otherwise its romantic issues being not necessarily restricted to a change back to the original order though this admissible instance appears to have been the only romance formerly recognized by novelists as possible in the case whether the following production be a picture of other possibilities or not its incidents may be taken to be fairly well supported by evidence every day forthcoming in most counties  the writing of the tale was rendered memorable to two persons at least by a tedious illness of five months that laid hold of the author soon after the story was begun in a wellknown magazine during which period the narrative had to be strenuously continued by dictation to a predetermined cheerful ending  as some of these novels of wessex life address themselves more especially to readers into whose souls the iron has entered and whose years have less pleasure in them now than heretofore so a laodicean may perhaps help to while away an idle afternoon of the comfortable ones whose lines have fallen to them in pleasant places above all of that large and happy section of the reading public which has not yet reached ripeness of years those to whom marriage is the pilgrims eternal city and not a milestone on the way th  january 1896     book the first george somerset   i  the sun blazed down and down till it was within halfanhour of its setting but the sketcher still lingered at his occupation of measuring and copying the chevroned doorwaya bold and quaint example of a transitional style of architecture which formed the tower entrance to an english village church the graveyard being quite open on its western side the tweedclad figure of the young draughtsman and the tall mass of antique masonry which rose above him to a battlemented parapet were fired to a great brightness by the solar rays that crossed the neighbouring mead like a warp of gold threads in whose mazes groups of equally lustrous gnats danced and wailed incessantly  he was so absorbed in his pursuit that he did not mark the brilliant chromatic effect of which he composed the central feature till it was brought home to his intelligence by the warmth of the moulded stonework under his touch when measuring which led him at length to turn his head and gaze on its cause  there are few in whom the sight of a sunset does not beget as much meditative melancholy as contemplative pleasure the human decline and death that it illustrates being too obvious to escape the notice of the simplest observer the sketcher as if he had been brought to this reflection many hundreds of times before by the same spectacle showed that he did not wish to pursue it just now by turning away his face after a few moments to resume his architectural studies  he took his measurements carefully and as if he reverenced the old workers whose trick he was endeavouring to acquire six hundred years after the original performance had ceased and the performers passed into the unseen by means of a strip of lead called a leaden tape which he pressed around and into the fillets and hollows with his finger and thumb he transferred the exact contour of each moulding to his drawing that lay on a sketchingstool a few feet distant where were also a sketchingblock a small tsquare a bowpencil and other mathematical instruments when he had marked down the line thus fixed he returned to the doorway to copy another as before  it being the month of august when the pale face of the townsman and the stranger is to be seen among the brown skins of remotest uplanders not only in england but throughout the temperate zone few of the homewardbound labourers paused to notice him further than by a momentary turn of the head they had beheld such gentlemen before not exactly measuring the church so accurately as this one seemed to be doing but painting it from a distance or at least walking round the mouldy pile at the same time the present visitor even exteriorly was not altogether commonplace his features were good his eyes of the dark deep sort called eloquent by the sex that ought to know and with that ray of light in them which announces a heart susceptible to beauty of all kindsin woman in art and in inanimate nature though he would have been broadly characterized as a young man his face bore contradictory testimonies to his precise age this was conceivably owing to a too dominant speculative activity in him which while it had preserved the emotional side of his constitution and with it the significant flexuousness of mouth and chin had played upon his forehead and temples till at weary moments they exhibited some traces of being overexercised a youthfulness about the mobile features a mature foreheadthough not exactly what the world has been familiar with in past agesis now growing common and with the advance of juvenile introspection it probably must grow commoner still briefly he had more of the beautyif beauty it ought to be calledof the future human type than of the past but not so much as to make him other than a nice young man  his build was somewhat slender and tall his complexion though a little browned by recent exposure was that of a man who spent much of his time indoors of beard he had but small show though he was as innocent as a nazarite of the use of the razor but he possessed a moustache allsufficient to hide the subtleties of his mouth which could thus be tremulous at tender moments without provoking inconvenient criticism  owing to his situation on high ground open to the west he remained enveloped in the lingering aureate haze till a time when the eastern part of the churchyard was in obscurity and damp with rising dew when it was too dark to sketch further he packed up his drawing and beckoning to a lad who had been idling by the gate directed him to carry the stool and implements to a roadside inn which he named lying a mile or two ahead the draughtsman leisurely followed the lad out of the churchyard and along a lane in the direction signified    the spectacle of a summer traveller from london sketching mediaeval details in these neopagan days when a lull has come over the study of english gothic architecture through a reawakening to the artforms of times that more nearly neighbour our own is accounted for by the fact that george somerset son of the academician of that name was a man of independent tastes and excursive instincts who unconsciously and perhaps unhappily took greater pleasure in floating in lonely currents of thought than with the general tide of opinion when quite a lad in the days of the french gothic mania which immediately succeeded to the great englishpointed revival under britton pugin rickman scott and other mediaevalists he had crept away from the fashion to admire what was good in palladian and renaissance as soon as jacobean queen anne and kindred accretions of decayed styles began to be popular he purchased such oldschool works as revett and stuart chambers and the rest and worked diligently at the five orders till quite bewildered on the question of style he concluded that all styles were extinct and with them all architecture as a living art somerset was not old enough at that time to know that in practice art had at all times been as full of shifts and compromises as every other mundane thing that ideal perfection was never achieved by greek goth or hebrew jew and never would be and thus he was thrown into a mood of disgust with his profession from which mood he was only delivered by recklessly abandoning these studies and indulging in an old enthusiasm for poetical literature for two whole years he did nothing but write verse in every conceivable metre and on every conceivable subject from wordsworthian sonnets on the singing of his teakettle to epic fragments on the fall of empires his discovery at the age of fiveandtwenty that these inspired works were not jumped at by the publishers with all the eagerness they deserved coincided in point of time with a severe hint from his father that unless he went on with his legitimate profession he might have to look elsewhere than at home for an allowance mr somerset junior then awoke to realities became intently practical rushed back to his dusty drawingboards and worked up the styles anew with a view of regularly starting in practice on the first day of the following january  it is an old story and perhaps only deserves the light tone in which the soaring of a young man into the empyrean and his descent again is always narrated but as has often been said the light and the truth may be on the side of the dreamer a far wider view than the wise ones have may be his at that recalcitrant time and his reduction to common measure be nothing less than a tragic event the operation called lunging in which a haltered colt is made to trot round and round a horsebreaker who holds the rope till the beholder grows dizzy in looking at them is a very unhappy one for the animal concerned during its progress the colt springs upward across the circle stops flies over the turf with the velocity of a bird and indulges in all sorts of graceful antics but he always ends in one waythanks to the knotted whipcordin a level trot round the lunger with the regularity of a horizontal wheel and in the loss for ever to his character of the bold contours which the fine hand of nature gave it yet the process is considered to be the making of him  whether somerset became permanently made under the action of the inevitable lunge or whether he lapsed into mere dabbling with the artistic side of his profession only it would be premature to say but at any rate it was his contrite return to architecture as a calling that sent him on the sketching excursion under notice feeling that something still was wanting to round off his knowledge before he could take his professional line with confidence he was led to remember that his own native gothic was the one form of design that he had totally neglected from the beginning through its having greeted him with wearisome iteration at the opening of his career now it had again returned to silence indeedsuch is the surprising instability of art principles as they are facetiously calledit was just as likely as not to sink into the neglect and oblivion which had been its lot in georgian times this accident of being out of vogue lent english gothic an additional charm to one of his proclivities and away he went to make it the business of a summer circuit in the west  the quiet time of evening the secluded neighbourhood the unusually gorgeous liveries of the clouds packed in a pile over that quarter of the heavens in which the sun had disappeared were such as to make a traveller loiter on his walk coming to a stile somerset mounted himself on the top bar to imbibe the spirit of the scene and hour the evening was so still that every trifling sound could be heard for miles there was the rattle of a returning waggon mixed with the smacks of the waggoners whip the team must have been at least three miles off from far over the hill came the faint periodic yell of kennelled hounds while from the nearest village resounded the voices of boys at play in the twilight then a powerful clock struck the hour it was not from the direction of the church but rather from the wood behind him and he thought it must be the clock of some mansion that way  but the mind of man cannot always be forced to take up subjects by the pressure of their material presence and somersets thoughts were often to his great loss apt to be even more than common truants from the tones and images that met his outer senses on walks and rides he would sometimes go quietly through the queerest gayest most extraordinary town in europe and let it alone provided it did not meddle with him by its beggars beauties innkeepers police coachmen mongrels bad smells and such like obstructions this feat of questionable utility he began performing now sitting on the threeinch ash rail that had been peeled and polished like glass by the rubbings of all the smallclothes in the parish he forgot the time the place forgot that it was augustin short everything of the present altogether his mind flew back to his past life and deplored the waste of time that had resulted from his not having been able to make up his mind which of the many fashions of art that were coming and going in kaleidoscopic change was the true point of departure from himself he had suffered from the modern malady of unlimited appreciativeness as much as any living man of his own age dozens of his fellows in years and experience who had never thought specially of the matter but had blunderingly applied themselves to whatever form of art confronted them at the moment of their making a move were by this time acquiring renown as new lights while he was still unknown he wished that some accident could have hemmed in his eyes between inexorable blinkers and sped him on in a channel ever so worn  thus balanced between believing and not believing in his own future he was recalled to the scene without by hearing the notes of a familiar hymn rising in subdued harmonies from a valley below he listened more heedfully it was his old friend the new sabbath which he had never once heard since the lisping days of childhood and whose existence much as it had then been to him he had till this moment quite forgotten where the new sabbath had kept itself all these yearswhy that sound and hearty melody had disappeared from all the cathedrals parish churches minsters and chapelsofease that he had been acquainted with during his apprenticeship to life and until his ways had become irregular and uncongregationalhe could not at first say but then he recollected that the tune appertained to the old westgallery period of churchmusic anterior to the great choral reformation and the rule of monkthat old time when the repetition of a word or halfline of a verse was not considered a disgrace to an ecclesiastical choir  willing to be interested in anything which would keep him outofdoors somerset dismounted from the stile and descended the hill before him to learn whence the singing proceeded    ii  he found that it had its origin in a building standing alone in a field and though the evening was not yet dark without lights shone from the windows in a few moments somerset stood before the edifice being just then en rapport with ecclesiasticism by reason of his recent occupation he could not help murmuring shade of pugin what a monstrosity  perhaps this exclamation rather out of date since the discovery that pugin himself often nodded amazingly would not have been indulged in by somerset but for his new architectural resolves which caused professional opinions to advance themselves officiously to his lips whenever occasion offered the building was in short a recentlyerected chapel of red brick with pseudoclassic ornamentation and the white regular joints of mortar could be seen streaking its surface in geometrical oppressiveness from top to bottom the roof was of blue slate clean as a table and unbroken from gable to gable the windows were glazed with sheets of plate glass a temporary iron stovepipe passing out near one of these and running up to the height of the ridge where it was finished by a covering like a parachute walking round to the end he perceived an oblong white stone let into the wall just above the plinth on which was inscribed in deep letters                 erected 187            at the sole expense of            john power esq mp  the new sabbath still proceeded line by line with all the emotional swells and cadences that had of old characterized the tune and the body of vocal harmony that it evoked implied a large congregation within to whom it was plainly as familiar as it had been to churchgoers of a past generation with a whimsical sense of regret at the secession of his once favourite air somerset moved away and would have quite withdrawn from the field had he not at that moment observed two young men with pitchers of water coming up from a stream hard by and hastening with their burdens into the chapel vestry by a side door almost as soon as they had entered they emerged again with empty pitchers and proceeded to the stream to fill them as before an operation which they repeated several times somerset went forward to the stream and waited till the young men came out again  you are carrying in a great deal of water he said as each dipped his pitcher  one of the young men modestly replied yes we filled the cistern this morning but it leaks and requires a few pitcherfuls more  why do you do it  there is to be a baptism sir  somerset was not sufficiently interested to develop a further conversation and observing them in silence till they had again vanished into the building he went on his way reaching the brow of the hill he stopped and looked back the chapel was still in view and the shades of night having deepened the lights shone from the windows yet more brightly than before a few steps further would hide them and the edifice and all that belonged to it from his sight possibly for ever there was something in the thought which led him to linger the chapel had neither beauty quaintness nor congeniality to recommend it the dissimilitude between the new utilitarianism of the place and the scenes of venerable gothic art which had occupied his daylight hours could not well be exceeded but somerset as has been said was an instrument of no narrow gamut he had a key for other touches than the purely aesthetic even on such an excursion as this his mind was arrested by the intense and busy energy which must needs belong to an assembly that required such a glare of light to do its religion by in the heaving of that tune there was an earnestness which made him thoughtful and the shine of those windows he had characterized as ugly reminded him of the shining of the good deed in a naughty world the chapel and its shabby plot of ground from which the herbage was all trodden away by busy feet had a living human interest that the numerous minsters and churches kneedeep in fresh green grass visited by him during the foregoing week had often lacked moreover there was going to be a baptism that meant the immersion of a grownup person and he had been told that baptists were serious people and that the scene was most impressive what manner of man would it be who on an ordinary plodding and bustling evening of the nineteenth century could single himself out as one different from the rest of the inhabitants banish all shyness and come forward to undergo such a trying ceremony who was he that had pondered gone into solitudes wrestled with himself worked up his courage and said i will do this though few else will for i believe it to be my duty  whether on account of these thoughts or from the circumstance that he had been alone amongst the tombs all day without communion with his kind he could not tell in after years when he had good reason to think of the subject but so it was that somerset went back and again stood under the chapelwall  instead of entering he passed round to where the stovechimney came through the bricks and holding on to the iron stay he put his toes on the plinth and looked in at the window the building was quite full of people belonging to that vast majority of society who are denied the art of articulating their higher emotions and crave dumbly for a fuglemanrespectably dressed working people whose faces and forms were worn and contorted by years of dreary toil on a platform at the end of the chapel a haggard man of more than middle age with grey whiskers ascetically cut back from the fore part of his face so far as to be almost banished from the countenance stood reading a chapter between the minister and the congregation was an open space and in the floor of this was sunk a tank full of water which just made its surface visible above the blackness of its depths by reflecting the lights overhead  somerset endeavoured to discover which one among the assemblage was to be the subject of the ceremony but nobody appeared there who was at all out of the region of commonplace the people were all quiet and settled yet he could discern on their faces something more than attention though it was less than excitement perhaps it was expectation and as if to bear out his surmise he heard at that moment the noise of wheels behind him  his gaze into the lighted chapel made what had been an evening scene when he looked away from the landscape night itself on looking back but he could see enough to discover that a brougham had driven up to the sidedoor used by the young waterbearers and that a lady in whiteandblack halfmourning was in the act of alighting followed by what appeared to be a waitingwoman carrying wraps they entered the vestryroom of the chapel and the door was shut the service went on as before till at a certain moment the door between vestry and chapel was opened when a woman came out clothed in an ample robe of flowing white which descended to her feet somerset was unfortunate in his position he could not see her face but her gait suggested at once that she was the lady who had arrived just before she was rather tall than otherwise and the contour of her head and shoulders denoted a girl in the heyday of youth and activity his imagination stimulated by this beginning set about filling in the meagre outline with most attractive details  she stood upon the brink of the pool and the minister descended the steps at its edge till the soles of his shoes were moistened with the water he turned to the young candidate but she did not follow him instead of doing so she remained rigid as a stone he stretched out his hand but she still showed reluctance till with some embarrassment he went back and spoke softly in her ear  she approached the edge looked into the water and turned away shaking her head somerset could for the first time see her face though humanly imperfect as is every face we see it was one which made him think that the best in womankind no less than the best in psalmtunes had gone over to the dissenters he had certainly seen nobody so interesting in his tour hitherto she was about twenty or twentyoneperhaps twentythree for years have a way of stealing marches even upon beautys anointed the total dissimilarity between the expression of her lineaments and that of the countenances around her was not a little surprising and was productive of hypotheses without measure as to how she came there she was in fact emphatically a modern type of maidenhood and she looked ultramodern by reason of her environment a presumably sophisticated being among the simple onesnot wickedly so but one who knew life fairly well for her age her hair of good english brown neither light nor dark was abundanttoo abundant for convenience in tying as it seemed and it threw off the lamplight in a hazy lustre and though it could not be said of her features that this or that was flawless the nameless charm of them altogether was only another instance of how beautiful a woman can be as a whole without attaining in any one detail to the lines marked out as absolutely correct the spirit and the life were there and material shapes could be disregarded  whatever moral characteristics this might be the surface of enough was shown to assure somerset that she had some experience of things far removed from her present circumscribed horizon and could live and was even at that moment living a clandestine stealthy inner life which had very little to do with her outward one the repression of nearly every external sign of that distress under which somerset knew by a sudden intuitive sympathy that she was labouring added strength to these convictions  and you refuse said the astonished minister as she still stood immovable on the brink of the pool he persuasively took her sleeve between his finger and thumb as if to draw her but she resented this by a quick movement of displeasure and he released her seeing that he had gone too far  but my dear lady he said you promised consider your profession and that you stand in the eyes of the whole church as an exemplar of your faith  i cannot do it  but your fathers memory miss his last dying request  i cannot help it she said turning to get away  you came here with the intention to fulfil the word  but i was mistaken  then why did you come  she tacitly implied that to be a question she did not care to answer please say no more to me she murmured and hastened to withdraw  during this unexpected dialogue which had reached somersets ears through the open windows that young mans feelings had flown hither and thither between minister and lady in a most capricious manner it had seemed at one moment a rather uncivil thing of her charming as she was to give the minister and the waterbearers so much trouble for nothing the next it seemed like reviving the ancient cruelties of the duckingstool to try to force a girl into that dark water if she had not a mind to it but the minister was not without insight and he had seen that it would be useless to say more the crestfallen old man had to turn round upon the congregation and declare officially that the baptism was postponed  she passed through the door into the vestry during the exciting moments of her recusancy there had been a perceptible flutter among the sensitive members of the congregation nervous dissenters seeming to be at one with nervous episcopalians in this at least that they heartily disliked a scene during service calm was restored to their minds by the minister starting a rather long hymn in minims and semibreves amid the singing of which he ascended the pulpit his face had a severe and even denunciatory look as he gave out his text and somerset began to understand that this meant mischief to the young person who had caused the hitch  in the third chapter of revelation and the fifteenth and following verses you will find these words  i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked  the sermon straightway began and it was soon apparent that the commentary was to be no less forcible than the text it was also apparent that the words were virtually not directed forward in the line in which they were uttered but through the chink of the vestrydoor that had stood slightly ajar since the exit of the young lady the listeners appeared to feel this no less than somerset did for their eyes one and all became fixed upon that vestry door as if they would almost push it open by the force of their gazing the preachers heart was full and bitter no book or note was wanted by him never was spontaneity more absolute than here it was no timid reproof of the ornamental kind but a direct denunciation all the more vigorous perhaps from the limitation of mind and language under which the speaker laboured yet fool that he had been made by the candidate there was nothing acrid in his attack genuine flashes of rhetorical fire were occasionally struck by that plain and simple man who knew what straightforward conduct was and who did not know the illimitable caprice of a womans mind  at this moment there was not in the whole chapel a person whose imagination was not centred on what was invisibly taking place within the vestry the thunder of the ministers eloquence echoed of course through the weak sisters cavern of retreat no less than round the public assembly what she was doing inside therewhether listening contritely or haughtily hastening to put on her things and get away from the chapel and all it containedwas obviously the thought of each member what changes were tracing themselves upon that lovely face did it rise to phases of raffaelesque resignation or sink so low as to flush and frown was somersets inquiry and a halfexplanation occurred when during the discourse the door which had been ajar was gently pushed to  looking on as a stranger it seemed to him more than probable that this young womans power of persistence in her unexpected repugnance to the rite was strengthened by wealth and position of some sort and was not the unassisted gift of nature the manner of her arrival and her dignified bearing before the assembly strengthened the belief a woman who did not feel something extraneous to her mental self to fall back upon would be so far overawed by the people and the crisis as not to retain sufficient resolution for a change of mind  the sermon ended the minister wiped his steaming face and turned down his cuffs and nods and sagacious glances went round yet many even of those who had presumably passed the same ordeal with credit exhibited gentler judgment than the preachers on a tergiversation of which they had probably recognized some germ in their own bosoms when in the ladys situation  for somerset there was but one scene the imagined scene of the girl herself as she sat alone in the vestry the fervent congregation rose to sing again and then somerset heard a slight noise on his left hand which caused him to turn his head the brougham which had retired into the field to wait was back again at the door the subject of his rumination came out from the chapelnot in her mystic robe of white but dressed in ordinary fashionable costumefollowed as before by the attendant with other articles of clothing on her arm including the white gown somerset fancied that the younger woman was drying her eyes with her handkerchief but there was not much time to see they quickly entered the carriage and it moved on then a cat suddenly mewed and he saw a white persian standing forlorn where the carriage had been the door was opened the cat taken in and the carriage drove away  the strangers girlish form stamped itself deeply on somersets soul he strolled on his way quite oblivious to the fact that the moon had just risen and that the landscape was one for him to linger over especially if there were any gothic architecture in the line of the lunar rays the inference was that though this girl must be of a serious turn of mind wilfulness was not foreign to her composition and it was probable that her daily doings evinced without much abatement by religion the unbroken spirit and pride of life natural to her age  the little village inn at which somerset intended to pass the night lay a mile further on and retracing his way up to the stile he rambled along the lane now beginning to be streaked like a zebra with the shadows of some young trees that edged the road but his attention was attracted to the other side of the way by a hum as of a nightbee which arose from the play of the breezes over a single wire of telegraph running parallel with his track on tall poles that had appeared by the road he hardly knew when from a branch route probably leading from some town in the neighbourhood to the village he was approaching he did not know the population of sleepinggreen as the village of his search was called but the presence of this mark of civilization seemed to signify that its inhabitants were not quite so far in the rear of their age as might be imagined a glance at the still ungrassed heap of earth round the foot of each post was however sufficient to show that it was at no very remote period that they had made their advance  aided by this friendly wire somerset had no difficulty in keeping his course till he reached a point in the ascent of a hill at which the telegraph branched off from the road passing through an opening in the hedge to strike across an undulating down while the road wound round to the left for a few moments somerset doubted and stood still the wire sang on overhead with dying falls and melodious rises that invited him to follow while above the wire rode the stars in their courses the low nocturn of the former seeming to be the voices of those stars       still quiring to the youngeyed cherubim  recalling himself from these reflections somerset decided to follow the lead of the wire it was not the first time during his present tour that he had found his way at night by the help of these musical threads which the postoffice authorities had erected all over the country for quite another purpose than to guide belated travellers plunging with it across the down he came to a hedgeless road that entered a park or chase which flourished in all its original wildness tufts of rushes and brakes of fern rose from the hollows and the road was in places half overgrown with green as if it had not been tended for many years so much so that where shaded by trees he found some difficulty in keeping it though he had noticed the remains of a deerfence further back no deer were visible and it was scarcely possible that there should be any in the existing state of things but rabbits were multitudinous every hillock being dotted with their seated figures till somerset approached and sent them limping into their burrows the road next wound round a clump of underwood beside which lay heaps of faggots for burning and then there appeared against the sky the walls and towers of a castle half ruin half residence standing on an eminence hard by  somerset stopped to examine it the castle was not exceptionally large but it had all the characteristics of its most important fellows irregular dilapidated and muffled in creepers as a great portion of it was some parta comparatively modern wingwas inhabited for a light or two steadily gleamed from some upper windows in others a reflection of the moon denoted that unbroken glass yet filled their casements over all rose the keep a square solid tower apparently not much injured by wars or weather and darkened with ivy on one side wherein wings could be heard flapping uncertainly as if they belonged to a bird unable to find a proper perch hissing noises supervened and then a hoot proclaiming that a brood of young owls were residing there in the company of older ones in spite of the habitable and more modern wing neglect and decay had set their mark upon the outworks of the pile unfitting them for a more positive light than that of the present hour  he walked up to a modern arch spanning the ditchnow dry and greenover which the drawbridge once had swung the large door under the porters archway was closed and locked while standing here the singing of the wire which for the last few minutes he had quite forgotten again struck upon his ear and retreating to a convenient place he observed its final course from the poles amid the trees it leaped across the moat over the girdling wall and thence by a tremendous stretch towards the keep where to judge by sound it vanished through an arrowslit into the interior this fossil of feudalism then was the journeysend of the wire and not the village of sleepinggreen  there was a certain unexpectedness in the fact that the hoary memorial of a stolid antagonism to the interchange of ideas the monument of hard distinctions in blood and race of deadly mistrust of ones neighbour in spite of the churchs teaching and of a sublime unconsciousness of any other force than a brute one should be the goal of a machine which beyond everything may be said to symbolize cosmopolitan views and the intellectual and moral kinship of all mankind in that light the little buzzing wire had a far finer significance to the student somerset than the vast walls which neighboured it but the modern fever and fret which consumes people before they can grow old was also signified by the wire and this aspect of today did not contrast well with the fairer side of feudalismleisure lighthearted generosity intense friendships hawks hounds revels healthy complexions freedom from care and such a living power in architectural art as the world may never again see  somerset withdrew till neither the singing of the wire nor the hisses of the irritable owls could be heard any more a clock in the castle struck ten and he recognized the strokes as those he had heard when sitting on the stile it was indispensable that he should retrace his steps and push on to sleepinggreen if he wished that night to reach his lodgings which had been secured by letter at a little inn in the straggling line of roadside houses called by the above name where his luggage had by this time probably arrived in a quarter of an hour he was again at the point where the wire left the road and following the highway over a hill he saw the hamlet at his feet    iii  by halfpast ten the next morning somerset was once more approaching the precincts of the building which had interested him the night before referring to his map he had learnt that it bore the name of stancy castle or castle de stancy and he had been at once struck with its familiarity though he had never understood its position in the county believing it further to the west if report spoke truly there was some excellent vaulting in the interior and a change of study from ecclesiastical to secular gothic was not unwelcome for a while  the entrancegate was open now and under the archway the outer ward was visible a great part of it being laid out as a flowergarden this was in process of clearing from weeds and rubbish by a set of gardeners and the soil was so encumbered that in rooting out the weeds such few hardy flowers as still remained in the beds were mostly brought up with them the groove wherein the portcullis had run was as fresh as if only cut yesterday the very tooling of the stone being visible close to this hung a bellpull formed of a large wooden acorn attached to a vertical rod somersets application brought a woman from the porters door who informed him that the day before having been the weekly showday for visitors it was doubtful if he could be admitted now  who is at home said somerset  only miss de stancy the porteress replied  his dread of being considered an intruder was such that he thought at first there was no help for it but to wait till the next week but he had already through his want of effrontery lost a sight of many interiors whose exhibition would have been rather a satisfaction to the inmates than a trouble it was inconvenient to wait he knew nobody in the neighbourhood from whom he could get an introductory letter he turned and passed the woman crossed the ward where the gardeners were at work over a second and smaller bridge and up a flight of stone stairs open to the sky along whose steps sunburnt tudor soldiers and other renowned dead men had doubtless many times walked it led to the principal door on this side thence he could observe the walls of the lower court in detail and the old mosses with which they were paddedmosses that from time immemorial had been burnt brown every summer and every winter had grown green again the arrowslit and the electric wire that entered it like a worm uneasy at being unearthed were distinctly visible now so also was the clock not as he had supposed a chronometer coeval with the fortress itself but new and shining and bearing the name of a recent maker  the door was opened by a bland intensely shaven man out of livery who took somersets name and politely worded request to be allowed to inspect the architecture of the more public portions of the castle he pronounced the word architecture in the tone of a man who knew and practised that art for he said to himself if she thinks i am a mere idle tourist it will not be so well  no such uncomfortable consequences ensued miss de stancy had great pleasure in giving mr somerset full permission to walk through whatever parts of the building he chose  he followed the butler into the inner buildings of the fortress the ponderous thickness of whose walls made itself felt like a physical pressure an internal stone staircase ranged round four sides of a square was next revealed leading at the top of one flight into a spacious hall which seemed to occupy the whole area of the keep from this apartment a corridor floored with black oak led to the more modern wing where light and air were treated in a less gingerly fashion  here passages were broader than in the oldest portion and upholstery enlisted in the service of the fine arts hid to a great extent the coldness of the walls  somerset was now left to himself and roving freely from room to room he found time to inspect the different objects of interest that abounded there not all the chambers even of the habitable division were in use as dwellingrooms though these were still numerous enough for the wants of an ordinary country family in a long gallery with a coved ceiling of arabesques which had once been gilded hung a series of paintings representing the past personages of the de stancy line it was a remarkable arrayeven more so on account of the incredibly neglected condition of the canvases than for the artistic peculiarities they exhibited many of the frames were dropping apart at their angles and some of the canvas was so dingy that the face of the person depicted was only distinguishable as the moon through mist for the colour they had now they might have been painted during an eclipse while to judge by the webs tying them to the wall the spiders that ran up and down their backs were such as to make the fair originals shudder in their graves  he wondered how many of the lofty foreheads and smiling lips of this pictorial pedigree could be credited as true reflections of their prototypes some were wilfully false no doubt many more so by unavoidable accident and want of skill somerset felt that it required a profounder mind than his to disinter from the lumber of conventionality the lineaments that really sat in the painters presence and to discover their history behind the curtain of mere tradition  the painters of this long collection were those who usually appear in such places holbein jansen and vandyck sir peter sir geoffrey sir joshua and sir thomas their sitters too had mostly been sirs sir william sir john or sir george de stancysome undoubtedly having a nobility stamped upon them beyond that conferred by their robes and orders and others not so fortunate their respective ladies hung by their sidesfeeble and watery or fat and comfortable as the case might be also their fathers and mothersinlaw their brothers and remoter relatives their contemporary reigning princes and their intimate friends of the de stancys pure there ran through the collection a mark by which they might surely have been recognized as members of one family this feature being the upper part of the nose every one even if lacking other points in common had the special indent at this point in the facesometimes moderate in degree sometimes excessive  while looking at the pictureswhich though not in his regular line of study interested somerset more than the architecture because of their singular dilapidation it occurred to his mind that he had in his youth been schoolfellow for a very short time with a pleasant boy bearing a surname attached to one of the paintingsthe name of ravensbury the boy had vanished he knew not howhe thought he had been removed from school suddenly on account of ill health but the recollection was vague and somerset moved on to the rooms above and below in addition to the architectural details of which he had as yet obtained but glimpses there was a great collection of old movables and other domestic artworkall more than a century old and mostly lying as lumber there were suites of tapestry hangings common and fine green and scarlet leatherwork on which the gilding was still but little injured venerable damask curtains quilted silk tablecovers ebony cabinets worked satin windowcushions carved bedsteads and embroidered bedfurniture which had apparently screened no sleeper for these many years downstairs there was also an interesting collection of armour together with several huge trunks and coffers a great many of them had been recently taken out and cleaned as if a long dormant interest in them were suddenly revived doubtless they were those which had been used by the living originals of the phantoms that looked down from the frames  this excellent hoard of suggestive designs for woodwork metalwork and work of other sorts induced somerset to divert his studies from the ecclesiastical direction to acquire some new ideas from the objects here for domestic application yet for the present he was inclined to keep his sketchbook closed and his ivory rule folded and devote himself to a general survey emerging from the groundfloor by a small doorway he found himself on a terrace to the northeast and on the other side than that by which he had entered it was bounded by a parapet breast high over which a view of the distant country met the eye stretching from the foot of the slope to a distance of many miles somerset went and leaned over and looked down upon the tops of the bushes beneath the prospect included the village he had passed through on the previous day and amidst the green lights and shades of the meadows he could discern the red brick chapel whose recalcitrant inmate had so engrossed him  before his attention had long strayed over the incident which romanticized that utilitarian structure he became aware that he was not the only person who was looking from the terrace towards that point of the compass at the righthand corner in a niche of the curtainwall reclined a girlish shape and asleep on the bench over which she leaned was a white catthe identical persian as it seemedthat had been taken into the carriage at the chapeldoor  somerset began to muse on the probability or otherwise of the backsliding baptist and this young lady resulting in one and the same person and almost without knowing it he found himself deeply hoping for such a unity the object of his inspection was idly leaning and this somewhat disguised her figure it might have been tall or short curvilinear or angular she carried a light sunshade which she fitfully twirled until thrusting it back over her shoulder her head was revealed sufficiently to show that she wore no hat or bonnet this token of her being an inmate of the castle and not a visitor rather damped his expectations but he persisted in believing her look towards the chapel must have a meaning in it till she suddenly stood erect and revealed herself as short in staturealmost dumpyat the same time giving him a distinct view of her profile she was not at all like the heroine of the chapel he saw the dinted nose of the de stancys outlined with holbein shadowlessness against the bluegreen of the distant wood it was not the de stancy face with all its original specialities it was so to speak a defective reprint of that face for the nose tried hard to turn up and deal utter confusion to the family shape  as for the rest of the countenance somerset was obliged to own that it was not beautiful nature had done there many things that she ought not to have done and left undone much that she should have executed it would have been decidedly plain but for a precious quality which no perfection of chiselling can give when the temperament denies it and which no facial irregularity can take awaya tender affectionateness which might almost be called yearning such as is often seen in the women of correggio when they are painted in profile but the plain features of miss de stancywho she undoubtedly waswere rather severely handled by somersets judgment owing to his impression of the previous night a beauty of a sort would have been lent by the flexuous contours of the mobile parts but for that unfortunate condition the poor girl was burdened with of having to hand on a traditional feature with which she did not find herself otherwise in harmony  she glanced at him for a moment and showed by an imperceptible movement that he had made his presence felt not to embarrass her somerset hastened to withdraw at the same time that she passed round to the other part of the terrace followed by the cat in whom somerset could imagine a certain denominational cast of countenance notwithstanding her company but as white cats are much alike each other at a distance it was reasonable to suppose this creature was not the same one as that possessed by the beauty    iv  he descended the stone stairs to a lower story of the castle in which was a cryptlike hall covered by vaulting of exceptional and massive ingenuity            built ere the art was known      by pointed aisle and shafted stalk      the arcades of an alleyed walk            to emulate in stone  it happened that the central pillar whereon the vaults rested reputed to exhibit some of the most hideous grotesques in england upon its capital was within a locked door somerset was tempted to ask a servant for permission to open it till he heard that the inner room was temporarily used for plate the key being kept by miss de stancy at which he said no more but afterwards the active housemaid redescended the stone steps she entered the crypt with a bunch of keys in one hand and in the other a candle followed by the young lady whom somerset had seen on the terrace  i shall be very glad to unlock anything you may want to see so few people take any real interest in what is here that we do not leave it open  somerset expressed his thanks  miss de stancy a little to his surprise had a touch of rusticity in her manner and that forced absence of reserve which seclusion from society lends to young women more frequently than not she seemed glad to have something to do the arrival of somerset was plainly an event sufficient to set some little mark upon her day deception had been written on the faces of those frowning walls in their implying the insignificance of somerset when he found them tenanted only by this little woman whose life was narrower than his own  we have not been here long continued miss de stancy and thats why everything is in such a dilapidated and confused condition  somerset entered the dark storecloset thinking less of the ancient pillar revealed by the light of the candle than what a singular remark the latter was to come from a member of the family which appeared to have been there five centuries he held the candle above his head and walked round and presently miss de stancy came back  there is another vault below she said with the severe face of a young woman who speaks only because it is absolutely necessary perhaps you are not aware of it it was the dungeon if you wish to go down there too the servant will show you the way it is not at all ornamental rough unhewn arches and clumsy piers  somerset thanked her and would perhaps take advantage of her kind offer when he had examined the spot where he was if it were not causing inconvenience  no i am sure paula will be glad to know that anybody thinks it interesting to go down therewhich is more than she does herself  some obvious inquiries were suggested by this but somerset said i have seen the pictures and have been much struck by them partly he added with some hesitation because one or two of them reminded me of a schoolfellowi think his name was john ravensbury  yes she said almost eagerly he was my cousin  so that we are not quite strangers  but he is dead now he was unfortunate he was mostly spoken of as that unlucky boy you know i suppose mr somerset why the paintings are in such a decaying stateit is owing to the peculiar treatment of the castle during mr wilkinss time he was blind so one can imagine he did not appreciate such things as there are here  the castle has been shut up you mean  o yes for many years but it will not be so again we are going to have the pictures cleaned and the frames mended and the old pieces of furniture put in their proper places it will be very nice then did you see those in the east closet  i have only seen those in the gallery  i will just show you the way to the others if you would like to see them  they ascended to the room designated the east closet the paintings here mostly of smaller size were in a better condition owing to the fact that they were hung on an inner wall and had hence been kept free from damp somerset inquired the names and histories of one or two  i really dont quite know miss de stancy replied after some thought but paula knows i am sure i dont study them muchi dont see the use of it she swung her sunshade so that it fell open and turned it up till it fell shut i have never been able to give much attention to ancestors she added with her eyes on the parasol  these are your ancestors he asked for her position and tone were matters which perplexed him in spite of the family likeness and other details he could scarcely believe this frank and communicative country maiden to be the modern representative of the de stancys  o yes they certainly are she said laughing people say i am like them i dont know if i amwell yes i know i am i can see that of course any day but they have gone from my family and perhaps it is just as well that they should have gone they are useless she added with serene conclusiveness  ah they have gone have they  yes castle and furniture went together it was long agolong before i was born it doesnt seem to me as if the place ever belonged to a relative of mine  somerset corrected his smiling manner to one of solicitude  but you live here miss de stancy  yesa great deal now though sometimes i go home to sleep  this is home to you and not home  i live here with paulamy friend i have not been here long neither has she for the first six months after her fathers death she did not come here at all  they walked on gazing at the walls till the young man said i fear i may be making some mistake but i am sure you will pardon my inquisitiveness this once who is paula  ah you dont know of course you dontlocal changes dont get talked of far away she is the owner of this castle and estate my father sold it when he was quite a young man years before i was born and not long after his fathers death it was purchased by a man named wilkins a rich man who became blind soon after he had bought it and never lived here so it was left uncared for  she went out upon the terrace and without exactly knowing why somerset followed  your friend  has only come here quite recently she is away from home today it was very sad murmured the young girl thoughtfully no sooner had mr power bought it of the representatives of mr wilkinsalmost immediately indeedthan he died from a chill caught after a warm bath on account of that she did not take possession for several months and even now she has only had a few rooms prepared as a temporary residence till she can think what to do poor thing it is sad to be left alone  somerset heedfully remarked that he thought he recognized that name power as one he had seen lately somewhere or other  perhaps you have been hearing of her father do you know what he was  somerset did not  she looked across the distant country where undulations of darkgreen foliage formed a prospect extending for miles and as she watched and somersets eyes led by hers watched also a white streak of steam thin as a cotton thread could be discerned ploughing that green expanse her father made that miss de stancy said directing her finger towards the object  that what  that railway he was mr john power the great railway contractor and it was through making the railway that he discovered this castlethe railway was diverted a little on its account  a clash between ancient and modern  yes but he took an interest in the locality long before he purchased the estate and he built the people a chapel on a bit of freehold he bought for them he was a great nonconformist a staunch baptist up to the day of his deatha much stauncher one she said significantly than his daughter is  ah i begin to spot her  you have heard about the baptism  i know something of it  her conduct has given mortal offence to the scattered people of the denomination that her father was at such pains to unite into a body  somerset could guess the remainder and in thinking over the circumstances did not state what he had seen she added as if disappointed at his want of curiosity  she would not submit to the rite when it came to the point the water looked so cold and dark and fearful she said that she could not do it to save her life  surely she should have known her mind before she had gone so far somersets words had a condemnatory form but perhaps his actual feeling was that if miss power had known her own mind she would have not interested him half so much  paulas own mind had nothing to do with it said miss de stancy warming up to staunch partizanship in a moment it was all undertaken by her from a mistaken sense of duty it was her fathers dying wish that she should make public profession of herwhat do you call itof the denomination she belonged to as soon as she felt herself fit to do it so when he was dead she tried and tried and didnt get any more fit and at last she screwed herself up to the pitch and thought she must undergo the ceremony out of pure reverence for his memory it was very shortsighted of her father to put her in such a position because she is now very sad as she feels she can never try again after such a sermon as was delivered against her  somerset presumed that miss power need not have heard this knox or bossuet of hers if she had chosen to go away  she did not hear it in the face of the congregation but from the vestry she told me some of it when she reached home would you believe it the man who preached so bitterly is a tenant of hers i said surely you will turn him out of his housebut she answered in her calm deep nice way that she supposed he had a perfect right to preach against her that she could not in justice molest him at all i wouldnt let him stay if the house were mine but she has often before allowed him to scold her from the pulpit in a smaller wayonce it was about an expensive dress she had wornnot mentioning her by name you know but all the people are quite aware that it is meant for her because only one person of her wealth or position belongs to the baptist body in this county  somerset was looking at the homely affectionate face of the little speaker you are her good friend i am sure he remarked  she looked into the distant air with tacit admission of the impeachment so would you be if you knew her she said and a blush slowly rose to her cheek as if the person spoken of had been a lover rather than a friend  but you are not a baptist any more than i continued somerset  o no and i never knew one till i knew paula i think they are very nice though i sometimes wish paula was not one but the religion of reasonable persons  they walked on and came opposite to where the telegraph emerged from the trees leapt over the parapet and up through the loophole into the interior  that looks strange in such a building said her companion  miss power had it put up to know the latest news from town it costs six pounds a mile she can work it herself beautifully and so can i but not so well it was a great delight to learn miss power was so interested at first that she was sending messages from morning till night and did you hear the new clock  is it a new oneyes i heard it  the old one was quite worn out so paula has put it in the cellar and had this new one made though it still strikes on the old bell it tells the seconds but the old one which my very great grandfather erected in the eighteenth century only told the hours paula says that time being so much more valuable now must of course be cut up into smaller pieces  she does not appear to be much impressed by the spirit of this ancient pile  miss de stancy shook her head too slightly to express absolute negation  do you wish to come through this door she asked there is a singular chimneypiece in the kitchen which is considered a unique example of its kind though i myself dont know enough about it to have an opinion on the subject  when they had looked at the corbelled chimneypiece they returned to the hall where his eye was caught anew by a large map that he had conned for some time when alone without being able to divine the locality represented it was called general plan of the town and showed streets and open spaces corresponding with nothing he had seen in the county  is that town here he asked  it is not anywhere but in paulas brain she has laid it out from her own design the site is supposed to be near our railway station just across there where the land belongs to her she is going to grant cheap building leases and develop the manufacture of pottery  potteryhow very practical she must be  o no no replied miss de stancy in tones showing how supremely ignorant he must be of miss powers nature if he characterized her in those terms it is greek pottery she meanshellenic pottery she tells me to call it only i forget there is beautiful clay at the place her father told her he found it in making the railway tunnel she has visited the british museum continental museums and greece and spain and hopes to imitate the old fictile work in time especially the greek of the best period four hundred years after christ or before christi forget which it was paula said o no she is not practical in the sense you mean at all  a mixed young lady rather  miss de stancy appeared unable to settle whether this new definition of her dear friend should be accepted as kindly or disallowed as decidedly sarcastic you would like her if you knew her she insisted in half tones of pique after which she walked on a few steps  i think very highly of her said somerset  and i and yet at one time i could never have believed that i should have been her friend one is prejudiced at first against people who are reported to have such differences in feeling associations and habit as she seemed to have from mine but it has not stood in the least in the way of our liking each other i believe the difference makes us the more united  it says a great deal for the liberality of both answered somerset warmly heaven send us more of the same sort of people they are not too numerous at present  as this remark called for no reply from miss de stancy she took advantage of an opportunity to leave him alone first repeating her permission to him to wander where he would he walked about for some time sketchbook in hand but was conscious that his interest did not lie much in the architecture in passing along the corridor of an upper floor he observed an open door through which was visible a room containing one of the finest renaissance cabinets he had ever seen it was impossible on close examination to do justice to it in a hasty sketch it would be necessary to measure every line if he would bring away anything of utility to him as a designer deciding to reserve this gem for another opportunity he cast his eyes round the room and blushed a little without knowing it he had intruded into the absent miss paulas own particular set of chambers including a boudoir and sleeping apartment on the tables of the sittingroom were most of the popular papers and periodicals that he knew not only english but from paris italy and america satirical prints though they did not unduly preponderate were not wanting besides these there were books from a london circulating library papercovered light literature in french and choice italian and the latest monthly reviews while between the two windows stood the telegraph apparatus whose wire had been the means of bringing him hither  these things ensconced amid so much of the old and hoary were as if a stray hour from the nineteenth century had wandered like a butterfly into the thirteenth and lost itself there  the door between this antechamber and the sleepingroom stood open without venturing to cross the threshold for he felt that he would be abusing hospitality to go so far somerset looked in for a moment it was a pretty place and seemed to have been hastily fitted up in a corner overhung by a blue and white canopy of silk was a little cot hardly large enough to impress the character of bedroom upon the old place upon a counterpane lay a parasol and a silk neckerchief on the other side of the room was a tall mirror of startling newness draped like the bedstead in blue and white thrown at random upon the floor was a pair of satin slippers that would have fitted cinderella a dressinggown lay across a settee and opposite upon a small easychair in the same blue and white livery were a bible the baptist magazine wardlaw on infant baptism walfords county families and the court journal on and over the mantelpiece were nicknacks of various descriptions and photographic portraits of the artistic scientific and literary celebrities of the day  a dressingroom lay beyond but becoming conscious that his study of ancient architecture would hardly bear stretching further in that direction mr somerset retreated to the outside obliviously passing by the gem of renaissance that had led him in  she affects blue he was thinking then she is fair  on looking up some time later at the new clock that told the seconds he found that the hours at his disposal for work had flown without his having transferred a single feature of the building or furniture to his sketchbook before leaving he sent in for permission to come again and then walked across the fields to the inn at sleepinggreen reflecting less upon miss de stancy so little force of presence had she possessed than upon the modern flower in a mediaeval flowerpot whom miss de stancys information had brought before him and upon the incongruities that were daily shaping themselves in the world under the great modern fluctuations of classes and creeds  somerset was still full of the subject when he arrived at the end of his walk and he fancied that some loungers at the bar of the inn were discussing the heroine of the chapelscene just at the moment of his entry on this account when the landlord came to clear away the dinner somerset was led to inquire of him by way of opening a conversation if there were many baptists in the neighbourhood  the landlord who was a serious man on the surface though he occasionally smiled beneath replied that there were a great manyfar more than the average in country parishes even here in my house now he added when volks get a drop of drink into em and their feelings rise to a zong some man will strike up a hymn by preference but i find no fault with that for though tis hardly human nature to be so calculating in yer cups a feller may as well sing to gain something as sing to waste  how do you account for there being so many  well you zee sir some says one thing and some another i think they does it to save the expense of a christian burial for ther children now theres a poor family out in long lanethe husband used to smite for jimmy more the blacksmith till a hurt his armtheyd have no less than eleven children if theyd not been lucky tother way and buried five when they were three or four months old now every one of them children was given to the sexton in a little box that any journeyman could nail together in a quarter of an hour and he buried em at night for a shilling a head whereas twould have cost a couple of pounds each if theyd been christened at church of course theres the new lady at the castle shes a chapel member and that may make a little difference but shes not been here long enough to show whether twill be worth while to join em for the profit ot or whether twill not no doubt if it turns out that shes of a sort to relieve volks in trouble more will join her set than belongs to it already any port in a storm of course as the saying is  as for yourself you are a churchman at present i presume  yes not but i was a methodist onceay for a length of time twas owing to my taking a house next door to a chapel so that what with hearing the organ bizz like a bee through the wall and what with finding it saved umbrellas on wet zundays i went over to that faith for two yearsthough i believe i dropped money by iti wouldnt be the man to say so if i hadnt howsomever when i moved into this house i turned back again to my old religion faith i dont zee much difference be you one or be you tother youve got to get your living  the de stancys of course have not much influence here now for that or any other thing  o no no not any at all they be very low upon ground and always will be now i suppose it was thoughted worthy of being recorded in historyyouve read it sir no doubt  not a word  o then you shall ive got the history zomewhere twas gay manners that did it the only bit of luck they have had of late years is miss powers taking to little miss de stancy and making her her companykeeper i hope twill continue  that the two daughters of these antipodean families should be such intimate friends was a situation which pleased somerset as much as it did the landlord it was an engaging instance of that human progress on which he had expended many charming dreams in the years when poetry theology and the reorganization of society had seemed matters of more importance to him than a profession which should help him to a big house and income a fair deiopeia and a lovely progeny when he was alone he poured out a glass of wine and silently drank the healths of the two generousminded young women who in this lonely district had found sweet communion a necessity of life and by pure and instinctive good sense had broken down a barrier which men thrice their age and repute would probably have felt it imperative to maintain but perhaps this was premature the omnipotent miss powers characterpractical or ideal politic or impulsivehe as yet knew nothing of and giving over reasoning from insufficient data he lapsed into mere conjecture    v  the next morning somerset was again at the castle he passed some interval on the walls before encountering miss de stancy whom at last he observed going towards a ponycarriage that waited near the door  a smile gained strength upon her face at his approach and she was the first to speak i am sorry miss power has not returned she said and accounted for that ladys absence by her distress at the event of two evenings earlier  but i have driven over to my fatherssir william de stancyshouse this morning she went on and on mentioning your name to him i found he knew it quite well you will will you not forgive my ignorance in having no better knowledge of the elder mr somersets works than a dim sense of his fame as a painter but i was going to say that my father would much like to include you in his personal acquaintance and wishes me to ask if you will give him the pleasure of lunching with him today my cousin john whom you once knew was a great favourite of his and used to speak of you sometimes it will be so kind if you can come my father is an old man out of society and he would be glad to hear the news of town  somerset said he was glad to find himself among friends where he had only expected strangers and promised to come that day if she would tell him the way  that she could easily do the short way was across that glade he saw therethen over the stile into the wood following the path till it came out upon the turnpikeroad he would then be almost close to the house the distance was about two miles and a half but if he thought it too far for a walk she would drive on to the town where she had been going when he came and instead of returning straight to her fathers would come back and pick him up  it was not at all necessary he thought he was a walker and could find the path  at this moment a servant came to tell miss de stancy that the telegraph was calling her  ahit is lucky that i was not gone again she exclaimed john seldom reads it right if i am away  it now seemed quite in the ordinary course that as a friend of her fathers he should accompany her to the instrument so up they went together and immediately on reaching it she applied her ear to the instrument and began to gather the message somerset fancied himself like a person overlooking anothers letter and moved aside  it is no secret she said smiling paula to charlotte it begins  thats very pretty  oand it is aboutyou murmured miss de stancy  me the architect blushed a little  she made no answer and the machine went on with its story there was something curious in watching this utterance about himself under his very nose in language unintelligible to him he conjectured whether it were inquiry praise or blame with a sense that it might reasonably be the latter as the result of his surreptitious look into that blue bedroom possibly observed and reported by some servant of the house  direct that every facility be given to mr somerset to visit any part of the castle he may wish to see on my return i shall be glad to welcome him as the acquaintance of your relatives i have two of his fathers pictures  dear me the plot thickens he said as miss de stancy announced the words how could she know about me  i sent a message to her this morning when i saw you crossing the park on your way heretelling her that mr somerset son of the academician was making sketches of the castle and that my father knew something of you thats her answer  where are the pictures by my father that she has purchased  o not hereat least not unpacked  miss de stancy then left him to proceed on her journey to markton so the nearest little town was called informing him that she would be at her fathers house to receive him at two oclock just about one he closed his sketchbook and set out in the direction she had indicated at the entrance to the wood a man was at work pulling down a rotten gate that bore on its battered lock the initials w de s and erecting a new one whose ironmongery exhibited the letters p p  the warmth of the summer noon did not inconveniently penetrate the dense masses of foliage which now began to overhang the path except in spots where a ruthless timberfelling had taken place in previous years for the purpose of sale it was that particular halfhour of the day in which the birds of the forest prefer walking to flying and there being no wind the hopping of the smallest songster over the dead leaves reached his ear from behind the undergrowth the track had originally been a wellkept winding drive but a deep carpet of moss and leaves overlaid it now though the general outline still remained to show that its curves had been set out with as much care as those of a lawn walk and the gradient made easy for carriages where the natural slopes were great felled trunks occasionally lay across it and alongside were the hollow and fungous boles of trees sawn down in long past years  after a walk of threequarters of an hour he came to another gate where the letters p p again supplanted the historical w de s climbing over this he found himself on a highway which presently dipped down towards the town of markton a place he had never yet seen it appeared in the distance as a quiet little borough of a few thousand inhabitants and without the town boundary on the side he was approaching stood halfadozen genteel and modern houses of the detached kind usually found in such suburbs on inquiry sir william de stancys residence was indicated as one of these  it was almost new of streaked brick having a central door and a small bay window on each side to light the two front parlours a little lawn spread its green surface in front divided from the road by iron railings the low line of shrubs immediately within them being coated with pallid dust from the highway on the neat piers of the neat entrance gate were chiselled the words myrtle villa genuine roadside respectability sat smiling on every brick of the eligible dwelling  perhaps that which impressed somerset more than the mushroom modernism of sir william de stancys house was the air of healthful cheerfulness which pervaded it he was shown in by a neat maidservant in black gown and white apron a canary singing a welcome from a cage in the shadow of the window the voices of crowing cocks coming over the chimneys from somewhere behind and the sun and air riddling the house everywhere  a dwelling of those wellknown and popular dimensions which allow the proceedings in the kitchen to be distinctly heard in the parlours it was so planned that a raking view might be obtained through it from the front door to the end of the back garden the drawingroom furniture was comfortable in the walnutandgreenrep style of some years ago somerset had expected to find his friends living in an old house with remnants of their own antique furniture and he hardly knew whether he ought to meet them with a smile or a gaze of condolence his doubt was terminated however by the cheerful and tripping entry of miss de stancy who had returned from her drive to markton and in a few more moments sir william came in from the garden  he was an old man of tall and spare build with a considerable stoop his glasses dangling against his waistcoatbuttons and the front corners of his coattails hanging lower than the hinderparts so that they swayed right and left as he walked he nervously apologized to his visitor for having kept him waiting  i am so glad to see you he said with a mild benevolence of tone as he retained somersets hand for a moment or two partly for your fathers sake whom i met more than once in my younger days before he became so wellknown and also because i learn that you were a friend of my poor nephew john ravensbury he looked over his shoulder to see if his daughter were within hearing and with the impulse of the solitary to make a confidence continued in a low tone she poor girl was to have married john his death was a sad blow to her and to all of uspray take a seat mr somerset  the reverses of fortune which had brought sir william de stancy to this comfortable cottage awakened in somerset a warmer emotion than curiosity and he sat down with a heart as responsive to each speech uttered as if it had seriously concerned himself while his host gave some words of information to his daughter on the trifling events that had marked the morning just passed such as that the cow had got out of the paddock into miss powers field that the smith who had promised to come and look at the kitchen range had not arrived that two wasps nests had been discovered in the garden bank and that nick joness baby had fallen downstairs sir william had large cavernous arches to his eyesockets reminding the beholder of the vaults in the castle he once had owned his hands were long and almost fleshless each knuckle showing like a bamboojoint from beneath his coatsleeves which were small at the elbow and large at the wrist all the colour had gone from his beard and locks except in the case of a few isolated hairs of the former which retained dashes of their original shade at sudden points in their length revealing that all had once been raven black  but to study a man to his face for long is a species of illnature which requires a colder temperament or at least an older heart than the architects was at that time incurious unobservance is the true attitude of cordiality and somerset blamed himself for having fallen into an act of inspection even briefly he would wait for his hosts conversation which would doubtless be of the essence of historical romance  the favourable bankreturns have made the moneymarket much easier today as i learn said sir william  o have they said somerset yes i suppose they have  and something is meant by this unusual quietness in foreign stocks since the late remarkable fluctuations insisted the old man is the current of speculation quite arrested or is it but a temporary lull  somerset said he was afraid he could not give an opinion and entered very lamely into the subject but sir william seemed to find sufficient interest in his own thoughts to do away with the necessity of acquiring fresh impressions from other peoples replies for often after putting a question he looked on the floor as if the subject were at an end lunch was now ready and when they were in the diningroom miss de stancy to introduce a topic of more general interest asked somerset if he had noticed the myrtle on the lawn  somerset had noticed it and thought he had never seen such a fullblown one in the open air before his eyes were however resting at the moment on the only objects at all out of the common that the diningroom contained one was a singular glass case over the fireplace within which were some large mediaeval doorkeys black with rust and age and the others were two fulllength oil portraits in the costume of the end of the last centuryso out of all proportion to the size of the room they occupied that they almost reached to the floor  those originally belonged to the castle yonder said miss de stancy or charlotte as her father called her noticing somersets glance at the keys they used to unlock the principal entrancedoors which were knocked to pieces in the civil wars new doors were placed afterwards but the old keys were never given up and have been preserved by us ever since  they are quite uselessmere lumberparticularly to me said sir william  and those huge paintings were a present from paula she continued they are portraits of my greatgrandfather and mother paula would give all the old family pictures back to me if we had room for them but they would fill the house to the ceilings  sir william was impatient of the subject what is the utility of such accumulations he asked their originals are but clay nowmere forgotten dust not worthy a moments inquiry or reflection at this distance of time nothing can retain the spirit and why should we preserve the shadow of the formlondon has been very full this year sir i have been told  it has said somerset and he asked if they had been up that season it was plain that the matter with which sir william de stancy least cared to occupy himself before visitors was the history of his own family in which he was followed with more simplicity by his daughter charlotte  no said the baronet one might be led to think there is a fatality which prevents it we make arrangements to go to town almost every year to meet some old friend who combines the rare conditions of being in london with being mindful of me but he has always died or gone elsewhere before the event has taken place but with a disposition to be happy it is neither this place nor the other that can render us the reverse in short each mans happiness depends upon himself and his ability for doing with little he turned more particularly to somerset and added with an impressive smile i hope you cultivate the art of doing with little  somerset said that he certainly did cultivate that art partly because he was obliged to  ahyou dont mean to the extent that i mean the world has not yet learned the riches of frugality says i think cicero somewhere and nobody can testify to the truth of that remark better than i if a man knows how to spend less than his income however small that may be whyhe has the philosophers stone and sir william looked in somersets face with frugality written in every pore of his own as much as to say and here you see one who has been a living instance of those principles from his youth up  somerset soon found that whatever turn the conversation took sir william invariably reverted to this topic of frugality when luncheon was over he asked his visitor to walk with him into the garden and no sooner were they alone than he continued well mr somerset you are down here sketching architecture for professional purposes nothing can be better you are a young man and your art is one in which there are innumerable chances  i had begun to think they were rather few said somerset  no they are numerous enough the difficulty is to find out where they lie it is better to know where your luck lies than where your talent lies thats an old mans opinion  ill remember it said somerset  and now give me some account of your new clubs new hotels and new men what i was going to add on the subject of finding out where your luck lies is that nobody is so unfortunate as not to have a lucky star in some direction or other perhaps yours is at the antipodes if so go there all i say is discover your lucky star  i am looking for it  you may be able to do two things one well the other but indifferently and yet you may have more luck in the latter then stick to that one and never mind what you can do best your star lies there  there i am not quite at one with you sir william  you should be not that i mean to say that luck lies in any one place long or at any one persons door fortune likes new faces and your wisdom lies in bringing your acquisitions into safety while her favour lasts to do that you must make friends in her time of smilesmake friends with people wherever you find them my daughter has unconsciously followed that maxim she has struck up a warm friendship with our neighbour miss power at the castle we are diametrically different from her in associations traditions ideas religionshe comes of a violent dissenting family among other thingsbut i say to charlotte what i say to you win affection and regard wherever you can and accommodate yourself to the times i put nothing in the way of their intimacy and wisely so for by this so many pleasant hours are added to the sum total vouchsafed to humanity  it was quite late in the afternoon when somerset took his leave miss de stancy did not return to the castle that night and he walked through the wood as he had come feeling that he had been talking with a man of simple nature who flattered his own understanding by devising machiavellian theories after the event to account for any spontaneous action of himself or his daughter which might otherwise seem eccentric or irregular  before somerset reached the inn he was overtaken by a slight shower and on entering the house he walked into the general room where there was a fire and stood with one foot on the fender the landlord was talking to some guest who sat behind a screen and probably because somerset had been seen passing the window and was known to be sketching at the castle the conversation turned on sir william de stancy  i have often noticed observed the landlord that volks who have come to grief and quite failed have the rules how to succeed in life more at their vingers ends than volks who have succeeded i assure you that sir william so full as he is of wise maxims never acted upon a wise maxim in his life until he had lost everything and it didnt matter whether he was wise or no you know what he was in his young days of course  no i dont said the invisible stranger  o i thought everybody knew poor sir williams history he was the star as i may zay of good company forty years ago i remember him in the height of his jinks as i used to zee him when i was a very little boy and think how great and wonderful he was i can seem to zee now the exact style of his clothes white hat white trousers white silk handkerchief and his jonnick face as white as his clothes with keeping late hours there was nothing black about him but his hair and his eyeshe wore no beard at that timeand they were black as slooes the like of his coming on the racecourse was never seen there afore nor since he drove his ikkipage hisself and it was always hauled by four beautiful white horses and two outriders rode in harness bridles there was a groom behind him and another at the rubbingpost all in livery as glorious as new jerusalem what a stablishment he kept up at that time i can mind him sir with thirty racehorses in training at once seventeen coachhorses twelve hunters at his box tother side of london four chargers at budmouth and ever so many hacks  and he lost all by his racing speculations the stranger observed and somerset fancied that the voice had in it something more than the languid carelessness of a casual sojourner  partly by that partly in other ways he spent a mint o money in a wild project of founding a wateringplace and sunk thousands in a useless silver mine so twas no wonder that the castle named after him vell into other hands the way it was done was curious mr wilkins who was the first owner after it went from sir william actually sat down as a guest at his table and got up as the owner he took off at a round sum everything saleable furniture plate pictures even the milk and butter in the dairy thats how the pictures and furniture come to be in the castle still wormeaten rubbish zome o it and hardly worth moving  and off went the baronet to myrtle villa  o no he went away for many years tis quite lately since his illness that he came to that little place in zight of the stone walls that were the pride of his forefathers  from what i hear he has not the manner of a brokenhearted man  not at all since that illness he has been happy as you see him no pride quite calm and mild at new moon quite childish tis that makes him able to live there before he was so ill he couldnt bear a zight of the place but since then he is happy nowhere else and never leaves the parish further than to drive once a week to markton his head wont stand society nowadays and he lives quite lonely as you zee only zeeing his daughter or his son whenever he comes home which is not often they say that if his brain hadnt softened a little he would ha diedtwas that saved his life  whats this i hear about his daughter is she really hired companion to the new owner  now thats a curious thing again these two girls being so fond of one another one of em a dissenter and all that and tother a de stancy o no not hired exactly but she mostly lives with miss power and goes about with her and i dare say miss power makes it woth her while one cant move a step without the other following though judging by ordinary volks youd think twould be a catanddog friendship rather  but tis not  tis not they be more like lovers than maid and maid miss power is looked up to by little de stancy as if she were a godamighty and miss power lets her love her to her hearts content but whether miss power loves back again i cant zay for shes as deep as the north star  the landlord here left the stranger to go to some other part of the house and somerset drew near to the glass partition to gain a glimpse of a man whose interest in the neighbourhood seemed to have arisen so simultaneously with his own but the inner room was empty the man had apparently departed by another door    vi  the telegraph had almost the attributes of a human being at stancy castle when its bell rang people rushed to the old tapestried chamber allotted to it and waited its pleasure with all the deference due to such a novel inhabitant of that ancestral pile this happened on the following afternoon about four oclock while somerset was sketching in the room adjoining that occupied by the instrument hearing its call he looked in to learn if anybody were attending and found miss de stancy bending over it  she welcomed him without the least embarrassment another message she saidpaula to charlottehave returned to markton am starting for home will be at the gate between four and five if possible  miss de stancy blushed with pleasure when she raised her eyes from the machine is she not thoughtful to let me know beforehand  somerset said she certainly appeared to be feeling at the same time that he was not in possession of sufficient data to make the opinion of great value  now i must get everything ready and order what she will want as mrs goodman is away what will she want dinner would be bestshe has had no lunch i know or tea perhaps and dinner at the usual time still if she has had no lunchhark what do i hear  she ran to an arrowslit and somerset who had also heard something looked out of an adjoining one they could see from their elevated position a great way along the white road stretching like a tape amid the green expanses on each side there had arisen a cloud of dust accompanied by a noise of wheels  it is she said charlotte o yesit is past fourthe telegram has been delayed  how would she be likely to come  she has doubtless hired a carriage at the inn she said it would be useless to send to meet her as she couldnt name a time where is she now  just where the boughs of those beeches overhang the roadthere she is again  miss de stancy went away to give directions and somerset continued to watch the vehicle which was of no great pretension soon crossed the bridge and stopped there was a ring at the bell and miss de stancy reappeared  did you see her as she drove upis she not interesting  i could not see her  ah noof course you could not from this window because of the trees mr somerset will you come downstairs you will have to meet her you know  somerset felt an indescribable backwardness i will go on with my sketching he said perhaps she will not be  o but it would be quite natural would it not our manners are easier here you know than they are in town and miss power has adapted herself to them  a compromise was effected by somerset declaring that he would hold himself in readiness to be discovered on the landing at any convenient time  a servant entered miss power said miss de stancy before he could speak  the man advanced with a card miss de stancy took it up and read thereon mr william dare  it is not miss power who has come then she asked with a disappointed face  no maam  she looked again at the card this is some man of business i supposedoes he want to see me  yes miss leastwise he would be glad to see you if miss power is not at home  miss de stancy left the room and soon returned saying mr somerset can you give me your counsel in this matter this mr dare says he is a photographic amateur and it seems that he wrote some time ago to miss power who gave him permission to take views of the castle and promised to show him the best points but i have heard nothing of it and scarcely know whether i ought to take his word in her absence mrs goodman miss powers relative who usually attends to these things is away  i dare say it is all right said somerset  would you mind seeing him if you think it quite in order perhaps you will instruct him where the best views are to be obtained  thereupon somerset at once went down to mr dare his coming as a sort of counterfeit of miss power disposed somerset to judge him with as much severity as justice would allow and his manner for the moment was not of a kind calculated to dissipate antagonistic instincts mr dare was standing before the fireplace with his feet wide apart and his hands in the pockets of his coattails looking at a carving over the mantelpiece he turned quickly at the sound of somersets footsteps and revealed himself as a person quite out of the common  his age it was impossible to say there was not a hair on his face which could serve to hang a guess upon in repose he appeared a boy but his actions were so completely those of a man that the beholders first estimate of sixteen as his age was hastily corrected to sixandtwenty and afterwards shifted hither and thither along intervening years as the tenor of his sentences sent him up or down he had a broad forehead vertical as the face of a bastion and his hair which was parted in the middle hung as a fringe or valance above in the fashion sometimes affected by the other sex he wore a heavy ring of which the gold seemed fair the diamond questionable and the taste indifferent there were the remains of a swagger in his body and limbs as he came forward regarding somerset with a confident smile as if the wonder were not why mr dare should be present but why somerset should be present likewise and the first tone that came from dares lips wound up his listeners opinion that he did not like him  a latent power in the man or boy was revealed by the circumstance that somerset did not feel as he would ordinarily have done that it was a matter of profound indifference to him whether this gentlemanphotographer were a likeable person or no  i have called by appointment or rather i left a card stating that today would suit me and no objection was made somerset recognized the voice it was that of the invisible stranger who had talked with the landlord about the de stancys mr dare then proceeded to explain his business  somerset found from his inquiries that the man had unquestionably been instructed by somebody to take the views he spoke of and concluded that dares curiosity at the inn was after all naturally explained by his errand to this place blaming himself for a too hasty condemnation of the stranger who though visually a little too assured was civil enough verbally somerset proceeded with the young photographer to sundry corners of the outer ward and thence across the moat to the field suggesting advantageous points of view the office being a shadow of his own pursuits was not uncongenial to somerset and he forgot other things in attending to it  now in our country we should stand further back than this and so get a more comprehensive coup doeil said dare as somerset selected a good situation  you are not an englishman then said somerset  i have lived mostly in india malta gibraltar the ionian islands and canada i there invented a new photographic process which i am bent upon making famous yet i am but a dilettante and do not follow this art at the base dictation of what men call necessity  o indeed somerset replied  as soon as this business was disposed of and mr dare had brought up his van and assistant to begin operations somerset returned to the castle entrance while under the archway a man with a professional look drove up in a dogcart and inquired if miss power were at home today  she has not yet returned mr havill was the reply  somerset who had hoped to hear an affirmative by this time thought that miss power was bent on disappointing him in the flesh notwithstanding the interest she expressed in him by telegraph and as it was now drawing towards the end of the afternoon he walked off in the direction of his inn  there were two or three ways to that spot but the pleasantest was by passing through a rambling shrubbery between whose bushes trickled a broad shallow brook occasionally intercepted in its course by a transverse chain of old stones evidently from the castle walls which formed a miniature waterfall the walk lay along the riverbrink soon somerset saw before him a circular summerhouse formed of short sticks nailed to ornamental patterns outside the structure and immediately in the path stood a man with a book in his hand and it was presently apparent that this gentleman was holding a conversation with some person inside the pavilion but the back of the building being towards somerset the second individual could not be seen  the speaker at one moment glanced into the interior and at another at the advancing form of the architect whom though distinctly enough beheld the other scarcely appeared to heed in the absorbing interest of his own discourse somerset became aware that it was the baptist minister whose rhetoric he had heard in the chapel yonder  now continued the baptist minister will you express to me any reason or objection whatever which induces you to withdraw from our communion it was that of your father and of his father before him any difficulty you may have met with i will honestly try to remove for i need hardly say that in losing you we lose one of the most valued members of the baptist church in this district i speak with all the respect due to your position when i ask you to realize how irreparable is the injury you inflict upon the cause here by this lukewarm backwardness  i dont withdraw said a womans low voice within  what do you do  i decline to attend for the present  and you can give no reason for this  there was no reply  or for your refusal to proceed with the baptism  i have been christened  my dear young lady it is well known that your christening was the work of your aunt who did it unknown to your parents when she had you in her power out of pure obstinacy to a church with which she was not in sympathy taking you surreptitiously and indefensibly to the font of the establishment so that the rite meant and could mean nothing at all but i fear that your new position has brought you into contact with the paedobaptists that they have disturbed your old principles and so induced you to believe in the validity of that trumpery ceremony  it seems sufficient  i will demolish the basis of that seeming in three minutes give me but that time as a listener  i have no objection  very well first then i will assume that those who have influenced you in the matter have not been able to make any impression upon one so well grounded as yourself in our distinctive doctrine by the stale old argument drawn from circumcision  you may assume it  goodthat clears the ground and we now come to the new testament  the minister began to turn over the leaves of his little bible which it impressed somerset to observe was bound with a flap like a pocket book the black surface of the leather being worn brown at the corners by long usage he turned on till he came to the beginning of the new testament and then commenced his discourse after explaining his position the old man ran very ably through the arguments citing wellknown writers on the point in dispute when he required more finished sentences than his own  the ministers earnestness and interest in his own case led him unconsciously to include somerset in his audience as the young man drew nearer till instead of fixing his eyes exclusively on the person within the summerhouse the preacher began to direct a good proportion of his discourse upon his new auditor turning from one listener to the other attentively without seeming to feel somersets presence as superfluous  and now he said in conclusion i put it to you sir as to her do you find any flaw in my argument is there madam a single text which honestly interpreted affords the least foothold for the paedobaptists in other words for your opinion on the efficacy of the rite administered to you in your unconscious infancy i put it to you both as honest and responsible beings he turned again to the young man  it happened that somerset had been over this ground long ago born so to speak a highchurch infant in his youth he had been of a thoughtful turn till at one time an idea of his entering the church had been entertained by his parents he had formed acquaintance with men of almost every variety of doctrinal practice in this country and as the pleadings of each assailed him before he had arrived at an age of sufficient mental stability to resist new impressions however badly substantiated he inclined to each denomination as it presented itself was       everything by starts and nothing long  till he had travelled through a great many beliefs and doctrines without feeling himself much better than when he set out  a study of fonts and their origin had qualified him in this particular subject fully conscious of the inexpediency of contests on minor ritual differences he yet felt a sudden impulse towards a mild intellectual tournament with the eager old manpurely as an exercise of his wits in the defence of a fair girl  sir i accept your challenge to us said somerset advancing to the ministers side    vii  at the sound of a new voice the lady in the bower started as he could see by her outline through the crevices of the woodwork and creepers the minister looked surprised  you will lend me your bible sir to assist my memory he continued  the minister held out the bible with some reluctance but he allowed somerset to take it from his hand the latter stepping upon a large mosscovered stone which stood near and laying his hat on a flat beech bough that rose and fell behind him pointed to the minister to seat himself on the grass the minister looked at the grass and looked up again at somerset but did not move  somerset for the moment was not observing him his new position had turned out to be exactly opposite the open side of the bower and now for the first time he beheld the interior on the seat was the woman who had stood beneath his eyes in the chapel the paula of miss de stancys enthusiastic eulogies she wore a summer hat beneath which her fair curly hair formed a thicket round her forehead it would be impossible to describe her as she then appeared not sensuous enough for an aphrodite and too subdued for a hebe she would yet with the adjunct of doves or nectar have stood sufficiently well for either of those personages if presented in a pink morning light and with mythological scarcity of attire  half in surprise she glanced up at him and lowering her eyes again as if no surprise were ever let influence her actions for more than a moment she sat on as before looking past somersets position at the view down the river visible for a long distance before her till it was lost under the bending trees  somerset turned over the leaves of the ministers bible and began  in the first epistle to the corinthians the seventh chapter and the fourteenth verse  here the young lady raised her eyes in spite of her reserve but it being apparently too much labour to keep them raised allowed her glance to subside upon her jet necklace extending it with the thumb of her left hand  sir said the baptist excitedly i know that passage wellit is the last refuge of the paedobaptistsi foresee your argument i have met it dozens of times and it is not worth that snap of the fingers it is worth no more than the argument from circumcision or the sufferlittlechildren argument  then turn to the sixteenth chapter of the acts and the thirtythird  that too cried the minister is answered by what i said before i perceive sir that you adopt the method of a special pleader and not that of an honest inquirer is it or is it not an answer to my proofs from the eighth chapter of the acts the thirtysixth and thirtyseventh verses the sixteenth of mark sixteenth verse second of acts fortyfirst verse the tenth and the fortyseventh verse or the eighteenth and eighth verse  very well then let me prove the point by other reasoningby the argument from apostolic tradition he threw the ministers book upon the grass and proceeded with his contention which comprised a fairly good exposition of the earliest practice of the church and inferences therefrom when he reached this point an interest in his offhand arguments was revealed by the mobile bosom of miss paula power though she still occupied herself by drawing out the necklace testimony from justin martyr followed with inferences from irenaeus in the expression omnes enim venit per semetipsum salvare omnes inquam qui per eum renascuntur in deum infantes et parvulos et pueros et juvenes at the sound of so much seriousness paula turned her eyes upon the speaker with attention he next adduced proof of the signification of renascor in the writings of the fathers as reasoned by wall arguments from tertullians advice to defer the rite citations from cyprian nazianzen chrysostom and jerome and briefly summed up the whole matter  somerset looked round for the minister as he concluded but the old man after standing face to face with the speaker had turned his back upon him and during the latter portions of the attack had moved slowly away he now looked back his countenance was full of commiserating reproach as he lifted his hand twice shook his head and said in the epistle to the philippians first chapter and sixteenth verse it is written that there are some who preach in contention and not sincerely and in the second epistle to timothy fourth chapter and fourth verse attention is drawn to those whose ears refuse the truth and are turned unto fables i wish you good afternoon sir and that priceless gift sincerity  the minister vanished behind the trees somerset and miss power being left confronting each other alone  somerset stepped aside from the stone hat in hand at the same moment in which miss power rose from her seat she hesitated for an instant and said with a pretty girlish stiffness sweeping back the skirt of her dress to free her toes in turning although you are personally unknown to me i cannot leave you without expressing my deep sense of your profound scholarship and my admiration for the thoroughness of your studies in divinity  your opinion gives me great pleasure said somerset bowing and fairly blushing but believe me i am no scholar and no theologian my knowledge of the subject arises simply from the accident that some few years ago i looked into the question for a special reason in the study of my profession i was interested in the designing of fonts and baptisteries and by a natural process i was led to investigate the history of baptism and some of the arguments i then learnt up still remain with me thats the simple explanation of my erudition  if your sermons at the church only match your address today i shall not wonder at hearing that the parishioners are at last willing to attend  it flashed upon somersets mind that she supposed him to be the new curate of whose arrival he had casually heard during his sojourn at the inn before he could bring himself to correct an error to which perhaps more than to anything else was owing the friendliness of her manner she went on as if to escape the embarrassment of silence  i need hardly say that i at least do not doubt the sincerity of your arguments  nevertheless i was not altogether sincere he answered  she was silent  then why should you have delivered such a defence of me she asked with simple curiosity  somerset involuntarily looked in her face for his answer  paula again teased the necklace would you have spoken so eloquently on the other side if iif occasion had served she inquired shyly  perhaps i would  another pause till she said i too was insincere  you  i was  in what way  in letting him and you think i had been at all influenced by authority scriptural or patristic  may i ask why then did you decline the ceremony the other evening  ah you too have heard of it she said quickly  no  what then  i saw it  she blushed and looked down the river i cannot give my reasons she said  of course not said somerset  i would give a great deal to possess real logical dogmatism  so would i  there was a moment of embarrassment she wanted to get away but did not precisely know how he would have withdrawn had she not said as if rather oppressed by her conscience and evidently still thinking him the curate i cannot but feel that mr woodwells heart has been unnecessarily wounded  the ministers  yes he is singlemindedness itself he gives away nearly all he has to the poor he works among the sick carrying them necessaries with his own hands he teaches the ignorant men and lads of the village when he ought to be resting at home till he is absolutely prostrate from exhaustion and then he sits up at night writing encouraging letters to those poor people who formerly belonged to his congregation in the village and have now gone away he always offends ladies because he cant help speaking the truth as he believes it but he hasnt offended me  her feelings had risen towards the end so that she finished quite warmly and turned aside  i was not in the least aware that he was such a man murmured somerset looking wistfully after the minister whatever you may have done i fear that i have grievously wounded a worthy mans heart from an idle wish to engage in a useless unbecoming dull lastcentury argument  not dull she murmured for it interested me  somerset accepted her correction willingly it was illconsidered of me however he said and in his distress he has forgotten his bible he went and picked up the worn volume from where it lay on the grass  you can easily win him to forgive you by just following and returning the book to him she observed  i will said the young man impulsively and bowing to her he hastened along the river brink after the minister he at length saw his friend before him leaning over the gate which led from the private path into a lane his cheek resting on the palm of his hand with every outward sign of abstraction he was not conscious of somersets presence till the latter touched him on the shoulder  never was a reconciliation effected more readily when somerset said that fearing his motives might be misconstrued he had followed to assure the minister of his goodwill and esteem mr woodwell held out his hand and proved his friendliness in return by preparing to have the controversy on their religious differences over again from the beginning with exhaustive detail somerset evaded this with alacrity and once having won his companion to other subjects he found that the austere man had a smile as pleasant as an infants on the rare moments when he indulged in it moreover that he was warmly attached to miss power  though she gives me more trouble than all the rest of the baptist church in this district he said i love her as my own daughter but i am sadly exercised to know what she is at heart heaven supply me with fortitude to contest her wild opinions and intractability but she has sweet virtues and her conduct at times can be most endearing  i believe it said somerset with more fervour than mere politeness required  sometimes i think those stancy towers and lands will be a curse to her the spirit of old papistical times still lingers in the nooks of those silent walls like a bad odour in a still atmosphere dulling the iconoclastic emotions of the true puritan it would be a pity indeed if she were to be tainted by the very situation that her fathers indomitable energy created for her  do not be concerned about her said somerset gently shes not a paedobaptist at heart although she seems so  mr woodwell placed his finger on somersets arm saying if shes not a paedobaptist or episcopalian if she is not vulnerable to the mediaeval influences of her mansion lands and new acquaintance it is because shes been vulnerable to what is worse to doctrines beside which the errors of paaedobaptists episcopalians roman catholics are but as air  how you astonish me  have you heard in your metropolitan experience of a curious body of new lights as they think themselves the minister whispered a name to his listener as if he were fearful of being overheard  o no said somerset shaking his head and smiling at the ministers horror shes not that at least i think not  shes a woman nothing more dont fear for her all will be well  the poor old man sighed i love her as my own i will say no more  somerset was now in haste to go back to the lady to ease her apparent anxiety as to the result of his mission and also because time seemed heavy in the loss of her discreet voice and soft buoyant look every moment of delay began to be as two but the minister was too earnest in his converse to see his companions haste and it was not till perception was forced upon him by the actual retreat of somerset that he remembered time to be a limited commodity he then expressed his wish to see somerset at his house to tea any afternoon he could spare and receiving the others promise to call as soon as he could allowed the younger man to set out for the summerhouse which he did at a smart pace when he reached it he looked around and found she was gone  somerset was immediately struck by his own lack of social dexterity why did he act so readily on the whimsical suggestion of another person and follow the minister when he might have said that he would call on mr woodwell tomorrow and making himself known to miss power as the visiting architect of whom she had heard from miss de stancy have had the pleasure of attending her to the castle thats what any other man would have had wit enough to do he said  there then arose the question whether her despatching him after the minister was such an admirable act of goodnature to a good man as it had at first seemed to be perhaps it was simply a manoeuvre for getting rid of himself and he remembered his doubt whether a certain light in her eyes when she inquired concerning his sincerity were innocent earnestness or the reverse as the possibility of levity crossed his brain his face warmed it pained him to think that a woman so interesting could condescend to a trick of even so mild a complexion as that he wanted to think her the soul of all that was tender and noble and kind the pleasure of setting himself to win a ministers goodwill was a little tarnished now    viii  that evening somerset was so preoccupied with these things that he left all his sketching implements outofdoors in the castle grounds the next morning he hastened thither to secure them from being stolen or spoiled meanwhile he was hoping to have an opportunity of rectifying paulas mistake about his personality which having served a very good purpose in introducing them to a mutual conversation might possibly be made just as agreeable as a thing to be explained away  he fetched his drawing instruments rods sketchingblocks and other articles from the field where they had lain and was passing under the walls with them in his hands when there emerged from the outer archway an open landau drawn by a pair of black horses of fine action and obviously strong pedigree in which paula was seated under the shade of a white parasol with black and white ribbons fluttering on the summit the morning sun sparkled on the equipage its newness being made all the more noticeable by the ragged old arch behind  she bowed to somerset in a way which might have been meant to express that she had discovered her mistake but there was no embarrassment in her manner and the carriage bore her away without her making any sign for checking it he had not been walking towards the castle entrance and she could not be supposed to know that it was his intention to enter that day  she had looked such a bud of youth and promise that his disappointment at her departure showed itself in his face as he observed her however he went on his way entered a turret ascended to the leads of the great tower and stepped out  from this elevated position he could still see the carriage and the white surface of paulas parasol in the glowing sun while he watched the landau stopped and in a few moments the horses were turned the wheels and the panels flashed and the carriage came bowling along towards the castle again  somerset descended the stone stairs before he had quite got to the bottom he saw miss de stancy standing in the outer hall  when did you come mr somerset she gaily said looking up surprised how industrious you are to be at work so regularly every day we didnt think you would be here today paula has gone to a vegetable show at markton and i am going to join her there soon  o gone to a vegetable show but i think she has altered her  at this moment the noise of the carriage was heard in the ward and after a few seconds miss power came insomerset being invisible from the door where she stood  o paula what has brought you back said miss de stancy  i have forgotten something  mr somerset is here will you not speak to him  somerset came forward and miss de stancy presented him to her friend mr somerset acknowledged the pleasure by a respectful inclination of his person and said some words about the meeting yesterday  yes said miss power with a serene deliberateness quite noteworthy in a girl of her age i have seen it all since i was mistaken about you was i not mr somerset i am glad to welcome you here both as a friend of miss de stancys family and as the son of your fatherwhich is indeed quite a sufficient introduction anywhere  you have two pictures painted by mr somersets father have you not i have already told him about them said miss de stancy perhaps mr somerset would like to see them if they are unpacked  as somerset had from his infancy suffered from a plethora of those productions excellent as they were he did not reply quite so eagerly as miss de stancy seemed to expect to her kind suggestion and paula remarked to him you will stay to lunch do order it at your own time if our hour should not be convenient  her voice was a voice of low note in quality that of a flute at the grave end of its gamut if she sang she was a pure contralto unmistakably  i am making use of the permission you have been good enough to grant meof sketching what is valuable within these walls  yes of course i am willing for anybody to come people hold these places in trust for the nation in one sense you lift your hands charlotte i see i have not convinced you on that point yet  miss de stancy laughed and said something to no purpose  somehow miss power seemed not only more woman than miss de stancy but more woman than somerset was man and yet in years she was inferior to both though becomingly girlish and modest she appeared to possess a good deal of composure which was well expressed by the shaded light of her eyes  you have then met mr somerset before said charlotte  he was kind enough to deliver an address in my defence yesterday i suppose i seemed quite unable to defend myself  o no said he when a few more words had passed she turned to miss de stancy and spoke of some domestic matter upon which somerset withdrew paula accompanying his exit with a remark that she hoped to see him again a little later in the day  somerset retired to the chambers of antique lumber keeping an eye upon the windows to see if she reentered the carriage and resumed her journey to markton but when the horses had been standing a long time the carriage was driven round to the stables then she was not going to the vegetable show that was rather curious seeing that she had only come back for something forgotten  these queries and thoughts occupied the mind of somerset until the bell was rung for luncheon owing to the very dusty condition in which he found himself after his mornings labours among the old carvings he was rather late in getting downstairs and seeing that the rest had gone in he went straight to the dininghall  the population of the castle had increased in his absence there were assembled paula and her friend charlotte a bearded man some years older than himself with a cold grey eye who was cursorily introduced to him in sitting down as mr havill an architect of markton also an elderly lady of dignified aspect in a black satin dress of which she apparently had a very high opinion this lady who seemed to be a mere dummy in the establishment was as he now learnt mrs goodman by name a widow of a recently deceased gentleman and aunt to paulathe identical aunt who had smuggled paula into a church in her helpless infancy and had her christened without her parents knowledge having been left in narrow circumstances by her husband she was at present living with miss power as chaperon and adviser on practical mattersin a word as ballast to the management beyond her somerset discerned his new acquaintance mr woodwell who on sight of somerset was for hastening up to him and performing a laboured shaking of hands in earnest recognition  paula had just come in from the garden and was carelessly laying down her large shady hat as he entered her dress a figured material in black and white was short allowing her feet to appear there was something in her look and in the style of her corsage which reminded him of several of the bygone beauties in the gallery the thought for a moment crossed his mind that she might have been imitating one of them  fine old screen sir said mr havill in a longdrawn voice across the table when they were seated pointing in the direction of the traceried oak division between the dininghall and a vestibule at the end as good a piece of fourteenthcentury work as you shall see in this part of the country  you mean fifteenth century of course said somerset  havill was silent you are one of the profession perhaps asked the latter after a while  you mean that i am an architect said somerset yes  ahone of my own honoured vocation havills face had been not unpleasant until this moment when he smiled whereupon there instantly gleamed over him a phase of meanness remaining until the smile died away  havill continued with slow watchfulness  what enormous sacrileges are committed by the builders every day i observe i was driving yesterday to toneborough where i am erecting a townhall and passing through a village on my way i saw the workmen pulling down a chancelwall in which they found imbedded a unique specimen of perpendicular worka capital from some old arcadethe mouldings wonderfully undercut they were smashing it up as fillingin for the new wall  it must have been unique said somerset in the tooreadily controversial tone of the educated young man who has yet to learn diplomacy i have never seen much undercutting in perpendicular stonework nor anybody else i think  o yeslots of it said mr havill nettled  paula looked from one to the other which am i to take as guide she asked are perpendicular capitals undercut as you call it mr havill or no  it depends upon circumstances said mr havill  but somerset had answered at the same time there is seldom or never any marked undercutting in moulded work later than the middle of the fourteenth century  havill looked keenly at somerset for a time then he turned to paula as regards that fine saxon vaulting you did me the honour to consult me about the other day i should advise taking out some of the old stones and reinstating new ones exactly like them  but the new ones wont be saxon said paula and then in time to come when i have passed away and those stones have become stained like the rest people will be deceived i should prefer an honest patch to any such makebelieve of saxon relics  as she concluded she let her eyes rest on somerset for a moment as if to ask him to side with her much as he liked talking to paula he would have preferred not to enter into this discussion with another professional man even though that man were a spurious article but he was led on to enthusiasm by a sudden pang of regret at finding that the masterly workmanship in this fine castle was likely to be tinkered and spoilt by such a man as havill  you will deceive nobody into believing that anything is saxon here he said warmly there is not a square inch of saxon work as it is called in the whole castle  paula in doubt looked to mr havill  o yes sir you are quite mistaken said that gentleman slowly every stone of those lower vaults was reared in saxon times  i can assure you said somerset deferentially but firmly that there is not an arch or wall in this castle of a date anterior to the year 1100 no one whose attention has ever been given to the study of architectural details of that age can be of a different opinion  i have studied architecture and i am of a different opinion i have the best reason in the world for the difference for i have history herself on my side what will you say when i tell you that it is a recorded fact that this was used as a castle by the romans and that it is mentioned in domesday as a building of long standing  i shall say that has nothing to do with it replied the young man i dont deny that there may have been a castle here in the time of the romans what i say is that none of the architecture we now see was standing at that date  there was a silence of a minute disturbed only by a murmured dialogue between mrs goodman and the minister during which paula was looking thoughtfully on the table as if framing a question  can it be she said to somerset that such certainty has been reached in the study of architectural dates now would you really risk anything on your belief would you agree to be shut up in the vaults and fed upon bread and water for a week if i could prove you wrong  willingly said somerset the date of those towers and arches is matter of absolute certainty from the details that they should have been built before the conquest is as unlikely as say that the rustiest old gun with a percussion lock should be older than the date of waterloo  how i wish i knew something precise of an art which makes one so independent of written history  mr havill had lapsed into a mannerly silence that was only sullenness disguised paula turned her conversation to miss de stancy who had simply looked from one to the other during the discussion though she might have been supposed to have a prescriptive right to a few remarks on the matter a commonplace talk ensued till havill who had not joined in it privately began at somerset again with a mixed manner of cordiality contempt and misgiving  you have a practice i suppose sir  i am not in practice just yet  just beginning  i am about to begin  in london or near here  in london probably  hm i am practising in markton  indeed have you been at it long  not particularly i designed the chapel built by this ladys late father it was my first undertakingi owe my start in fact to mr power ever build a chapel  never i have sketched a good many churches  ahthere we differ i didnt do much sketching in my youth nor have i time for it now sketching and building are two different things to my mind i was not brought up to the professiongot into it through sheer love of it i began as a landscape gardener then i became a builder then i was a road contractor every architect might do worse than have some such experience but nowadays tis the men who can draw pretty pictures who get recommended not the practical men young prigs win institute medals for a pretty design or two which if anybody tried to build them would fall down like a house of cards then they get travelling studentships and what not and then they start as architects of some new school or other and think they are the masters of us experienced ones  while somerset was reflecting how far this statement was true he heard the voice of paula inquiring who can he be  her eyes were bent on the window looking out somerset saw in the mead beyond the dry ditch dare with his photographic apparatus  he is the young gentleman who called about taking views of the castle said charlotte  o yesi remember it is quite right he met me in the village and asked me to suggest him some views i thought him a respectable young fellow  i think he is a canadian said somerset  no said paula he is from the eastat least he implied so to me  there is italian blood in him said charlotte brightly for he spoke to me with an italian accent but i cant think whether he is a boy or a man  it is to be earnestly hoped that the gentleman does not prevaricate said the minister for the first time attracted by the subject i accidentally met him in the lane and he said something to me about having lived in malta i think it was malta or gibraltareven if he did not say that he was born there  his manners are no credit to his nationality observed mrs goodman also speaking publicly for the first time he asked me this morning to send him out a pail of water for his process and before i had turned away he began whistling i dont like whistlers  then it appears said somerset that he is a being of no age no nationality and no behaviour  a complete negative added havill brightening into a civil sneer that is he would be if he were not a maker of negatives well known in markton  not well known mr havill answered mrs goodman firmly for i lived in markton for thirty years ending three months ago and he was never heard of in my time  he is something like you charlotte said paula smiling playfully on her companion  all the men looked at charlotte on whose face a delicate nervous blush thereupon made its appearance  pon my word there is a likeness now i think of it said havill  paula bent down to charlotte and whispered forgive my rudeness dear he is not a nice enough person to be like you he is really more like one or other of the old pictures about the house i forget which and really it does not matter  peoples features fall naturally into groups and classes remarked somerset to an observant person they often repeat themselves though to a careless eye they seem infinite in their differences  the conversation flagged and they idly observed the figure of the cosmopolite dare as he walked round his instrument in the mead and busied himself with an arrangement of curtains and lenses occasionally withdrawing a few steps and looking contemplatively at the towers and walls    ix  somerset returned to the top of the great tower with a vague consciousness that he was going to do something up thereperhaps sketch a general plan of the structure but he began to discern that this stancycastle episode in his studies of gothic architecture might be less useful than ornamental to him as a professional man though it was too agreeable to be abandoned finding after a while that his drawing progressed but slowly by reason of infinite joyful thoughts more allied to his nature than to his art he relinquished rule and compass and entered one of the two turrets opening on the roof it was not the staircase by which he had ascended and he proceeded to explore its lower part entering from the blaze of light without and imagining the stairs to descend as usual he became aware after a few steps that there was suddenly nothing to tread on and found himself precipitated downwards to a distance of several feet  arrived at the bottom he was conscious of the happy fact that he had not seriously hurt himself though his leg was twisted awkwardly next he perceived that the stone steps had been removed from the turret so that he had dropped into it as into a dry well that owing to its being walled up below there was no door of exit on either side of him that he was in short a prisoner  placing himself in a more comfortable position he calmly considered the best means of getting out or of making his condition known for a moment he tried to drag himself up by his arm but it was a hopeless attempt the height to the first step being far too great  he next looked round at a lower level not far from his left elbow in the concave of the outer wall was a slit for the admission of light and he perceived at once that through this slit alone lay his chance of communicating with the outer world at first it seemed as if it were to be done by shouting but when he learnt what little effect was produced by his voice in the midst of such a mass of masonry his heart failed him for a moment yet as either paula or miss de stancy would probably guess his visit to the top of the tower there was no cause for terror if some for alarm  he put his handkerchief through the windowslit so that it fluttered outside and fixing it in its place by a large stone drawn from the loose ones around him awaited succour as best he could to begin this course of procedure was easy but to abide in patience till it should produce fruit was an irksome task as nearly as he could guessfor his watch had been stopped by the fallit was now about four oclock and it would be scarcely possible for evening to approach without some eye or other noticing the white signal so somerset waited his eyes lingering on the little world of objects around him till they all became quite familiar spiderswebs in plenty were there and one in particular just before him was in full use as a snare stretching across the arch of the window with radiating threads as its ribs somerset had plenty of time and he counted their numberfifteen he remained so silent that the owner of this elaborate structure soon forgot the disturbance which had resulted in the breaking of his diagonal ties and crept out from the corner to mend them in watching the process somerset noticed that on the stonework behind the web sundry names and initials had been cut by explorers in years gone by among these antique inscriptions he observed two bright and clean ones consisting of the words de stancy and w dare crossing each other at right angles from the state of the stone they could not have been cut more than a month before this date and musing on the circumstance somerset passed the time until the sun reached the slit in that side of the tower where beginning by throwing in a streak of fire as narrow as a cornstalk it enlarged its width till the dusty nook was flooded with cheerful light it disclosed something lying in the corner which on examination proved to be a dry bone whether it was human or had come from the castle larder in bygone times he could not tell one bone was not a whole skeleton but it made him think of ginevra of modena the heroine of the mistletoe bough and other cribbed and confined wretches who had fallen into such traps and been discovered after a cycle of years  the suns rays had travelled some way round the interior when somersets waiting ears were at last attracted by footsteps above each tread being brought down by the hollow turret with great fidelity he hoped that with these sounds would arise that of a soft voice he had begun to like well indeed during the solitary hour or two of his waiting here he had pictured paula straying alone on the terrace of the castle looking up noting his signal and ascending to deliver him from his painful position by her own exertions it seemed that at length his dream had been verified the footsteps approached the opening of the turret and attracted by the call which somerset now raised began to descend towards him in a moment not paulas face but that of a dreary footman of her household looked into the hole  somerset mastered his disappointment and the man speedily fetched a ladder by which means the prisoner of two hours ascended to the roof in safety during the process he ventured to ask for the ladies of the house and learnt that they had gone out for a drive together  before he left the castle however they had returned a circumstance unexpectedly made known to him by his receiving a message from miss power to the effect that she would be glad to see him at his convenience wondering what it could possibly mean he followed the messenger to her rooma small modern library in the jacobean wing of the house adjoining that in which the telegraph stood she was alone sitting behind a table littered with letters and sketches and looking fresh from her drive perhaps it was because he had been shut up in that dismal dungeon all the afternoon that he felt something in her presence which at the same time charmed and refreshed him  she signified that he was to sit down but finding that he was going to place himself on a straightbacked chair some distance off she said will you sit nearer to me and then as if rather oppressed by her dignity she left her own chair of business and seated herself at ease on an ottoman which was among the diversified furniture of the apartment  i want to consult you professionally she went on i have been much impressed by your great knowledge of castellated architecture will you sit in that leather chair at the table as you may have to take notes  the young man assented expressed his gratification and went to the chair she designated  but mr somerset she continued from the ottomanthe width of the table only dividing themi first should just like to know and i trust you will excuse my inquiry if you are an architect in practice or only as yet studying for the profession  i am just going to practise i open my office on the first of january next he answered  you would not mind having me as a clientyour first client she looked curiously from her sideway face across the table as she said this  can you ask it said somerset warmly what are you going to build  i am going to restore the castle  what all of it said somerset astonished at the audacity of such an undertaking  not the parts that are absolutely ruinous the walls battered by the parliament artillery had better remain as they are i suppose but we have begun wrong it is i who should ask you not you me i fear she went on in that low note which was somewhat difficult to catch at a distance i fear what the antiquarians will say if i am not very careful they come here a great deal in summer and if i were to do the work wrong they would put my name in the papers as a dreadful person but i must live here as i have no other house except the one in london and hence i must make the place habitable i do hope i can trust to your judgment  i hope so he said with diffidence for far from having much professional confidence he often mistrusted himself i am a fellow of the society of antiquaries and a member of the institute of british architectsnot a fellow of that body yet though i soon shall be  then i am sure you must be trustworthy she said with enthusiasm well what am i to dohow do we begin  somerset began to feel more professional what with the business chair and the table and the writingpaper notwithstanding that these articles and the room they were in were hers instead of his and an evenness of manner which he had momentarily lost returned to him the very first step he said is to decide upon the outlaywhat is it to cost  he faltered a little for it seemed to disturb the softness of their relationship to talk thus of hard cash but her sympathy with his feeling was apparently not great and she said the expenditure shall be what you advise  what a heavenly client he thought but you must just give some idea he said gently for the fact is any sum almost may be spent on such a building five thousand ten thousand twenty thousand fifty thousand a hundred thousand  i want it done well so suppose we say a hundred thousand my fathers solicitormy solicitor nowsays i may go to a hundred thousand without extravagance if the expenditure is scattered over two or three years  somerset looked round for a pen with quickness of insight she knew what he wanted and signified where one could be found he wrote down in large figures       100000  it was more than he had expected and for a young man just beginning practice the opportunity of playing with another persons money to that extent would afford an exceptionally handsome opening not so much from the commission it represented as from the attention that would be bestowed by the artworld on such an undertaking  paula had sunk into a reverie i was intending to intrust the work to mr havill a local architect she said but i gathered from his conversation with you today that his ignorance of styles might compromise me very seriously in short though my father employed him in one or two little matters it would not be righteven a morally culpable thingto place such an historically valuable building in his hands  has mr havill ever been led to expect the commission he asked  he may have guessed that he would have it i have spoken of my intention to him more than once  somerset thought over his conversation with havill well he did not like havill personally and he had strong reasons for suspecting that in the matter of architecture havill was a quack but was it quite generous to step in thus and take away what would be a golden opportunity to such a man of making both ends meet comfortably for some years to come without giving him at least one chance he reflected a little longer and then spoke out his feeling  i venture to propose a slightly modified arrangement he said instead of committing the whole undertaking to my hands without better proof of my ability to carry it out than you have at present let there be a competition between mr havill and myselflet our rival plans for the restoration and enlargement be submitted to a committee of the royal institute of british architectsand let the choice rest with them subject of course to your approval  it is indeed generous of you to suggest it she looked thoughtfully at him he appeared to strike her in a new light you really recommend it the fairness which had prompted his words seemed to incline her still more than before to resign herself entirely to him in the matter  i do said somerset deliberately  i will think of it since you wish it and now what general idea have you of the plan to adopt i do not positively agree to your suggestion as yet so i may perhaps ask the question  somerset being by this time familiar with the general plan of the castle took out his pencil and made a rough sketch while he was doing it she rose and coming to the back of his chair bent over him in silence  ah i begin to see your conception she murmured and the breath of her words fanned his ear he finished the sketch and held it up to her saying  i would suggest that you walk over the building with mr havill and myself and detail your ideas to us on each portion  is it necessary  clients mostly do it  i will then but it is too late for me this evening please meet me tomorrow at ten    x  at ten oclock they met in the same room paula appearing in a straw hat having a bentup brim lined with plaited silk so that it surrounded her forehead like a nimbus and somerset armed with sketchbook measuringrod and other apparatus of his craft  and mr havill said the young man  i have not decided to employ him if i do he shall go round with me independently of you she replied rather brusquely  somerset was by no means sorry to hear this his duty to havill was done  and now she said as they walked on together through the passages i must tell you that i am not a mediaevalist myself and perhaps thats a pity  what are you  i am greekthats why i dont wish to influence your design  somerset as they proceeded pointed out where roofs had been and should be again where gables had been pulled down and where floors had vanished showing her how to reconstruct their details from marks in the walls much as a comparative anatomist reconstructs an antediluvian from fragmentary bones and teeth she appeared to be interested listened attentively but said little in reply they were ultimately in a long narrow passage indifferently lighted when somerset treading on a loose stone felt a twinge of weakness in one knee and knew in a moment that it was the result of the twist given by his yesterdays fall he paused leaning against the wall  what is it said paula with a sudden timidity in her voice  i slipped down yesterday he said it will be right in a moment  ican i help you said paula but she did not come near him indeed she withdrew a little she looked up the passage and down the passage and became conscious that it was long and gloomy and that nobody was near a curious coy uneasiness seemed to take possession of her whether she thought for the first time that she had made a mistakethat to wander about the castle alone with him was compromising or whether it was the mere shy instinct of maidenhood nobody knows but she said suddenly i will get something for you and return in a few minutes  pray dontit has quite passed he said stepping out again  but paula had vanished when she came back it was in the rear of charlotte de stancy miss de stancy had a tumbler in one hand half full of wine which she offered him paula remaining in the background  he took the glass and to satisfy his companions drank a mouthful or two though there was really nothing whatever the matter with him beyond the slight ache above mentioned charlotte was going to retire but paula said quite anxiously you will stay with me charlotte wont you surely you are interested in what i am doing  what is it said miss de stancy  planning how to mend and enlarge the castle tell mr somerset what i want done in the quadrangleyou know quite welland i will walk on  she walked on but instead of talking on the subject as directed charlotte and somerset followed chatting on indifferent matters they came to an inner court and found paula standing there  she met miss de stancy with a smile did you explain she asked  i have not explained yet paula seated herself on a stone bench and charlotte went on miss power thought of making a greek court of this but she will not tell you so herself because it seems such dreadful anachronism  i said i would not tell any architect myself interposed paula correctingly i did not then know that he would be mr somerset  it is rather startling said somerset  a greek colonnade all round you said paula continued her less reticent companion a peristyle you called ityou saw it in a book dont you rememberand then you were going to have a fountain in the middle and statues like those in the british museum  i did say so remarked paula pulling the leaves from a young sycamoretree that had sprung up between the joints of the paving  from the spot where they sat they could see over the roofs the upper part of the great tower wherein somerset had met with his misadventure the tower stood boldly up in the sun and from one of the slits in the corner something white waved in the breeze  what can that be said charlotte is it the fluff of owls or a handkerchief  it is my handkerchief somerset answered i fixed it there with a stone to attract attention and forgot to take it away  all three looked up at the handkerchief with interest why did you want to attract attention said paula  o i fell into the turret but i got out very easily  o paula said charlotte turning to her friend that must be the place where the man fell in years ago and was starved to death  starved to death said paula  they say so o mr somerset what an escape and charlotte de stancy walked away to a point from which she could get a better view of the treacherous turret  whom did you think to attract asked paula after a pause  i thought you might see it  me personally and blushing faintly her eyes rested upon him  i hoped for anybody i thought of you said somerset  she did not continue in a moment she arose and went across to miss de stancy dont you go falling down and becoming a skeleton she saidsomerset overheard the words though paula was unaware of itafter which she clasped her fingers behind charlottes neck and smiled tenderly in her face  it seemed to be quite unconsciously done and somerset thought it a very beautiful action presently paula returned to him and said mr somerset i think we have had enough architecture for today  the two women then wished him goodmorning and went away somerset feeling that he had now every reason for prowling about the castle remained near the spot endeavouring to evolve some plan of procedure for the project entertained by the beautiful owner of those weatherscathed walls but for a long time the mental perspective of his new position so excited the emotional side of his nature that he could not concentrate it on feet and inches as paulas architect supposing havill not to be admitted as a competitor he must of necessity be in constant communication with her for a space of two or three years to come and particularly during the next few months she doubtless cherished far too ambitious views of her career to feel any personal interest in this enforced relationship with him but he would be at liberty to feel what he chose and to be the victim of an unrequited passion while afforded such splendid opportunities of communion with the one beloved deprived that passion of its most deplorable features accessibility is a great point in matters of love and perhaps of the two there is less misery in loving without return a goddess who is to be seen and spoken to every day than in having an affection tenderly reciprocated by one always hopelessly removed  with this view of having to spend a considerable time in the neighbourhood somerset shifted his quarters that afternoon from the little inn at sleepinggreen to a larger one at markton he required more rooms in which to carry out paulas instructions than the former place afforded and a more central position having reached and dined at markton he found the evening tedious and again strolled out in the direction of the castle  when he reached it the light was declining and a solemn stillness overspread the pile the great tower was in full view that spot of white which looked like a pigeon fluttering from the loophole was his handkerchief still hanging in the place where he had left it his eyes yet lingered on the walls when he noticed with surprise that the handkerchief suddenly vanished  believing that the breezes though weak below might have been strong enough at that height to blow it into the turret and in no hurry to get off the premises he leisurely climbed up to find it ascending by the second staircase crossing the roof and going to the top of the treacherous turret the ladder by which he had escaped still stood within it and beside the ladder he beheld the dim outline of a woman in a meditative attitude holding his handkerchief in her hand  somerset softly withdrew when he had reached the ground he looked up a girlish form was standing at the top of the tower looking over the parapet upon himpossibly not seeing him for it was dark on the lawn it was either miss de stancy or paula one of them had gone there alone for his handkerchief and had remained awhile pondering on his escape but which if i were not a faintheart i should run all risk and wave my hat or kiss my hand to her whoever she is he thought but he did not do either  so he lingered about silently in the shades and then thought of strolling to his rooms at markton just at leaving as he passed under the inhabited wing whence one or two lights now blinked he heard a piano and a voice singing the mistletoe bough the song had probably been suggested to the romantic fancy of the singer by her visit to the scene of his captivity    xi  the identity of the lady whom he had seen on the tower and afterwards heard singing was established the next day  i have been thinking said miss power on meeting him that you may require a studio on the premises if so the room i showed you yesterday is at your service if i employ mr havill to compete with you i will offer him a similar one  somerset did not decline and she added in the same room you will find the handkerchief that was left on the tower  ah i saw that it was gone somebody brought it down  i did she shyly remarked looking up for a second under her shady hatbrim  i am much obliged to you  o no i went up last night to see where the accident happened and there i found it when you came up were you in search of it or did you want me  then she saw me he thought i went for the handkerchief only i was not aware that you were there he answered simply and he involuntarily sighed  it was very soft but she might have heard him for there was interest in her voice as she continued did you see me before you went back  i did not know it was you i saw that some lady was there and i would not disturb her i wondered all the evening if it were you  paula hastened to explain we understood that you would stay to dinner and as you did not come in we wondered where you were that made me think of your accident and after dinner i went up to the place where it happened  somerset almost wished she had not explained so lucidly  and now followed the piquant days to which his position as her architect or at worst as one of her two architects naturally led his anticipations were for once surpassed by the reality perhaps somersets inherent unfitness for a professional life under ordinary circumstances was only proved by his great zest for it now had he been in regular practice with numerous other clients instead of having merely made a start with this one he would have totally neglected their business in his exclusive attention to paulas  the idea of a competition between somerset and havill had been highly approved by paulas solicitor but she would not assent to it as yet seeming quite vexed that somerset should not have taken the good the gods provided without questioning her justice to havill the room she had offered him was prepared as a studio drawingboards and whatmans paper were sent for and in a few days somerset began serious labour his first requirement was a clerk or two to do the drudgery of measuring and figuring but for the present he preferred to sketch alone sometimes in measuring the outworks of the castle he ran against havill strolling about with no apparent object who bestowed on him an envious nod and passed by  i hope you will not make your sketches she said looking in upon him one day and then go away to your studio in london and think of your other buildings and forget mine i am in haste to begin and wish you not to neglect me  i have no other building to think of said somerset rising and placing a chair for her i had not begun practice as you may know i have nothing else in hand but your castle  i suppose i ought not to say i am glad of it but it is an advantage to have an architect all to ones self the architect whom i at first thought of told me before i knew you that if i placed the castle in his hands he would undertake no other commission till its completion  i agree to the same said somerset  i dont wish to bind you but i hinder you nowdo pray go on without reference to me when will there be some drawing for me to see  i will take care that it shall be soon  he had a metallic tape in his hand and went out of the room to take some dimension in the corridor the assistant for whom he had advertised had not arrived and he attempted to fix the end of the tape by sticking his penknife through the ring into the wall paula looked on at a distance  i will hold it she said  she went to the required corner and held the end in its place she had taken it the wrong way and somerset went over and placed it properly in her fingers carefully avoiding to touch them she obediently raised her hand to the corner again and stood till he had finished when she asked is that all  that is all said somerset thank you without further speech she looked at his sketchbook while he marked down the lines just acquired  you said the other day she observed that early gothic work might be known by the undercutting or something to that effect i have looked in rickman and the oxford glossary but i cannot quite understand what you meant  it was only too probable to her lover from the way in which she turned to him that she had looked in rickman and the glossary and was thinking of nothing in the world but of the subject of her inquiry  i can show you by actual example if you will come to the chapel he returned hesitatingly  dont go on purpose to show mewhen you are there on your own account i will come in  i shall be there in halfanhour  very well said paula she looked out of a window and seeing miss de stancy on the terrace left him  somerset stood thinking of what he had said he had no occasion whatever to go into the chapel of the castle that day he had been tempted by her words to say he would be there and halfanhour had come to his lips almost without his knowledge this community of interestif it were not anything more tenderwas growing serious what had passed between them amounted to an appointment they were going to meet in the most solitary chamber of the whole solitary pile could it be that paula had well considered this in replying with her friendly very well probably not  somerset proceeded to the chapel and waited with the progress of the seconds towards the halfhour he began to discover that a dangerous admiration for this girl had risen within him yet so imaginative was his passion that he hardly knew a single feature of her countenance well enough to remember it in her absence the meditative judgment of things and men which had been his habit up to the moment of seeing her in the baptist chapel seemed to have left himnothing remained but a distracting wish to be always near her and it was quite with dismay that he recognized what immense importance he was attaching to the question whether she would keep the trifling engagement or not  the chapel of stancy castle was a silent place heaped up in corners with a lumber of old panels framework and broken coloured glass here no clock could be heard beating out the hours of the dayhere no voice of priest or deacon had for generations uttered the daily service denoting how the year rolls on the stagnation of the spot was sufficient to draw somersets mind for a moment from the subject which absorbed it and he thought so too will time triumph over all this fervour within me  lifting his eyes from the floor on which his foot had been tapping nervously he saw paula standing at the other end it was not so pleasant when he also saw that mrs goodman accompanied her the latter lady however obligingly remained where she was resting while paula came forward and as usual paused without speaking  it is in this little arcade that the example occurs said somerset  o yes she answered turning to look at it  early piers capitals and mouldings generally alternated with deep hollows so as to form strong shadows now look under the abacus of this capital you will find the stone hollowed out wonderfully and also in this archmould it is often difficult to understand how it could be done without cracking off the stone the difference between this and late work can be felt by the hand even better than it can be seen he suited the action to the word and placed his hand in the hollow  she listened attentively then stretched up her own hand to test the cutting as he had done she was not quite tall enough she would step upon this piece of wood having done so she tried again and succeeded in putting her finger on the spot no she could not understand it through her glove even now she pulled off her glove and her hand resting in the stone channel her eyes became abstracted in the effort of realization the ideas derived through her hand passing into her face  no i am not sure now she said  somerset placed his own hand in the cavity now their two hands were close together again they had been close together halfanhour earlier and he had sedulously avoided touching hers he dared not let such an accident happen now and yetsurely she saw the situation was the inscrutable seriousness with which she applied herself to his lesson a mockery there was such a bottomless depth in her eyes that it was impossible to guess truly let it be that destiny alone had ruled that their hands should be together a second time  all rumination was cut short by an impulse he seized her forefinger between his own finger and thumb and drew it along the hollow saying that is the curve i mean  somersets hand was hot and trembling paulas on the contrary was cool and soft as an infants  now the archmould continued he therethe depth of that cavity is tremendous and it is not geometrical as in later work he drew her unresisting fingers from the capital to the arch and laid them in the little trench as before  she allowed them to rest quietly there till he relinquished them thank you she then said withdrawing her hand brushing the dust from her fingertips and putting on her glove  her imperception of his feeling was the very sublimity of maiden innocence if it were real if not well the coquetry was no great sin  mr somerset will you allow me to have the greek court i mentioned she asked tentatively after a long break in their discourse as she scanned the green stones along the base of the arcade with a conjectural countenance as to his reply  will your own feeling for the genius of the place allow you  i am not a mediaevalist i am an eclectic  you dont dislike your own house on that account  i did at firsti dont so much now i should love it and adore every stone and think feudalism the only true romance of life if  what  if i were a de stancy and the castle the long home of my forefathers  somerset was a little surprised at the avowal the ministers words on the effects of her new environment recurred to his mind miss de stancy doesnt think so he said she cares nothing about those things  paula now turned to him hitherto her remarks had been sparingly spoken her eyes being directed elsewhere yes that is very strange is it not she said but it is owing to the joyous freshness of her nature which precludes her from dwelling on the pastindeed the past is no more to her than it is to a sparrow or robin she is scarcely an instance of the wearing out of old families for a younger mental constitution than hers i never knew  unless that very simplicity represents the second childhood of her line rather than her own exclusive character  paula shook her head in spite of the greek court she is more greek than i  you represent science rather than art perhaps  how she asked glancing up under her hat  i mean replied somerset that you represent the march of mindthe steamship and the railway and the thoughts that shake mankind  she weighed his words and said ah yes you allude to my father my father was a great man but i am more and more forgetting his greatness that kind of greatness is what a woman can never truly enter into i am less and less his daughter every day that goes by  she walked away a few steps to rejoin the excellent mrs goodman who as somerset still perceived was waiting for paula at the discreetest of distances in the shadows at the farther end of the building surely paulas voice had faltered and she had turned to hide a tear  she came back again did you know that my father made half the railways in europe including that one over there she said waving her little gloved hand in the direction whence low rumbles were occasionally heard during the day  yes  how did you know  miss de stancy told me a little and i then found his name and doings were quite familiar to me  curiously enough with his words there came through the broken windows the murmur of a train in the distance sounding clearer and more clear it was nothing to listen to yet they both listened till the increasing noise suddenly broke off into dead silence  it has gone into the tunnel said paula have you seen the tunnel my father made the curves are said to be a triumph of science there is nothing else like it in this part of england  there is not i have heard so but i have not seen it  do you think it a thing more to be proud of that ones father should have made a great tunnel and railway like that than that ones remote ancestor should have built a great castle like this  what could somerset say it would have required a casuist to decide whether his answer should depend upon his conviction or upon the family ties of such a questioner from a modern point of view railways are no doubt things more to be proud of than castles he said though perhaps i myself from mere association should decide in favour of the ancestor who built the castle the serious anxiety to be truthful that somerset threw into his observation was more than the circumstance required to design great engineering works he added musingly and without the least eye to the disparagement of her parent requires no doubt a leading mind but to execute them as he did requires of course only a following mind  his reply had not altogether pleased her and there was a distinct reproach conveyed by her slight movement towards mrs goodman he saw it and was grieved that he should have spoken so i am going to walk over and inspect that famous tunnel of your fathers he added gently it will be a pleasant study for this afternoon  she went away i am no man of the world he thought i ought to have praised that father of hers straight off i shall not win her respect much less her love    xii  somerset did not forget what he had planned and when lunch was over he walked away through the trees the tunnel was more difficult of discovery than he had anticipated and it was only after considerable winding among green lanes whose deep ruts were like canyons of colorado in miniature that he reached the slope in the distant upland where the tunnel began a road stretched over its crest and thence along one side of the railwaycutting  he there unexpectedly saw standing miss powers carriage and on drawing nearer he found it to contain paula herself miss de stancy and mrs goodman  how singular exclaimed miss de stancy gaily  it is most natural said paula instantly in the morning two people discuss a feature in the landscape and in the afternoon each has a desire to see it from what the other has said of it therefore they accidentally meet  now paula had distinctly heard somerset declare that he was going to walk there how then could she say this so coolly it was with a pang at his heart that he returned to his old thought of her being possibly a finished coquette and dissembler whatever she might be she was not a creature starched very stiffly by puritanism  somerset looked down on the mouth of the tunnel the popular commonplace that science steam and travel must always be unromantic and hideous was not proven at this spot on either slope of the deep cutting green with long grass grew drooping young trees of ash beech and other flexible varieties their foliage almost concealing the actual railway which ran along the bottom its thin steel rails gleaming like silver threads in the depths the vertical front of the tunnel faced with brick that had once been red was now weatherstained lichened and mossed over in harmonious rustybrowns pearly greys and neutral greens at the very base appearing a little blueblack spot like a mouseholethe tunnels mouth  the carriage was drawn up quite close to the wood railing and paula was looking down at the same time with him but he made no remark to her  mrs goodman broke the silence by saying if it were not a railway we should call it a lovely dell  somerset agreed with her adding that it was so charming that he felt inclined to go down  if you do perhaps miss power will order you up again as a trespasser said charlotte de stancy you are one of the largest shareholders in the railway are you not paula  miss power did not reply  i suppose as the road is partly yours you might walk all the way to london along the rails if you wished might you not dear charlotte continued  paula smiled and said no of course not  somerset feeling himself superfluous raised his hat to his companions as if he meant not to see them again for a while and began to descend by some steps cut in the earth miss de stancy asked mrs goodman to accompany her to a barrow over the top of the tunnel and they left the carriage paula remaining alone  down somerset plunged through the long grass bushes late summer flowers moths and caterpillars vexed with himself that he had come there since paula was so inscrutable and humming the notes of some song he did not know the tunnel that had seemed so small from the surface was a vast archway when he reached its mouth which emitted as a contrast to the sultry heat on the slopes of the cutting a cool breeze that had travelled a mile underground from the other end far away in the darkness of this silent subterranean corridor he could see that other end as a mere speck of light  when he had conscientiously admired the construction of the massive archivault and the majesty of its nude ungarnished walls he looked up the slope at the carriage it was so small to the eye that it might have been made for a performance by canaries paulas face being still smaller as she leaned back in her seat idly looking down at him there seemed something roguish in her attitude of criticism and to be no longer the subject of her contemplation he entered the tunnel out of her sight  in the middle of the speck of light before him appeared a speck of black and then a shrill whistle dulled by millions of tons of earth reached his ears from thence it was what he had been on his guard against all the timea passing train and instead of taking the trouble to come out of the tunnel he stepped into a recess till the train had rattled past and vanished onward round a curve  somerset still remained where he had placed himself mentally balancing science against art the grandeur of this fine piece of construction against that of the castle and thinking whether paulas father had not after all the best of it when all at once he saw paulas form confronting him at the entrance of the tunnel he instantly went forward into the light to his surprise she was as pale as a lily  o mr somerset she exclaimed you ought not to frighten me soindeed you ought not the train came out almost as soon as you had gone in and as you did not returnan accident was possible  somerset at once perceived that he had been to blame in not thinking of this  please do forgive my thoughtlessness in not reflecting how it would strike you he pleaded ii see i have alarmed you  her alarm was indeed much greater than he had at first thought she trembled so much that she was obliged to sit down at which he went up to her full of solicitousness  you ought not to have done it she said i naturally thoughtany person would  somerset perhaps wisely said nothing at this outburst the cause of her vexation was plainly enough his perception of her discomposure he stood looking in another direction till in a few moments she had risen to her feet again quite calm  it would have been dreadful she said with faint gaiety as the colour returned to her face if i had lost my architect and been obliged to engage mr havill without an alternative  i was really in no danger but of course i ought to have considered he said  i forgive you she returned goodnaturedly i knew there was no great danger to a person exercising ordinary discretion but artists and thinkers like you are indiscreet for a moment sometimes i am now going up again what do you think of the tunnel  they were crossing the railway to ascend by the opposite path somerset keeping his eye on the interior of the tunnel for safety when suddenly there arose a noise and shriek from the contrary direction behind the trees both knew in a moment what it meant and each seized the other as they rushed off the permanent way the ideas of both had been so centred on the tunnel as the source of danger that the probability of a train from the opposite quarter had been forgotten it rushed past them causing paulas dress hair and ribbons to flutter violently and blowing up the fallen leaves in a shower over their shoulders  neither spoke and they went up several steps holding each other by the hand till becoming conscious of the fact she withdrew hers whereupon somerset stopped and looked earnestly at her but her eyes were averted towards the tunnel wall  what an escape he said  we were not so very near i think were we she asked quickly if we were i think you werevery good to take my hand  they reached the top at last and the new level and open air seemed to give her a new mind i dont see the carriage anywhere she said in the common tones of civilization  he thought it had gone over the crest of the hill he would accompany her till they reached it  nopleasei would rather noti can find it very well before he could say more she had inclined her head and smiled and was on her way alone  the tunnelcutting appeared a dreary gulf enough now to the young man as he stood leaning over the rails above it beating the herbage with his stick for some minutes he could not criticize or weigh her conduct the warmth of her presence still encircled him he recalled her face as it had looked out at him from under the white silk puffing of her black hat and the speaking power of her eyes at the moment of danger the breadth of that clearcomplexioned foreheadalmost concealed by the masses of brown hair bundled up around itsignified that if her disposition were oblique and insincere enough for trifling coquetting or in any way making a fool of him she had the intellect to do it cruelly well  but it was ungenerous to ruminate so suspiciously a girl not an actress by profession could hardly turn pale artificially as she had done though perhaps mere fright meant nothing and would have arisen in her just as readily had he been one of the labourers on her estate  the reflection that such feeling as she had exhibited could have no tender meaning returned upon him with masterful force when he thought of her wealth and the social position into which she had drifted somerset being of a solitary and studious nature was not quite competent to estimate precisely the disqualifying effect if any of her nonconformity her newness of blood and other things among the old county families established round her but the toughest prejudices he thought were not likely to be long invulnerable to such cheerful beauty and brightness of intellect as paulas when she emerged as she was plainly about to do from the seclusion in which she had been living since her fathers death she would inevitably win her way among her neighbours she would become the local topic fortunehunters would learn of her existence and draw near in shoals what chance would there then be for him  the points in his favour were indeed few but they were just enough to keep a tantalizing hope alive modestly leaving out of count his personal and intellectual qualifications he thought of his family it was an old stock enough though not a rich one his greatuncle had been the wellknown viceadmiral sir armstrong somerset who served his country well in the baltic the indies china and the caribbean sea his grandfather had been a notable metaphysician his father the royal academician was popular but perhaps this was not the sort of reasoning likely to occupy the mind of a young woman the personal aspect of the situation was in such circumstances of far more import he had come as a wandering strangerthat possibly lent some interest to him in her eyes he was installed in an office which would necessitate free communion with her for some time to come that was another advantage and would be a still greater one if she showed as paula seemed disposed to do such artistic sympathy with his work as to follow up with interest the details of its progress  the carriage did not reappear and he went on towards markton disinclined to return again that day to the studio which had been prepared for him at the castle he heard feet brushing the grass behind him and looking round saw the baptist minister  i have just come from the village said mr woodwell who looked worn and weary his boots being covered with dust and i have learnt that which confirms my fears for her  for miss power  most assuredly  what danger is there said somerset  the temptations of her position have become too much for her she is going out of mourning next week and will give a large dinnerparty on the occasion for though the invitations are partly in the name of her relative mrs goodman they must come from her the guests are to include people of old cavalier families who would have treated her grandfather sir and even her father with scorn for their religion and connections also the parson and curateyes actually people who believe in the apostolic succession and whats more theyre coming my opinion is that it has all arisen from her friendship with miss de stancy  well cried somerset warmly this only shows liberality of feeling on both sides i suppose she has invited you as well  she has not invited me mr somerset not withstanding your erroneous opinions on important matters i speak to you as a friend and i tell you that she has never in her secret heart forgiven that sermon of mine in which i likened her to the church at laodicea i admit the words were harsh but i was doing my duty and if the case arose tomorrow i would do it again her displeasure is a deep grief to me but i serve one greater than she you of course are invited to this dinner  i have heard nothing of it murmured the young man  their paths diverged and when somerset reached the hotel he was informed that somebody was waiting to see him  man or woman he asked  the landlady who always liked to reply in person to somersets inquiries apparently thinking him by virtue of his drawing implements and liberality of payment a possible lord of burleigh came forward and said it was certainly not a woman but whether man or boy she could not say his name is mr dare she added  othat youth he said  somerset went upstairs along the passage down two steps round the angle and so on to the rooms reserved for him in this rambling edifice of stagecoach memories where he found dare waiting dare came forward pulling out the cutting of an advertisement  mr somerset this is yours i believe from the architectural world  somerset said that he had inserted it  i think i should suit your purpose as assistant very well  are you an architects draughtsman  not specially i have some knowledge of the same and want to increase it  i thought you were a photographer  also of photography said dare with a bow though but an amateur in that art i can challenge comparison with regent street or broadway  somerset looked upon his table two letters only addressed in initials were lying there as answers to his advertisement he asked dare to wait and looked them over neither was satisfactory on this account he overcame his slight feeling against mr dare and put a question to test that gentlemans capacities how would you measure the front of a building including windows doors mouldings and every other feature for a ground plan so as to combine the greatest accuracy with the greatest despatch  in running dimensions said dare  as this was the particular kind of work he wanted done somerset thought the answer promising coming to terms with dare he requested the wouldbe student of architecture to wait at the castle the next day and dismissed him  a quarter of an hour later when dare was taking a walk in the country he drew from his pocket eight other letters addressed to somerset in initials which to judge by their style and stationery were from men far superior to those two whose communications alone somerset had seen dare looked them over for a few seconds as he strolled on then tore them into minute fragments and burying them under the leaves in the ditch went on his way again    xiii  though exhibiting indifference somerset had felt a pang of disappointment when he heard the news of paulas approaching dinnerparty it seemed a little unkind of her to pass him over seeing how much they were thrown together just now that dinner meant more than it sounded notwithstanding the roominess of her castle she was at present living somewhat incommodiously owing partly to the stagnation caused by her recent bereavement and partly to the necessity for overhauling the de stancy lumber piled in those vast and gloomy chambers before they could be made tolerable to nineteenthcentury fastidiousness  to give dinners on any large scale before somerset had at least set a few of these rooms in order for her showed to his thinking an overpowering desire for society  during the week he saw less of her than usual her time being to all appearance much taken up with driving out to make calls on her neighbours and receiving return visits all this he observed from the windows of his studio overlooking the castle ward in which room he now spent a great deal of his time bending over drawingboards and instructing dare who worked as well as could be expected of a youth of such varied attainments  nearer came the wednesday of the party and no hint of that event reached somerset but such as had been communicated by the baptist minister at last on the very afternoon an invitation was handed into his studionot a kind note in paulas handwriting but a formal printed card in the joint names of mrs goodman and miss power it reached him just four hours before the dinnertime he was plainly to be used as a stopgap at the last moment because somebody could not come  having previously arranged to pass a quiet evening in his rooms at the lord quantock arms in reading up chronicles of the castle from the county history with the view of gathering some ideas as to the distribution of rooms therein before the demolition of a portion of the structure he decided offhand that paulas dinner was not of sufficient importance to him as a professional man and student of art to justify a waste of the evening by going he accordingly declined mrs goodmans and miss powers invitation and at five oclock left the castle and walked across the fields to the little town  he dined early and clearing away heaviness with a cup of coffee applied himself to that volume of the county history which contained the record of stancy castle  here he read that when this picturesque and ancient structure was founded or by whom is extremely uncertain but that a castle stood on the site in very early times appears from many old books of charters in its prime it was such a masterpiece of fortification as to be the wonder of the world and it was thought before the invention of gunpowder that it never could be taken by any force less than divine  he read on to the times when it first passed into the hands of de stancy chivaler and received the family name and so on from de stancy to de stancy till he was lost in the reflection whether paula would or would not have thought more highly of him if he had accepted the invitation to dinner applying himself again to the tome he learned that in the year 1504 stephen the carpenter was paid eleven pence for necessarye repayrs and william the mastermason eight shillings for whyt lyming of the kitchen and the lyme to do it with including a new rope for the fyer bell also the sundry charges for vij crockes xiij lytyll pans a pare of pot hookes a fyer pane a lanterne a chafynge dyshe and xij candyll stychs  bang went eight strokes of the clock it was the dinnerhour  there now i cant go anyhow he said bitterly jumping up and picturing her receiving her company how would she look what would she wear profoundly indifferent to the early history of the noble fabric he felt a violent reaction towards modernism eclecticism new aristocracies everything in short that paula represented he even gave himself up to consider the greek court that she had wished for and passed the remainder of the evening in making a perspective view of the same  the next morning he awoke early and resolving to be at work betimes started promptly it was a fine calm hour of day the grass slopes were silvery with excess of dew and the blue mists hung in the depths of each tree for want of wind to blow them out somerset entered the drive on foot and when near the castle he observed in the gravel the wheelmarks of the carriages that had conveyed the guests thither the night before there seemed to have been a large number for the road where newly repaired was quite cut up before going indoors he was tempted to walk round to the wing in which paula slept  rooks were cawing sparrows were chattering there but the blind of her window was as closely drawn as if it were midnight probably she was sound asleep dreaming of the compliments which had been paid her by her guests and of the future triumphant pleasures that would follow in their train reaching the outer stone stairs leading to the great hall he found them shadowed by an awning brilliantly striped with red and blue within which rows of flowering plants in pots bordered the pathway she could not have made more preparation had the gathering been a ball he passed along the gallery in which his studio was situated entered the room and seized a drawingboard to put into correct drawing the sketch for the greek court that he had struck out the night before thereby abandoning his art principles to please the whim of a girl dare had not yet arrived and after a time somerset threw down his pencil and leant back  his eye fell upon something that moved it was white and lay in the folding chair on the opposite side of the room on near approach he found it to be a fragment of swansdown fanned into motion by his own movements and partially squeezed into the chink of the chair as though by some person sitting on it  none but a woman would have worn or brought that swansdown into his studio and it made him reflect on the possible one nothing interrupted his conjectures till ten oclock when dare came then one of the servants tapped at the door to know if mr somerset had arrived somerset asked if miss power wished to see him and was informed that she had only wished to know if he had come somerset sent a return message that he had a design on the board which he should soon be glad to submit to her and the messenger departed  fine doings here last night sir said dare as he dusted his tsquare  o indeed  a dinnerparty i hear eighteen guests  ah said somerset  the young lady was magnificentsapphires and opalsshe carried as much as a thousand pounds upon her head and shoulders during that three or four hour of course they call her charming compuesta no hay muger fea as they say at madrid  i dont doubt it for a moment said somerset with reserve  dare said no more and presently the door opened and there stood paula  somerset nodded to dare to withdraw into an adjoining room and offered her a chair  you wish to show me the design you have prepared she asked without taking the seat  yes i have come round to your opinion i have made a plan for the greek court you were anxious to build and he elevated the drawingboard against the wall  she regarded it attentively for some moments her finger resting lightly against her chin and said i have given up the idea of a greek court  he showed his astonishment and was almost disappointed he had been grinding up greek architecture entirely on her account had wrenched his mind round to this strange arrangement all for nothing  yes she continued on reconsideration i perceive the want of harmony that would result from inserting such a piece of marblework in a mediaeval fortress so in future we will limit ourselves strictly to synchronism of stylethat is to say make good the norman work by norman the perpendicular by perpendicular and so on i have informed mr havill of the same thing  somerset pulled the greek drawing off the board and tore it in two pieces  she involuntarily turned to look in his face but stopped before she had quite lifted her eyes high enough why did you do that she asked with suave curiosity  it is of no further use said somerset tearing the drawing in the other direction and throwing the pieces into the fireplace you have been reading up orders and styles to some purpose i perceive he regarded her with a faint smile  i have had a few books down from town it is desirable to know a little about the architecture of ones own house  she remained looking at the torn drawing when somerset observing on the table the particle of swansdown he had found in the chair gently blew it so that it skimmed across the table under her eyes  it looks as if it came off a ladys dress he said idly  off a ladys fan she replied  o off a fan  yes off mine  at her reply somerset stretched out his hand for the swansdown and put it carefully in his pocketbook whereupon paula moulding her cherryred lower lip beneath her upper one in arch selfconsciousness at his act turned away to the window and after a pause said softly as she looked out why did you not accept our invitation to dinner  it was impossible to explain why he impulsively drew near and confronted her and said i hope you pardon me  i dont know that i can quite do that answered she with ever so little reproach i know why you did not comeyou were mortified at not being asked sooner but it was purely by an accident that you received your invitation so late my aunt sent the others by post but as yours was to be delivered by hand it was left on her table and was overlooked  surely he could not doubt her words those nice friendly accents were the embodiment of truth itself  i dont mean to make a serious complaint she added in injured tones showing that she did only we had asked nearly all of them to meet you as the son of your illustrious father whom many of my friends know personally andthey were disappointed  it was now time for somerset to be genuinely grieved at what he had done paula seemed so good and honourable at that moment that he could have laid down his life for her  when i was dressed i came in here to ask you to reconsider your decision she continued or to meet us in the drawingroom if you could not possibly be ready for dinner but you were gone  and you sat down in that chair didnt you darling and remained there a long time musing he thought but that he did not say  i am very sorry he murmured  will you make amends by coming to our garden party i ask you the very first  i will replied somerset to add that it would give him great pleasure etc seemed an absurdly weak way of expressing his feelings and he said no more  it is on the nineteenth dont forget the day  he met her eyes in such a way that if she were woman she must have seen it to mean as plainly as words do i look as if i could forget anything you say  she must indeed have understood much more by this timethe whole of his open secret but he did not understand her history has revealed that a supernumerary lover or two is rarely considered a disadvantage by a woman from queen to cottagegirl and the thought made him pause    xiv  when she was gone he went on with the drawing not calling in dare who remained in the room adjoining presently a servant came and laid a paper on his table which miss power had sent it was one of the morning newspapers and was folded so that his eye fell immediately on a letter headed restoration or demolition  the letter was professedly written by a dispassionate person solely in the interests of art it drew attention to the circumstance that the ancient and interesting castle of the de stancys had unhappily passed into the hands of an iconoclast by blood who without respect for the tradition of the county or any feeling whatever for history in stone was about to demolish much if not all that was interesting in that ancient pile and insert in its midst a monstrous travesty of some greek temple in the name of all lovers of mediaeval art conjured the simpleminded writer let something be done to save a building which injured and battered in the civil wars was now to be made a complete ruin by the freaks of an irresponsible owner her sending him the paper seemed to imply that she required his opinion on the case and in the afternoon leaving dare to measure up a wing according to directions he went out in the hope of meeting her having learnt that she had gone to the village on reaching the church he saw her crossing the churchyard path with her aunt and miss de stancy somerset entered the enclosure and as soon as she saw him she came across  what is to be done she asked  you need not be concerned about such a letter as that  i am concerned  i think it dreadful impertinence spoke up charlotte who had joined them can you think who wrote it mr somerset  somerset could not  well what am i to do repeated paula  just as you would have done before  thats what i say observed mrs goodman emphatically  but i have already alteredi have given up the greek court  oyou had seen the paper this morning before you looked at my drawing  i had she answered  somerset thought it a forcible illustration of her natural reticence that she should have abandoned the design without telling him the reason but he was glad she had not done it from mere caprice  she turned to him and said quietly i wish you would answer that letter  it would be illadvised said somerset still if after consideration you wish it much i will meanwhile let me impress upon you again the expediency of calling in mr havillto whom as your fathers architect expecting this commission something perhaps is owedand getting him to furnish an alternative plan to mine and submitting the choice of designs to some members of the royal institute of british architects this letter makes it still more advisable than before  very well said paula reluctantly  let him have all the particulars you have been good enough to explain to meso that we start fair in the competition  she looked negligently on the grass i will tell the building steward to write them out for him she said  the party separated and entered the church by different doors somerset went to a nook of the building that he had often intended to visit it was called the stancy aisle and in it stood the tombs of that family somerset examined them they were unusually rich and numerous beginning with crosslegged knights in hauberks of chainmail their ladies beside them in wimple and coverchief all more or less coated with the green mould and dirt of ages and continuing with others of later date in fine alabaster gilded and coloured some of them wearing round their necks the yorkist collar of suns and roses the livery of edward the fourth in scrutinizing the tallest canopy over these he beheld paula behind it as if in contemplation of the same objects  you came to the church to sketch these monuments i suppose mr somerset she asked as soon as she saw him  no i came to speak to you about the letter  she sighed yes that letter she said i am persecuted if i had been one of these it would never have been written she tapped the alabaster effigy of a recumbent lady with her parasol  they are interesting are they not he said she is beautifully preserved the gilding is nearly gone but beyond that she is perfect  she is like charlotte said paula and what was much like another sigh escaped her lips  somerset admitted that there was a resemblance while paula drew her forefinger across the marble face of the effigy and at length took out her handkerchief and began wiping the dust from the hollows of the features he looked on wondering what her sigh had meant but guessing that it had been somehow caused by the sight of these sculptures in connection with the newspaper writers denunciation of her as an irresponsible outsider  the secret was out when in answer to his question idly put if she wished she were like one of these she said with exceptional vehemence for one of her demeanour  i dont wish i was like one of them i wish i was one of them  whatyou wish you were a de stancy  yes it is very dreadful to be denounced as a barbarian i want to be romantic and historical  miss de stancy seems not to value the privilege he said looking round at another part of the church where charlotte was innocently prattling to mrs goodman quite heedless of the tombs of her forefathers  if i were one she continued i should come here when i feel alone in the world as i do today and i would defy people and say you cannot spoil what has been  they walked on till they reached the old black pew attached to the castlea vast square enclosure of oak panelling occupying half the aisle and surmounted with a little balustrade above the framework within the baize lining that had once been green now faded to the colour of a common in august was torn kicked and scraped to rags by the feet and hands of the ploughboys who had appropriated the pew as their own special place of worship since it had ceased to be used by any resident at the castle because its height afforded convenient shelter for playing at marbles and pricking with pins  charlotte and mrs goodman had by this time left the building and could be seen looking at the headstones outside  if you were a de stancy said somerset who had pondered more deeply upon that new wish of hers than he had seemed to do you would be a churchwoman and sit here  and i should have the pew done up she said readily as she rested her pretty chin on the top rail and looked at the interior her cheeks pressed into deep dimples her quick reply told him that the idea was no new one with her and he thought of poor mr woodwells shrewd prophecy as he perceived that her days as a separatist were numbered  well why cant you have it done up and sit here he said warily  paula shook her head  you are not at enmity with anglicanism i am sure  i want not to be i want to bewhat  what the de stancys were and are he said insidiously and her silenced bearing told him that he had hit the nail  it was a strange idea to get possession of such a nature as hers and for a minute he felt himself on the side of the minister so strong was somersets feeling of wishing her to show the quality of fidelity to paternal dogma and party that he could not help adding  but have you forgotten that other nobilitythe nobility of talent and enterprise  no but i wish i had a wellknown line of ancestors  you have archimedes newcomen watt telford stephenson those are your fathers direct ancestors have you forgotten them have you forgotten your father and the railways he made over half europe and his great energy and skill and all connected with him as if he had never lived  she did not answer for some time no i have not forgotten it she said still looking into the pew but i have a predilection dartiste for ancestors of the other sort like the de stancys  her hand was resting on the low pew next the high one of the de stancys somerset looked at the hand or rather at the glove which covered it then at her averted cheek then beyond it into the pew then at her hand again until by an indescribable consciousness that he was not going too far he laid his own upon it  no no said paula quickly withdrawing her hand but there was nothing resentful or haughty in her tonenothing in short which makes a man in such circumstances feel that he has done a particularly foolish action  the flower on her bosom rose and fell somewhat more than usual as she added i am going away nowi will leave you here without waiting for a reply she adroitly swept back her skirts to free her feet and went out of the church blushing  somerset took her hint and did not follow and when he knew that she had rejoined her friends and heard the carriage roll away he made towards the opposite door pausing to glance once more at the alabaster effigies before leaving them to their silence and neglect he beheld dare bending over them to all appearance intently occupied  he must have been in the church some timecertainly during the tender episode between somerset and paula and could not have failed to perceive it somerset blushed it was unpleasant that dare should have seen the interior of his heart so plainly he went across and said i think i left you to finish the drawing of the north wing mr dare  three hours ago sir said dare having finished that i came to look at the churchfine buildingfine monumentstwo interesting people looking at them  what  i stand corrected pensa molto parla poco as the italians have it  well now mr dare suppose you get back to the castle  which history dubs castle stancy certainly  how do you get on with the measuring  dare sighed whimsically badly in the morning when i have been tempted to indulge overnight and worse in the afternoon when i have been tempted in the morning  somerset looked at the youth and said i fear i shall have to dispense with your services dare for i think you have been tempted today  on my honour no my manner is a little against me mr somerset but you need not fear for my ability to do your work i am a young man wasted and am thought of slight account it is the true men who get snubbed while traitors are allowed to thrive  hang sentiment dare and off with you a little ruffled somerset had turned his back upon the interesting speaker so that he did not observe the sly twist dare threw into his right eye as he spoke the latter went off in one direction and somerset in the other pursuing his pensive way towards markton with thoughts not difficult to divine  from one point in her nature he went to another till he again recurred to her romantic interest in the de stancy family to wish she was one of them how very inconsistent of her that she really did wish it was unquestionable    xv  it was the day of the gardenparty the weather was too cloudy to be called perfect but it was as sultry as the most thinlyclad young lady could desire great trouble had been taken by paula to bring the lawn to a fit condition after the neglect of recent years and somerset had suggested the design for the tents as he approached the precincts of the castle he discerned a flag of newest fabric floating over the keep and soon his fly fell in with the stream of carriages that were passing over the bridge into the outer ward  mrs goodman and paula were receiving the people in the drawingroom somerset came forward in his turn but as he was immediately followed by others there was not much opportunity even had she felt the wish for any special mark of feeling in the younger ladys greeting of him  he went on through a canvas passage lined on each side with flowering plants till he reached the tents thence after nodding to one or two guests slightly known to him he proceeded to the grounds with a sense of being rather lonely few visitors had as yet got so far in and as he walked up and down a shady alley his mind dwelt upon the new aspect under which paula had greeted his eyes that afternoon her blackandwhite costume had finally disappeared and in its place she had adopted a picturesque dress of ivory white with satin enrichments of the same hue while upon her bosom she wore a blue flower her days of infestivity were plainly ended and her days of gladness were to begin  his reverie was interrupted by the sound of his name and looking round he beheld havill who appeared to be as much alone as himself  somerset already knew that havill had been appointed to compete with him according to his recommendation in measuring a dark corner a day or two before he had stumbled upon havill engaged in the same pursuit with a view to the rival design afterwards he had seen him receiving paulas instructions precisely as he had done himself it was as he had wished for fairness sake and yet he felt a regret for he was less paulas own architect now  well mr somerset said havill since we first met an unexpected rivalry has arisen between us but i dare say we shall survive the contest as it is not one arising out of love hahaha he spoke in a level voice of fierce pleasantry and uncovered his regular white teeth  somerset supposed him to allude to the castle competition  yes said havill her proposed undertaking brought out some adverse criticism till it was known that she intended to have more than one architectural opinion an excellent stroke of hers to disarm criticism you saw the second letter in the morning papers  no said the other  the writer states that he has discovered that the competent advice of two architects is to be taken and withdraws his accusations  somerset said nothing for a minute have you been supplied with the necessary data for your drawings he asked showing by the question the track his thoughts had taken  havill said that he had but possibly not so completely as you have he added again smiling fiercely somerset did not quite like the insinuation and the two speakers parted the younger going towards the musicians who had now begun to fill the air with their strains from the embowered enclosure of a drooping ash when he got back to the marquees they were quite crowded and the guests began to pour out upon the grass the toilets of the ladies presenting a brilliant spectaclehere being coloured dresses with white devices there white dresses with coloured devices and yonder transparent dresses with no device at all a lavender haze hung in the air the trees were as still as those of a submarine forest while the sun in colour like a brass plaque had a hairy outline in the livid sky  after watching awhile some young people who were so madly devoted to lawntennis that they set about it like daylabourers at the moment of their arrival he turned and saw approaching a graceful figure in creamcoloured hues whose gloves lost themselves beneath her lace ruffles even when she lifted her hand to make firm the blue flower at her breast and whose hair hung under her hat in great knots so well compacted that the sun gilded the convexity of each knot like a ball  you seem to be alone said paula who had at last escaped from the duty of receiving guests  i dont know many people  yes i thought of that while i was in the drawingroom but i could not get out before i am now no longer a responsible being mrs goodman is mistress for the remainder of the day will you be introduced to anybody whom would you like to know  i am not particularly unhappy in my solitude  but you must be made to know a few  very welli submit readily  she looked away from him and while he was observing upon her cheek the moving shadow of leaves cast by the declining sun she said o there is my aunt and beckoned with her parasol to that lady who approached in the comparatively youthful guise of a grey silk dress that whistled at every touch  paula left them together and mrs goodman then made him acquainted with a few of the best people describing what they were in a whisper before they came up among them being the radical member for markton who had succeeded to the seat rendered vacant by the death of paulas father while talking to this gentleman on the proposed enlargement of the castle somerset raised his eyes and hand towards the walls the better to point out his meaning in so doing he saw a face in the square of darkness formed by one of the open windows the effect being that of a highlight portrait by vandyck or rembrandt  it was his assistant dare leaning on the windowsill of the studio as he smoked his cigarette and surveyed the gay groups promenading beneath  after holding a chattering conversation with some ladies from a neighbouring country seat who had known his father in bygone years and handing them ices and strawberries till they were satisfied he found an opportunity of leaving the grounds wishing to learn what progress dare had made in the survey of the castle  dare was still in the studio when he entered somerset informed the youth that there was no necessity for his working later that day unless to please himself and proceeded to inspect dares achievements thus far to his vexation dare had not plotted three dimensions during the previous two days this was not the first time that dare either from incompetence or indolence had shown his inutility as a housesurveyor and draughtsman  mr dare said somerset i fear you dont suit me well enough to make it necessary that you should stay after this week  dare removed the cigarette from his lips and bowed if i dont suit the sooner i go the better why wait the week he said  well thats as you like  somerset drew the inkstand towards him wrote out a cheque for dares services and handed it across the table  ill not trouble you tomorrow said dare seeing that the payment included the week in advance  very well replied somerset please lock the door when you leave shaking hands with dare and wishing him well he left the room and descended to the lawn below  there he contrived to get near miss power again and inquired of her for miss de stancy  o did you not know said paula her father is unwell and she preferred staying with him this afternoon  i hoped he might have been here  o no he never comes out of his house to any party of this sort it excites him and he must not be excited  poor sir william muttered somerset  no said paula he is grand and historical  that is hardly an orthodox notion for a puritan said somerset mischievously  i am not a puritan insisted paula  the day turned to dusk and the guests began going in relays to the dininghall when somerset had taken in two or three ladies to whom he had been presented and attended to their wants which occupied him threequarters of an hour he returned again to the large tent with a view to finding paula and taking his leave it was now brilliantly lighted up and the musicians who during daylight had been invisible behind the ashtree were ensconced at one end with their harps and violins it reminded him that there was to be dancing the tent had in the meantime half filled with a new set of young people who had come expressly for that pastime behind the girls gathered numbers of newly arrived young men with low shoulders and diminutive moustaches who were evidently prepared for once to sacrifice themselves as partners  somerset felt something of a thrill at the sight he was an infrequent dancer and particularly unprepared for dancing at present but to dance once with paula power he would give a year of his life he looked round but she was nowhere to be seen the first set began old and middleaged people gathered from the different rooms to look on at the gyrations of their children but paula did not appear when another dance or two had progressed and an increase in the average age of the dancers was making itself perceptible especially on the masculine side somerset was aroused by a whisper at his elbow  you dance i think miss deverell is disengaged she has not been asked once this evening the speaker was paula  somerset looked at miss deverella sallow lady with black twinkling eyes yellow costume and gay laugh who had been there all the afternoonand said something about having thought of going home  is that because i asked you to dance she murmured thereshe is appropriated a young gentleman had at that moment approached the uninviting miss deverell claimed her hand and led her off  thats right said somerset i ought to leave room for younger men  you need not say so that baldheaded gentleman is fortyfive he does not think of younger men  have you a dance to spare for me  her face grew stealthily redder in the candlelight oi have no engagement at alli have refused i hardly feel at liberty to dance it would be as well to leave that to my visitors  why  my father though he allowed me to be taught never liked the idea of my dancing  did he make you promise anything on the point  he said he was not in favour of such amusementsno more  i think you are not bound by that on an informal occasion like the present  she was silent  you will just once said he  another silence if you like she venturesomely answered at last  somerset closed the hand which was hanging by his side and somehow hers was in it the dance was nearly formed and he led her forward several persons looked at them significantly but he did not notice it then and plunged into the maze  never had mr somerset passed through such an experience before had he not felt her actual weight and warmth he might have fancied the whole episode a figment of the imagination it seemed as if those musicians had thrown a double sweetness into their notes on seeing the mistress of the castle in the dance that a perfumed southern atmosphere had begun to pervade the marquee and that human beings were shaking themselves free of all inconvenient gravitation  somersets feelings burst from his lips this is the happiest moment i have ever known he said do you know why  i think i saw a flash of lightning through the opening of the tent said paula with roguish abruptness  he did not press for an answer within a few minutes a long growl of thunder was heard it was as if jove could not refrain from testifying his jealousy of somerset for taking this covetable woman so presumptuously in his arms  the dance was over and he had retired with paula to the back of the tent when another faint flash of lightning was visible through an opening she lifted the canvas and looked out somerset looking out behind her another dance was begun and being on this account left out of notice somerset did not hasten to leave paulas side  i think they begin to feel the heat she said  a little ventilation would do no harm he flung back the tent door where he stood and the light shone out upon the grass  i must go to the drawingroom soon she added they will begin to leave shortly  it is not late the thundercloud has made it seem darksee there a line of pale yellow stretches along the horizon from west to north thats eveningnot gone yet shall we go into the fresh air for a minute  she seemed to signify assent and he stepped off the tentfloor upon the ground she stepped off also  the air outofdoors had not cooled and without definitely choosing a direction they found themselves approaching a little wooden teahouse that stood on the lawn a few yards off arrived here they turned and regarded the tent they had just left and listened to the strains that came from within it  i feel more at ease now said paula  so do i said somerset  i mean she added in an undeceiving tone because i saw mrs goodman enter the tent again just as we came out here so i have no further responsibility  i meant something quite different try to guess what  she teasingly demurred finally breaking the silence by saying the rain is come at last as great drops began to fall upon the ground with a smack like pellets of clay  in a moment the storm poured down with sudden violence and they drew further back into the summerhouse the side of the tent from which they had emerged still remained open the rain streaming down between their eyes and the lighted interior of the marquee like a tissue of glass threads the brilliant forms of the dancers passing and repassing behind the watery screen as if they were people in an enchanted submarine palace  how happy they are said paula they dont even know that it is raining i am so glad that my aunt had the tent lined otherwise such a downpour would have gone clean through it  the thunderstorm showed no symptoms of abatement and the music and dancing went on more merrily than ever  we cannot go in said somerset and we cannot shout for umbrellas we will stay till it is over will we not  yes she said if you care to ah  what is it  only a big drop came upon my head  let us stand further in  her hand was hanging by her side and somersets was close by he took it and she did not draw it away thus they stood a long while the rain hissing down upon the grassplot and not a soul being visible outside the dancingtent save themselves  may i call you paula asked he  there was no answer  may i he repeated  yes occasionally she murmured  dear paulamay i call you that  o nonot yet  but you know i love you  yes she whispered  and shall i love you always  if you wish to  and will you love me  paula did not reply  will you paula he repeated  you may love me  but dont you love me in return  i love you to love me  wont you say anything more explicit  i would rather not  somerset emitted half a sigh he wished she had been more demonstrative yet felt that this passive way of assenting was as much as he could hope for had there been anything cold in her passivity he might have felt repressed but her stillness suggested the stillness of motion imperceptible from its intensity  we must go in said she the rain is almost over and there is no longer any excuse for this  somerset bent his lips toward hers no said the fair puritan decisively  why not he asked  nobody ever has  but expostulated somerset  to everything there is a season and the season for this is not just now she answered walking away  they crossed the wet and glistening lawn stepped under the tent and parted she vanished he did not know whither and standing with his gaze fixed on the dancers the young man waited till being in no mood to join them he went slowly through the artificial passage lined with flowers and entered the drawing room mrs goodman was there bidding goodnight to the early goers and paula was just behind her apparently in her usual mood his parting with her was quite formal but that he did not mind for her colour rose decidedly higher as he approached and the light in her eyes was like the ray of a diamond  when he reached the door he found that his brougham from the quantock arms which had been waiting more than an hour could not be heard of that vagrancy of spirit which love induces would not permit him to wait and leaving word that the man was to follow him when he returned he went past the glare of carriagelamps ranked in the ward and under the outer arch the night was now clear and beautiful and he strolled along his way full of mysterious elation till the vehicle overtook him and he got in  up to this point somersets progress in his suit had been though incomplete so uninterrupted that he almost feared the good chance he enjoyed how should it be in a mortal of his calibre to command success with such a sweet woman for long he might indeed turn out to be one of the singular exceptions which are said to prove rules but when fortune means to men most good observes the bard she looks upon them with a threatening eye somerset would even have been content that a little disapproval of his course should have occurred in some quarter so as to make his wooing more like ordinary life but paula was not clearly won and that was drawback sufficient in these pleasing agonies and painful delights he passed the journey to markton     book the second dare and havill   i  young dare sat thoughtfully at the window of the studio in which somerset had left him till the gay scene beneath became embrowned by the twilight and the brilliant red stripes of the marquees the bright sunshades the manytinted costumes of the ladies were indistinguishable from the blacks and greys of the masculine contingent moving among them he had occasionally glanced away from the outward prospect to study a small old volume that lay before him on the drawingboard near scrutiny revealed the book to bear the title moivres doctrine of chances  the evening had been so still that dare had heard conversations from below with a clearness unsuspected by the speakers themselves and among the dialogues which thus reached his ears was that between somerset and havill on their professional rivalry when they parted and somerset had mingled with the throng havill went to a seat at a distance afterwards he rose and walked away but on the bench he had quitted there remained a small object resembling a book or leather case  dare put away the drawingboard and plottingscales which he had kept before him during the evening as a reason for his presence at that post of espial locked up the door and went downstairs notwithstanding his dismissal by somerset he was so serene in countenance and easy in gait as to make it a fair conjecture that professional servitude however profitable was no necessity with him the gloom now rendered it practicable for any unbidden guest to join paulas assemblage without criticism and dare walked boldly out upon the lawn the crowd on the grass was rapidly diminishing the tennisplayers had relinquished sport many people had gone in to dinner or supper and many others attracted by the cheerful radiance of the candles were gathering in the large tent that had been lighted up for dancing  dare went to the gardenchair on which havill had been seated and found the article left behind to be a pocketbook whether because it was unclasped and fell open in his hand or otherwise he did not hesitate to examine the contents among a mass of architects customary memoranda occurred a draft of the letter abusing paula as an iconoclast or vandal by blood which had appeared in the newspaper the draft was so interlined and altered as to bear evidence of being the original conception of that ungentlemanly attack  the lad read the letter smiled and strolled about the grounds only met by an occasional pair of individuals of opposite sex in deep conversation the state of whose emotions led them to prefer the evening shade to the publicity and glare of the tents and rooms at last he observed the white waistcoat of the man he sought  mr havill the architect i believe said dare the author of most of the noteworthy buildings in this neighbourhood  havill assented blandly  i have long wished for the pleasure of your acquaintance and now an accident helps me to make it this pocketbook i think is yours  havill clapped his hand to his pocket examined the book dare held out to him and took it with thanks i see i am speaking to the artist archaeologist gothic photographermr dare  professor dare  professor pardon me i should not have guessed itso young as you are  well it is merely ornamental and in truth i drop the title in england particularly under present circumstances  ahthey are peculiar perhaps ah i remember i have heard that you are assisting a gentleman in preparing a design in opposition to minea design  that he is not competent to prepare himself you were perhaps going to add  not precisely that  you could hardly be blamed for such words however you are mistaken i did assist him to gain a little further insight into the working of architectural plans but our views on art are antagonistic and i assist him no more mr havill it must be very provoking to a wellestablished professional man to have a rival sprung at him in a grand undertaking which he had a right to expect as his own  professional sympathy is often accepted from those whose condolence on any domestic matter would be considered intrusive havill walked up and down beside dare for a few moments in silence and at last showed that the words had told by saying every one may have his opinion had i been a stranger to the power family the case would have been different but having been specially elected by the ladys father as a competent adviser in such matters and then to be degraded to the position of a mere competitor it wounds me to the quick  both in purse and in person like the illused hostess of the garter  a lady to whom i have been a staunch friend continued havill not heeding the interruption  at that moment sounds seemed to come from dare which bore a remarkable resemblance to the words ho ho havill it was hardly credible and yet could he be mistaken havill turned dares eye was twisted comically upward  what does that mean said havill coldly and with some amazement  ho ho havill staunch friend is goodespecially after an iconoclast and vandal by bloodmonstrosity in the form of a greek temple and so on eh  sir you have the advantage of me perhaps you allude to that anonymous letter  oho havill repeated the boyman turning his eyes yet further towards the zenith to an outsider such conduct would be natural but to a friend who finds your pocketbook and looks into it before returning it and kindly removes a leaf bearing the draft of a letter which might injure you if discovered there and carefully conceals it in his own pocketwhy such conduct is unkind dare held up the abstracted leaf  havill trembled i can explain he began  it is not necessary we are friends said dare assuringly  havill looked as if he would like to snatch the leaf away but altering his mind he said grimly well i take you at your word we are friends that letter was concocted before i knew of the competition it was during my first disgust when i believed myself entirely supplanted  i am not in the least surprised but if she knew you to be the writer  i should be ruined as far as this competition is concerned said havill carelessly had i known i was to be invited to compete i should not have written it of course to be supplanted is hard and thereby hangs a tale  another tale you astonish me  then you have not heard the scandal though everybody is talking about it  a scandal implies indecorum  well tis indecorous her infatuated partiality for him is patent to the eyes of a child a man she has only known a few weeks and one who obtained admission to her house in the most irregular manner had she a watchful friend beside her instead of that moonstruck mrs goodman she would be cautioned against bestowing her favours on the first adventurer who appears at her door it is a pity a great pity  o there is lovemaking in the wind said dare slowly that alters the case for me but it is not proved  it can easily be proved  i wish it were or disproved  you have only to come this way to clear up all doubts  havill took the lad towards the tent from which the strains of a waltz now proceeded and on whose sides flitting shadows told of the progress of the dance the companions looked in the rosy silk lining of the marquee and the numerous coronas of wax lights formed a canopy to a radiant scene which for two at least of those who composed it was an intoxicating one paula and somerset were dancing together  that proves nothing said dare  look at their rapt faces and say if it does not sneered havill  dare objected to a judgment based on looks alone  very welltime will show said the architect dropping the tentcurtain good god a girl worth fifty thousand and more a year to throw herself away upon a fellow like thatshe ought to be whipped  time must not show said dare  you speak with emphasis  i have reason i would give something to be sure on this point one way or the other let us wait till the dance is over and observe them more carefully horensagen ist halb gelogen hearsay is half lies  sheetlightnings increased in the northern sky followed by thunder like the indistinct noise of a battle havill and dare retired to the trees when the dance ended somerset and his partner emerged from the tent and slowly moved towards the teahouse divining their goal dare seized havills arm and the two worthies entered the building unseen by first passing round behind it they seated themselves in the back part of the interior where darkness prevailed  as before related paula and somerset came and stood within the door when the rain increased they drew themselves further inward their forms being distinctly outlined to the gaze of those lurking behind by the light from the tent beyond but the hiss of the falling rain and the lowness of their tones prevented their words from being heard  i wish myself out of this breathed havill to dare as he buttoned his coat over his white waistcoat i told you it was true but you wouldnt believe i wouldnt she should catch me here eavesdropping for the world  courage man friday said his cooler comrade  paula and her lover backed yet further till the hem of her skirt touched havills feet their attitudes were sufficient to prove their relations to the most obstinate didymus who should have witnessed them tender emotions seemed to pervade the summerhouse like an aroma the calm ecstasy of the condition of at least one of them was not without a coercive effect upon the two invidious spectators so that they must need have remained passive had they come there to disturb or annoy the serenity of paula was even more impressive than the hushed ardour of somerset she did not satisfy curiosity as somerset satisfied it she piqued it poor somerset had reached a perfectly intelligible depthone which had a single blissful way out of it and nine calamitous ones but paula remained an enigma all through the scene  the rain ceased and the pair moved away the enchantment worked by their presence vanished the details of the meeting settled down in the watchers minds and their tongues were loosened dare turning to havill said thank you you have done me a timely turn today  what had you hopes that way asked havill satirically  i the woman that interests my heart has yet to be born said dare with a steely coldness strange in such a juvenile and yet almost convincing but though i have not personal hopes i have an objection to this courtship now i think we may as well fraternize the situation being what it is  what is the situation  he is in your way as her architect he is in my way as her lover we dont want to hurt him but we wish him clean out of the neighbourhood  ill go as far as that said havill  i have come here at some trouble to myself merely to observe i find i ought to stay to act  if you were myself a married man with people dependent on him who has had a professional certainty turned to a miserably remote contingency by these events you might say you ought to act but what conceivable difference it can make to you who it is the young lady takes to her heart and home i fail to understand  well ill tell youthis much at least i want to keep the place vacant for another man  the place  the place of husband to miss power and proprietor of that castle and domain  thats a scheme with a vengeance who is the man  it is my secret at present  certainly havill drew a deep breath and dropped into a tone of depression well scheme as you will there will be small advantage to me he murmured the castle commission is as good as gone and a bill for two hundred pounds falls due next week  cheer up heart my position if you only knew it has ten times the difficulties of yours since this disagreeable discovery let us consider if we can assist each other the competition drawings are to be sent inwhen  in something over six weeksa fortnight before she returns from the scilly isles for which place she leaves here in a few days  o she goes awaythats better our lover will be working here at his drawings and she not present  exactly perhaps she is a little ashamed of the intimacy  and if your design is considered best by the committee he will have no further reason for staying assuming that they are not definitely engaged to marry by that time  i suppose so murmured havill discontentedly the conditions as sent to me state that the designs are to be adjudicated on by three members of the institute called in for the purpose so that she may return and have seemed to show no favour  then it amounts to this your design must be best it must combine the excellences of your invention with the excellences of his meanwhile a coolness should be made to arise between her and him and as there would be no artistic reason for his presence here after the verdict is pronounced he would perforce hie back to town do you see  i see the ingenuity of the plan but i also see two insurmountable obstacles to it the first is i cannot add the excellences of his design to mine without knowing what those excellences are which he will of course keep a secret second it will not be easy to promote a coolness between such hot ones as they  you make a mistake it is only he who is so ardent she is only lukewarm if we had any spirit a bargain would be struck between us you would appropriate his design i should cause the coolness  how could i appropriate his design  by copying it i suppose  copying it  by going into his studio and looking it over  havill turned to dare and stared by george you dont stick at trifles young man you dont suppose i would go into a mans rooms and steal his inventions like that  i scarcely suppose you would said dare indifferently as he rose  and if i were to said havill curiously how is the coolness to be caused  by the second man  who is to produce him  her majestys government  havill looked meditatively at his companion and shook his head in these idle suppositions we have been assuming conduct which would be quite against my principles as an honest man    ii  a few days after the party at stancy castle dare was walking down the high street of markton a cigarette between his lips and a silvertopped cane in his hand his eye fell upon a brass plate on an opposite door bearing the name of mr havill architect he crossed over and rang the office bell  the clerk who admitted him stated that mr havill was in his private room and would be disengaged in a short time while dare waited the clerk affixed to the door a piece of paper bearing the words back at 2 and went away to his dinner leaving dare in the room alone  dare looked at the different drawings on the boards about the room they all represented one subject which though unfinished as yet and bearing no inscription was recognized by the visitor as the design for the enlargement and restoration of stancy castle when he had glanced it over dare sat down  the doors between the office and private room were double but the one towards the office being only ajar dare could hear a conversation in progress within it presently rose to an altercation the tenor of which was obvious somebody had come for money  really i can stand it no longer mr havillreally i will not said the creditor excitedly now this bill overdue againwhat can you expect why i might have negotiated it and where would you have been then instead of that i have locked it up out of consideration for you and what do i get for my considerateness i shall let the law take its course  youll do me inexpressible harm and get nothing whatever said havill if you would renew for another three months there would be no difficulty in the matter  you have said so before i will do no such thing  there was a silence whereupon dare arose without hesitation and walked boldly into the private office havill was standing at one end as gloomy as a thundercloud and at the other was the unfortunate creditor with his hat on though dares entry surprised them both parties seemed relieved  i have called in passing to congratulate you mr havill said dare gaily such a commission as has been entrusted to you will make you famous  how do you doi wish it would make me rich said havill drily  it will be a lift in that direction from what i know of the profession what is she going to spend  a hundred thousand  your commission as architect five thousand not bad for making a few sketches consider what other great commissions such a work will lead to  what great work is this asked the creditor  stancy castle said dare since havill seemed too agape to answer you have not heard of it then those are the drawings i presume in the next room  havill replied in the affirmative beginning to perceive the manoeuvre perhaps you would like to see them he said to the creditor  the latter offered no objection and all three went into the drawingoffice  it will certainly be a magnificent structure said the creditor after regarding the elevations through his spectacles stancy castle i had no idea of it and when do you begin to build mr havill he inquired in mollified tones  in three months i think said dare looking to havill  havill assented  five thousand pounds commission murmured the creditor paid down i suppose  havill nodded  and the works will not linger for lack of money to carry them out i imagine said dare two hundred thousand will probably be spent before the work is finished  there is not much doubt of it said havill  you said nothing to me about this whispered the creditor to havill taking him aside with a look of regret  you would not listen  it alters the case greatly the creditor retired with havill to the door and after a subdued colloquy in the passage he went away havill returning to the office  what the devil do you mean by hoaxing him like this when the job is no more mine than inigo joness  dont be too curious said dare laughing rather thank me for getting rid of him  but it is all a vision said havill ruefully regarding the pencilled towers of stancy castle if the competition were really the commission that you have represented it to be there might be something to laugh at  it must be made a commission somehow returned dare carelessly i am come to lend you a little assistance i must stay in the neighbourhood and i have nothing else to do  a carriage slowly passed the window and havill recognized the power liveries hulloshes coming here he said under his breath as the carriage stopped by the kerb what does she want i wonder dare does she know you  i would just as soon be out of the way  then go into the garden  dare went out through the back office as paula was shown in at the front she wore a grey travelling costume and seemed to be in some haste  i am on my way to the railwaystation she said to havill i shall be absent from home for several weeks and since you requested it i have called to inquire how you are getting on with the design  please look it over said havill placing a seat for her  no said paula i think it would be unfair i have not looked at mrthe other architects plans since he has begun to design seriously and i will not look at yours are you getting on quite well and do you want to know anything more if so go to the castle and get anybody to assist you why would you not make use of the room at your disposal in the castle as the other architect has done  in asking the question her face was towards the window and suddenly her cheeks became a rosy red she instantly looked another way  having my own office so near it was not necessary thank you replied havill as noting her countenance he allowed his glance to stray into the street somerset was walking past on the opposite side  the time isthe time fixed for sending in the drawings is the first of november i believe she said confusedly and the decision will be come to by three gentlemen who are prominent members of the institute of architects  havill then accompanied her to the carriage and she drove away  havill went to the back window to tell dare that he need not stay in the garden but the garden was empty the architect remained alone in his office for some time at the end of a quarter of an hour when the scream of a railway whistle had echoed down the still street he beheld somerset repassing the window in a direction from the railway with somewhat of a sad gait in another minute dare entered humming the latest air of offenbach  tis a mere piece of duplicity said havill  what is  her pretending indifference as to which of us comes out successful in the competition when she colours carmine the moment somerset passes by he described paulas visit and the incident  it may not mean cupids entire xxx after all said dare judicially the mere suspicion that a certain man loves her would make a girl blush at his unexpected appearance well shes gone from him for a time the better for you  he has been privileged to see her off at any rate  not privileged  how do you know that  i went out of your garden by the back gate and followed her carriage to the railway he simply went to the first bridge outside the station and waited when she was in the train it moved forward he was all expectation and drew out his handkerchief ready to wave while she looked out of the window towards the bridge the train backed before it reached the bridge to attach the box containing her horses and the carriagetruck then it started for good and when it reached the bridge she looked out again he waving his handkerchief to her  and she waving hers back  no she didnt  ah  she looked at himnothing more i wouldnt give much for his chance after a while dare added musingly you are a mathematician did you ever investigate the doctrine of expectations  never  dare drew from his pocket his book of chances a volume as well thumbed as the ministers bible this is a treatise on the subject he said i will teach it to you some day    the same evening havill asked dare to dine with him he was just at this time living en garcon his wife and children being away on a visit after dinner they sat on till their faces were rather flushed the talk turned as before on the castlecompetition  to know his design is to win said dare and to win is to send him back to london where he came from  havill inquired if dare had seen any sketch of the design while with somerset  not a line i was concerned only with the old building  not to know it is to lose undoubtedly murmured havill  suppose we go for a walk that way instead of consulting here  they went down the town and along the highway when they reached the entrance to the park a man driving a basketcarriage came out from the gate and passed them by in the gloom  that was he said dare he sometimes drives over from the hotel and sometimes walks he has been working late this evening  strolling on under the trees they met three masculine figures laughing and talking loudly  those are the three firstclass london draughtsmen bowles knowles and cockton whom he has engaged to assist him regardless of expense continued dare  o lord groaned havill theres no chance for me  the castle now arose before them endowed by the rayless shade with a more massive majesty than either sunlight or moonlight could impart and havill sighed again as he thought of what he was losing by somersets rivalry well what was the use of coming here he asked  i thought it might suggest somethingsome way of seeing the design the servants would let us into his room i dare say  i dont care to ask let us walk through the wards and then homeward  they sauntered on smoking dare leading the way through the gatehouse into a corridor which was not inclosed a lamp hanging at the further end  we are getting into the inhabited part i think said havill  dare however had gone on and knowing the tortuous passages from his few days experience in measuring them with somerset he came to the butlers pantry dare knocked and nobody answering he entered took down a key which hung behind the door and rejoined havill it is all right he said the cats away and the mice are at play in consequence  proceeding up a stone staircase he unlocked the door of a room in the dark struck a light inside and returning to the door called in a whisper to havill who had remained behind this is mr somersets studio he said  how did you get permission inquired havill not knowing that dare had seen no one  anyhow said dare carelessly we can examine the plans at leisure for if the placid mrs goodman who is the only one at home sees the light she will only think it is somerset still at work  dare uncovered the drawings and young somersets brainwork for the last six weeks lay under their eyes to dare who was too cursory to trouble himself by entering into such details it had very little meaning but the design shone into havills head like a light into a dark place it was original and it was fascinating its originality lay partly in the circumstance that somerset had not attempted to adapt an old building to the wants of the new civilization he had placed his new erection beside it as a slightly attached structure harmonizing with the old heightening and beautifying rather than subduing it his work formed a palace with a ruinous castle annexed as a curiosity to havill the conception had more charm than it could have to the most appreciative outsider for when a mediocre and jealous mind that has been cudgelling itself over a problem capable of many solutions lights on the solution of a rival all possibilities in that kind seem to merge in the one beheld  dare was struck by the arrested expression of the architects face is it rather good he asked  yes rather said havill subduing himself  more than rather  yes the clever devil exclaimed havill unable to depreciate longer  how  the riddle that has worried me three weeks he has solved in a way which is simplicity itself he has got it and i am undone  nonsense dont give way lets make a tracing  the groundplan will be sufficient said havill his courage reviving the idea is so simple that if once seen it is not easily forgotten  a rough tracing of somersets design was quickly made and blowing out the candle with a wave of his hand the younger gentleman locked the door and they went downstairs again  i should never have thought of it said havill as they walked homeward  one man has need of another every ten years ogni dieci anni un uomo ha bisogno dell altro as they say in italy youll help me for this turn if i have need of you  i shall never have the power  o yes you will a man who can contrive to get admitted to a competition by writing a letter abusing another man has any amount of power the stroke was a good one  havill was silent till he said i think these gusts mean that we are to have a storm of rain  dare looked up the sky was overcast the trees shivered and a drop or two began to strike into the walkers coats from the east they were not far from the inn at sleepinggreen where dare had lodgings occupying the rooms which had been used by somerset till he gave them up for more commodious chambers at markton and they decided to turn in there till the rain should be over  having possessed himself of somersets brains havill was inclined to be jovial and ordered the best in wines that the house afforded before starting from home they had drunk as much as was good for them so that their potations here soon began to have a marked effect upon their tongues the rain beat upon the windows with a dull dogged pertinacity which seemed to signify boundless reserves of the same and long continuance the wind rose the sign creaked and the candles waved the weather had in truth broken up for the season and this was the first night of the change  well here we are said havill as he poured out another glass of the brandied liquor called old port at sleepinggreen and it seems that here we are to remain for the present  i am at home anywhere cried the lad whose brow was hot and eye wild  havill who had not drunk enough to affect his reasoning held up his glass to the light and said i never can quite make out what you are or what your age is are you sixteen oneandtwenty or twentyseven and are you an englishman frenchman indian american or what you seem not to have taken your degrees in these parts  thats a secret my friend said dare i am a citizen of the world i owe no country patriotism and no king or queen obedience a man whose country has no boundary is your only true gentleman  well where were you bornsomewhere i suppose  it would be a fact worth the telling the secret of my birth lies here and dare slapped his breast with his right hand  literally just under your shirtfront or figuratively in your heart asked havill  literally there it is necessary that it should be recorded for ones own memory is a treacherous book of reference should verification be required at a time of delirium disease or death  havill asked no further what he meant and went to the door finding that the rain still continued he returned to dare who was by this time sinking down in a onesided attitude as if hung up by the shoulder informing his companion that he was but little inclined to move far in such a tempestuous night he decided to remain in the inn till next morning on calling in the landlord however they learnt that the house was full of farmers on their way home from a large sheepfair in the neighbourhood and that several of these having decided to stay on account of the same tempestuous weather had already engaged the spare beds if mr dare would give up his room and share a doublebedded room with mr havill the thing could be done but not otherwise  to this the two companions agreed and presently went upstairs with as gentlemanly a walk and vertical a candle as they could exhibit under the circumstances  the other inmates of the inn soon retired to rest and the storm raged on unheeded by all local humanity    iii  at two oclock the rain lessened its fury at halfpast two the obscured moon shone forth and at three havill awoke the blind had not been pulled down overnight and the moonlight streamed into the room across the bed whereon dare was sleeping he lay on his back his arms thrown out and his wellcurved youthful form looked like an unpedestaled dionysus in the colourless lunar rays  sleep had cleared havills mind from the drowsing effects of the last nights sitting and he thought of dares mysterious manner in speaking of himself this lad resembled the etruscan youth tages in one respect that of being a boy with seemingly the wisdom of a sage and the effect of his presence was now heightened by all those sinister and mystic attributes which are lent by nocturnal environment he who in broad daylight might be but a young chevalier dindustrie was now an unlimited possibility in social phenomena havill remembered how the lad had pointed to his breast and said that his secret was literally kept there the architect was too much of a provincial to have quenched the common curiosity that was part of his nature by the acquired metropolitan indifference to other peoples lives which in essence more unworthy even than the former causes less practical inconvenience in its exercise  dare was breathing profoundly instigated as above mentioned havill got out of bed and stood beside the sleeper after a moments pause he gently pulled back the unfastened collar of dares nightshirt and saw a word tattooed in distinct characters on his breast before there was time for havill to decipher it dare moved slightly as if conscious of disturbance and havill hastened back to bed dare bestirred himself yet more whereupon havill breathed heavily though keeping an intent glance on the lad through his halfclosed eyes to learn if he had been aware of the investigation  dare was certainly conscious of something for he sat up rubbed his eyes and gazed around the room then after a few moments of reflection he drew some article from beneath his pillow a blue gleam shone from the object as dare held it in the moonlight and havill perceived that it was a small revolver  a clammy dew broke out upon the face and body of the architect when stepping out of bed with the weapon in his hand dare looked under the bed behind the curtains out of the window and into a closet as if convinced that something had occurred but in doubt as to what it was he then came across to where havill was lying and still keeping up the appearance of sleep watching him awhile and mistrusting the reality of this semblance dare brought it to the test by holding the revolver within a few inches of havills forehead  havill could stand no more crystallized with terror he said without however moving more than his lips in dread of hasty action on the part of dare o good lord dare dare i have done nothing  the youth smiled and lowered the pistol i was only finding out whether it was you or some burglar who had been playing tricks upon me i find it was you  do put away that thing it is too ghastly to produce in a respectable bedroom why do you carry it  cosmopolites always do now answer my questions what were you up to and dare as he spoke played with the pistol again  havill had recovered some coolness you could not use it upon me he said sardonically watching dare it would be risking your neck for too little an object  i did not think you were shrewd enough to see that replied dare carelessly as he returned the revolver to its place well whether you have outwitted me or no you will keep the secret as long as i choose  why said havill  because i keep your secret of the letter abusing miss p and of the pilfered tracing you carry in your pocket  it is quite true said havill  they went to bed again dare was soon asleep but havill did not attempt to disturb him again the elder man slept but fitfully he was aroused in the morning by a heavy rumbling and jingling along the highway overlooked by the window the front wall of the house being shaken by the reverberation  there is no rest for me here he said rising and going to the window carefully avoiding the neighbourhood of mr dare when havill had glanced out he returned to dress himself  whats that noise said dare awakened by the same rumble  it is the artillery going away  from where  markton barracks  hurrah said dare jumping up in bed i have been waiting for that these six weeks  havill did not ask questions as to the meaning of this unexpected remark  when they were downstairs dares first act was to ring the bell and ask if his army and navy gazette had arrived  while the servant was gone havill cleared his throat and said i am an architect and i take in the architect you are an architect and you take in the army and navy gazette  i am not an architect any more than i am a soldier but i have taken in the army and navy gazette these many weeks  when they were at breakfast the paper came in dare hastily tore it open and glanced at the pages  i am going to markton after breakfast he said suddenly before looking up we will walk together if you like  they walked together as planned and entered markton about ten oclock  i have just to make a call here said dare when they were opposite the barrackentrance on the outskirts of the town where wheeltracks and a regular chain of hoofmarks left by the departed batteries were imprinted in the gravel between the open gates i shall not be a moment havill stood still while his companion entered and asked the commissary in charge or somebody representing him when the new batteries would arrive to take the place of those which had gone away he was informed that it would be about noon  now i am at your service said dare and will help you to rearrange your design by the new intellectual light we have acquired  they entered havills office and set to work when contrasted with the tracing from somersets plan havills design which was not far advanced revealed all its weaknesses to him after seeing somersets scheme the bands of havills imagination were loosened he laid his own previous efforts aside got fresh sheets of drawingpaper and drew with vigour  i may as well stay and help you said dare i have nothing to do till twelve oclock and not much then  so there he remained at a quarter to twelve children and idlers began to gather against the railings of havills house a few minutes past twelve the noise of an arriving host was heard at the entrance to the town thereupon dare and havill went to the window  the x and y batteries of the z brigade royal horse artillery were entering markton each headed by the major with his bugler behind him in a moment they came abreast and passed every man in his place that is to say  six shining horses in pairs harnessed by ropetraces white as milk with a driver on each near horse two gunners on the leadcoloured stoutwheeled limber their carcases jolted to a jelly for lack of springs two gunners on the leadcoloured stoutwheeled guncarriage in the same personal condition the ninepounder gun dipping its heavy head to earth as if ashamed of its office in these enlightened times the complement of jingling and prancing troopers riding at the wheels and elsewhere six shining horses with their drivers and traces white as milk as before two more gallant jolted men on another jolting limber and more stout wheels and leadcoloured paint two more jolted men on another drooping gun more jingling troopers on horseback again six shining draughthorses traces drivers gun gunners lead paint stout wheels and troopers as before  so each detachment lumbered slowly by all eyes martially forward except when wandering in quest of female beauty  hes a fine fellow is he not said dare denoting by a nod a mounted officer with a sallow yet handsome face and black moustache who came up on a bay gelding with the men of his battery  what is he said havill  a captain who lacks advancement  do you know him  i know him  yes do you  dare made no reply and they watched the captain as he rode past with his drawn sword in his hand the sun making a little sun upon its blade and upon his brilliantly polished long boots and bright spurs also warming his gold crossbelt and braidings white gloves busby with its red bag and tall white plume  havill seemed to be too indifferent to press his questioning and when all the soldiers had passed by dare observed to his companion that he should leave him for a short time but would return in the afternoon or next day  after this he walked up the street in the rear of the artillery following them to the barracks on reaching the gates he found a crowd of people gathered outside looking with admiration at the guns and gunners drawn up within the enclosure when the soldiers were dismissed to their quarters the sightseers dispersed and dare went through the gates to the barrackyard  the guns were standing on the green the soldiers and horses were scattered about and the handsome captain whom dare had pointed out to havill was inspecting the buildings in the company of the quartermaster dare made a mental note of these things and apparently changing a previous intention went out from the barracks and returned to the town    iv  to return for a while to george somerset the sun of his later existence having vanished from that young mans horizon he confined himself closely to the studio superintending the exertions of his draughtsmen bowles knowles and cockton who were now in the full swing of working out somersets creations from the sketches he had previously prepared  he had so far got the start of havill in the competition that by the help of these three gentlemen his design was soon finished but he gained no unfair advantage on this account an additional month being allowed to havill to compensate for his later information  before scaling up his drawings somerset wished to spend a short time in london and dismissing his assistants till further notice he locked up the rooms which had been appropriated as office and studio and prepared for the journey  it was afternoon somerset walked from the castle in the direction of the wood to reach markton by a detour he had not proceeded far when there approached his path a man riding a bay horse with a squarecut tail the equestrian wore a grizzled beard and looked at somerset with a piercing eye as he noiselessly ambled nearer over the soft sod of the park he proved to be mr cunningham haze chief constable of the district who had become slightly known to somerset during his sojourn here  one word mr somerset said the chief after they had exchanged nods of recognition reining his horse as he spoke  somerset stopped  you have a studio at the castle in which you are preparing drawings  i have  have you a clerk  i had three till yesterday when i paid them off  would they have any right to enter the studio late at night  there would have been nothing wrong in their doing so either of them might have gone back at any time for something forgotten they lived quite near the castle  ah then all is explained i was riding past over the grass on the night of last thursday and i saw two persons in your studio with a light it must have been about halfpast nine oclock one of them came forward and pulled down the blind so that the light fell upon his face but i only saw it for a short time  if it were knowles or cockton he would have had a beard  he had no beard  then it must have been bowles a young man  quite young his companion in the background seemed older  they are all about the same age really by the wayit couldnt have been dareand havill surely would you recognize them again  the young one possibly the other not at all for he remained in the shade  somerset endeavoured to discern in a description by the chief constable the features of mr bowles but it seemed to approximate more closely to dare in spite of himself ill make a sketch of the only one who had no business there and show it to you he presently said i should like this cleared up  mr cunningham haze said he was going to toneborough that afternoon but would return in the evening before somersets departure with this they parted a possible motive for dares presence in the rooms had instantly presented itself to somersets mind for he had seen dare enter havills office more than once as if he were at work there  he accordingly sat on the next stile and taking out his pocketbook began a pencil sketch of dares head to show to mr haze in the evening for if dare had indeed found admission with havill or as his agent the design was lost  but he could not make a drawing that was a satisfactory likeness then he luckily remembered that dare in the intense warmth of admiration he had affected for somerset on the first day or two of their acquaintance had begged for his photograph and in return for it had left one of himself on the mantelpiece taken as he said by his own process somerset resolved to show this production to mr haze as being more to the purpose than a sketch and instead of finishing the latter proceeded on his way  he entered the old overgrown drive which wound indirectly through the wood to markton the road having been laid out for idling rather than for progress bent sharply hither and thither among the fissured trunks and layers of horny leaves which lay there all the year round interspersed with cushions of vivid green moss that formed oases in the rustred expanse  reaching a point where the road made one of its bends between two large beeches a man and woman revealed themselves at a few yards distance walking slowly towards him in the short and quaint lady he recognized charlotte de stancy whom he remembered not to have seen for several days  she slightly blushed and said o this is pleasant mr somerset let me present my brother to you captain de stancy of the royal horse artillery  her brother came forward and shook hands heartily with somerset and they all three rambled on together talking of the season the place the fishing the shooting and whatever else came uppermost in their minds  captain de stancy was a personage who would have been called interesting by women well out of their teens he was ripe without having declined a digit towards fogeyism he was sufficiently old and experienced to suggest a goodly accumulation of touching amourettes in the chambers of his memory and not too old for the possibility of increasing the store he was apparently about eightandthirty less tall than his father had been but admirably made and his every movement exhibited a fine combination of strength and flexibility of limb his face was somewhat thin and thoughtful its complexion being naturally pale though darkened by exposure to a warmer sun than ours his features were somewhat striking his moustache and hair raven black and his eyes denied the attributes of military keenness by reason of the largeness and darkness of their aspect acquired thereby a softness of expression that was in part womanly his mouth as far as it could be seen reproduced this characteristic which might have been called weakness or goodness according to the mental attitude of the observer it was large but well formed and showed an unimpaired line of teeth within his dress at present was a heathercoloured rural suit cut close to his figure  you knew my cousin jack ravensbury he said to somerset as they went on poor jack he was a good fellow  he was a very good fellow  he would have been made a parson if he had livedit was his great wish i as his senior and a man of the world as i thought myself used to chaff him about it when he was a boy and tell him not to be a milksop but to enter the army but i think jack was rightthe parsons have the best of it i see now  they would hardly admit that said somerset laughing nor can i  nor i said the captains sister see how lovely you all looked with your big guns and uniform when you entered markton and then see how stupid the parsons look by comparison when they flock into markton at a visitation  ah yes said de stancy       doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade        but when of the first sight youve had your fill        it pallsat least it does so upon me        this paradise of pleasure and ennui  when one is getting on for forty         when we have made our love and gamed our gaming           dressed voted shone and maybe something more         with dandies dined heard senators declaiming           seen beauties brought to market by the score  and so on there arises a strong desire for a quiet oldfashioned country life in which incessant movement is not a necessary part of the programme  but you are not forty will said charlotte  my dear i was thirtynine last january  well men about here are youths at that age it was india used you up so when you served in the line was it not i wish you had never gone there  so do i said de stancy drily but i ought to grow a youth again like the rest now i am in my native air  they came to a narrow brook not wider than a mans stride and miss de stancy halted on the edge  why lottie you used to jump it easily enough said her brother but we wont make her do it now he took her in his arms and lifted her over giving her a gratuitous ride for some additional yards and saying you are not a pound heavier lott than you were at ten years old what do you think of the country here mr somerset are you going to stay long  i think very well of it said somerset but i leave tomorrow morning which makes it necessary that i turn back in a minute or two from walking with you  thats a disappointment i had hoped you were going to finish out the autumn with shooting theres some very fair to be got here on reasonable terms ive just heard  but you need not hire any spoke up charlotte paula would let you shoot anything i am sure she has not been here long enough to preserve much game and the poachers had it all in mr wilkins time but what there is you might kill with pleasure to her  no thank you said de stancy grimly i prefer to remain a stranger to miss powermiss steampower she ought to be calledand to all her possessions  charlotte was subdued and did not insist further while somerset before he could feel himself able to decide on the mood in which the gallant captains joke at paulas expense should be taken wondered whether it were a married man or a bachelor who uttered it  he had not been able to keep the question of de stancys domestic state out of his head from the first moment of seeing him assuming de stancy to be a husband he felt there might be some excuse for his remark if unmarried somerset liked the satire still better in such circumstances there was a relief in the thought that captain de stancys prejudices might be infinitely stronger than those of his sister or father  going tomorrow did you say mr somerset asked miss de stancy then will you dine with us today my father is anxious that you should do so before you go i am sorry there will be only our own family present to meet you but you can leave as early as you wish  her brother seconded the invitation and somerset promised though his leisure for that evening was short he was in truth somewhat inclined to like de stancy for though the captain had said nothing of any value either on war commerce science or art he had seemed attractive to the younger man beyond the natural interest a soldier has for imaginative minds in the civil walks of life de stancys occasional manifestations of taedium vitae were too poetically shaped to be repellent gallantry combined in him with a sort of ascetic selfrepression in a way that was curious he was a dozen years older than somerset his life had been passed in grooves remote from those of somersets own life and the latter decided that he would like to meet the artillery officer again  bidding them a temporary farewell he went away to markton by a shorter path than that pursued by the de stancys and after spending the remainder of the afternoon preparing for departure he sallied forth just before the dinnerhour towards the suburban villa  he had become yet more curious whether a mrs de stancy existed if there were one he would probably see her tonight he had an irrepressible hope that there might be such a lady on entering the drawingroom only the father son and daughter were assembled somerset fell into talk with charlotte during the few minutes before dinner and his thought found its way out  there is no mrs de stancy he said in an undertone  none she said my brother is a bachelor  the dinner having been fixed at an early hour to suit somerset they had returned to the drawingroom at eight oclock about nine he was aiming to get away  you are not off yet said the captain  there would have been no hurry said somerset had i not just remembered that i have left one thing undone which i want to attend to before my departure i want to see the chief constable tonight  cunningham hazehe is the very man i too want to see but he went out of town this afternoon and i hardly think you will see him tonight his return has been delayed  then the matter must wait  i have left word at his house asking him to call here if he gets home before halfpast ten but at any rate i shall see him tomorrow morning can i do anything for you since you are leaving early  somerset replied that the business was of no great importance and briefly explained the suspected intrusion into his studio that he had with him a photograph of the suspected young man if it is a mistake added somerset i should regret putting my draughtsmans portrait into the hands of the police since it might injure his character indeed it would be unfair to him so i wish to keep the likeness in my own hands and merely to show it to mr haze thats why i prefer not to send it  my matter with haze is that the barrack furniture does not correspond with the inventories if you like ill ask your question at the same time with pleasure  thereupon somerset gave captain de stancy an unfastened envelope containing the portrait asking him to destroy it if the constable should declare it not to correspond with the face that met his eye at the window soon after somerset took his leave of the household  he had not been absent ten minutes when other wheels were heard on the gravel without and the servant announced mr cunningham haze who had returned earlier than he had expected and had called as requested  they went into the diningroom to discuss their business when the barrack matter had been arranged de stancy said i have a little commission to execute for my friend mr somerset i am to ask you if this portrait of the person he suspects of unlawfully entering his room is like the man you saw there  the speaker was seated on one side of the diningtable and mr haze on the other as he spoke de stancy pulled the envelope from his pocket and half drew out the photograph which he had not as yet looked at to hand it over to the constable in the act his eye fell upon the portrait with its uncertain expression of age assured look and hair worn in a fringe like a girls  captain de stancys face became strained and he leant back in his chair having previously had sufficient power over himself to close the envelope and return it to his pocket  good heavens you are ill captain de stancy said the chief constable  it was only momentary said de stancy better in a minutea glass of water will put me right  mr haze got him a glass of water from the sideboard  these spasms occasionally overtake me said de stancy when he had drunk i am already better what were we saying o this affair of mr somersets i find that this envelope is not the right one he ostensibly searched his pocket again i must have mislaid it he continued rising ill be with you again in a moment  de stancy went into the room adjoining opened an album of portraits that lay on the table and selected one of a young man quite unknown to him whose age was somewhat akin to dares but who in no other attribute resembled him  de stancy placed this picture in the original envelope and returned with it to the chief constable saying he had found it at last  thank you thank you said cunningham haze looking it over ahi perceive it is not what i expected to see mr somerset was mistaken  when the chief constable had left the house captain de stancy shut the door and drew out the original photograph as he looked at the transcript of dares features he was moved by a painful agitation till recalling himself to the present he carefully put the portrait into the fire  during the following days captain de stancys manner on the roads in the streets and at barracks was that of crusoe after seeing the print of a mans foot on the sand    v  anybody who had closely considered dare at this time would have discovered that shortly after the arrival of the royal horse artillery at markton barracks he gave up his room at the inn at sleepinggreen and took permanent lodgings over a brokers shop in the town abovementioned the peculiarity of the rooms was that they commanded a view lengthwise of the barrack lane along which any soldier in the natural course of things would pass either to enter the town to call at myrtle villa or to go to stancy castle  dare seemed to act as if there were plenty of time for his business some few days had slipped by when perceiving captain de stancy walk past his window and into the town dare took his hat and cane and followed in the same direction when he was about fifty yards short of myrtle villa on the other side of the town he saw de stancy enter its gate  dare mounted a stile beside the highway and patiently waited in about twenty minutes de stancy came out again and turned back in the direction of the town till dare was revealed to him on his left hand when de stancy recognized the youth he was visibly agitated though apparently not surprised standing still a moment he dropped his glance upon the ground and then came forward to dare who having alighted from the stile stood before the captain with a smile  my dear lad said de stancy much moved by recollections he held dares hand for a moment in both his own and turned askance  you are not astonished said dare still retaining his smile as if to his mind there were something comic in the situation  i knew you were somewhere near where do you come from  from going to and fro in the earth and walking up and down in it as satan said to his makersouthampton last in common speech  have you come here to see me  entirely i divined that your next quarters would be markton the previous batteries that were at your station having come on here i have wanted to see you badly  you have  i am rather out of cash i have been knocking about a good deal since you last heard from me  i will do what i can again  thanks captain  but willy i am afraid it will not be much at present you know i am as poor as a mouse  but such as it is could you write a cheque for it now  i will send it to you from the barracks  i have a better plan by getting over this stile we could go round at the back of the villas to sleepinggreen church there is always a penandink in the vestry and we can have a nice talk on the way it would be unwise for me to appear at the barracks just now  thats true  de stancy sighed and they were about to walk across the fields together no said dare suddenly stopping my plans make it imperative that we should not run the risk of being seen in each others company for long walk on and i will follow you can stroll into the churchyard and move about as if you were ruminating on the epitaphs there are some with excellent morals ill enter by the other gate and we can meet easily in the vestryroom  de stancy looked gloomy and was on the point of acquiescing when he turned back and said why should your photograph be shown to the chief constable  by whom  somerset the architect he suspects your having broken into his office or something of the sort de stancy briefly related what somerset had explained to him at the dinnertable  it was merely diamond cut diamond between us on an architectural matter murmured dare ho and he suspects and thats his remedy  i hope this is nothing serious asked de stancy gravely  i peeped at his drawingthats all but since he chooses to make that use of my photograph which i gave him in friendship ill make use of his in a way he little dreams of well now lets on  a quarter of an hour later they met in the vestry of the church at sleepinggreen  i have only just transferred my account to the bank here said de stancy as he took out his chequebook and it will be more convenient to me at present to draw but a small sum i will make up the balance afterwards  when he had written it dare glanced over the paper and said ruefully it is small dad well there is all the more reason why i should broach my scheme with a view to making such documents larger in the future  i shall be glad to hear of any such scheme answered de stancy with a languid attempt at jocularity  then here it is the plan i have arranged for you is of the nature of a marriage  you are very kind said de stancy agape  the ladys name is miss paula power who as you may have heard since your arrival is in absolute possession of her fathers property and estates including stancy castle as soon as i heard of her i saw what a marvellous match it would be for you and your family it would make a man of you in short and i have set my mind upon your putting no objection in the way of its accomplishment  but willy it seems to me that of us two it is you who exercise paternal authority  true it is for your good let me do it  well one must be indulgent under the circumstances i suppose but added de stancy simply willy idont want to marry you know i have lately thought that some day we may be able to live together you and i go off to america or new zealand where we are not known and there lead a quiet pastoral life defying social rules and troublesome observances  i cant hear of it captain replied dare reprovingly i am what events have made me and having fixed my mind upon getting you settled in life by this marriage i have put things in train for it at an immense trouble to myself if you had thought over it o nights as much as i have you would not say nay  but i ought to have married your mother if anybody and as i have not married her the least i can do in respect to her is to marry no other woman  you have some sort of duty to me have you not captain de stancy  yes willy i admit that i have the elder replied reflectively and i dont think i have failed in it thus far  this will be the crowning proof paternal affection family pride the noble instincts to reinstate yourself in the castle of your ancestors all demand the step and when you have seen the lady she has the figure and motions of a sylph the face of an angel the eye of love itself what a sight she is crossing the lawn on a sunny afternoon or gliding airily along the corridors of the old place the de stancys knew so well her lips are the softest reddest most distracting things you ever saw her hair is as soft as silk and of the rarest tenderest brown  the captain moved uneasily dont take the trouble to say more willy he observed you know how i am my cursed susceptibility to these matters has already wasted years of my life and i dont want to make myself a fool about her too  you must see her  no dont let me see her de stancy expostulated if she is only half so goodlooking as you say she will drag me at her heels like a blind samson you are a mere youth as yet but i may tell you that the misfortune of never having been my own master where a beautiful face was concerned obliges me to be cautious if i would preserve my peace of mind  well to my mind captain de stancy your objections seem trivial are those all  they are all i care to mention just now to you  captain can there be secrets between us  de stancy paused and looked at the lad as if his heart wished to confess what his judgment feared to tell there should not beon this point he murmured  then tell mewhy do you so much object to her  i once vowed a vow  a vow said dare rather disconcerted  a vow of infinite solemnity i must tell you from the beginning perhaps you are old enough to hear it now though you have been too young before your mothers life ended in much sorrow and it was occasioned entirely by me in my regret for the wrong done her i swore to her that though she had not been my wife no other woman should stand in that relationship to me and this to her was a sort of comfort when she was dead my knowledge of my own plaguy impressionableness which seemed to be ineradicableas it seems stillled me to think what safeguards i could set over myself with a view to keeping my promise to live a life of celibacy and among other things i determined to forswear the society and if possible the sight of women young and attractive as far as i had the power to do  it is not so easy to avoid the sight of a beautiful woman if she crosses your path i should think  it is not easy but it is possible  how  by directing your attention another way  but do you mean to say captain that you can be in a room with a pretty woman who speaks to you and not look at her  i do though mere looking has less to do with it than mental attentivenessallowing your thoughts to flow out in her directionto comprehend her image  but it would be considered very impolite not to look at the woman or comprehend her image  it would and is i am considered the most impolite officer in the service i have been nicknamed the man with the averted eyesthe man with the detestable habitthe man who greets you with his shoulder and so on ninetyandnine fair women at the present moment hate me like poison and death for having persistently refused to plumb the depths of their offered eyes  how can you do it who are by nature courteous  i cannot alwaysi break down sometimes but upon the whole recollection holds me to it dread of a lapse nothing is so potent as fear well maintained  de stancy narrated these details in a grave meditative tone with his eyes on the wall as if he were scarcely conscious of a listener  but havent you reckless moments captainwhen you have taken a little more wine than usual for instance  i dont take wine  o you are a teetotaller  not a pledged onebut i dont touch alcohol unless i get wet or anything of that sort  dont you sometimes forget this vow of yours to my mother  no i wear a reminder  what is that like  de stancy held up his left hand on the third finger of which appeared an iron ring  dare surveyed it saying yes i have seen that before though i never knew why you wore it well i wear a reminder also but of a different sort  he threw open his shirtfront and revealed tattooed on his breast the letters de stancy the same marks which havill had seen in the bedroom by the light of the moon  the captain rather winced at the sight well well he said hastily thats enough now at any rate you understand my objection to know miss power  but captain said the lad coaxingly as he fastened his shirt you forget me and the good you may do me by marrying surely thats a sufficient reason for a change of sentiment this inexperienced sweet creature owns the castle and estate which bears your name even to the furniture and pictures she is the possessor of at least forty thousand a yearhow much more i cannot saywhile buried here in outer wessex she lives at the rate of twelve hundred in her simplicity  it is very good of you to set this before me but i prefer to go on as i am going  well i wont bore you any more with her today a monk in regimentalstis strange dare arose and was about to open the door when looking through the window captain de stancy said stop he had perceived his father sir william de stancy walking among the tombstones without  yes indeed said dare turning the key in the door it would look strange if he were to find us here  as the old man seemed indisposed to leave the churchyard just yet they sat down again  what a capital cardtable this green cloth would make said dare as they waited you play captain i suppose  very seldom  the same with me but as i enjoy a hand of cards with a friend i dont go unprovided saying which dare drew a pack from the tail of his coat shall we while away this leisure with the witching things  really id rather not  but coaxed the young man i am in the humour for it so dont be unkind  but willy why do you care for these things cards are harmless enough in their way but i dont like to see you carrying them in your pocket it isnt good for you  it was by the merest chance i had them now come just one hand since we are prisoners i want to show you how nicely i can play i wont corrupt you  of course not said de stancy as if ashamed of what his objection implied you are not corrupt enough yourself to do that i should hope  the cards were dealt and they began to playcaptain de stancy abstractedly and with his eyes mostly straying out of the window upon the large yew whose boughs as they moved were distorted by the old green windowpanes  it is better than doing nothing said dare cheerfully as the game went on i hope you dont dislike it  not if it pleases you said de stancy listlessly  and the consecration of this place does not extend further than the aisle wall  doesnt it said de stancy as he mechanically played out his cards what became of that box of books i sent you with my last cheque  well as i hadnt time to read them and as i knew you would not like them to be wasted i sold them to a bloke who peruses them from morning till night ah now you have lost a fiver altogetherhow queer well double the stakes so as i was saying just at the time the books came i got an inkling of this important business and literature went to the wall  important businesswhat  the capture of this lady to be sure  de stancy sighed impatiently i wish you were less calculating and had more of the impulse natural to your years  gameby jove you have lost again captain that makeslet me seenine pounds fifteen to square us  i owe you that said de stancy startled it is more than i have in cash i must write another cheque  never mind make it payable to yourself and our connection will be quite unsuspected  captain de stancy did as requested and rose from his seat sir william though further off was still in the churchyard  how can you hesitate for a moment about this girl said dare pointing to the bent figure of the old man think of the satisfaction it would be to him to see his son within the family walls again it should be a religion with you to compass such a legitimate end as this  well well ill think of it said the captain with an impatient laugh you are quite a mephistopheles willi say it to my sorrow  would that i were in your place  would that you were fifteen years ago i might have called the chance a magnificent one  but you are a young man still and you look younger than you are nobody knows our relationship and i am not such a fool as to divulge it of course if through me you reclaim this splendid possession i should leave it to your feelings what you would do for me  sir william had by this time cleared out of the churchyard and the pair emerged from the vestry and departed proceeding towards markton by the same bypath they presently came to an eminence covered with bushes of blackthorn and tufts of yellowing fern from this point a good view of the woods and glades about stancy castle could be obtained dare stood still on the top and stretched out his finger the captains eye followed the direction and he saw above the manyhued foliage in the middle distance the towering keep of paulas castle  thats the goal of your ambition captainambition do i saymost righteous and dutiful endeavour how the hoary shape catches the sunlightit is the raison detre of the landscape and its possession is coveted by a thousand hearts surely it is an hereditary desire of yours you must make a point of returning to it and appearing in the map of the future as in that of the past i delight in this work of encouraging you and pushing you forward towards your own you are really very clever you know buti say it with respecthow comes it that you want so much waking up  because i know the day is not so bright as it seems my boy however you make a little mistake if i care for anything on earth i do care for that old fortress of my forefathers i respect so little among the living that all my reverence is for my own dead but manoeuvring even for my own as you call it is not in my line it is distastefulit is positively hateful to me  well well let it stand thus for the present but will you refuse me one little requestmerely to see her ill contrive it so that she may not see you dont refuse me it is the one thing i ask and i shall think it hard if you deny me  o will said the captain wearily why will you plead so noeven though your mind is particularly set upon it i cannot see her or bestow a thought upon her much as i should like to gratify you    vi  when they had parted dare walked along towards markton with resolve on his mouth and an unscrupulous light in his prominent black eye could any person who had heard the previous conversation have seen him now he would have found little difficulty in divining that notwithstanding de stancys obduracy the reinstation of captain de stancy in the castle and the possible legitimation and enrichment of himself was still the dream of his brain even should any legal settlement or offspring intervene to nip the extreme development of his projects there was abundant opportunity for his glorification two conditions were imperative de stancy must see paula before somersets return and it was necessary to have help from havill even if it involved letting him know all  whether havill already knew all was a nice question for mr dares luminous mind havill had had opportunities of reading his secret particularly on the night they occupied the same room if so by revealing it to paula havill might utterly blast his project for the marriage havill then was at all risks to be retained as an ally  yet dare would have preferred a stronger check upon his confederate than was afforded by his own knowledge of that anonymous letter and the competition trick for were the competition lost to him havill would have no further interest in conciliating miss power would as soon as not let her know the secret of de stancys relation to him  fortune as usual helped him in his dilemma entering havills office dare found him sitting there but the drawings had all disappeared from the boards the architect held an open letter in his hand  well what news said dare  miss power has returned to the castle somerset is detained in london and the competition is decided said havill with a glance of quiet dubiousness  and you have won it  no we are bracketedits a tie the judges say there is no choice between the designsthat they are singularly equal and singularly good that she would do well to adopt either signed soandso fellows of the royal institute of british architects the result is that she will employ which she personally likes best it is as if i had spun a sovereign in the air and it had alighted on its edge the least false movement will make it tails the least wise movement heads  singularly equal well we owe that to our nocturnal visit which must not be known  o lord no said havill apprehensively  dare felt secure of him at those words havill had much at stake the slightest rumour of his trick in bringing about the competition would be fatal to havills reputation  the permanent absence of somerset then is desirable architecturally on your account matrimonially on mine  matrimonially by the waywho was that captain you pointed out to me when the artillery entered the town  captain de stancyson of sir william de stancy hes the husband o you neednt look incredulous it is practicable but we wont argue that in the first place i want him to see her and to see her in the most lovekindling passionbegetting circumstances that can be thought of and he must see her surreptitiously for he refuses to meet her  let him see her going to church or chapel  dare shook his head  driving out  commonplace  walking in the gardens  ditto  at her toilet  ahif it were possible  which it hardly is well you had better think it over and make inquiries about her habits and as to when she is in a favourable aspect for observation as the almanacs say  shortly afterwards dare took his leave in the evening he made it his business to sit smoking on the bole of a tree which commanded a view of the upper ward of the castle and also of the old posterngate now enlarged and used as a tradesmens entrance it was halfpast six oclock the dressingbell rang and dare saw a lightfooted young woman hasten at the sound across the ward from the servants quarter a light appeared in a chamber which he knew to be paulas dressingroom and there it remained halfanhour a shadow passing and repassing on the blind in the style of headdress worn by the girl he had previously seen the dinnerbell sounded and the light went out  as yet it was scarcely dark out of doors and in a few minutes dare had the satisfaction of seeing the same woman cross the ward and emerge upon the slope without this time she was bonneted and carried a little basket in her hand a nearer view showed her to be as he had expected milly birch paulas maid who had friends living in markton whom she was in the habit of visiting almost every evening during the three hours of leisure which intervened between paulas retirement from the dressingroom and return thither at ten oclock when the young woman had descended the road and passed into the large drive dare rose and followed her  o it is you miss birch said dare on overtaking her i am glad to have the pleasure of walking by your side  yes sir o its mr dare we dont see you at the castle now sir  no and do you get a walk like this every evening when the others are at their busiest  almost every evening thats the one return to the poor ladys maid for losing her leisure when the others get itin the absence of the family from home  is miss power a hard mistress  no  rather fanciful than hard i presume  just so sir  and she likes to appear to advantage no doubt  i suppose so said milly laughing we all do  when does she appear to the best advantage when riding or driving or reading her book  not altogether then if you mean the very best  perhaps it is when she sits looking in the glass at herself and you let down her hair  not particularly to my mind  when does she to your mind when dressed for a dinnerparty or ball  shes middling then but there is one time when she looks nicer and cleverer than at any it is when she is in the gymnasium  ogymnasium  because when she is there she wears such a pretty boys costume and is so charming in her movements that you think she is a lovely young youth and not a girl at all  when does she go to this gymnasium  not so much as she used to only on wet mornings now when she cant get out for walks or drives but she used to do it every day  i should like to see her there  why sir  i am a poor artist and cant afford models to see her attitudes would be of great assistance to me in the art i love so well  milly shook her head shes very strict about the door being locked if i were to leave it open she would dismiss me as i should deserve  but consider dear miss birch the advantage to a poor artist the sight of her would be if you could hold the door ajar it would be worth five pounds to me and a good deal to you  no said the incorruptible milly shaking her head besides i dont always go there with her o no i couldnt  milly remained so firm at this point that dare said no more  when he had left her he returned to the castle grounds and though there was not much light he had no difficulty in discovering the gymnasium the outside of which he had observed before without thinking to inquire its purpose like the erections in other parts of the shrubberies it was constructed of wood the interstices between the framing being filled up with short billets of fir nailed diagonally dare even when without a settled plan in his head could arrange for probabilities and wrenching out one of the billets he looked inside it seemed to be a simple oblong apartment fitted up with ropes with a little dressingcloset at one end and lighted by a skylight or lantern in the roof dare replaced the wood and went on his way  havill was smoking on his doorstep when dare passed up the street he held up his hand  since you have been gone said the architect ive hit upon something that may help you in exhibiting your lady to your gentleman in the summer i had orders to design a gymnasium for her which i did and they say she is very clever on the ropes and bars now  ive discovered it i shall contrive for him to see her there on the first wet morning which is when she practises what made her think of it  as you may have heard she holds advanced views on social and other matters and in those on the higher education of women she is very strong talking a good deal about the physical training of the greeks whom she adores or did every philosopher and man of science who ventilates his theories in the monthly reviews has a devout listener in her and this subject of the physical development of her sex has had its turn with other things in her mind so she had the place built on her very first arrival according to the latest lights on athletics and in imitation of those at the new colleges for women  how deuced clever of the girl she means to live to be a hundred    vii  the wet day arrived with all the promptness that might have been expected of it in this land of rains and mists the alder bushes behind the gymnasium dripped monotonously leaf upon leaf added to this being the purl of the shallow stream a little way off producing a sense of satiety in watery sounds though there was drizzle in the open meads the rain here in the thicket was comparatively slight and two men with fishing tackle who stood beneath one of the larger bushes found its boughs a sufficient shelter  we may as well walk home again as study nature here willy said the taller and elder of the twain i feared it would continue when we started the magnificent sport you speak of must rest for today  the other looked at his watch but made no particular reply  come let us move on i dont like intruding into other peoples grounds like this de stancy continued  we are not intruding anybody walks outside this fence he indicated an iron railing newly tarred dividing the wilder underwood amid which they stood from the inner and wellkept parts of the shrubbery and against which the back of the gymnasium was built  light footsteps upon a gravel walk could be heard on the other side of the fence and a trio of cloaked and umbrellascreened figures were for a moment discernible they vanished behind the gymnasium and again nothing resounded but the river murmurs and the clocklike drippings of the leafage  hush said dare  no pranks my boy said de stancy suspiciously you should be above them  and you should trust to my good sense captain dare remonstrated i have not indulged in a prank since the sixth year of my pilgrimage i have found them too damaging to my interests well it is not too dry here and damp injures your health you say have a pull for safetys sake he presented a flask to de stancy  the artillery officer looked down at his nether garments  i dont break my rule without good reason he observed  i am afraid that reason exists at present  i am afraid it does what have you got  only a little wine  what wine  do try it i call it the blushful hippocrene that the poet describes as       tasting of flora and the country green       dance and provencal song and sunburnt mirth  de stancy took the flask and drank a little  it warms does it not said dare  too much said de stancy with misgiving i have been taken unawares why it is three parts brandy to my taste you scamp  dare put away the wine now you are to see something he said  somethingwhat is it captain de stancy regarded him with a puzzled look  it is quite a curiosity and really worth seeing now just look in here  the speaker advanced to the back of the building and withdrew the wood billet from the wall  will i believe you are up to some trick said de stancy not however suspecting the actual truth in these unsuggestive circumstances and with a comfortable resignation produced by the potent liquor which would have been comical to an outsider but which to one who had known the history and relationship of the two speakers would have worn a sadder significance i am too big a fool about you to keep you down as i ought thats the fault of me worse luck  he pressed the youths hand with a smile went forward and looked through the hole into the interior of the gymnasium dare withdrew to some little distance and watched captain de stancys face which presently began to assume an expression of interest  what was the captain seeing a sort of optical poem  paula in a pink flannel costume was bending wheeling and undulating in the air like a goldfish in its globe sometimes ascending by her arms nearly to the lantern then lowering herself till she swung level with the floor her aunt mrs goodman and charlotte de stancy were sitting on campstools at one end watching her gyrations paula occasionally addressing them with such an expression asnow aunt look at meand you charlotteis not that shocking to your weak nerves when some adroit feat would be repeated which however seemed to give much more pleasure to paula herself in performing it than to mrs goodman in looking on the latter sometimes saying o it is terrificdo not run such a risk again  it would have demanded the poetic passion of some joyous elizabethan lyrist like lodge nash or constable to fitly phrase paulas presentation of herself at this moment of absolute abandonment to every muscular whim that could take possession of such a supple form the white manilla ropes clung about the performer like snakes as she took her exercise and the colour in her face deepened as she went on captain de stancy felt that much as he had seen in early life of beauty in woman he had never seen beauty of such a real and living sort as this a recollection of his vow together with a sense that to gaze on the festival of this bona dea was though so innocent and pretty a sight hardly fair or gentlemanly would have compelled him to withdraw his eyes had not the sportive fascination of her appearance glued them there in spite of all and as if to complete the picture of grace personified and add the one thing wanting to the charm which bound him the clouds till that time thick in the sky broke away from the upper heaven and allowed the noonday sun to pour down through the lantern upon her irradiating her with a warm light that was incarnadined by her pink doublet and hose and reflected in upon her face she only required a cloud to rest on instead of the green silk net which actually supported her reclining figure for the moment to be quite olympian save indeed that in place of haughty effrontery there sat on her countenance only the healthful sprightliness of an english girl  dare had withdrawn to a point at which another path crossed the path occupied by de stancy looking in a side direction he saw havill idling slowly up to him over the silent grass havills knowledge of the appointment had brought him out to see what would come of it when he neared dare but was still partially hidden by the boughs from the third of the party the former simply pointed to de stancy upon which havill stood and peeped at him is she within there he inquired  dare nodded and whispered you need not have asked if you had examined his face  thats true  a fermentation is beginning in him said dare half pitifully a purely chemical process and when it is complete he will probably be clear and fiery and sparkling and quite another man than the good weak easy fellow that he was  to precisely describe captain de stancys admiration was impossible a sun seemed to rise in his face by watching him they could almost see the aspect of her within the wall so accurately were her changing phases reflected in him he seemed to forget that he was not alone  and is this he murmured in the manner of one only half apprehending himself and is this the end of my vow  paula was saying at this moment ariel sleeps in this posture does he not auntie suiting the action to the word she flung out her arms behind her head as she lay in the green silk hammock idly closed her pink eyelids and swung herself to and fro     book the third de stancy    i  captain de stancy was a changed man a hitherto wellrepressed energy was giving him motion towards longshunned consequences his features were indeed the same as before though had a physiognomist chosen to study them with the closeness of an astronomer scanning the universe he would doubtless have discerned abundant novelty  in recent years de stancy had been an easy melancholy unaspiring officer enervated and depressed by a parental affection quite beyond his control for the graceless lad darethe obtrusive memento of a shadowy period in de stancys youth who threatened to be the curse of his old age throughout a long space he had persevered in his system of rigidly incarcerating within himself all instincts towards the opposite sex with a resolution that would not have disgraced a much stronger man by this habit maintained with fair success a chamber of his nature had been preserved intact during many later years like the one solitary sealedup cell occasionally retained by bees in a lobe of drained honeycomb and thus though he had irretrievably exhausted the relish of society of ambition of action and of his profession the loveforce that he had kept immured alive was still a reproducible thing  the sight of paula in her graceful performance which the judicious dare had so carefully planned led up to and heightened by subtle accessories operated on de stancys surprised soul with a promptness almost magical  on the evening of the selfsame day having dined as usual he retired to his rooms where he found a hamper of wine awaiting him it had been anonymously sent and the account was paid he smiled grimly but no longer with heaviness in this he instantly recognized the handiwork of dare who having at last broken down the barrier which de stancy had erected round his heart for so many years acted like a skilled strategist and took swift measures to follow up the advantage so tardily gained  captain de stancy knew himself conquered he knew he should yield to paulahad indeed yielded but there was now in his solitude an hour or two of reaction he did not drink from the bottles sent he went early to bed and lay tossing thereon till far into the night thinking over the collapse his teetotalism had with the lapse of years unconsciously become the outward and visible sign to himself of his secret vows and a return to its opposite however mildly done signified with ceremonious distinctness the formal acceptance of delectations long forsworn  but the exceeding freshness of his feeling for paula which by reason of its long arrest was that of a man far under thirty and was a wonder to himself every instant would not long brook weighing in balances he wished suddenly to commit himself to remove the question of retreat out of the region of debate the clock struck two and the wish became determination he arose and wrapping himself in his dressinggown went to the next room where he took from a shelf in the pantry several large bottles which he carried to the window till they stood on the sill a goodly row there had been sufficient light in the room for him to do this without a candle now he softly opened the sash and the radiance of a gibbous moon riding in the opposite sky flooded the apartment it fell on the labels of the captains bottles revealing their contents to be simple aerated waters for drinking  de stancy looked out and listened the guns that stood drawn up within the yard glistened in the moonlight reaching them from over the barrackwall there was an occasional stamp of horses in the stables also a measured tread of sentinelsone or more at the gates one at the hospital one between the wings two at the magazine and others further off recurring to his intention he drew the corks of the mineral waters and inverting each bottle one by one over the windowsill heard its contents dribble in a small stream on to the gravel below  he then opened the hamper which dare had sent uncorking one of the bottles he murmured to paula and drank a glass of the ruby liquor  a man again after eighteen years he said shutting the sash and returning to his bedroom  the first overt result of his kindled interest in miss power was his saying to his sister the day after the surreptitious sight of paula i am sorry charlotte for a word or two i said the other day  well  i was rather disrespectful to your friend miss power  i dont think sowere you  yes when we were walking in the wood i made a stupid joke about her what does she know about medo you ever speak of me to her  only in general terms  what general terms  you know well enough william of your idiosyncrasies and so onthat you are a bit of a womanhater or at least a confirmed bachelor and have but little respect for your own family  i wish you had not told her that said de stancy with dissatisfaction  but i thought you always liked women to know your principles said charlotte in injured tones and would particularly like her to know them living so near  yes yes replied her brother hastily well i ought to see her just to show her that i am not quite a brute  that would be very nice she answered putting her hands together in agreeable astonishment it is just what i have wished though i did not dream of suggesting it after what i have heard you say i am going to stay with her again tomorrow and i will let her know about this  dont tell her anything plainly for heavens sake i really want to see the interior of the castle i have never entered its walls since my babyhood he raised his eyes as he spoke to where the walls in question showed their ashlar faces over the trees  you might have gone over it at any time  o yes it is only recently that i have thought much of the place i feel now that i should like to examine the old building thoroughly since it was for so many generations associated with our fortunes especially as most of the old furniture is still there my sedulous avoidance hitherto of all relating to our family vicissitudes has been i own stupid conduct for an intelligent being but impossible grapes are always sour and i have unconsciously adopted radical notions to obliterate disappointed hereditary instincts but these have a trick of reestablishing themselves as one gets older and the castle and what it contains have a keen interest for me now  it contains paula  de stancys pulse which had been beating languidly for many years beat double at the sound of that name  i meant furniture and pictures for the moment he said but i dont mind extending the meaning to her if you wish it  she is the rarest thing there  so you have said before  the castle and our family history have as much romantic interest for her as they have for you charlotte went on she delights in visiting our tombs and effigies and ponders over them for hours  indeed said de stancy allowing his surprise to hide the satisfaction which accompanied it that should make us friendly does she see many people  not many as yet and she cannot have many staying there during the alterations  ah yesthe alterations didnt you say that she has had a london architect stopping there on that account what was heold or young  he is a young man he has been to our house dont you remember you met him there  what was his name  mr somerset  o that man yes yes i remember hullo lottie  what  your face is as red as a peony now i know a secret charlotte vainly endeavoured to hide her confusion very wellnot a word i wont say more continued de stancy goodhumouredly except that he seems to be a very nice fellow  de stancy had turned the dialogue on to this little wellpreserved secret of his sisters with sufficient outward lightness but it had been done in instinctive concealment of the disquieting start with which he had recognized that somerset dares enemy whom he had intercepted in placing dares portrait into the hands of the chief constable was a man beloved by his sister charlotte this novel circumstance might lead to a curious complication but he was to hear more  he may be very nice replied charlotte with an effort after this silence but he is nothing to me more than a very good friend  theres no engagement or thought of one between you  certainly theres not said charlotte with brave emphasis it is more likely to be between paula and him than me and him  de stancys bare military ears and closely cropped poll flushed hot miss power and him  i dont mean to say there is because paula denies it but i mean that he loves paula that i do know  de stancy was dumb this item of news which dare had kept from him not knowing how far de stancys sense of honour might extend was decidedly grave indeed he was so greatly impressed with the fact that he could not help saying as much aloud this is very serious  why she murmured tremblingly for the first leaking out of her tender and sworn secret had disabled her quite  because i love paula too  what do you say william youa woman you have never seen  i have seen herby accident and now my dear little sis you will be my close ally wont you as i will be yours as brother and sister should be he placed his arm coaxingly round charlottes shoulder  o william how can i at last she stammered  why how cant you i should say we are both in the same ship i love paula you love mr somerset it behoves both of us to see that this flirtation of theirs ends in nothing  i dont like you to put it like thatthat i love himit frightens me murmured the girl visibly agitated i dont want to divide him from paula i couldnt i wouldnt do anything to separate them believe me will i could not i am sorry you love there also though i should be glad if it happened in the natural order of events that she should come round to you but i cannot do anything to part them and make mr somerset suffer it would be too wrong and blamable  now you silly charlotte thats just how you women fly off at a tangent i mean nothing dishonourable in the least have i ever prompted you to do anything dishonourable fair fighting allies was all i thought of  miss de stancy breathed more freely yes we will be that of course we are always that william but i hope i can be your ally and be quite neutral i would so much rather  well i suppose it will not be a breach of your precious neutrality if you get me invited to see the castle  o no she said brightly i dont mind doing such a thing as that why not come with me tomorrow i will say i am going to bring you there will be no trouble at all  de stancy readily agreed the effect upon him of the information now acquired was to intensify his ardour tenfold the stimulus being due to a perception that somerset with a little more knowledge would hold a card which could be played with disastrous effect against himselfhis relationship to dare its disclosure to a lady of such puritan antecedents as paulas would probably mean her immediate severance from himself as an unclean thing  is miss power a severe pietist or precisian or is she a compromising lady he asked abruptly  she is severe and uncompromisingif you mean in her judgments on morals said charlotte not quite hearing the remark was peculiarly apposite and de stancy was silent  he spent some following hours in a close study of the castle history which till now had unutterably bored him more particularly did he dwell over documents and notes which referred to the pedigree of his own family he wrote out the names of alland they were manywho had been born within those domineering walls since their first erection of those among them who had been brought thither by marriage with the owner and of stranger knights and gentlemen who had entered the castle by marriage with its mistress he refreshed his memory on the strange loves and hates that had arisen in the course of the family history on memorable attacks and the dates of the same the most memorable among them being the occasion on which the party represented by paula battered down the castle walls that she was now about to mend and as he hoped return in their original intact shape to the family dispossessed by marriage with himself its living representative  in sir williams villa were small engravings after many of the portraits in the castle galleries some of them hanging in the diningroom in plain oak and maple frames and others preserved in portfolios de stancy spent much of his time over these and in getting up the romances of their originals lives from memoirs and other records all which stories were as great novelties to him as they could possibly be to any stranger most interesting to him was the life of an edward de stancy who had lived just before the civil wars and to whom captain de stancy bore a very traceable likeness this ancestor had a mole on his cheek black and distinct as a fly in cream and as in the case of the first lord amhersts wart and bennet earl of arlingtons nosescar the painter had faithfully reproduced the defect on canvas it so happened that the captain had a mole though not exactly on the same spot of his face and this made the resemblance still greater  he took infinite trouble with his dress that day showing an amount of anxiety on the matter which for him was quite abnormal at last when fully equipped he set out with his sister to make the call proposed charlotte was rather unhappy at sight of her brothers earnest attempt to make an impression on paula but she could say nothing against it and they proceeded on their way  it was the darkest of november weather when the days are so short that morning seems to join with evening without the intervention of noon the sky was lined with low cloud within whose dense substance tempests were slowly fermenting for the coming days even now a windy turbulence troubled the halfnaked boughs and a lonely leaf would occasionally spin downwards to rejoin on the grass the scathed multitude of its comrades which had preceded it in its fall the river by the pavilion in the summer so clear and purling now slid onwards brown and thick and silent and enlarged to double size    ii  meanwhile paula was alone of anyone else it would have been said that she must be finding the afternoon rather dreary in the quaint halls not of her forefathers but of miss power it was unsafe to predicate so surely she walked from room to room in a black velvet dress which gave decision to her outline without depriving it of softness she occasionally clasped her hands behind her head and looked out of a window but she more particularly bent her footsteps up and down the long gallery where she had caused a large fire of logs to be kindled in her endeavour to extend cheerfulness somewhat beyond the precincts of the sittingrooms  the fire glanced up on paula and paula glanced down at the fire and at the gnarled beech fuel and at the woodlice which ran out from beneath the bark to the extremity of the logs as the heat approached them the lowdown ruddy light spread over the dark floor like the setting sun over a moor fluttering on the grotesque countenances of the bright andirons and touching all the furniture on the underside  she now and then crossed to one of the deep embrasures of the windows to decipher some sentence from a letter she held in her hand the daylight would have been more than sufficient for any bystander to discern that the capitals in that letter were of the peculiar semigothic type affected at the time by somerset and other young architects of his school in their epistolary correspondence she was very possibly thinking of him even when not reading his letter for the expression of softness with which she perused the page was more or less with her when she appeared to examine other things  she walked about for a little time longer then put away the letter looked at the clock and thence returned to the windows straining her eyes over the landscape without as she murmured i wish charlotte was not so long coming  as charlotte continued to keep away paula became less reasonable in her desires and proceeded to wish that somerset would arrive then that anybody would come then walking towards the portraits on the wall she flippantly asked one of those cavaliers to oblige her fancy for company by stepping down from his frame the temerity of the request led her to prudently withdraw it almost as soon as conceived old paintings had been said to play queer tricks in extreme cases and the shadows this afternoon were funereal enough for anything in the shape of revenge on an intruder who embodied the antagonistic modern spirit to such an extent as she however paula still stood before the picture which had attracted her and this by a coincidence common enough in fact though scarcely credited in chronicles happened to be that one of the seventeenthcentury portraits of which de stancy had studied the engraved copy at myrtle villa the same morning  whilst she remained before the picture wondering her favourite wonder how would she feel if this and its accompanying canvases were pictures of her own ancestors she was surprised by a light footstep upon the carpet which covered part of the room and turning quickly she beheld the smiling little figure of charlotte de stancy  what has made you so late said paula you are come to stay of course  charlotte said she had come to stay but i have brought somebody with me  ahwhom  my brother happened to be at home and i have brought him  miss de stancys brother had been so continuously absent from home in india or elsewhere so little spoken of and when spoken of so truly though unconsciously represented as one whose interests lay wholly outside this antiquated neighbourhood that to paula he had been a mere nebulosity whom she had never distinctly outlined to have him thus cohere into substance at a moments notice lent him the novelty of a new creation  is he in the drawingroom said paula in a low voice  no he is here he would follow me i hope you will forgive him  and then paula saw emerge into the red beams of the dancing fire from behind a halfdrawn hanging which screened the door the military gentleman whose acquaintance the reader has already made  you know the house doubtless captain de stancy said paula somewhat shyly when he had been presented to her  i have never seen the inside since i was three weeks old replied the artillery officer gracefully and hence my recollections of it are not remarkably distinct a year or two before i was born the entail was cut off by my father and grandfather so that i saw the venerable place only to lose it at least i believe thats the truth of the case but my knowledge of the transaction is not profound and it is a delicate point on which to question ones father  paula assented and looked at the interesting and noble figure of the man whose parents had seemingly righted themselves at the expense of wronging him  the pictures and furniture were sold about the same time i think said charlotte  yes murmured de stancy they went in a mad bargain of my father with his visitor as they sat over their wine my father sat down as host on that occasion and arose as guest  he seemed to speak with such a courteous absence of regret for the alienation that paula who was always fearing that the recollection would rise as a painful shadow between herself and the de stancys felt reassured by his magnanimity  de stancy looked with interest round the gallery seeing which paula said she would have lights brought in a moment  no please not said de stancy the room and ourselves are of so much more interesting a colour by this light  as they moved hither and thither the various expressions of de stancys face made themselves picturesquely visible in the unsteady shine of the blaze in a short time he had drawn near to the painting of the ancestor whom he so greatly resembled when her quick eye noted the speck on the face indicative of inherited traits strongly pronounced a new and romantic feeling that the de stancys had stretched out a tentacle from their genealogical tree to seize her by the hand and draw her in to their mass took possession of paula as has been said the de stancys were a family on whom the hallmark of membership was deeply stamped and by the present light the representative under the portrait and the representative in the portrait seemed beings not far removed paula was continually starting from a reverie and speaking irrelevantly as if such reflections as those seized hold of her in spite of her natural unconcern  when candles were brought in captain de stancy ardently contrived to make the pictures the theme of conversation from the nearest they went to the next whereupon paula as hostess took up one of the candlesticks and held it aloft to light up the painting the candlestick being tall and heavy de stancy relieved her of it and taking another candle in the other hand he imperceptibly slid into the position of exhibitor rather than spectator thus he walked in advance holding the two candles on high his shadow forming a gigantic figure on the neighbouring wall while he recited the particulars of family history pertaining to each portrait that he had learnt up with such eager persistence during the previous fourandtwentyhours i have often wondered what could have been the history of this lady but nobody has ever been able to tell me paula observed pointing to a vandyck which represented a beautiful woman wearing curls across her forehead a squarecut bodice and a heavy pearl necklace upon the smooth expanse of her neck  i dont think anybody knows charlotte said  o yes replied her brother promptly seeing with enthusiasm that it was yet another opportunity for making capital of his acquired knowledge with which he felt himself as inconveniently crammed as a candidate for a government examination that lady has been largely celebrated under a fancy name though she is comparatively little known by her own her parents were the chief ornaments of the almost irreproachable court of charles the first and were not more distinguished by their politeness and honour than by the affections and virtues which constitute the great charm of private life  the stock verbiage of the family memoir was somewhat apparent in this effusion but it much impressed his listeners and he went on to point out that from the ladys necklace was suspended a heartshaped portraitthat of the man who broke his heart by her persistent refusal to encourage his suit de stancy then led them a little further where hung a portrait of the lover one of his own family who appeared in full panoply of plate mail the pommel of his sword standing up under his elbow the gallant captain then related how this personage of his line wooed the lady fruitlessly how after her marriage with another she and her husband visited the parents of the disappointed lover the then occupiers of the castle how in a fit of desperation at the sight of her he retired to his room where he composed some passionate verses which he wrote with his blood and after directing them to her ran himself through the body with his sword too late the ladys heart was touched by his devotion she was ever after a melancholy woman and wore his portrait despite her husbands prohibition this continued de stancy leading them through the doorway into the hall where the coats of mail were arranged along the wall and stopping opposite a suit which bore some resemblance to that of the portrait this is his armour as you will perceive by comparing it with the picture and this is the sword with which he did the rash deed  what unreasonable devotion said paula practically it was too romantic of him she was not worthy of such a sacrifice  he also is one whom they say you resemble a little in feature i think said charlotte  do they replied de stancy i wonder if its true he set down the candles and asking the girls to withdraw for a moment was inside the upper part of the suit of armour in incredibly quick time going then and placing himself in front of a lowhanging painting near the original so as to be enclosed by the frame while covering the figure arranging the sword as in the one above and setting the light that it might fall in the right direction he recalled them when he put the question is the resemblance strong  he looked so much like a man of bygone times that neither of them replied but remained curiously gazing at him his modern and comparatively sallow complexion as seen through the open visor lent an ethereal ideality to his appearance which the timestained countenance of the original warrior totally lacked  at last paula spoke so stilly that she seemed a statue enunciating are the verses known that he wrote with his blood  o yes they have been carefully preserved captain de stancy with true wooers instinct had committed some of them to memory that morning from the printed copy to be found in every wellordered library i fear i dont remember them all he said but they begin in this way       from one that dyeth in his discontent       dear faire receive this greeting to thee sent       and still as oft as it is read by thee       then with some deep sad sigh remember mee        o twas my fortunes error to vow dutie       to one that bears defiance in her beautie       sweete poyson pretious wooe infectious jewell       such is a ladie that is faire and cruell        how well could i with ayre camelionlike       live happie and still gazeing on thy cheeke       in which forsaken man methink i see       how goodlie love doth threaten cares to mee        why dost thou frowne thus on a kneelinge soule       whose faults in love thou mayst as well controule       in lovebut o that word that word i feare       is hateful still both to thy hart and eare                                         ladie in breefe my fate doth now intend       the period of my daies to have an end       waste not on me thy pittie pretious faire       rest you in much content i in despaire  a solemn silence followed the close of the recital which de stancy improved by turning the point of the sword to his breast resting the pommel upon the floor and saying  after writing that we may picture him turning this same sword in this same way and falling on it thus he inclined his body forward as he spoke  dont captain de stancy please dont cried paula involuntarily  no dont show us any further william said his sister it is too tragic  de stancy put away the sword himself rather excitednot however by his own recital but by the direct gaze of paula at him  this protean quality of de stancys by means of which he could assume the shape and situation of almost any ancestor at will had impressed her and he perceived it with a throb of fervour but it had done no more than impress her for though in delivering the lines he had so fixed his look upon her as to suggest to any maiden practised in the game of the eyes a present significance in the words the idea of any such arrierepensee had by no means commended itself to her soul  at this time a messenger from markton barracks arrived at the castle and wished to speak to captain de stancy in the hall begging the two ladies to excuse him for a moment he went out  while de stancy was talking in the twilight to the messenger at one end of the apartment some other arrival was shown in by the side door and in making his way after the conference across the hall to the room he had previously quitted de stancy encountered the newcomer there was just enough light to reveal the countenance to be dares he bore a portfolio under his arm and had begun to wear a moustache in case the chief constable should meet him anywhere in his rambles and be struck by his resemblance to the man in the studio  what the devil are you doing here said captain de stancy in tones he had never used before to the young man  dare started back in surprise and naturally so de stancy having adopted a new system of living and relinquished the meagre diet and enervating waters of his past years was rapidly recovering tone his voice was firmer his cheeks were less pallid and above all he was authoritative towards his present companion whose ingenuity in vamping up a being for his ambitious experiments seemed about to be rewarded like frankensteins by his discomfiture at the hands of his own creature  what the devil are you doing here i say repeated de stancy  you can talk to me like that after my working so hard to get you on in life and make a rising man of you expostulated dare as one who felt himself no longer the leader in this enterprise  but said the captain less harshly if you let them discover any relations between us here you will ruin the fairest prospects man ever had  o i like that captainwhen you owe all of it to me  thats too cool will  no what i say is true however let that go so now you are here on a call but how are you going to get here often enough to win her before the other man comes back if you dont see her every daytwice three times a dayyou will not capture her in the time  i must think of that said de stancy  there is only one way of being constantly here you must come to copy the pictures or furniture something in the way he did  ill think of it muttered de stancy hastily as he heard the voices of the ladies whom he hastened to join as they were appearing at the other end of the room his countenance was gloomy as he recrossed the hall for dares words on the shortness of his opportunities had impressed him almost at once he uttered a hope to paula that he might have further chance of studying and if possible of copying some of the ancestral faces with which the building abounded  meanwhile dare had come forward with his portfolio which proved to be full of photographs while paula and charlotte were examining them he said to de stancy as a stranger excuse my interruption sir but if you should think of copying any of the portraits as you were stating just now to the ladies my patent photographic process is at your service and is i believe the only one which would be effectual in the dim indoor lights  it is just what i was thinking of said de stancy now so far cooled down from his irritation as to be quite ready to accept dares adroitly suggested scheme  on application to paula she immediately gave de stancy permission to photograph to any extent and told dare he might bring his instruments as soon as captain de stancy required them  dont stare at her in such a brazen way whispered the latter to the young man when paula had withdrawn a few steps say i shall highly value the privilege of assisting captain de stancy in such a work  dare obeyed and before leaving de stancy arranged to begin performing on his venerated forefathers the next morning the youth so accidentally engaged agreeing to be there at the same time to assist in the technical operations    iii  as he had promised de stancy made use the next day of the coveted permission that had been brought about by the ingenious dare dares timely suggestion of tendering assistance had the practical result of relieving the other of all necessity for occupying his time with the proceeding further than to bestow a perfunctory superintendence now and then to give a colour to his regular presence in the fortress the actual work of taking copies being carried on by the younger man  the weather was frequently wet during these operations and paula miss de stancy and her brother were often in the house whole mornings together by constant urging and coaxing the latter would induce his gentle sister much against her conscience to leave him opportunities for speaking to paula alone it was mostly before some print or painting that these conversations occurred while de stancy was ostensibly occupied with its merits or in giving directions to his photographer how to proceed as soon as the dialogue began the latter would withdraw out of earshot leaving paula to imagine him the most deferential young artist in the world  you will soon possess duplicates of the whole gallery she said on one of these occasions examining some curled sheets which dare had printed off from the negatives  no said the soldier i shall not have patience to go on i get illhumoured and indifferent and then leave off  why illhumoured  i scarcely knowmore than that i acquire a general sense of my own familys want of merit through seeing how meritorious the people are around me i see them happy and thriving without any necessity for me at all and then i regard these canvas grandfathers and grandmothers and ask why was a line so antiquated and out of date prolonged till now  she chid him goodnaturedly for such views they will do you an injury she declared do spare yourself captain de stancy  de stancy shook his head as he turned the painting before him a little further to the light  but do you know said paula that notion of yours of being a family out of date is delightful to some people i talk to charlotte about it often i am never weary of examining those canopied effigies in the church and almost wish they were those of my relations  i will try to see things in the same light for your sake said de stancy fervently  not for my sake for your own was what i meant of course she replied with a repressive air  captain de stancy bowed  what are you going to do with your photographs when you have them she asked as if still anxious to obliterate the previous sentimental lapse  i shall put them into a large album and carry them with me in my campaigns and may i ask now i have an opportunity that you would extend your permission to copy a little further and let me photograph one other painting that hangs in the castle to fittingly complete my set  which  that halflength of a lady which hangs in the morningroom i remember seeing it in the academy last year  paula involuntarily closed herself up the picture was her own portrait it does not belong to your series she said somewhat coldly  de stancys secret thought was i hope from my soul it will belong some day he answered with mildness there is a sort of connectionyou are my sisters friend  paula assented  and hence might not your friends brother photograph your picture  paula demurred  a gentle sigh rose from the bosom of de stancy what is to become of me he said with a light distressed laugh i am always inconsiderate and inclined to ask too much forgive me what was in my mind when i asked i dare not say  i quite understand your interest in your family picturesand all of it she remarked more gently willing not to hurt the sensitive feelings of a man so full of romance  and in that one he said looking devotedly at her if i had only been fortunate enough to include it with the rest my album would indeed have been a treasure to pore over by the bivouac fire  o captain de stancy this is provoking perseverance cried paula laughing half crossly i expected that after expressing my decision so plainly the first time i should not have been further urged upon the subject saying which she turned and moved decisively away  it had not been a productive meeting thus far one word said de stancy following and almost clasping her hand i have given offence i know but do let it all fall on my own headdont tell my sister of my misbehaviour she loves you deeply and it would wound her to the heart  you deserve to be told upon said paula as she withdrew with just enough playfulness to show that her anger was not too serious  charlotte looked at paula uneasily when the latter joined her in the drawingroom she wanted to say what is the matter but guessing that her brother had something to do with it forbore to speak at first she could not contain her anxiety long were you talking with my brother she said  yes returned paula with reservation however she soon added he not only wants to photograph his ancestors but my portrait too they are a dreadfully encroaching sex and perhaps being in the army makes them worse  ill give him a hint and tell him to be careful  dont say i have definitely complained of him it is not worth while to do that the matter is too trifling for repetition upon the whole charlotte i would rather you said nothing at all  de stancys hobby of photographing his ancestors seemed to become a perfect mania with him almost every morning discovered him in the larger apartments of the castle taking down and rehanging the dilapidated pictures with the assistance of the indispensable dare his fingers stained black with dust and his face expressing a busy attention to the work in hand though always reserving a look askance for the presence of paula  though there was something of subterfuge there was no deep and double subterfuge in all this de stancy took no particular interest in his ancestral portraits but he was enamoured of paula to weakness perhaps the composition of his love would hardly bear looking into but it was recklessly frank and not quite mercenary his photographic scheme was nothing worse than a lovers not too scrupulous contrivance after the refusal of his request to copy her picture he fumed and fretted at the prospect of somersets return before any impression had been made on her heart by himself he swore at dare and asked him hotly why he had dragged him into such a hopeless dilemma as this  hopeless somerset must still be kept away so that it is not hopeless i will consider how to prolong his stay  thereupon dare considered  the time was cominghad indeed comewhen it was necessary for paula to make up her mind about her architect if she meant to begin building in the spring the two sets of plans somersets and havills were hanging on the walls of the room that had been used by somerset as his studio and were accessible by anybody dare took occasion to go and study both sets with a view to finding a flaw in somersets which might have been passed over unnoticed by the committee of architects owing to their absence from the actual site but not a blunder could he find  he next went to havill and here he was met by an amazing state of affairs havills creditors at last suspecting something mythical in havills assurance that the grand commission was his had lost all patience his house was turned upsidedown and a poster gleamed on the front wall stating that the excellent modern household furniture was to be sold by auction on friday next troubles had apparently come in battalions for dare was informed by a bystander that havills wife was seriously ill also  without staying for a moment to enter his friends house back went mr dare to the castle and told captain de stancy of the architects desperate circumstances begging him to convey the news in some way to miss power de stancy promised to make representations in the proper quarter without perceiving that he was doing the best possible deed for himself thereby  he told paula of havills misfortunes in the presence of his sister who turned pale she discerned how this misfortune would bear upon the undecided competition  poor man murmured paula he was my fathers architect and somehow expected though i did not promise it the work of rebuilding the castle  then de stancy saw dares aim in sending him to miss power with the news and seeing it concurred somerset was his rival and all was fair and is he not to have the work of the castle after expecting it he asked  paula was lost in reflection the other architects design and mr havills are exactly equal in merit and we cannot decide how to give it to either explained charlotte  that is our difficulty paula murmured a bankrupt and his wife illdear me i wonder whats the cause  he has borrowed on the expectation of having to execute the castle works and now he is unable to meet his liabilities  it is very sad said paula  let me suggest a remedy for this deadlock said de stancy  do said paula  do the work of building in two halves or sections give havill the first half since he is in need when that is finished the second half can be given to your london architect if as i understand the plans are identical except in ornamental details there will be no difficulty about it at all  paula sighedjust a little one and yet the suggestion seemed to satisfy her by its reasonableness she turned sad wayward but was impressed by de stancys manner and words she appeared indeed to have a smouldering desire to please him in the afternoon she said to charlotte i mean to do as your brother says  a note was despatched to havill that very day and in an hour the crestfallen architect presented himself at the castle paula instantly gave him audience commiserated him and commissioned him to carry out a first section of the buildings comprising work to the extent of about twenty thousand pounds expenditure and then with a prematureness quite amazing among architects clients she handed him over a cheque for five hundred pounds on account  when he had gone paulas bearing showed some sign of being disquieted at what she had done but she covered her mood under a cloak of saucy serenity perhaps a tender remembrance of a certain thunderstorm in the foregoing august when she stood with somerset in the arbour and did not own that she loved him was pressing on her memory and bewildering her she had not seen quite clearly in adopting de stancys suggestion that somerset would now have no professional reason for being at the castle for the next twelve months  but the captain had and when havill entered the castle he rejoiced with great joy dare too rejoiced in his cold way and went on with his photography saying the game progresses captain  game call it divine comedy rather said the soldier exultingly  he is practically banished for a year or more what cant you do in a year captain  havill in the meantime having respectfully withdrawn from the presence of paula passed by dare and de stancy in the gallery as he had done in entering he spoke a few words to dare who congratulated him while they were talking somebody was heard in the hall inquiring hastily for mr havill  what shall i tell him demanded the porter  his wife is dead said the messenger  havill overheard the words and hastened away  an unlucky man said dare  that happily for us will not affect his installation here said de stancy now hold your tongue and keep at a distance she may come this way  surely enough in a few minutes she came de stancy to make conversation told her of the new misfortune which had just befallen mr havill  paula was very sorry to hear it and remarked that it gave her great satisfaction to have appointed him as architect of the first wing before he learnt the bad news i owe you best thanks captain de stancy for showing me such an expedient  do i really deserve thanks asked de stancy i wish i deserved a reward but i must bear in mind the fable of the priest and the jester  i never heard it  the jester implored the priest for alms but the smallest sum was refused though the holy man readily agreed to give him his blessing query its value  how does it apply  you give me unlimited thanks but deny me the tiniest substantial trifle i desire  what persistence exclaimed paula colouring very well if you will photograph my picture you must it is really not worthy further pleading take it when you like  when paula was alone she seemed vexed with herself for having given way and rising from her seat she went quietly to the door of the room containing the picture intending to lock it up till further consideration whatever he might think of her but on casting her eyes round the apartment the painting was gone the captain wisely taking the current when it served already had it in the gallery where he was to be seen bending attentively over it arranging the lights and directing dare with the instruments on leaving he thanked her and said that he had obtained a splendid copy would she look at it  paula was severe and icy thank youi dont wish to see it she said  de stancy bowed and departed in a glow of triumph satisfied notwithstanding her frigidity that he had compassed his immediate aim which was that she might not be able to dismiss from her thoughts him and his persevering desire for the shadow of her face during the next fourandtwentyhours and his confidence was well founded she could not  i fear this divine comedy will be slow business for us captain said dare who had heard her cold words  o no said de stancy flushing a little he had not been perceiving that the lad had the measure of his mind so entirely as to gauge his position at any moment but he would show no shamefacedness even if it is my boy he answered theres plenty of time before the other can come  at that hour and minute of de stancys remark the other to look at him seemed indeed securely shelved he was sitting lonely in his chambers far away wondering why she did not write and yet hoping to hearwondering if it had all been but a shortlived strain of tenderness he knew as well as if it had been stated in words that her serious acceptance of him as a suitor would be her acceptance of him as an architectthat her schemes in love would be expressed in terms of art and conversely that her refusal of him as a lover would be neatly effected by her choosing havills plans for the castle and returning his own with thanks the position was so clear he was so well walled in by circumstances that he was absolutely helpless  to wait for the line that would not comethe letter saying that as she had desired his was the design that pleased herwas still the only thing to do the to somerset surprising accident that the committee of architects should have pronounced the designs absolutely equal in point of merit and thus have caused the final choice to revert after all to paula had been a joyous thing to him when he first heard of it full of confidence in her favour but the fact of her having again become the arbitrator though it had made acceptance of his plans all the more probable made refusal of them should it happen all the more crushing he could have conceived himself favoured by paula as her lover even had the committee decided in favour of havill as her architect but not to be chosen as architect now was to be rejected in both kinds    iv  it was the sunday following the funeral of mrs havill news of whose death had been so unexpectedly brought to her husband at the moment of his exit from stancy castle the minister as was his custom improved the occasion by a couple of sermons on the uncertainty of life one was preached in the morning in the old chapel of markton the second at evening service in the rural chapel near stancy castle built by paulas father which bore to the first somewhat the relation of an episcopal chapelofease to the mother church  the unscreened lights blazed through the plateglass windows of the smaller building and outshone the steely stars of the early night just as they had done when somerset was attracted by their glare four months before the fervid ministers rhetoric equalled its force on that more romantic occasion but paula was not there she was not a frequent attendant now at her fathers votive building the mysterious tank whose dark waters had so repelled her at the last moment was boarded over a table stood on its centre with an open quarto bible upon it behind which havill in a new suit of black sat in a large chair havill held the office of deacon and he had mechanically taken the deacons seat as usual tonight in the face of the congregation and under the nose of mr woodwell  mr woodwell was always glad of an opportunity he was gifted with a burning natural eloquence which though perhaps a little too freely employed in exciting the wertherism of the uncultivated had in it genuine power he was a master of that oratory which no limitation of knowledge can repress and which no training can impart the neighbouring rector could eclipse woodwells scholarship and the freethinker at the corner shop in markton could demolish his logic but the baptist could do in five minutes what neither of these had done in a lifetime he could move some of the hardest of men to tears  thus it happened that when the sermon was fairly under way havill began to feel himself in a trying position it was not that he had bestowed much affection upon his deceased wife irreproachable woman as she had been but the suddenness of her death had shaken his nerves and mr woodwells address on the uncertainty of life involved considerations of conduct on earth that bore with singular directness upon havills unprincipled manoeuvre for victory in the castle competition he wished he had not been so inadvertent as to take his customary chair in the chapel people who saw havills agitation did not know that it was most largely owing to his sense of the fraud which had been practised on the unoffending somerset and when unable longer to endure the torture of woodwells words he rose from his place and went into the chapel vestry the preacher little thought that remorse for a contemptibly unfair act rather than grief for a dead wife was the cause of the architects withdrawal  when havill got into the open air his morbid excitement calmed down but a sickening selfabhorrence for the proceeding instigated by dare did not abate to appropriate another mans design was no more nor less than to embezzle his money or steal his goods the intense reaction from his conduct of the past two or three months did not leave him when he reached his own house and observed where the handbills of the countermanded sale had been torn down as the result of the payment made in advance by paula of money which should really have been somersets  the mood went on intensifying when he was in bed he lay awake till the clock reached those still small ghastly hours when the vital fires burn at their lowest in the human frame and death seizes more of his victims than in any other of the twentyfour havill could bear it no longer he got a light went down into his office and wrote the note subjoined  madamthe recent death of my wife necessitates a considerable change in my professional arrangements and plans with regard to the future one of the chief results of the change is i regret to state that i no longer find myself in a position to carry out the enlargement of the castle which you had so generously entrusted to my hands  i beg leave therefore to resign all further connection with the same and to express if you will allow me a hope that the commission may be placed in the hands of the other competitor herewith is returned a cheque for onehalf of the sum so kindly advanced in anticipation of the commission i should receive the other half with which i had cleared off my immediate embarrassments before perceiving the necessity for this course shall be returned to you as soon as some payments from other clients drop ini beg to remain madam your obedient servant james havill  havill would not trust himself till the morning to post this letter he sealed it up went out with it into the street and walked through the sleeping town to the postoffice at the mouth of the box he held the letter long by dropping it he was dropping at least two thousand five hundred pounds which however obtained were now securely his it was a great deal to let go and there he stood till another wave of conscience bore in upon his soul the absolute nature of the theft and made him shudder the footsteps of a solitary policeman could be heard nearing him along the deserted street hesitation ended and he let the letter go  when he awoke in the morning he thought over the circumstances by the cheerful light of a low eastern sun the horrors of the situation seemed much less formidable yet it cannot be said that he actually regretted his act later on he walked out with the strange sense of being a man who from one having a large professional undertaking in hand had by his own act suddenly reduced himself to an unoccupied nondescript from the upper end of the town he saw in the distance the grand grey towers of stancy castle looming over the leafless trees he felt stupefied at what he had done and said to himself with bitter discontent well well what is more contemptible than a halfhearted rogue  that morning the postbag had been brought to paula and mrs goodman in the usual way and miss power read the letter his resignation was a surprise the question whether he would or would not repay the money was passed over the necessity of installing somerset after all as sole architect was an agitation or emotion the precise nature of which it is impossible to accurately define  however she went about the house after breakfast with very much the manner of one who had had a weight removed either from her heart or from her conscience moreover her face was a little flushed when in passing by somersets late studio she saw the plans bearing his motto and knew that his and not havills would be the presiding presence in the coming architectural turmoil she went on further and called to charlotte who was now regularly sleeping in the castle to accompany her and together they ascended to the telegraphroom in the donjon tower  whom are you going to telegraph to said miss de stancy when they stood by the instrument  my architect  omr havill  mr somerset  miss de stancy had schooled her emotions on that side cruelly well and she asked calmly what have you chosen him after all  there is no choice in itread that said paula handing havills letter as if she felt that providence had stepped in to shape ends that she was too undecided or unpractised to shape for herself  it is very strange murmured charlotte while paula applied herself to the machine and despatched the words   miss power stancy castle to g somerset esq fsa friba queen annes chambers st jamess  your design is accepted in its entirety it will be necessary to begin soon i shall wish to see and consult you on the matter about the 10th instant   when the message was fairly gone out of the window paula seemed still further to expand the strange spell cast over her by something or otherprobably the presence of de stancy and the weird romanticism of his manner towards her which was as if the historic past had touched her with a yet living handin a great measure became dissipated leaving her the arch and serene maiden that she had been before  about this time captain de stancy and his achates were approaching the castle and had arrived about fifty paces from the spot at which it was dares custom to drop behind his companion in order that their appearance at the lodge should be that of master and man  dare was saying as he had said before i cant help fancying captain that your approach to this castle and its mistress is by a very tedious system your trenches zigzags counterscarps and ravelins may be all very well and a very sure system of attack in the long run but upon my soul they are almost as slow in maturing as those of uncle toby himself for my part i should be inclined to try an assault  dont pretend to give advice willy on matters beyond your years  i only meant it for your good and your proper advancement in the world said dare in wounded tones  different characters different systems returned the soldier this lady is of a reticent independent complicated disposition and any sudden proceeding would put her on her mettle you dont dream what my impatience is my boy it is a thing transcending your utmost conceptions but i proceed slowly i know better than to do otherwise thank god there is plenty of time as long as there is no risk of somersets return my situation is sure  and professional etiquette will prevent him coming yet havill and he will change like the men in a sentrybox when havill walks out hell walk in and not a moment before  that will not be till eighteen months have passed and as the jesuit said time and i against any two now drop to the rear added captain de stancy authoritatively and they passed under the walls of the castle  the grave fronts and bastions were wrapped in silence so much so that standing awhile in the inner ward they could hear through an open window a faintly clicking sound from within  shes at the telegraph said dare throwing forward his voice softly to the captain what can that be for so early that wire is a nuisance to my mind such constant intercourse with the outer world is bad for our romance  the speaker entered to arrange his photographic apparatus of which in truth he was getting weary and de stancy smoked on the terrace till dare should be ready while he waited his sister looked out upon him from an upper casement having caught sight of him as she came from paula in the telegraphroom  well lottie what news this morning he said gaily  nothing of importance we are quite well she added with hesitation there is one piece of news mr havillbut perhaps you have heard it in markton  nothing  mr havill has resigned his appointment as architect to the castle  whatwho has it then  mr somerset  appointed  yesby telegraph  when is he coming said de stancy in consternation  about the tenth we think  charlotte was concerned to see her brothers face and withdrew from the window that he might not question her further de stancy went into the hall and on to the gallery where dare was standing as still as a caryatid  i have heard every word said dare  well what does it mean has that fool havill done it on purpose to annoy me what conceivable reason can the man have for throwing up an appointment he has worked so hard for at the moment he has got it and in the time of his greatest need  dare guessed for he had seen a little way into havills soul during the brief period of their confederacy but he was very far from saying what he guessed yet he unconsciously revealed by other words the nocturnal shades in his character which had made that confederacy possible  somerset coming after all he replied by god that little sixbarrelled friend of mine and a good resolution and he would never arrive  what said captain de stancy paling with horror as he gathered the others sinister meaning  dare instantly recollected himself one is tempted to say anything at such a moment he replied hastily  since he is to come let him come for me continued de stancy with reactionary distinctness and still gazing gravely into the young mans face the battle shall be fairly fought out fair play even to a rivalremember that boy why are you hereunnaturally concerning yourself with the passions of a man of my age as if you were the parent and i the son would to heaven willy you had done as i wished you to do and led the life of a steady thoughtful young man instead of meddling here you should now have been in some studio college or professional mans chambers engaged in a useful pursuit which might have made one proud to own you but you were so precocious and headstrong and this is what you have come to you promise to be worthless  i think i shall go to my lodgings today instead of staying here over these pictures said dare after a silence during which captain de stancy endeavoured to calm himself i was going to tell you that my dinner today will unfortunately be one of herbs for want of the needful i have come to my last stiveryou dine at the mess i suppose captain  de stancy had walked away but dare knew that he played a pretty sure card in that speech de stancys heart could not withstand the suggested contrast between a lonely meal of breadandcheese and a wellordered dinner amid cheerful companions here he said emptying his pocket and returning to the lads side take this and order yourself a good meal you keep me as poor as a crow there shall be more tomorrow  the peculiarly bifold nature of captain de stancy as shown in his conduct at different times was something rare in life and perhaps happily so that mechanical admixture of black and white qualities without coalescence on which the theory of mens characters was based by moral analysis before the rise of modern ethical schools fictitious as it was in general application would have almost hit off the truth as regards captain de stancy removed to some halfknown century his deeds would have won a picturesqueness of light and shade that might have made him a fascinating subject for some gallery of illustrious historical personages it was this tendency to moral chequerwork which accounted for his varied bearings towards dare  dare withdrew to take his departure when he had gone a few steps despondent he suddenly turned and ran back with some excitement  captainhes coming on the tenth dont they say well four days before the tenth comes the sixth have you forgotten whats fixed for the sixth  i had quite forgotten  that day will be worth three months of quiet attentions with luck skill and a bold heart what maynt you do  captain de stancys face softened with satisfaction  there is something in that the game is not up after all the sixthit had gone clean out of my head by gad    v  the cheering message from paula to somerset sped through the loophole of stancy castle keep over the trees along the railway under bridges across four countiesfrom extreme antiquity of environment to sheer modernismand finally landed itself on a table in somersets chambers in the midst of a cloud of fog he read it and in the moment of reaction from the depression of his past days clapped his hands like a child  then he considered the date at which she wanted to see him had she so worded her despatch he would have gone that very day but there was nothing to complain of in her giving him a weeks notice pure maiden modesty might have checked her indulgence in a too ardent recall  time however dragged somewhat heavily along in the interim and on the second day he thought he would call on his father and tell him of his success in obtaining the appointment  the elder mr somerset lived in a detached house in the northwest part of fashionable london and ascending the chief staircase the young man branched off from the first landing and entered his fathers paintingroom it was an hour when he was pretty sure of finding the wellknown painter at work and on lifting the tapestry he was not disappointed mr somerset being busily engaged with his back towards the door  art and vitiated nature were struggling like wrestlers in that apartment and art was getting the worst of it the overpowering gloom pervading the clammy air rendered still more intense by the height of the window from the floor reduced all the pictures that were standing around to the wizened feebleness of corpses on end the shadowy parts of the room behind the different easels were veiled in a brown vapour precluding all estimate of the extent of the studio and only subdued in the foreground by the ruddy glare from an open stove of dutch tiles somersets footsteps had been so noiseless over the carpeting of the stairs and landing that his father was unaware of his presence he continued at his work as before which he performed by the help of a complicated apparatus of lamps candles and reflectors so arranged as to eke out the miserable daylight to a power apparently sufficient for the neutral touches on which he was at that moment engaged  the first thought of an unsophisticated stranger on entering that room could only be the amazed inquiry why a professor of the art of colour which beyond all other arts requires pure daylight for its exercise should fix himself on the single square league in habitable europe to which light is denied at noonday for weeks in succession  o its you george is it said the academician turning from the lamps which shone over his bald crown at such a slant as to reveal every cranial irregularity how are you this morning still a dead silence about your grand castle competition  somerset told the news his father duly congratulated him and added genially it is well to be you george one large commission to attend to and nothing to distract you from it i am bothered by having a dozen irons in the fire at once and people are so unreasonableonly this morning among other things when you got your order to go on with your single study i received a letter from a woman an old friend whom i can scarcely refuse begging me as a great favour to design her a set of theatrical costumes in which she and her friends can perform for some charity it would occupy me a good week to go into the subject and do the thing properly such are the sort of letters i get i wish george you could knock out something for her before you leave town it is positively impossible for me to do it with all this work in hand and these eternal fogs to contend against  i fear costumes are rather out of my line said the son however ill do what i can what period and country are they to represent  his father didnt know he had never looked at the play of late years it was loves labours lost you had better read it for yourself he said and do the best you can  during the morning somerset junior found time to refresh his memory of the play and afterwards went and hunted up materials for designs to suit the same which occupied his spare hours for the next three days as these occupations made no great demands upon his reasoning faculties he mostly found his mind wandering off to imaginary scenes at stancy castle particularly did he dwell at this time upon paulas lively interest in the history relics tombs architecturenay the very christian names of the de stancy line and her artistic preference for charlottes ancestors instead of her own yet what more natural than that a clever meditative girl encased in the feudal lumber of that family should imbibe at least an antiquarian interest in it human nature at bottom is romantic rather than ascetic and the local habitation which accident had provided for paula was perhaps acting as a solvent of the hard morbidly introspective views thrust upon her in early life  somerset wondered if his own possession of a substantial genealogy like captain de stancys would have had any appreciable effect upon her regard for him his suggestion to paula of her belonging to a worthy strain of engineers had been based on his content with his own intellectual line of descent through pheidias ictinus and callicrates chersiphron vitruvius wilars of cambray william of wykeham and the rest of that long and illustrious roll but miss powers marked preference for an animal pedigree led him to muse on what he could show for himself in that kind  these thoughts so far occupied him that when he took the sketches to his father on the morning of the fifth he was led to ask has any one ever sifted out our family pedigree  family pedigree  yes have we any pedigree worthy to be compared with that of professedly old families i never remember hearing of any ancestor further back than my greatgrandfather  somerset the elder reflected and said that he believed there was a genealogical tree about the house somewhere reaching back to a very respectable distance not that i ever took much interest in it he continued without looking up from his canvas but your great uncle john was a man with a taste for those subjects and he drew up such a sheet he made several copies on parchment and gave one to each of his brothers and sisters the one he gave to my father is still in my possession i think  somerset said that he should like to see it but halfanhours search about the house failed to discover the document and the academician then remembered that it was in an iron box at his bankers he had used it as a wrapper for some titledeeds and other valuable writings which were deposited there for safety why do you want it he inquired  the young man confessed his whim to know if his own antiquity would bear comparison with that of another person whose name he did not mention whereupon his father gave him a key that would fit the said chest if he meant to pursue the subject further somerset however did nothing in the matter that day but the next morning having to call at the bank on other business he remembered his new fancy  it was about eleven oclock the fog though not so brown as it had been on previous days was still dense enough to necessitate lights in the shops and offices when somerset had finished his business in the outer office of the bank he went to the managers room the hour being somewhat early the only persons present in that sanctuary of balances besides the manager who welcomed him were two gentlemen apparently lawyers who sat talking earnestly over a box of papers the manager on learning what somerset wanted unlocked a door from which a flight of stone steps led to the vaults and sent down a clerk and a porter for the safe  before however they had descended far a gentle tap came to the door and in response to an invitation to enter a lady appeared wrapped up in furs to her very nose  the manager seemed to recognize her for he went across the room in a moment and set her a chair at the middle table replying to some observation of hers with the words o yes certainly in a deferential tone  i should like it brought up at once said the lady  somerset who had seated himself at a table in a somewhat obscure corner screened by the lawyers started at the words the voice was miss powers and so plainly enough was the figure as soon as he examined it her back was towards him and either because the room was only lighted in two places or because she was absorbed in her own concerns she seemed to be unconscious of any ones presence on the scene except the banker and herself the former called back the clerk and two other porters having been summoned they disappeared to get whatever she required  somerset somewhat excited sat wondering what could have brought paula to london at this juncture and was in some doubt if the occasion were a suitable one for revealing himself her errand to her banker being possibly of a very private nature nothing helped him to a decision paula never once turned her head and the progress of time was marked only by the murmurs of the two lawyers and the ceaseless clash of gold and rattle of scales from the outer room where the busy heads of cashiers could be seen through the partition moving about under the globes of the gaslamps  footsteps were heard upon the cellarsteps and the three men previously sent below staggered from the doorway bearing a huge safe which nearly broke them down somerset knew that his fathers box or boxes could boast of no such dimensions and he was not surprised to see the chest deposited in front of miss power when the immense accumulation of dust had been cleared off the lid and the chest conveniently placed for her somerset was attended to his modest box being brought up by one man unassisted and without much expenditure of breath  his interest in paula was of so emotional a cast that his attention to his own errand was of the most perfunctory kind she was close to a gasstandard and the lawyers whose seats had intervened having finished their business and gone away all her actions were visible to him while he was opening his fathers box the manager assisted paula to unseal and unlock hers and he now saw her lift from it a morocco case which she placed on the table before her and unfastened out of it she took a dazzling object that fell like a cascade over her fingers it was a necklace of diamonds and pearls apparently of large size and many strands though he was not near enough to see distinctly when satisfied by her examination that she had got the right article she shut it into its case  the manager closed the chest for her and when it was again secured paula arose tossed the necklace into her handbag bowed to the manager and was about to bid him good morning thereupon he said with some hesitation pardon one question miss power do you intend to take those jewels far  yes she said simply to stancy castle  you are going straight there  i have one or two places to call at first  i would suggest that you carry them in some other wayby fastening them into the pocket of your dress for instance  but i am going to hold the bag in my hand and never once let it go  the banker slightly shook his head suppose your carriage gets overturned you would let it go then  perhaps so  or if you saw a child under the wheels just as you were stepping in or if you accidentally stumbled in getting out or if there was a collision on the railwayyou might let it go  yes i see i was too careless i thank you  paula removed the necklace from the bag turned her back to the manager and spent several minutes in placing her treasure in her bosom pinning it and otherwise making it absolutely secure  thats it said the greyhaired man of caution with evident satisfaction there is not much danger now you are not travelling alone  paula replied that she was not alone and went to the door there was one moment during which somerset might have conveniently made his presence known but the juxtaposition of the bankmanager and his own disarranged box of securities embarrassed him the moment slipped by and she was gone  in the meantime he had mechanically unearthed the pedigree and locking up his fathers chest somerset also took his departure at the heels of paula he walked along the misty street so deeply musing as to be quite unconscious of the direction of his walk what he inquired of himself could she want that necklace for so suddenly he recollected a remark of dares to the effect that her appearance on a particular occasion at stancy castle had been magnificent by reason of the jewels she wore which proved that she had retained a sufficient quantity of those valuables at the castle for ordinary requirements what exceptional occasion then was impending on which she wished to glorify herself beyond all previous experience he could not guess he was interrupted in these conjectures by a carriage nearly passing over his toes at a crossing in bond street looking up he saw between the two windows of the vehicle the profile of a thickly mantled bosom on which a camellia rose and fell all the remainder part of the ladys person was hidden but he remembered that flower of convenient season as one which had figured in the bank parlour halfanhour earlier today  somerset hastened after the carriage and in a minute saw it stop opposite a jewellers shop out came paula and then another woman in whom he recognized mrs birch one of the ladys maids at stancy castle the young man was at paulas side before she had crossed the pavement    vi  a quick arrested expression in her two sapphirine eyes accompanied by a little a very little blush which loitered long was all the outward disturbance that the sight of her lover caused the habit of selfrepression at any new emotional impact was instinctive with her always somerset could not say more than a word he looked his intense solicitude and paula spoke  she declared that this was an unexpected pleasure had he arranged to come on the tenth as she wished how strange that they should meet thusand yet not strangethe world was so small  somerset said that he was coming on the very day she mentionedthat the appointment gave him infinite gratification which was quite within the truth  come into this shop with me said paula with goodhumoured authoritativeness  they entered the shop and talked on while she made a small purchase but not a word did paula say of her sudden errand to town  i am having an exciting morning she said i am going from here to catch the oneoclock train to markton  it is important that you get there this afternoon i suppose  yes you know why  not at all  the hunt ball it was fixed for the sixth and this is the sixth i thought they might have asked you  no said somerset a trifle gloomily no i am not asked but it is a great task for youa long journey and a ball all in one day  yes charlotte said that but i dont mind it  you are glad you are going are you glad he said softly  her air confessed more than her words i am not so very glad that i am going to the hunt ball she replied confidentially  thanks for that said he  she lifted her eyes to his for a moment her manner had suddenly become so nearly the counterpart of that in the teahouse that to suspect any deterioration of affection in her was no longer generous it was only as if a thin layer of recent events had overlaid her memories of him until his presence swept them away  somerset looked up and finding the shopman to be still some way off he added when will you assure me of something in return for what i assured you that evening in the rain  not before you have built the castle my aunt does not know about it yet nor anybody  i ought to tell her  no not yet i dont wish it  then everything stands as usual  she lightly nodded  that is i may love you but you still will not say you love me  she nodded again and directing his attention to the advancing shopman said please not a word more  soon after this they left the jewellers and parted paula driving straight off to the station and somerset going on his way uncertainly happy his reimpression after a few minutes was that a special journey to town to fetch that magnificent necklace which she had not once mentioned to him but which was plainly to be the medium of some proud purpose with her this evening was hardly in harmony with her assertions of indifference to the attractions of the hunt ball  he got into a cab and drove to his club where he lunched and mopingly spent a great part of the afternoon in making calculations for the foundations of the castle works later in the afternoon he returned to his chambers wishing that he could annihilate the three days remaining before the tenth particularly this coming evening on his table was a letter in a strange writing and indifferently turning it over he found from the superscription that it had been addressed to him days before at the lordquantockarms hotel markton where it had lain ever since the landlord probably expecting him to return opening the missive he found to his surprise that it was after all an invitation to the hunt ball  too late said somerset to think i should be served this trick a second time  after a moments pause however he looked to see the time of day it was five minutes past fivejust about the hour when paula would be driving from markton station to stancy castle to rest and prepare herself for her evening triumph there was a train at six oclock timed to reach markton between eleven and twelve which by great exertion he might save even now if it were worth while to undertake such a scramble for the pleasure of dropping in to the ball at a late hour a moments vision of paula moving to swift tunes on the arm of a person or persons unknown was enough to impart the impetus required he jumped up flung his dress clothes into a portmanteau sent down to call a cab and in a few minutes was rattling off to the railway which had borne paula away from london just five hours earlier  once in the train he began to consider where and how he could most conveniently dress for the dance the train would certainly be halfanhour late halfanhour would be spent in getting to the townhall and that was the utmost delay tolerable if he would secure the hand of paula for one spin or be more than a mere dummy behind the earlier arrivals he looked for an empty compartment at the next stoppage and finding the one next his own unoccupied he entered it and changed his raiment for that in his portmanteau during the ensuing run of twenty miles  thus prepared he awaited the markton platform which was reached as the clock struck twelve somerset called a fly and drove at once to the townhall  the borough natives had ascended to their upper floors and were putting out their candles one by one as he passed along the streets but the lively strains that proceeded from the central edifice revealed distinctly enough what was going on among the temporary visitors from the neighbouring manors the doors were opened for him and entering the vestibule lined with flags flowers evergreens and escutcheons he stood looking into the furnace of gaiety beyond  it was some time before he could gather his impressions of the scene so perplexing were the lights the motions the toilets the fulldress uniforms of officers and the harmonies of sound yet light sound and movement were not so much the essence of that giddy scene as an intense aim at obliviousness in the beings composing it for two or three hours at least those whirling young people meant not to know that they were mortal the room was beating like a heart and the pulse was regulated by the trembling strings of the most popular quadrille band in wessex but at last his eyes grew settled enough to look critically around  the room was crowdedtoo crowded every variety of fair one beauties primary secondary and tertiary appeared among the personages composing the throng there were suns and moons also pale planets of little account broadly speaking these daughters of the county fell into two classes one the pinkfaced unsophisticated girls from neighbouring rectories and small countryhouses who knew not town except for an occasional fortnight and who spent their time from easter to lammas day much as they spent it during the remaining nine months of the year the other class were the children of the wealthy landowners who migrated each season to the townhouse these were pale and collected showed less enjoyment in their countenances and wore in general an approximation to the languid manners of the capital  a quadrille was in progress and somerset scanned each set his mind had run so long upon the necklace that his glance involuntarily sought out that gleaming object rather than the personality of its wearer at the top of the room there he beheld it but it was on the neck of charlotte de stancy  the whole lucid explanation broke across his understanding in a second his dear paula had fetched the necklace that charlotte should not appear to disadvantage among the county people by reason of her poverty it was generously donea disinterested act of sisterly kindness theirs was the friendship of hermia and helena before he had got further than to realize this there wheeled round amongst the dancers a lady whose tournure he recognized well she was paula and to the young mans vision a superlative something distinguished her from all the rest this was not dress or ornament for she had hardly a gem upon her her attire being a model of effective simplicity her partner was captain de stancy  the discovery of this latter fact slightly obscured his appreciation of what he had discovered just before it was with rather a lowering brow that he asked himself whether paulas predilection dartiste as she called it for the de stancy line might not lead to a predilection of a different sort for its last representative which would be not at all satisfactory  the architect remained in the background till the dance drew to a conclusion and then he went forward the circumstance of having met him by accident once already that day seemed to quench any surprise in miss powers bosom at seeing him now there was nothing in her parting from captain de stancy when he led her to a seat calculated to make somerset uneasy after his long absence though for that matter this proved nothing for like all wise maidens paula never ventured on the game of the eyes with a lover in public well knowing that every moment of such indulgence overnight might mean an hours sneer at her expense by the indulged gentleman next day when weighing womankind by the aid of a cold morning light and a bad headache  while somerset was explaining to paula and her aunt the reason of his sudden appearance their attention was drawn to a seat a short way off by a fluttering of ladies round the spot in a moment it was whispered that somebody had fallen ill and in another that the sufferer was miss de stancy paula mrs goodman and somerset at once joined the group of friends who were assisting her neither of them imagined for an instant that the unexpected advent of somerset on the scene had anything to do with the poor girls indisposition  she was assisted out of the room and her brother who now came up prepared to take her home somerset exchanging a few civil words with him which the hurry of the moment prevented them from continuing though on taking his leave with charlotte who was now better de stancy informed somerset in answer to a cursory inquiry that he hoped to be back again at the ball in halfanhour  when they were gone somerset feeling that now another dog might have his day sounded paula on the delightful question of a dance  paula replied in the negative  how is that asked somerset with reproachful disappointment  i cannot dance again she said in a somewhat depressed tone i must be released from every engagement to do so on account of charlottes illness i should have gone home with her if i had not been particularly requested to stay a little longer since it is as yet so early and charlottes illness is not very serious  if charlottes illness was not very serious somerset thought paula might have stretched a point but not wishing to hinder her in showing respect to a friend so well liked by himself he did not ask it de stancy had promised to be back again in halfanhour and paula had heard the promise but at the end of twenty minutes still seeming indifferent to what was going on around her she said she would stay no longer and reminding somerset that they were soon to meet and talk over the rebuilding drove off with her aunt to stancy castle  somerset stood looking after the retreating carriage till it was enveloped in shades that the lamps could not disperse the ballroom was now virtually empty for him and feeling no great anxiety to return thither he stood on the steps for some minutes longer looking into the calm mild night and at the dark houses behind whose blinds lay the burghers with their eyes sealed up in sleep he could not but think that it was rather too bad of paula to spoil his evening for a sentimental devotion to charlotte which could do the latter no appreciable good and he would have felt seriously hurt at her move if it had not been equally severe upon captain de stancy who was doubtless hastening back full of a belief that she would still be found there  the star of gasjets over the entrance threw its light upon the walls on the opposite side of the street where there were noticeboards of forthcoming events in glancing over these for the fifth time his eye was attracted by the first words of a placard in blue letters of a size larger than the rest and moving onward a few steps he read                       stancy castle             by the kind permission of miss power                          a play         will shortly be performed at the above castle                  in aid of the funds of the                       county hospital                    by the officers of the                    royal horse artillery                       markton barracks                      assisted by several                  ladies of the neighbourhood    the cast and other particulars will be duly announced in small  bills  places will be reserved on application to mr clangham  high street markton where a plan of the room may be seen    nbthe castle is about twenty minutes drive from markton station  to which there are numerous convenient trains from all parts of the  county    in a profound study somerset turned and reentered the ballroom where he remained gloomily standing here and there for about five minutes at the end of which he observed captain de stancy who had returned punctually to his word crossing the hall in his direction  the gallant officer darted glances of lively search over every group of dancers and sitters and then with rather a blank look in his face he came on to somerset replying to the latters inquiry for his sister that she had nearly recovered he said i dont see my fathers neighbours anywhere  they have gone home replied somerset a trifle drily they asked me to make their apologies to you for leading you to expect they would remain miss power was too anxious about miss de stancy to care to stay longer  the eyes of de stancy and the speaker met for an instant that curious guarded understanding or inimical confederacy which arises at moments between two men in love with the same woman was present here and in their mutual glances each said as plainly as by words that her departure had ruined his evenings hope  they were now about as much in one mood as it was possible for two such differing natures to be neither cared further for elaborating giddy curves on that townhall floor they stood talking languidly about this and that local topic till de stancy turned aside for a short time to speak to a dapper little lady who had beckoned to him in a few minutes he came back to somerset  mrs camperton the wife of major camperton of my battery would very much like me to introduce you to her she is an old friend of your fathers and has wanted to know you for a long time  de stancy and somerset crossed over to the lady and in a few minutes thanks to her flow of spirits she and somerset were chatting with remarkable freedom  it is a happy coincidence continued mrs camperton that i should have met you here immediately after receiving a letter from your father indeed it reached me only this morning he has been so kind we are getting up some theatricals as you know i suppose to help the funds of the county hospital which is in debt  i have just seen the announcementnothing more  yes such an estimable purpose and as we wished to do it thoroughly well i asked mr somerset to design us the costumes and he has now sent me the sketches it is quite a secret at present but we are going to play shakespeares romantic drama loves labours lost and we hope to get miss power to take the leading part you see being such a handsome girl and so wealthy and rather an undiscovered novelty in the county as yet she would draw a crowded room and greatly benefit the funds  miss power going to play herselfi am rather surprised said somerset whose idea is all this  o captain de stancyshes the originator entirely you see he is so interested in the neighbourhood his family having been connected with it for so many centuries that naturally a charitable object of this local nature appeals to his feelings  naturally her listener laconically repeated and have you settled who is to play the junior gentlemans part leading lover hero or whatever he is called  not absolutely though i think captain de stancy will not refuse it and he is a very good figure at present it lies between him and mr mild one of our young lieutenants my husband of course takes the heavy line and i am to be the second lady though i am rather too old for the part really if we can only secure miss power for heroine the cast will be excellent  excellent said somerset with a spectral smile    vii  when he awoke the next morning at the lordquantockarms hotel somerset felt quite morbid on recalling the intelligence he had received from mrs camperton but as the day for serious practical consultation about the castle works to which paula had playfully alluded was now close at hand he determined to banish sentimental reflections on the frailties that were besieging her nature by active preparation for his professional undertaking to be her highpriest in art to elaborate a structure whose cunning workmanship would be meeting her eye every day till the end of her natural life and saying to her he invented it with all the eloquence of an inanimate thing long regardedthis was no mean satisfaction come what else would  he returned to town the next day to set matters there in such trim that no inconvenience should result from his prolonged absence at the castle for having no other commission he determined with an eye rather to heartinterests than to increasing his professional practice to make as before the castle itself his office studio and chief abidingplace till the works were fairly in progress  on the tenth he reappeared at markton passing through the town on the road to stancy castle his eyes were again arrested by the noticeboard which had conveyed such startling information to him on the night of the ball the small bills now appeared thereon but when he anxiously looked them over to learn how the parts were to be allotted he found that intelligence still withheld yet they told enough the list of ladyplayers was given and miss powers name was one  that a young lady who six months ago would scarcely join for conscientious reasons in a simple dance on her own lawn should now be willing to exhibit herself on a public stage simulating lovepassages with a stranger argued a rate of development which under any circumstances would have surprised him but which with the particular addition as leading colleague of captain de stancy inflamed him almost to anger what clandestine arrangements had been going on in his absence to produce such a fullblown intention it were futile to guess paulas course was a race rather than a march and each successive heat was startling in its eclipse of that which went before  somerset was however introspective enough to know that his morals would have taken no such virtuous alarm had he been the chief male player instead of captain de stancy  he passed under the castlearch and entered there seemed a little turn in the tide of affairs when it was announced to him that miss power expected him and was alone  the wellknown antechambers through which he walked filled with twilight draughts and thin echoes that seemed to reverberate from two hundred years ago did not delay his eye as they had done when he had been ignorant that his destiny lay beyond and he followed on through all this ancientness to where the modern paula sat to receive him  he forgot everything in the pleasure of being alone in a room with her she met his eye with that in her own which cheered him it was a light expressing that something was understood between them she said quietly in two or three words that she had expected him in the forenoon  somerset explained that he had come only that morning from london  after a little more talk in which she said that her aunt would join them in a few minutes and miss de stancy was still indisposed at her fathers house she rang for tea and sat down beside a little table  shall we proceed to business at once she asked him  i suppose so  first then when will the working drawings be ready which i think you said must be made out before the work could begin  while somerset informed her on this and other matters mrs goodman entered and joined in the discussion after which they found it would be necessary to adjourn to the room where the plans were hanging on their walk thither paula asked if he stayed late at the ball  i left soon after you  that was very early seeing how late you arrived  yes i did not dance  what did you do then  i moped and walked to the door and saw an announcement  i knowthe play that is to be performed  in which you are to be the princess  thats not settledi have not agreed yet i shall not play the princess of france unless mr mild plays the king of navarre  this sounded rather well the princess was the lady beloved by the king and mr mild the young lieutenant of artillery was a diffident inexperienced rather plainlooking fellow whose sole interest in theatricals lay in the consideration of his costume and the sound of his own voice in the ears of the audience with such an unobjectionable person to enact the part of lover the prominent character of leading young lady or heroine which paula was to personate was really the most satisfactory in the whole list for her for although she was to be wooed hard there was just as much lovemaking among the remaining personages while as somerset had understood the play there could occur no flingings of her person upon her lovers neck or agonized downfalls upon the stage in her whole performance as there were in the parts chosen by mrs camperton the majors wife and some of the other ladies  why do you play at all he murmured  what a question how could i refuse for such an excellent purpose they say that my taking a part will be worth a hundred pounds to the charity my father always supported the hospital which is quite undenominational and he said i was to do the same  do you think the peculiar means you have adopted for supporting it entered into his view inquired somerset regarding her with critical dryness for my part i dont  it is an interesting way she returned persuasively though apparently in a state of mental equipoise on the point raised by his question and i shall not play the princess as i said to any other than that quiet young man now i assure you of this so dont be angry and absurd besides the king doesnt marry me at the end of the play as in shakespeares other comedies and if miss de stancy continues seriously unwell i shall not play at all  the young man pressed her hand but she gently slipped it away  are we not engaged paula he asked she evasively shook her head  comeyes we are shall we tell your aunt he continued unluckily at that moment mrs goodman who had followed them to the studio at a slower pace appeared round the doorway  noto the last replied paula hastily then her aunt entered and the conversation was no longer personal  somerset took his departure in a serener mood though not completely assured    viii  his serenity continued during two or three following days when continuing at the castle he got pleasant glimpses of paula now and then her strong desire that his love for her should be kept secret perplexed him but his affection was generous and he acquiesced in that desire  meanwhile news of the forthcoming dramatic performance radiated in every direction and in the next number of the county paper it was announced to somersets comparative satisfaction that the cast was definitely settled mr mild having agreed to be the king and miss power the french princess captain de stancy with becoming modesty for one who was the leading spirit figured quite low down in the secondary character of sir nathaniel  somerset remembered that by a happy chance the costume he had designed for sir nathaniel was not at all picturesque moreover sir nathaniel scarcely came near the princess through the whole play  every day after this there was coming and going to and from the castle of railway vans laden with canvas columns pasteboard trees limp housefronts woollen lawns and lath balustrades there were also frequent arrivals of young ladies from neighbouring country houses and warriors from the x and y batteries of artillery distinguishable by their regulation shaving  but it was upon captain de stancy and mrs camperton that the weight of preparation fell somerset through being much occupied in the drawingoffice was seldom present during the consultations and rehearsals until one day tea being served in the drawingroom at the usual hour he dropped in with the rest to receive a cup from paulas table the chatter was tremendous and somerset was at once consulted about some necessary carpentry which was to be specially made at markton after that he was looked on as one of the band which resulted in a large addition to the number of his acquaintance in this part of england  but his own feeling was that of being an outsider still this vagary had been originated the play chosen the parts allotted all in his absence and calling him in at the last moment might if flirtation were possible in paula be but a sop to pacify him what would he have given to impersonate her lover in the piece but neither paula nor any one else had asked him  the eventful evening came somerset had been engaged during the day with the different people by whom the works were to be carried out and in the evening went to his rooms at the lordquantockarms markton where he dined he did not return to the castle till the hour fixed for the performance and having been received by mrs goodman entered the large apartment now transfigured into a theatre like any other spectator  rumours of the projected representation had spread far and wide six times the number of tickets issued might have been readily sold friends and acquaintances of the actors came from curiosity to see how they would acquit themselves while other classes of people came because they were eager to see wellknown notabilities in unwonted situations when ladies hitherto only beheld in frigid impenetrable positions behind their coachmen in markton high street were about to reveal their hidden traits home attitudes intimate smiles nods and perhaps kisses to the public eye it was a throwing open of fascinating social secrets not to be missed for money  the performance opened with no further delay than was occasioned by the customary refusal of the curtain at these times to rise more than two feet six inches but this hitch was remedied and the play began it was with no enviable emotion that somerset who was watching intently saw not mr mild but captain de stancy enter as the king of navarre  somerset as a friend of the family had had a seat reserved for him next to that of mrs goodman and turning to her he said with some excitement i understood that mr mild had agreed to take that part  yes she said in a whisper so he had but he broke down luckily captain de stancy was familiar with the part through having coached the others so persistently and he undertook it offhand being about the same figure as lieutenant mild the same dress fits him with a little alteration by the tailor  it did fit him indeed and of the male costumes it was that on which somerset had bestowed most pains when designing them it shrewdly burst upon his mind that there might have been collusion between mild and de stancy the former agreeing to take the captains place and act as blind till the last moment a greater question was could paula have been aware of this and would she perform as the princess of france now de stancy was to be her lover  does miss power know of this change he inquired  she did not till quite a short time ago  he controlled his impatience till the beginning of the second act the princess entered it was paula but whether the slight embarrassment with which she pronounced her opening words       good lord boyet my beauty though but mean       needs not the painted flourish of your praise  was due to the newness of her situation or to her knowledge that de stancy had usurped milds part of her lover he could not guess de stancy appeared and somerset felt grim as he listened to the gallant captains salutation of the princess and her response    de s   fair princess welcome to the court of navarre   paula  fair i give you back again  and welcome i have not yet  somerset listened to this and to all that which followed of the same sort with the reflection that after all the princess never throughout the piece compromised her dignity by showing her love for the king and that the latter never addressed her in words in which passion got the better of courtesy moreover as paula had herself observed they did not marry at the end of the piece as in shakespeares other comedies somewhat calm in this assurance he waited on while the other couples respectively indulged in their lovemaking and banter including mrs camperton as the sprightly rosaline but he was doomed to be surprised out of his humour when the end of the act came on in abridging the play for the convenience of representation the favours or gifts from the gentlemen to the ladies were personally presented and now somerset saw de stancy advance with the necklace fetched by paula from london and clasp it on her neck  this seemed to throw a less pleasant light on her hasty journey to fetch a valuable ornament to lend it to a poorer friend was estimable but to fetch it that the friends brother should have something magnificent to use as a lovers offering to herself in public that wore a different complexion and if the article were recognized by the spectators as the same that charlotte had worn at the ball the presentation by de stancy of what must seem to be an heirloom of his house would be read as symbolizing a union of the families  de stancys mode of presenting the necklace though unauthorized by shakespeare had the full approval of the company and set them in good humour to receive major camperton as armado the braggart nothing calculated to stimulate jealousy occurred again till the fifth act and then there arose full cause for it  the scene was the outside of the princesss pavilion de stancy as the king of navarre stood with his group of attendants awaiting the princess who presently entered from her door the two began to converse as the play appointed de stancy turning to her with this reply       rebuke me not for that which you provoke       the virtue of your eye must break my oath  so far all was well and paula opened her lips for the set rejoinder but before she had spoken de stancy continued       if i profane with my unworthy hand                                     taking her hand       this holy shrine the gentle fine is this       my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand       to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss  somerset stared surely in this comedy the king never addressed the princess in such warm words and yet they were shakespeares for they were quite familiar to him a dim suspicion crossed his mind mrs goodman had brought a copy of shakespeare with her which she kept in her lap and never looked at borrowing it somerset turned to romeo and juliet and there he saw the words which de stancy had introduced as gag to intensify the mild lovemaking of the other play meanwhile de stancy continued       o then dear saint let lips do what hands do       they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair       then move not while my prayers effect i take       thus from my lips by yours my sin is purgd  could it be that de stancy was going to do what came next in the stage directionkiss her before there was time for conjecture on that point the sound of a very sweet and longdrawn osculation spread through the room followed by loud applause from the people in the cheap seats de stancy withdrew from bending over paula and she was very red in the face nothing seemed clearer than that he had actually done the deed the applause continuing somerset turned his head five hundred faces had regarded the act without a consciousness that it was an interpolation and four hundred and fifty mouths in those faces were smiling about one half of them were tender smiles these came from the women the other half were at best humorous and mainly satirical these came from the men it was a profanation without parallel and his face blazed like a coal  the play was now nearly at an end and somerset sat on feeling what he could not express more than ever was he assured that there had been collusion between the two artillery officers to bring about this end that he should have been the unhappy man to design those picturesque dresses in which his rival so audaciously played the lover to his somersets mistress was an added point to the satire he could hardly go so far as to assume that paula was a consenting party to this startling interlude but her otherwise unaccountable wish that his own love should be clandestinely shown lent immense force to a doubt of her sincerity the ghastly thought that she had merely been keeping him on like a pet spaniel to amuse her leisure moments till she should have found appropriate opportunity for an open engagement with some one else trusting to his sense of chivalry to keep secret their little episode filled him with a grim heat    ix  at the back of the room the applause had been loud at the moment of the kiss real or counterfeit the cause was partly owing to an exceptional circumstance which had occurred in that quarter early in the play  the people had all seated themselves and the first act had begun when the tapestry that screened the door was lifted gently and a figure appeared in the opening the general attention was at this moment absorbed by the newly disclosed stage and scarcely a soul noticed the stranger had any one of the audience turned his head there would have been sufficient in the countenance to detain his gaze notwithstanding the counterattraction forward  he was obviously a man who had come from afar there was not a square inch about him that had anything to do with modern english life his visage which was of the colour of light porphyry had little of its original surface left it was a face which had been the plaything of strange fires or pestilences that had moulded to whatever shape they chose his originally supple skin and left it pitted puckered and seamed like a dried watercourse but though dire catastrophes or the treacherous airs of remote climates had done their worst upon his exterior they seemed to have affected him but little within to judge from a certain robustness which showed itself in his manner of standing  the facemarks had a meaning for any one who could read them beyond the mere suggestion of their origin they signified that this man had either been the victim of some terrible necessity as regarded the occupation to which he had devoted himself or that he was a man of dogged obstinacy from sheer sang froid holding his ground amid malign forces when others would have fled affrighted away  as nobody noticed him he dropped the door hangings after a while walked silently along the matted alley and sat down in one of the back chairs his manner of entry was enough to show that the strength of character which he seemed to possess had phlegm for its base and not ardour one might have said that perhaps the shocks he had passed through had taken all his original warmth out of him his beaver hat which he had retained on his head till this moment he now placed under the seat where he sat absolutely motionless till the end of the first act as if he were indulging in a monologue which did not quite reach his lips  when paula entered at the beginning of the second act he showed as much excitement as was expressed by a slight movement of the eyes when she spoke he turned to his next neighbour and asked him in cold level words which had once been english but which seemed to have lost the accent of nationality is that the young woman who is the possessor of this castlepower by name  his neighbour happened to be the landlord at sleepinggreen and he informed the stranger that she was what he supposed  and who is that gentleman whose line of business seems to be to make love to power  hes captain de stancy sir william de stancys son who used to own this property  baronet or knight  baroneta very oldestablished family about here  the stranger nodded and the play went on no further word being spoken till the fourth act was reached when the stranger again said without taking his narrow black eyes from the stage theres something in that lovemaking between stancy and power thats not all sham  well said the landlord i have heard different stories about that and wouldnt be the man to zay what i couldnt swear to the story is that captain de stancy who is as poor as a gallicrow is in full cry ater her and that his ony chance lies in his being heir to a title and the wold name but she has not shown a genuine hanker for anybody yet  if she finds the money and this stancy finds the name and blood twould be a very neat match between emhey  thats the argument  nothing more was said again for a long time but the strangers eyes showed more interest in the passes between paula and de stancy than they had shown before at length the crisis came as described in the last chapter de stancy saluting her with that semblance of a kiss which gave such umbrage to somerset the strangers thin lips lengthened a couple of inches with satisfaction he put his hand into his pocket drew out two halfcrowns which he handed to the landlord saying just applaud that will you and get your comrades to do the same  the landlord though a little surprised took the money and began to clap his hands as desired the example was contagious and spread all over the room for the audience gentle and simple though they might not have followed the blank verse in all its bearings could at least appreciate a kiss it was the unusual acclamation raised by this means which had led somerset to turn his head  when the play had ended the stranger was the first to rise and going downstairs at the head of the crowd he passed out of doors and was lost to view some questions were asked by the landlord as to the strangers individuality but few had seen him fewer had noticed him singular as he was and none knew his name  while these things had been going on in the quarter allotted to the commonalty somerset in front had waited the fall of the curtain with those sick and sorry feelings which should be combated by the aid of philosophy and a good conscience but which really are only subdued by time and the abrading rush of affairs he was however stoical enough when it was all over to accept mrs goodmans invitation to accompany her to the drawingroom fully expecting to find there a large company including captain de stancy  but none of the acting ladies and gentlemen had emerged from their dressingrooms as yet feeling that he did not care to meet any of them that night he bade farewell to mrs goodman after a few minutes of conversation and left her while he was passing along the corridor at the side of the gallery which had been used as the theatre paula crossed it from the latter apartment towards an opposite door she was still in the dress of the princess and the diamond and pearl necklace still hung over her bosom as placed there by captain de stancy  her eye caught somersets and she stopped probably there was something in his face which told his mind for she invited him by a smile into the room she was entering  i congratulate you on your performance he said mechanically when she pushed to the door  do you really think it was well done she drew near him with a sociable air  it was startlingly donethe part from romeo and juliet preeminently so  do you think i knew he was going to introduce it or do you think i didnt know she said with that gentle sauciness which shows itself in the loved ones manner when she has had a triumphant evening without the lovers assistance  i think you may have known  no she averred decisively shaking her head it took me as much by surprise as it probably did you but why should i have told  without answering that question somerset went on then what he did at the end of his gag was of course a surprise also  he didnt really do what he seemed to do she serenely answered  well i have no right to make observationsyour actions are not subject to my surveillance you float above my plane said the young man with some bitterness but to speak plainly surely hekissed you  no she said he only kissed the air in front of meever so far off  was it six inches off  no not six inches  nor three  it was quite one she said with an ingenuous air  i dont call that very far  a miss is as good as a mile says the timehonoured proverb and it is not for us modern mortals to question its truth  how can you be so offhand broke out somerset i love you wildly and desperately paula and you know it well  i have never denied knowing it she said softly  then why do you with such knowledge adopt an air of levity at such a moment as this you keep me at armslength and wont say whether you care for me one bit or no i have owned all to you yet never once have you owned anything to me  i have owned much and you do me wrong if you consider that i show levity but even if i had not owned everything and you all it is not altogether such a grievous thing  you mean to say that it is not grievous even if a man does love a woman and suffers all the pain of feeling he loves in vain well i say it is quite the reverse and i have grounds for knowing  now dont fume so george somerset but hear me my not owning all may not have the dreadful meaning you think and therefore it may not be really such a grievous thing there are genuine reasons for womens conduct in these matters as well as for mens though it is sometimes supposed to be regulated entirely by caprice and if i do not give way to every feelingi mean demonstrationit is because i dont want to there now you know what that implies and be content  very well said somerset with repressed sadness i will not expect you to say more but you do like me a little paula  now she said shaking her head with symptoms of tenderness and looking into his eyes what have you just promised perhaps i like you a little more than a little which is much too much yesshakespeare says so and he is always right do you still doubt me ah i see you do  because somebody has stood nearer to you tonight than i  a fogy like himhalf as old again as either of us how can you mind him what shall i do to show you that i do not for a moment let him come between me and you  it is not for me to suggest what you should do though what you should permit me to do is obvious enough  she dropped her voice you mean permit you to do really and in earnest what he only seemed to do in the play  somerset signified by a look that such had been his thought  paula was silent no she murmured at last that cannot be he did not nor must you  it was said none the less decidedly for being spoken low  you quite resent such a suggestion you have a right to i beg your pardon not for speaking of it but for thinking it  i dont resent it at all and i am not offended one bit but i am not the less of opinion that it is possible to be premature in some things and to do this just now would be premature i know what you would saythat you would not have asked it but for that unfortunate improvisation of it in the play but that i was not responsible for and therefore owe no reparation to you now listen  paulapaula where in the world are you was heard resounding along the corridor in the voice of her aunt our friends are all ready to leave and you will surely bid them goodnight  i must be gonei wont ring for you to be shown outcome this way  but how will you get on in repeating the play tomorrow evening if that interpolation is against your wish he asked looking her hard in the face  ill think it over during the night come tomorrow morning to help me settle but she added with coy yet genial independence listen to me not a word more about awhat you asked for mind i dont want to go so far and i will notnot just yet anyhowi mean perhaps never you must promise that or i cannot see you again alone  it shall be as you request  very well and not a word of this to a soul my aunt suspects but she is a good aunt and will say nothing now that is clearly understood i should be glad to consult with you tomorrow early i will come to you in the studio or pleasance as soon as i am disengaged  she took him to a little chamfered doorway in the corner which opened into a descending turret and somerset went down when he had unfastened the door at the bottom and stepped into the lower corridor she asked are you down and on receiving an affirmative reply she closed the top door    x  somerset was in the studio the next morning about ten oclock superintending the labours of knowles bowles and cockton whom he had again engaged to assist him with the drawings on his appointment to carry out the works when he had set them going he ascended the staircase of the great tower for some purpose that bore upon the forthcoming repairs of this part passing the door of the telegraphroom he heard little sounds from the instrument which somebody was working only two people in the castle to the best of his knowledge knew the trick of this miss power and a page in her service called john miss de stancy could also despatch messages but she was at myrtle villa  the door was closed and much as he would have liked to enter the possibility that paula was not the performer led him to withhold his steps he went on to where the uppermost masonry had resisted the mighty hostility of the elements for five hundred years without receiving worse dilapidation than halfacentury produces upon the face of man but he still wondered who was telegraphing and whether the message bore on housekeeping architecture theatricals or love  could somerset have seen through the panels of the door in passing he would have beheld the room occupied by paula alone  it was she who sat at the instrument and the message she was despatching ran as under  can you send down a competent actress who will undertake the part of princess of france in loves labours lost this evening in a temporary theatre here dresses already provided suitable to a lady about the middle height state price  the telegram was addressed to a wellknown theatrical agent in london  off went the message and paula retired into the next room leaving the door open between that and the one she had just quitted here she busied herself with writing some letters till in less than an hour the telegraph instrument showed signs of life and she hastened back to its side the reply received from the agent was as follows  miss barbara bell of the regents theatre could come quite competent her terms would be about twentyfive guineas  without a moments pause paula returned for answer  the terms are quite satisfactory  presently she heard the instrument again and emerging from the next room in which she had passed the intervening time as before she read  miss barbara bells terms were accidentally understated they would be forty guineas in consequence of the distance am waiting at the office for a reply  paula set to work as before and replied  quite satisfactory only let her come at once  she did not leave the room this time but went to an arrowslit hard by and gazed out at the trees till the instrument began to speak again returning to it with a leisurely manner implying a full persuasion that the matter was settled she was somewhat surprised to learn that  miss bell in stating her terms understands that she will not be required to leave london till the middle of the afternoon if it is necessary for her to leave at once ten guineas extra would be indispensable on account of the great inconvenience of such a short notice  paula seemed a little vexed but not much concerned she sent back with a readiness scarcely politic in the circumstances  she must start at once price agreed to  her impatience for the answer was mixed with curiosity as to whether it was due to the agent or to miss barbara bell that the prices had grown like jacks beanstalk in the negotiation another telegram duly came  travelling expenses are expected to be paid  with decided impatience she dashed off  of course but nothing more will be agreed to  then and only then came the desired reply  miss bell starts by the twelve oclock train  this business being finished paula left the chamber and descended into the inclosure called the pleasance a spot grassed down like a lawn here stood somerset who having come down from the tower was looking on while a man searched for old foundations under the sod with a crowbar he was glad to see her at last and noticed that she looked serene and relieved but could not for the moment divine the cause paula came nearer returned his salutation and regarded the mans operations in silence awhile till his work led him to a distance from them  do you still wish to consult me asked somerset  about the building perhaps said she not about the play  but you said so  yes but it will be unnecessary  somerset thought this meant skittishness and merely bowed  you mistake me as usual she said in a low tone i am not going to consult you on that matter because i have done all you could have asked for without consulting you i take no part in the play tonight  forgive my momentary doubt  somebody else will play for mean actress from london but on no account must the substitution be known beforehand or the performance tonight will never come off and that i should much regret  captain de stancy will not play his part if he knows you will not play yoursthats what you mean  you may suppose it is she said smiling and to guard against this you must help me to keep the secret by being my confederate  to be paulas confederate today indeed time had brought him something worth waiting for in anything cried somerset  only in this said she with soft severity and you know what you have promised george and you remember there is to be nowhat we talked about now will you go in the onehorse brougham to markton station this afternoon and meet the four oclock train inquire for a lady for stancy castlea miss bell see her safely into the carriage and send her straight on here i am particularly anxious that she should not enter the town for i think she once came to markton in a starring company and she might be recognized and my plan be defeated  thus she instructed her lover and devoted friend and when he could stay no longer he left her in the garden to return to his studio as somerset went in by the garden door he met a strangelooking personage coming out by the same passagea stranger with the manner of a dutchman the face of a smelter and the clothes of an inhabitant of guiana the stranger whom we have already seen sitting at the back of the theatre the night before looked hard from somerset to paula and from paula again to somerset as he stepped out somerset had an unpleasant conviction that this queer gentleman had been standing for some time in the doorway unnoticed quizzing him and his mistress as they talked together if so he might have learnt a secret  when he arrived upstairs somerset went to a window commanding a view of the garden paula still stood in her place and the stranger was earnestly conversing with her soon they passed round the corner and disappeared  it was now time for him to see about starting for markton an intelligible zest for circumventing the ardent and coercive captain of artillery saving him from any unnecessary delay in the journey he was at the station ten minutes before the train was due and when it drew up to the platform the first person to jump out was captain de stancy in sportsmans attire and with a gun in his hand somerset nodded and de stancy spoke informing the architect that he had been ten miles up the line shooting waterfowl thats miss powers carriage i think he added  yes said somerset carelessly she expects a friend i believe we shall see you at the castle again tonight  de stancy assured him that they would and the two men parted captain de stancy when he had glanced to see that the carriage was empty going on to where a porter stood with a couple of spaniels  somerset now looked again to the train while his back had been turned to converse with the captain a lady of fiveandthirty had alighted from the identical compartment occupied by de stancy she made an inquiry about getting to stancy castle upon which somerset who had not till now observed her went forward and introducing himself assisted her to the carriage and saw her safely off  de stancy had by this time disappeared and somerset walked on to his rooms at the lordquantockarms where he remained till he had dined picturing the discomfiture of his alert rival when there should enter to him as princess not paula power but miss bell of the regents theatre london thus the hour passed till he found that if he meant to see the issue of the plot it was time to be off  on arriving at the castle somerset entered by the public door from the hall as before a natural delicacy leading him to feel that though he might be welcomed as an ally at the stagedoorin other words the door from the corridorit was advisable not to take too ready an advantage of a privilege which in the existing secrecy of his understanding with paula might lead to an overthrow of her plans on that point  not intending to sit out the whole performance somerset contented himself with standing in a window recess near the proscenium whence he could observe both the stage and the front rows of spectators he was quite uncertain whether paula would appear among the audience tonight and resolved to wait events just before the rise of the curtain the young lady in question entered and sat down when the scenery was disclosed and the king of navarre appeared what was somersets surprise to find that though the part was the part taken by de stancy on the previous night the voice was that of mr mild to him at the appointed season entered the princess namely miss barbara bell  before somerset had recovered from his crestfallen sensation at de stancys elusiveness that officer himself emerged in evening dress from behind a curtain forming a wing to the proscenium and somerset remarked that the minor part originally allotted to him was filled by the subaltern who had enacted it the night before de stancy glanced across whether by accident or otherwise somerset could not determine and his glance seemed to say he quite recognized there had been a trial of wits between them and that thanks to his chance meeting with miss bell in the train his had proved the stronger  the house being less crowded tonight there were one or two vacant chairs in the best part de stancy advancing from where he had stood for a few moments seated himself comfortably beside miss power  on the other side of her he now perceived the same queer elderly foreigner as he appeared who had come to her in the garden that morning somerset was surprised to perceive also that paula with very little hesitation introduced him and de stancy to each other a conversation ensued between the three none the less animated for being carried on in a whisper in which paula seemed on strangely intimate terms with the stranger and the stranger to show feelings of great friendship for de stancy considering that they must be new acquaintances  the play proceeded and somerset still lingered in his corner he could not help fancying that de stancys ingenious relinquishment of his part and its obvious reason was winning paulas admiration his conduct was homage carried to unscrupulous and inconvenient lengths a sort of thing which a woman may chide but which she can never resent who could do otherwise than talk kindly to a man incline a little to him and condone his fault when the sole motive of so audacious an exercise of his wits was to escape acting with any other heroine than herself  his conjectures were brought to a pause by the ending of the comedy and the opportunity afforded him of joining the group in front the mass of people were soon gone and the knot of friends assembled around paula were discussing the merits and faults of the two days performance  my uncle mr abner power said paula suddenly to somerset as he came near presenting the stranger to the astonished young man i could not see you before the performance as i should have liked to do the return of my uncle is so extraordinary that it ought to be told in a less hurried way than this he has been supposed dead by all of us for nearly ten yearsever since the time we last heard from him  for which i am to blame said mr power nodding to paulas architect yet not i but accident and a sluggish temperament there are times mr somerset when the human creature feels no interest in his kind and assumes that his kind feels no interest in him the feeling is not active enough to make him fly from their presence but sufficient to keep him silent if he happens to be away i may not have described it precisely but this i know that after my long illness and the fancied neglect of my letters  for which my father was not to blame since he did not receive them said paula  for which nobody was to blameafter that i say i wrote no more  you have much pleasure in returning at last no doubt said somerset  sir as i remained away without particular pain so i return without particular joy i speak the truth and no compliments i may add that there is one exception to this absence of feeling from my heart namely that i do derive great satisfaction from seeing how mightily this young woman has grown and prevailed  this address though delivered nominally to somerset was listened to by paula mrs goodman and de stancy also after uttering it the speaker turned away and continued his previous conversation with captain de stancy from this time till the group parted he never again spoke directly to somerset paying him barely so much attention as he might have expected as paulas architect and certainly less than he might have supposed his due as her accepted lover  the result of the appearance as from the tomb of this wintry man was that the evening ended in a frigid and formal way which gave little satisfaction to the sensitive somerset who was abstracted and constrained by reason of thoughts on how this resuscitation of the uncle would affect his relation with paula it was possibly also the thought of two at least of the others there had in truth scarcely yet been time enough to adumbrate the possibilities opened up by this gentlemans return  the only private word exchanged by somerset with any one that night was with mrs goodman in whom he always recognized a friend to his cause though the fluidity of her character rendered her but a feeble one at the best of times she informed him that mr power had no sort of legal control over paula or direction in her estates but somerset could not doubt that a near and only blood relation even had he possessed but half the static force of character that made itself apparent in mr power might exercise considerable moral influence over the girl if he chose and in view of mr powers marked preference for de stancy somerset had many misgivings as to its operating in a direction favourable to himself    xi  somerset was deeply engaged with his draughtsmen and builders during the three following days and scarcely entered the occupied wing of the castle  at his suggestion paula had agreed to have the works executed as such operations were carried out in old times before the advent of contractors each trade required in the building was to be represented by a mastertradesman of that denomination who should stand responsible for his own section of labour and for no other somerset himself as chief technicist working out his designs on the spot by this means the thoroughness of the workmanship would be greatly increased in comparison with the modern arrangement whereby a nominal builder seldom present who can certainly know no more than one trade intimately and well and who often does not know that undertakes the whole  but notwithstanding its manifest advantages to the proprietor the plan added largely to the responsibilities of the architect who with his mastermason mastercarpenter masterplumber and what not had scarcely a moment to call his own still the method being upon the face of it the true one somerset supervised with a will  but there seemed to float across the court to him from the inhabited wing an intimation that things were not as they had been before that an influence adverse to himself was at work behind the ashlared face of inner wall which confronted him perhaps this was because he never saw paula at the windows or heard her footfall in that half of the building given over to himself and his myrmidons there was really no reason other than a sentimental one why he should see her the uninhabited part of the castle was almost an independent structure and it was quite natural to exist for weeks in this wing without coming in contact with residents in the other  a more pronounced cause than vague surmise was destined to perturb him and this in an unexpected manner it happened one morning that he glanced through a local paper while waiting at the lordquantockarms for the ponycarriage to be brought round in which he often drove to the castle the paper was two days old but to his unutterable amazement he read therein a paragraph which ran as follows  we are informed that a marriage is likely to be arranged between captain de stancy of the royal horse artillery only surviving son of sir william de stancy baronet and paula only daughter of the late john power esq mp of stancy castle  somerset dropped the paper and stared out of the window fortunately for his emotions the horse and carriage were at this moment brought to the door so that nothing hindered somerset in driving off to the spot at which he would be soonest likely to learn what truth or otherwise there was in the newspaper report from the first he doubted it and yet how should it have got there such strange rumours like paradoxical maxims generally include a portion of truth five days had elapsed since he last spoke to paula  reaching the castle he entered his own quarters as usual and after setting the draughtsmen to work walked up and down pondering how he might best see her without making the paragraph the ground of his request for an interview for if it were a fabrication such a reason would wound her pride in her own honour towards him and if it were partly true he would certainly do better in leaving her alone than in reproaching her it would simply amount to a proof that paula was an arrant coquette  in his meditation he stood still closely scanning one of the jambstones of a doorless entrance as if to discover where the old hingehook had entered the stonework he heard a footstep behind him and looking round saw paula standing by she held a newspaper in her hand the spot was one quite hemmed in from observation a fact of which she seemed to be quite aware  i have something to tell you she said something important but you are so occupied with that old stone that i am obliged to wait  it is not true surely he said looking at the paper  no look here she said holding up the sheet it was not what he had supposed but a new onethe local rival to that which had contained the announcement and was still damp from the press she pointed and he read  we are authorized to state that there is no foundation whatever for the assertion of our contemporary that a marriage is likely to be arranged between captain de stancy and miss power of stancy castle  somerset pressed her hand it disturbed me he said though i did not believe it  it astonished me as much as it disturbed you and i sent this contradiction at once  how could it have got there  she shook her head  you have not the least knowledge  not the least i wish i had  it was not from any friends of de stancys or himself  it was not his sister has ascertained beyond doubt that he knew nothing of it well now dont say any more to me about the matter  ill find out how it got into the paper  not nowany future time will do i have something else to tell you  i hope the news is as good as the last he said looking into her face with anxiety for though that face was blooming it seemed full of a doubt as to how her next information would be taken  o yes it is good because everybody says so we are going to take a delightful journey my newcreated uncle as he seems and i and my aunt and perhaps charlotte if she is well enough are going to nice and other places about there  to nice said somerset rather blankly and i must stay here  why of course you must considering what you have undertaken she said looking with saucy composure into his eyes my uncles reason for proposing the journey just now is that he thinks the alterations will make residence here dusty and disagreeable during the spring the opportunity of going with him is too good a one for us to lose as i have never been there  i wish i was going to be one of the party what do you wish about it  she shook her head impenetrably a woman may wish some things she does not care to tell  are you really glad you are going dearestas i must call you just once said the young man gazing earnestly into her face which struck him as looking far too rosy and radiant to be consistent with ever so little regret at leaving him behind  i take great interest in foreign trips especially to the shores of the mediterranean and everybody makes a point of getting away when the house is turned out of the window  but you do feel a little sadness such as i should feel if our positions were reversed  i think you ought not to have asked that so incredulously she murmured we can be near each other in spirit when our bodies are far apart can we not her tone grew softer and she drew a little closer to his side with a slightly nestling motion as she went on may i be sure that you will not think unkindly of me when i am absent from your sight and not begrudge me any little pleasure because you are not there to share it with me  may you can you ask it as for me i shall have no pleasure to be begrudged or otherwise the only pleasure i have is as you well know in you when you are with me i am happy when you are away i take no pleasure in anything  i dont deserve it i have no right to disturb you so she said very gently but i have given you some pleasure have i not a little more pleasure than pain perhaps  you have and yet but i dont accuse you dearest yes you have given me pleasure one truly pleasant time was when we stood together in the summerhouse on the evening of the gardenparty and you said you liked me to love you  yes it was a pleasant time she returned thoughtfully how the rain came down and formed a gauze between us and the dancers did it not and how afraid we wereat least i waslest anybody should discover us there and how quickly i ran in after the rain was over  yes said somerset i remember it but no harm came of it to you and perhaps no good will come of it to me  do not be premature in your conclusions sir she said archly if you really do feel for me only half what you say we shallyou will make good come of itin some way or other  dear paulanow i believe you and can bear anything  then we will say no more because as you recollect we agreed not to go too far no expostulations for we are going to be practical young people besides i wont listen if you utter them i simply echo your words and say i too believe you now i must go have faith in me and dont magnify trifles light as air  i think i understand you and if i do it will make a great difference in my conduct you will have no cause to complain  then you must not understand me so much as to make much difference for your conduct as my architect is perfect but i must not linger longer though i wished you to know this news from my very own lips  bless you for it when do you leave  the day after tomorrow  so early does your uncle guess anything do you wish him to be told just yet  yes to the first no to the second  i may write to you  on business yes it will be necessary  how can you speak so at a time of parting  now georgeyou see i say george and not mr somerset and you may draw your own inferencedont be so morbid in your reproaches i have informed you that you may write or still better telegraph since the wire is so handyon business well of course it is for you to judge whether you will add postscripts of another sort there you make me say more than a woman ought because you are so obtuse and literal good afternoongoodbye this will be my address  she handed him a slip of paper and flitted away  though he saw her again after this it was during the bustle of preparation when there was always a third person present usually in the shape of that breathing refrigerator her uncle hence the few words that passed between them were of the most formal description and chiefly concerned the restoration of the castle and a church at nice designed by him which he wanted her to inspect  they were to leave by an early afternoon train and somerset was invited to lunch on that day the morning was occupied by a long business consultation in the studio with mr power and mrs goodman on what rooms were to be left locked up what left in charge of the servants and what thrown open to the builders and workmen under the surveillance of somerset at present the work consisted mostly of repairs to existing rooms so as to render those habitable which had long been used only as stores for lumber paula did not appear during this discussion but when they were all seated in the dininghall she came in dressed for the journey and to outward appearance with blithe anticipation at its prospect blooming from every feature next to her came charlotte de stancy still with some of the pallor of an invalid but wonderfully brightened up as somerset thought by the prospect of a visit to a delightful shore it might have been this and it might have been that somersets presence had a share in the change  it was in the hall when they were in the bustle of leavetaking that there occurred the only opportunity for the two or three private words with paula to which his star treated him on that last day his took the hasty form of you will write soon  telegraphing will be quicker she answered in the same low tone and whispering be true to me turned away  how unreasonable he was in addition to those words warm as they were he would have preferred a little paleness of cheek or trembling of lip instead of the bloom and the beauty which sat upon her undisturbed maidenhood to tell him that in some slight way she suffered at his loss  immediately after this they went to the carriages waiting at the door somerset who had in a measure taken charge of the castle accompanied them and saw them off much as if they were his visitors she stepped in a general adieu was spoken and she was gone  while the carriages rolled away he ascended to the top of the tower where he saw them lessen to spots on the road and turn the corner out of sight the chances of a rival seemed to grow in proportion as paula receded from his side but he could not have answered why he had bidden her and her relatives adieu on her own doorstep like a privileged friend of the family while de stancy had scarcely seen her since the playnight that the silence into which the captain appeared to have sunk was the placidity of conscious power was scarcely probable yet that adventitious aids existed for de stancy he could not deny the link formed by charlotte between de stancy and paula much as he liked the ingenuous girl was one that he could have wished away it constituted a bridge of access to paulas inner life and feelings which nothing could rival except that one fact which as he firmly believed did actually rival it giving him faith and hope his own primary occupation of paulas heart moreover mrs goodman would be an influence favourable to himself and his cause during the journey though to be sure to set against her there was the phlegmatic and obstinate abner power in whom apprised by those subtle media of intelligence which lovers possess he fancied he saw no friend  somerset remained but a short time at the castle that day the light of its chambers had fled the gross grandeur of the dictatorial towers oppressed him and the studio was hateful he remembered a promise made long ago to mr woodwell of calling upon him some afternoon and a visit which had not much attractiveness in it at other times recommended itself now through being the one possible way open to him of hearing paula named and her doings talked of hence in walking back to markton instead of going up the high street he turned aside into the unfrequented footway that led to the ministers cottage  mr woodwell was not indoors at the moment of his call and somerset lingered at the doorway and cast his eyes around it was a house which typified the drearier tenets of its occupier with great exactness it stood upon its spot of earth without any natural union with it no mosses disguised the stiff straight line where wall met earth not a creeper softened the aspect of the bare front the garden walk was strewn with loose clinkers from the neighbouring foundry which rolled under the pedestrians foot and jolted his soul out of him before he reached the porchless door but all was clean and clear and dry  whether mr woodwell was personally responsible for this condition of things there was not time to closely consider for somerset perceived the minister coming up the walk towards him mr woodwell welcomed him heartily and yet with the mien of a man whose mind has scarcely dismissed some scene which has preceded the one that confronts him what that scene was soon transpired  i have had a busy afternoon said the minister as they walked indoors or rather an exciting afternoon your client at stancy castle whose uncle as i imagine you know has so unexpectedly returned has left with him today for the south of france and i wished to ask her before her departure some questions as to how a charity organized by her father was to be administered in her absence but i have been very unfortunate she could not find time to see me at her own house and i awaited her at the station all to no purpose owing to the presence of her friends well well i must see if a letter will find her  somerset asked if anybody of the neighbourhood was there to see them off  yes that was the trouble of it captain de stancy was there and quite monopolized her i dont know what tis coming to and perhaps i have no business to inquire since she is scarcely a member of our church now who could have anticipated the daughter of my old friend john power developing into the ordinary gay woman of the world as she has done who could have expected her to associate with people who show contempt for their makers intentions by flippantly assuming other characters than those in which he created them  you mistake her murmured somerset in a voice which he vainly endeavoured to attune to philosophy miss power has some very rare and beautiful qualities in her nature though i confess i tremblefear lest the de stancy influence should be too strong  sir it is already do you remember my telling you that i thought the force of her surroundings would obscure the pure daylight of her spirit as a monkish window of coloured images attenuates the rays of gods sun i do not wish to indulge in rash surmises but her oscillation from her family creed of calvinistic truth towards the traditions of the de stancys has been so decided though so gradual thatwell i may be wrong  that what said the young man sharply  i sometimes think she will take to her as husband the present representative of that impoverished linecaptain de stancywhich she may easily do if she chooses as his behaviour today showed  he was probably there on account of his sister said somerset trying to escape the mental picture of farewell gallantries bestowed on paula  it was hinted at in the papers the other day  and it was flatly contradicted  yes well we shall see in the lords good time i can do no more for her and now mr somerset pray take a cup of tea  the revelations of the minister depressed somerset a little and he did not stay long as he went to the door woodwell said there is a worthy manthe deacon of our chapel mr havillwho would like to be friendly with you poor man since the death of his wife he seems to have something on his mindsome trouble which my words will not reach if ever you are passing his door please give him a look in he fears that calling on you might be an intrusion  somerset did not clearly promise and went his way the ministers allusion to the announcement of the marriage reminded somerset that she had expressed a wish to know how the paragraph came to be inserted the wish had been carelessly spoken but he went to the newspaper office to make inquiries on the point  the reply was unexpected the reporter informed his questioner that in returning from the theatricals at which he was present he shared a fly with a gentleman who assured him that such an alliance was certain so obviously did it recommend itself to all concerned as a means of strengthening both families the gentlemans knowledge of the powers was so precise that the reporter did not hesitate to accept his assertion he was a man who had seen a great deal of the world and his face was noticeable for the seams and scars on it  somerset recognized paulas uncle in the portrait  hostilities then were beginning the paragraph had been meant as the first slap taking her abroad was the second     book the fourth somerset dare and de stancy    i  there was no part of paulas journey in which somerset did not think of her he imagined her in the hotel at havre in her brief rest at paris her drive past the place de la bastille to the boulevart mazas to take the train for lyons her tedious progress through the dark of a winter night till she crossed the isothermal line which told of the beginning of a southern atmosphere and onwards to the ancient blue sea  thus between the hours devoted to architecture he passed the next three days one morning he set himself by the help of john to practise on the telegraph instrument expecting a message but though he watched the machine at every opportunity or kept some other person on the alert in its neighbourhood no message arrived to gratify him till after the lapse of nearly a fortnight then she spoke from her new habitation nine hundred miles away in these meagre words  are settled at the address given can now attend to any inquiry about the building  the pointed implication that she could attend to inquiries about nothing else breathed of the veritable paula so distinctly that he could forgive its sauciness his reply was soon despatched  will write particulars of our progress always the same  the last three words formed the sentimental appendage which she had assured him she could tolerate and which he hoped she might desire  he spent the remainder of the day in making a little sketch to show what had been done in the castle since her departure this he despatched with a letter of explanation ending in a paragraph of a different tenor  i have demonstrated our progress as well as i could but another subject has been in my mind even whilst writing the former ask yourself if you use me well in keeping me a fortnight before you so much as say that you have arrived the one thing that reconciled me to your departure was the thought that i should hear early from you my idea of being able to submit to your absence was based entirely upon that  but i have resolved not to be out of humour and to believe that your scheme of reserve is not unreasonable neither do i quarrel with your injunction to keep silence to all relatives i do not know anything i can say to show you more plainly my acquiescence in your wish not to go too far in short to keep yourself dearby dear i mean not cheapyou have been dear in the other sense a long time as you know than by not urging you to go a single degree further in warmth than you please  when this was posted he again turned his attention to her walls and towers which indeed were a dumb consolation in many ways for the lack of herself there was no nook in the castle to which he had not access or could not easily obtain access by applying for the keys and this propinquity of things belonging to her served to keep her image before him even more constantly than his memories would have done  three days and a half after the despatch of his subdued effusion the telegraph called to tell him the good news that  your letter and drawing are just received thanks for the latter will reply to the former by post this afternoon  it was with cheerful patience that he attended to his three draughtsmen in the studio or walked about the environs of the fortress during the fifty hours spent by her presumably tender missive on the road a light fleece of snow fell during the second night of waiting inverting the position of longestablished lights and shades and lowering to a dingy grey the approximately white walls of other weathers he could trace the postmans footmarks as he entered over the bridge knowing them by the dot of his walkingstick on entering the expected letter was waiting upon his table he looked at its direction with glad curiosity it was the first letter he had ever received from her   hotel  nice  feb 14  my dear mr somerset the george then to which she had so kindly treated him in her last conversation was not to be continued in black and white  your letter explaining the progress of the work aided by the sketch enclosed gave me as clear an idea of the advance made since my departure as i could have gained by being present i feel every confidence in you and am quite sure the restoration is in good hands in this opinion both my aunt and my uncle coincide please act entirely on your own judgment in everything and as soon as you give a certificate to the builders for the first instalment of their money it will be promptly sent by my solicitors  you bid me ask myself if i have used you well in not sending intelligence of myself till a fortnight after i had left you now george dont be unreasonable let me remind you that as a certain apostle said there are a thousand things lawful which are not expedient i say this not from pride in my own conduct but to offer you a very fair explanation of it your resolve not to be out of humour with me suggests that you have been sorely tempted that way else why should such a resolve have been necessary  if you only knew what passes in my mind sometimes you would perhaps not be so ready to blame shall i tell you no for if it is a great emotion it may afford you a cruel satisfaction at finding i suffer through separation and if it be a growing indifference to you it will be inflicting gratuitous unhappiness upon you to say so if you care for me as i sometimes think you may do a little  o paula said somerset  please which way would you have it but it is better that you should guess at what i feel than that you should distinctly know it notwithstanding this assertion you will i know adhere to your first prepossession in favour of prompt confessions in spite of that i fear that upon trial such promptness would not produce that happiness which your fancy leads you to expect your heart would weary in time and when once that happens goodbye to the emotion you have told me of imagine such a case clearly and you will perceive the probability of what i say at the same time i admit that a woman who is only a creature of evasions and disguises is very disagreeable  do not write very frequently and never write at all unless you have some real information about the castle works to communicate i will explain to you on another occasion why i make this request you will possibly set it down as additional evidence of my coldheartedness if so you must would you also mind writing the business letter on an independent sheet with a proper beginning and ending whether you inclose another sheet is of course optionalsincerely yours paula power  somerset had a suspicion that her order to him not to neglect the business letter was to escape any invidious remarks from her uncle he wished she would be more explicit so that he might know exactly how matters stood with them and whether abner power had ever ventured to express disapproval of him as her lover  but not knowing he waited anxiously for a new architectural event on which he might legitimately send her another line this occurred about a week later when the men engaged in digging foundations discovered remains of old ones which warranted a modification of the original plan he accordingly sent off his professional advice on the point requesting her assent or otherwise to the amendment winding up the inquiry with yours faithfully on another sheet he wrotedo you suffer from any unpleasantness in the manner of others on account of me if so inform me paula i cannot otherwise interpret your request for the separate sheets while on this point i will tell you what i have learnt relative to the authorship of that false paragraph about your engagement it was communicated to the paper by your uncle was the wish father to the thought or could he have been misled as many were by appearances at the theatricals  if i am not to write to you without a professional reason surely you can write to me without such an excuse when you write tell me of yourself there is nothing i so much wish to hear of write a great deal about your daily doings for my minds eye keeps those sweet operations more distinctly before me than my bodily sight does my own  you say nothing of having been to look at the chapelofease i told you of the plans of which i made when an architects pupil working in metres instead of feet and inches to my immense perplexity that the drawings might be understood by the foreign workmen go there and tell me what you think of its design i can assure you that every curve thereof is my own  how i wish you would invite me to run over and see you if only for a day or two for my heart runs after you in a most distracted manner dearest you entirely fill my life but i forget we have resolved not to go very far but the fact is i am half afraid lest with such reticence you should not remember how very much i am yours and with what a dogged constancy i shall always remember you paula sometimes i have horrible misgivings that something will divide us especially if we do not make a more distinct show of our true relationship true do i say i mean the relationship which i think exists between us but which you do not affirm too clearlyyours always  away southward like the swallow went the tender lines he wondered if she would notice his hint of being ready to pay her a flying visit if permitted to do so his fancy dwelt on that further side of france the very contours of whose shore were now lines of beauty for him he prowled in the library and found interest in the mustiest facts relating to that place learning with aesthetic pleasure that the number of its population was fifty thousand that the mean temperature of its atmosphere was 60 degrees fahrenheit and that the peculiarities of a mistral were far from agreeable  he waited overlong for her reply but it ultimately came after the usual business preliminary she said  as requested i have visited the little church you designed it gave me great pleasure to stand before a building whose outline and details had come from the brain of such a valued friend and adviser  valued friend and adviser repeated somerset critically  i like the style much especially that of the windowsearly english are they not i am going to attend service there next sunday because you were the architect and for no godly reason at all does that content you fie for your despondency remember m aurelius this is the chief thing be not perturbed for all things are of the nature of the universal indeed i am a little surprised at your having forebodings after my assurance to you before i left i have none my opinion is that to be happy it is best to think that as we are the product of events events will continue to produce that which is in harmony with us you are too fainthearted and thats the truth of it i advise you not to abandon yourself to idolatry too readily you know what i mean it fills me with remorse when i think how very far below such a position my actual worth removes me  i should like to receive another letter from you as soon as you have got over the misgiving you speak of but dont write too soon i wish i could write anything to raise your spirits but you may be so perverse that if in order to do this i tell you of the races routs scenery gaieties and gambling going on in this place and neighbourhood into which of course i cannot help being a little drawn you may declare that my words make you worse than ever dont pass the line i have set down in the way you were tempted to do in your last and not too many dearestsat least as yet this is not a time for effusion you have my very warm affection and thats enough for the present  as a loveletter this missive was tantalizing enough but since its form was simply a continuation of what she had practised before she left it produced no undue misgiving in him far more was he impressed by her omitting to answer the two important questions he had put to her first concerning her uncles attitude towards them and his conduct in giving such strange information to the reporter second on his somersets paying her a flying visit some time during the spring since she had requested it he made no haste in his reply when penned it ran in the words subjoined which in common with every line of their correspondence acquired from the strangeness of subsequent circumstances an interest and a force that perhaps they did not intrinsically possess  people cannot he wrote be for ever in good spirits on this gloomy side of the channel even though you seem to be so on yours however that i can abstain from letting you know whether my spirits are good or otherwise i will prove in our future correspondence i admire you more and more both for the warm feeling towards me which i firmly believe you have and for your ability to maintain side by side with it so much dignity and resolution with regard to foolish sentiment sometimes i think i could have put up with a little more weakness if it had brought with it a little more tenderness but i dismiss all that when i mentally survey your other qualities i have thought of fifty things to say to you of the too far sort not one of any other so that your prohibition is very unfortunate for by it i am doomed to say things that do not rise spontaneously to my lips you say that our shutup feelings are not to be mentioned yet how long is the yet to last  but to speak more solemnly matters grow very serious with us paulaat least with me and there are times when this restraint is really unbearable it is possible to put up with reserve when the reserved being is by ones side for the eyes may reveal what the lips do not but when she is absent what was piquancy becomes harshness tender railleries become cruel sarcasm and tacit understandings misunderstandings however that may be you shall never be able to reproach me for touchiness i still esteem you as a friend i admire you and love you as a woman this i shall always do however unconfiding you prove    ii  without knowing it somerset was drawing near to a crisis in this soft correspondence which would speedily put his assertions to the test but the knowledge came upon him soon enough for his peace  her next letter dated march 9th was the shortest of all he had received and beyond the portion devoted to the buildingworks it contained only the following sentences  i am almost angry with you george for being vexed because i am not more effusive why should the verbal i love you be ever uttered between two beings of opposite sex who have eyes to see signs during the seven or eight months that we have known each other you have discovered my regard for you and what more can you desire would a reiterated assertion of passion really do any good remember it is a natural instinct with us women to retain the power of obliging a man to hope fear pray and beseech as long as we think fit before we confess to a reciprocal affection  i am now going to own to a weakness about which i had intended to keep silent it will not perhaps add to your respect for me my uncle whom in many ways i like is displeased with me for keeping up this correspondence so regularly i am quite perverse enough to venture to disregard his feelings but considering the relationship and his kindness in other respects i should prefer not to do so at present honestly speaking i want the courage to resist him in some things he said to me the other day that he was very much surprised that i did not depend upon his judgment for my future happiness whether that meant much or little i have resolved to communicate with you only by telegrams for the remainder of the time we are here please reply by the same means only there now dont flush and call me names it is for the best and we want no nonsense you and i dear george i feel more than i say and if i do not speak more plainly you will understand what is behind after all i have hinted i can promise you that you will not like me less upon knowing me better hope ever i would give up a good deal for you goodbye  this brought somerset some cheerfulness and a good deal of gloom he silently reproached her who was apparently so independent for lacking independence in such a vital matter perhaps it was mere sex perhaps it was peculiar to a few that her independence and courage like cleopatras failed her occasionally at the last moment  one curious impression which had often haunted him now returned with redoubled force he could not see himself as the husband of paula power in any likely future he could not imagine her his wife people were apt to run into mistakes in their presentiments but though he could picture her as queening it over him as avowing her love for him unreservedly even as compromising herself for him he could not see her in a state of domesticity with him  telegrams being commanded to the telegraph he repaired when after two days an immediate wish to communicate with her led him to dismiss vague conjecture on the future situation his first telegram took the following form  i give up the letter writing i will part with anything to please you but yourself your comfort with your relative is the first thing to be considered not for the world do i wish you to make divisions within doors yours  tuesday wednesday thursday passed and on saturday a telegram came in reply  i can fear grieve at and complain of nothing having your nice promise to consider my comfort always  this was very pretty but it admitted little such short messages were in themselves poor substitutes for letters but their speed and easy frequency were good qualities which the letters did not possess three days later he replied  you do not once say to me come would such a strange accident as my arrival disturb you much  she replied rather quickly  i am indisposed to answer you too clearly keep your heart strong tis a censorious world  the vagueness there shown made somerset peremptory and he could not help replying somewhat more impetuously than usual why do you give me so much cause for anxiety why treat me to so much mystification say once distinctly that what i have asked is given  he awaited for the answer one day two days a week but none came it was now the end of march and when somerset walked of an afternoon by the river and pool in the lower part of the grounds his ear newly greeted by the small voices of frogs and toads and other creatures who had been torpid through the winter he became doubtful and uneasy that she alone should be silent in the awakening year  he waited through a second week and there was still no reply it was possible that the urgency of his request had tempted her to punish him and he continued his walks to fro and around with as close an ear to the undertones of nature and as attentive an eye to the charms of his own art as the grand passion would allow now came the days of battle between winter and spring on these excursions though spring was to the forward during the daylight winter would reassert itself at night and not unfrequently at other moments tepid airs and nipping breezes met on the confines of sunshine and shade trembling raindrops that were still akin to frost crystals dashed themselves from the bushes as he pursued his way from town to castle the birds were like an orchestra waiting for the signal to strike up and colour began to enter into the country round  but he gave only a modicum of thought to these proceedings he rather thought such things as she can afford to be saucy and to find a source of blitheness in my love considering the power that wealth gives her to pick and choose almost where she will he was bound to own however that one of the charms of her conversation was the complete absence of the note of the heiress from its accents that other things equal her interest would naturally incline to a person bearing the name of de stancy was evident from her avowed predilections his original assumption that she was a personification of the modern spirit who had been dropped like a seed from the bill of a bird into a chink of mediaevalism required some qualification romanticism which will exist in every human breast as long as human nature itself exists had asserted itself in her veneration for things old not because of any merit in them but because of their long continuance had developed in her and her modern spirit was taking to itself wings and flying away whether his image was flying with the other was a question which moved him all the more deeply now that her silence gave him dread of an affirmative answer  for another seven days he stoically left in suspension all forecasts of his possibly grim fate in being the employed and not the beloved the week passed he telegraphed there was no reply he had sudden fears for her personal safety and resolved to break her command by writing                                           stancy castle april 13  dear paulaare you ill or in trouble it is impossible in the very unquiet state you have put me into by your silence that i should abstain from writing without affectation you sorely distress me and i think you would hardly have done it could you know what a degree of anxiety you cause why paula do you not write or send to me what have i done that you should treat me like this do write if it is only to reproach me i am compelled to pass the greater part of the day in this castle which reminds me constantly of you and yet eternally lacks your presence i am unfortunate indeed that you have not been able to find halfanhour during the last month to tell me at least that you are alive  you have always been ambiguous it is true but i thought i saw encouragement in your eyes encouragement certainly was in your eyes and who would not have been deluded by them and have believed them sincere yet what tenderness can there be in a heart that can cause me pain so wilfully  there may of course be some deliberate scheming on the part of your relations to intercept our letters but i cannot think it i know that the housekeeper has received a letter from your aunt this very week in which she incidentally mentions that all are well and in the same place as before how then can i excuse you  then write paula or at least telegraph as you proposed otherwise i am resolved to take your silence as a signal to treat your fair words as wind and to write to you no more    iii  he despatched the letter and halfanhour afterwards felt sure that it would mortally offend her but he had now reached a state of temporary indifference and could contemplate the loss of such a tantalizing property with reasonable calm  in the interim of waiting for a reply he was one day walking to markton when passing myrtle villa he saw sir william de stancy ambling about his gardenpath and examining the crocuses that palisaded its edge sir william saw him and asked him to come in somerset was in the mood for any diversion from his own affairs and they seated themselves by the drawingroom fire  i am much alone now said sir william and if the weather were not very mild so that i can get out into the garden every day i should feel it a great deal  you allude to your daughters absence  and my sons strange to say i do not miss her so much as i miss him she offers to return at any moment but i do not wish to deprive her of the advantages of a little foreign travel with her friend always mr somerset give your spare time to foreign countries especially those which contrast with your own in topography language and art thats my advice to all young people of your age dont waste your money on expensive amusements at home practise the strictest economy at home to have a margin for going abroad  economy which sir william had never practised but to which after exhausting all other practices he now raised an altar as the athenians did to the unknown god was a topic likely to prolong itself on the baronets lips and somerset contrived to interrupt him by asking  captain de stancy too has gone has the artillery then left the barracks  no said sir william but my son has made use of his leave in running over to see his sister at nice  the current of quiet meditation in somerset changed to a busy whirl at this reply that paula should become indifferent to his existence from a sense of superiority physical spiritual or social was a sufficiently ironical thing but that she should have relinquished him because of the presence of a rival lent commonplace dreariness to her cruelty  sir william noting nothing continued in the tone of clever childishness which characterized him it is very singular how the present situation has been led up to by me policy and policy alone has been the rule of my conduct for many years past and when i say that i have saved my family by it i believe time will show that i am within the truth i hope you dont let your passions outrun your policy as so many young men are apt to do better be poor and politic than rich and headstrong thats the opinion of an old man however i was going to say that it was purely from policy that i allowed a friendship to develop between my daughter and miss power and now events are proving the wisdom of my course straws show how the wind blows and there are little signs that my son captain de stancy will return to stancy castle by the fortunate step of marrying its owner i say nothing to either of them and they say nothing to me but my wisdom lies in doing nothing to hinder such a consummation despite inherited prejudices  somerset had quite time enough to rein himself in during the old gentlemans locution and the voice in which he answered was so cold and reckless that it did not seem his own but how will they live happily together when she is a dissenter and a radical and a newlight and a neogreek and a person of red blood while captain de stancy is the reverse of them all  i anticipate no difficulty on that score said the baronet my sons star lies in that direction and like the magi he is following it without trifling with his opportunity you have skill in architecture therefore you follow it my son has skill in gallantry and now he is about to exercise it profitably  may nobody wish him more harm in that exercise than i do said somerset fervently  a stagnant moodiness of several hours which followed his visit to myrtle villa resulted in a resolve to journey over to paula the very next day he now felt perfectly convinced that the inviting of captain de stancy to visit them at nice was a second stage in the scheme of paulas uncle the premature announcement of her marriage having been the first the roundness and neatness of the whole plan could not fail to recommend it to the mind which delighted in putting involved things straight and such a mind abner powers seemed to be in fact the felicity in a politic sense of pairing the captain with the heiress furnished no little excuse for manoeuvring to bring it about so long as that manoeuvring fell short of unfairness which mr powers could scarcely be said to do  the next day was spent in furnishing the builders with such instructions as they might require for a coming week or ten days and in dropping a short note to paula ending as follows  i am coming to see you possibly you will refuse me an interview never mind i am comingyours g somerset  the morning after that he was up and away between him and paula stretched nine hundred miles by the line of journey that he found it necessary to adopt namely the way of london in order to inform his father of his movements and to make one or two business calls the afternoon was passed in attending to these matters the night in speeding onward and by the time that nine oclock sounded next morning through the sunless and leaden air of the english channel coasts he had reduced the number of miles on his list by two hundred and cut off the sea from the impediments between him and paula  on awakening from a fitful sleep in the grey dawn of the morning following he looked out upon lyons quiet enough now the citizens unaroused to the daily round of breadwinning and enveloped in a haze of fog  six hundred and fifty miles of his journey had been got over there still intervened two hundred and fifty between him and the end of suspense when he thought of that he was disinclined to pause and pressed on by the same train which set him down at marseilles at midday  here he considered by going on to nice that afternoon he would arrive at too late an hour to call upon her the same evening it would therefore be advisable to sleep in marseilles and proceed the next morning to his journeys end so as to meet her in a brighter condition than he could boast of today this he accordingly did and leaving marseilles the next morning about eight found himself at nice early in the afternoon  now that he was actually at the centre of his gravitation he seemed even further away from a feasible meeting with her than in england while afar off his presence at nice had appeared to be the one thing needful for the solution of his trouble but the very house fronts seemed now to ask him what right he had there unluckily in writing from england he had not allowed her time to reply before his departure so that he did not know what difficulties might lie in the way of her seeing him privately before deciding what to do he walked down the avenue de la gare to the promenade between the shore and the jardin public and sat down to think  the hotel which she had given him as her address looked right out upon him and the sea beyond and he rested there with the pleasing hope that her eyes might glance from a window and discover his form everything in the scene was sunny and gay behind him in the gardens a band was playing before him was the sea the great sea the historical and original mediterranean the sea of innumerable characters in history and legend that arranged themselves before him in a long frieze of memories so diverse as to include both aeneas and st paul  northern eyes are not prepared on a sudden for the impact of such images of warmth and colour as meet them southward or for the vigorous light that falls from the sky of this favoured shore in any other circumstances the transparency and serenity of the air the perfume of the sea the radiant houses the palms and flowers would have acted upon somerset as an enchantment and wrapped him in a reverie but at present he only saw and felt these things as through a thick glass which kept out half their atmosphere  at last he made up his mind he would take up his quarters at her hotel and catch echoes of her and her people to learn somehow if their attitude towards him as a lover were actually hostile before formally encountering them under this crystalline light full of gaieties sentiment languor seductiveness and readymade romance the memory of a solitary unimportant man in the lugubrious north might have faded from her mind he was only her hired designer he was an artist but he had been engaged by her and was not a volunteer and she did not as yet know that he meant to accept no return for his labours but the pleasure of presenting them to her as a loveoffering  so off he went at once towards the imposing building whither his letters had preceded him owing to a press of visitors there was a moments delay before he could be attended to at the bureau and he turned to the large staircase that confronted him momentarily hoping that her figure might descend her skirts must indeed have brushed the carpeting of those steps scores of times he engaged his room ordered his luggage to be sent for and finally inquired for the party he sought  they left nice yesterday monsieur replied madame  was she quite sure somerset asked her  yes she was quite sure two of the hotel carriages had driven them to the station  did she know where they had gone to  this and other inquiries resulted in the information that they had gone to the hotel at monte carlo that how long they were going to stay there and whether they were coming back again was not known his final question whether miss power had received a letter from england which must have arrived the day previous was answered in the affirmative  somersets first and sudden resolve was to follow on after them to the hotel named but he finally decided to make his immediate visit to monte carlo only a cautious reconnoitre returning to nice to sleep  accordingly after an early dinner he again set forth through the broad avenue de la gare and an hour on the coast railway brought him to the beautiful and sinister little spot to which the power and de stancy party had strayed in common with the rest of the frivolous throng  he assumed that their visit thither would be chiefly one of curiosity and therefore not prolonged this proved to be the case in even greater measure than he had anticipated on inquiry at the hotel he learnt that they had stayed only one night leaving a short time before his arrival though it was believed that some of the party were still in the town  in a state of indecision somerset strolled into the gardens of the casino and looked out upon the sea there it still lay calm yet lively of an unmixed blue yet variegated hushed but articulate even to melodiousness everything about and around this coast appeared indeed jaunty tuneful and at ease reciprocating with heartiness the rays of the splendid sun everything except himself the palms and flowers on the terraces before him were undisturbed by a single cold breath the marble work of parapets and steps was unsplintered by frosts the whole was like a conservatory with the sky for its dome  for want of other occupation he went round towards the public entrance to the casino and ascended the great staircase into the pillared hall it was possible after all that upon leaving the hotel and sending on their luggage they had taken another turn through the rooms to follow by a later train with more than curiosity he scanned first the readingrooms only however to see not a face that he knew he then crossed the vestibule to the gamingtables    iv  here he was confronted by a heated phantasmagoria of splendour and a high pressure of suspense that seemed to make the air quiver a low whisper of conversation prevailed which might probably have been not wrongly defined as the lowest note of social harmony  the people gathered at this negative pole of industry had come from all civilized countries their tongues were familiar with many forms of utterance that of each racial group or type being unintelligible in its subtler variations if not entirely to the rest but the language of meum and tuum they collectively comprehended without translation in a halfcharmed spellbound state they had congregated in knots standing or sitting in hollow circles round the notorious oval tables marked with figures and lines the eyes of all these sets of people were watching the roulette somerset went from table to table looking among the loungers rather than among the regular players for faces or at least for one face which did not meet his gaze  the suggestive charm which the centuriesold impersonality gaming rather than games and gamesters had for somerset led him to loiter on even when his hope of meeting any of the power and de stancy party had vanished as a nonparticipant in its profits and losses fevers and frenzies it had that stage effect upon his imagination which is usually exercised over those who behold chance presented to them with spectacular piquancy without advancing far enough in its acquaintance to suffer from its ghastly reprisals and impish tricks he beheld a hundred diametrically opposed wishes issuing from the murky intelligences around a table and spreading down across each other upon the figured diagram in their midst each to its own number it was a network of hopes which at the announcement sept rouge impair et manque disappeared like magic gossamer to be replaced in a moment by new that all the people there including himself could be interested in what to the eye of perfect reason was a somewhat monotonous thingthe property of numbers to recur at certain longer or shorter intervals in a machine containing themin other words the blind groping after fractions of a result the whole of which was well knownwas one testimony among many of the powerlessness of logic when confronted with imagination  at this juncture our lounger discerned at one of the tables about the last person in the world he could have wished to encounter there it was dare whom he had supposed to be a thousand miles off hanging about the purlieus of markton  dare was seated beside a table in an attitude of application which seemed to imply that he had come early and engaged in this pursuit in a systematic manner somerset had never witnessed dare and de stancy together neither had he heard of any engagement of dare by the travelling party as artist courier or otherwise and yet it crossed his mind that dare might have had something to do with them or at least have seen them this possibility was enough to overmaster somersets reluctance to speak to the young man and he did so as soon as an opportunity occurred  dares face was as rigid and dry as if it had been encrusted with plaster and he was like one turned into a computing machine which no longer had the power of feeling he recognized somerset as indifferently as if he had met him in the ward of stancy castle and replying to his remarks by a word or two concentrated on the game anew  are you here alone said somerset presently  quite alone there was a silence till dare added but i have seen some friends of yours he again became absorbed in the events of the table somerset retreated a few steps and pondered the question whether dare could know where they had gone he disliked to be beholden to dare for information but he would give a great deal to know while pausing he watched dares play he staked only fivefranc pieces but it was done with an assiduity worthy of larger coin at every halfminute or so he placed his money on a certain spot and as regularly had the mortification of seeing it swept away by the croupiers rake after a while he varied his procedure he risked his money which from the look of his face seemed rather to have dwindled than increased less recklessly against long odds than before leaving off backing numbers en plein he laid his venture a cheval then tried it upon the dozens then upon two numbers then upon a square and apparently getting nearer and nearer defeat at last upon the simple chances of even or odd over or under red or black yet with a few fluctuations in his favour fortune bore steadily against him till he could breast her blows no longer he rose from the table and came towards somerset and they both moved on together into the entrancehall  dare was at that moment the victim of an overpowering mania for more money his presence in the south of europe had its origin as may be guessed in captain de stancys journey in the same direction whom he had followed and troubled with persistent request for more funds carefully keeping out of sight of paula and the rest his dream of involving paula in the de stancy pedigree knew no abatement but somerset had lighted upon him at an instant when that idea though not displaced was overwhelmed by a rage for play in hope of being able to continue it by somersets aid he was prepared to do almost anything to please the architect  you asked me said dare stroking his impassive brow if i had seen anything of the powers i have seen them and if i can be of any use to you in giving information about them i shall only be too glad  what information can you give  i can tell you where they are gone to  where  to the grand hotel genoa they went on there this afternoon  whom do you refer to by they  mrs goodman mr power miss power miss de stancy and the worthy captain he leaves them tomorrow he comes back here for a day on his way to england  somerset was silent dare continued now i have done you a favour will you do me one in return  somerset looked towards the gamingrooms and said dubiously well  lend me two hundred francs  yes said somerset but on one condition that i dont give them to you till you are inside the hotel you are staying at  that cant be its at nice  well i am going back to nice and ill lend you the money the instant we get there  but i want it here now instantly cried dare and for the first time there was a wiry unreasonableness in his voice that fortified his companion more firmly than ever in his determination to lend the young man no money whilst he remained inside that building  you want it to throw it away i dont approve of it so come with me  but said dare i arrived here with a hundred napoleons and more expressly to work out my theory of chances and recurrences which is sound i have studied it hundreds of times by the help of this he partially drew from his pocket the little volume that we have before seen in his hands if i only persevere in my system the certainty that i must win is almost mathematical i have staked and lost two hundred and thirtythree times allowing out of that one chance in every thirtysix which is the average of zero being marked and two hundred and four times for the backers of the other numbers i have the mathematical expectation of six times at least which would nearly recoup me and shall i then sacrifice that vast foundation of waste chances that i have laid down and paid for merely for want of a little ready money  you might persevere for a twelvemonth and still not get the better of your reverses time tells in favour of the bank just imagine for the sake of argument that all the people who have ever placed a stake upon a certain number to be one person playing continuously has that imaginary person won the existence of the bank is a sufficient answer  but a particular player has the option of leaving off at any point favourable to himself which the bank has not and theres my opportunity  which from your mood you will be sure not to take advantage of  i shall go on playing said dare doggedly  not with my money  very well we wont part as enemies replied dare with the flawless politeness of a man whose speech has no longer any kinship with his feelings shall we share a bottle of wine you will not well i hope your luck with your lady will be more magnificent than mine has been here butmind captain de stancy hes a fearful wildfowl for you  hes a harmless inoffensive soldier as far as i know if he is notlet him be what he may for me  and do his worst to cut you out i suppose  ayif you will somerset much against his judgment was being stimulated by these pricks into words of irritation captain de stancy might i think be better employed than in dangling at the heels of a lady who can well dispense with his company and you might be better employed than in wasting your wages here  wagesa fit word for my money may i ask you at what stage in the appearance of a man whose way of existence is unknown his money ceases to be called wages and begins to be called means  somerset turned and left him without replying dare following his receding figure with a look of ripe resentment not less likely to vent itself in mischief from the want of moral ballast in him who emitted it he then fixed a nettled and unsatisfied gaze upon the gamingrooms and in another minute or two left the casino also  dare and somerset met no more that day the latter returned to nice by the evening train and went straight to the hotel he now thanked his fortune that he had not precipitately given up his room there for a telegram from paula awaited him his hand almost trembled as he opened it to read the following few short words dated from the grand hotel genoa  letter received am glad to hear of your journey we are not returning to nice but stay here a week i direct this at a venture  this tantalizing messagethe first breaking of her recent silencewas saucy almost cruel in its dry frigidity it led him to give up his idea of following at once to genoa that was what she obviously expected him to do and it was possible that his nonarrival might draw a letter or message from her of a sweeter composition than this that would at least be the effect of his tardiness if she cared in the least for him if she did not he could bear the worst the argument was good enough as far as it went but like many more failed from the narrowness of its premises the contingent intervention of dare being entirely undreamt of it was altogether a fatal miscalculation which cost him dear  passing by the telegraphoffice in the rue pontneuf at an early hour the next morning he saw dare coming out from the door it was somersets momentary impulse to thank dare for the information given as to paulas whereabouts information which had now proved true but dare did not seem to appreciate his friendliness and after a few words of studied civility the young man moved on  and well he might five minutes before that time he had thrown open a gulf of treachery between himself and the architect which nothing in life could ever close before leaving the telegraphoffice dare had despatched the following message to paula direct as a setoff against what he called somersets ingratitude for valuable information though it was really the fruit of many passions motives and desires  g somerset nice to miss power grand hotel genoa  have lost all at monte carlo have learnt that captain d s returns here tomorrow please send me one hundred pounds by him and save me from disgrace will await him at eleven oclock and four on the pontneuf    v  five hours after the despatch of that telegram captain de stancy was rattling along the coast railway of the riviera from genoa to nice he was returning to england by way of marseilles but before turning northwards he had engaged to perform on miss powers account a peculiar and somewhat disagreeable duty this was to place in somersets hands a hundred and twentyfive napoleons which had been demanded from her by a message in somersets name the money was in his pocketall in gold in a canvas bag tied up by paulas own hands which he had observed to tremble as she tied it  as he leaned in the corner of the carriage he was thinking over the events of the morning which had culminated in that liberal response at ten oclock before he had gone out from the hotel where he had taken up his quarters which was not the same as the one patronized by paula and her friends he had been summoned to her presence in a manner so unexpected as to imply that something serious was in question on entering her room he had been struck by the absence of that saucy independence usually apparent in her bearing towards him notwithstanding the persistency with which he had hovered near her for the previous month and gradually by the position of his sister and the favour of paulas uncle in intercepting one of somersets letters and several of his telegrams established himself as an intimate member of the travelling party his entry however this time as always had had the effect of a tonic and it was quite with her customary selfpossession that she had told him of the object of her message  you think of returning to nice this afternoon she inquired  de stancy informed her that such was his intention and asked if he could do anything for her there  then he remembered she had hesitated i have received a telegram she said at length and so she allowed to escape her bit by bit the information that her architect whose name she seemed reluctant to utter had travelled from england to nice that week partly to consult her partly for a holiday trip that he had gone on to monte carlo had there lost his money and got into difficulties and had appealed to her to help him out of them by the immediate advance of some ready cash it was a sad case an unexpected case she murmured with her eyes fixed on the window indeed she could not comprehend it  to de stancy there appeared nothing so very extraordinary in somersets apparent fiasco except in so far as that he should have applied to paula for relief from his distresses instead of elsewhere it was a selfhumiliation which a lover would have avoided at all costs he thought yet after a momentary reflection on his theory of somersets character it seemed sufficiently natural that he should lean persistently on paula if only with a view of keeping himself linked to her memory without thinking too profoundly of his own dignity that the esteem in which she had held somerset up to that hour suffered a tremendous blow by his apparent scrape was clearly visible in her reticent as she was and de stancy while pitying somerset thanked him in his mind for having gratuitously given a rival an advantage which that rivals attentions had never been able to gain of themselves  after a little further conversation she had said since you are to be my messenger i must tell you that i have decided to send the hundred pounds asked for and you will please to deliver them into no hands but his own a curious little blush crept over her sobered faceperhaps it was a blush of shame at the conduct of the young man in whom she had of late been suspiciously interestedas she added he will be on the pontneuf at four this afternoon and again at eleven tomorrow can you meet him there  certainly de stancy replied  she then asked him rather anxiously how he could account for mr somerset knowing that he captain de stancy was about to return to nice  de stancy informed her that he left word at the hotel of his intention to return which was quite true moreover there did not lurk in his mind at the moment of speaking the faintest suspicion that somerset had seen dare  she then tied the bag and handed it to him leaving him with a serene and impenetrable bearing which he hoped for his own sake meant an acquired indifference to somerset and his fortunes her sending the architect a sum of money which she could easily spare might be set down to natural generosity towards a man with whom she was artistically cooperating for the improvement of her home  she came back to him again for a moment could you possibly get there before four this afternoon she asked and he informed her that he could just do so by leaving almost at once which he was very willing to do though by so forestalling his time he would lose the projected morning with her and the rest at the palazzo doria  i may tell you that i shall not go to the palazzo doria either if it is any consolation to you to know it was her reply i shall sit indoors and think of you on your journey  the answer admitted of two translations and conjectures thereon filled the gallant soldiers mind during the greater part of the journey he arrived at the hotel they had all stayed at in succession about six hours after somerset had left it for a little excursion to san remo and its neighbourhood as a means of passing a few days till paula should write again to inquire why he had not come on de stancy saw no one he knew and in obedience to paulas commands he promptly set off on foot for the pontneuf  though opposed to the architect as a lover de stancy felt for him as a poor devil in need of money having had experiences of that sort himself and he was really anxious that the needful supply entrusted to him should reach somersets hands he was on the bridge five minutes before the hour and when the clock struck a hand was laid on his shoulder turning he beheld dare  knowing that the youth was loitering somewhere along the coast for they had frequently met together on de stancys previous visit the latter merely said dont bother me for the present willy i have an engagement you can see me at the hotel this evening  when you have given me the hundred pounds i will fly like a rocket captain said the young gentleman i keep the appointment instead of the other man  de stancy looked hard at him howdo you know about this he asked breathlessly  i have seen him  de stancy took the young man by the two shoulders and gazed into his eyes the scrutiny seemed not altogether to remove the suspicion which had suddenly started up in his mind my soul he said dropping his arms can this be true  what  you know  dare shrugged his shoulders are you going to hand over the money or no he said  i am going to make inquiries said de stancy walking away with a vehement tread  captain you are without natural affection said dare walking by his side in a tone which showed his fear that he had overestimated that emotion see what i have done for you you have been my constant care and anxiety for i cant tell how long i have stayed awake at night thinking how i might best give you a good start in the world by arranging this judicious marriage when you have been sleeping as sound as a top with no cares upon your mind at all and now i have got into a scrapeas the most thoughtful of us may sometimesyou go to make inquiries  i have promised the lady to whom this money belongswhose generosity has been shamefully abused in some waythat i will deliver it into no hands but those of one man and he has not yet appeared i therefore go to find him  dare laid his hand upon de stancys arm captain we are both warm and punctilious on points of honour this will come to a split between us if we dont mind so not to bring matters to a crisis lend me ten pounds here to enable me to get home and ill disappear  in a state bordering on distraction eager to get the young man out of his sight before worse revelations should rise up between them de stancy without pausing in his walk gave him the sum demanded he soon reached the postoffice where he inquired if a mr somerset had left any directions for forwarding letters  it was just what somerset had done de stancy was told that mr somerset had commanded that any letters should be sent on to him at the hotel victoria san remo  it was now evident that the scheme of getting money from paula was either of dares invention or that somerset ashamed of his first impulse had abandoned it as speedily as it had been formed de stancy turned and went out dare in keeping with his promise had vanished captain de stancy resolved to do nothing in the case till further events should enlighten him beyond sending a line to miss power to inform her that somerset had not appeared and that he therefore retained the money for further instructions     book the fifth de stancy and paula   i  miss power was reclining on a red velvet couch in the bedroom of an oldfashioned red hotel at strassburg and her friend miss de stancy was sitting by a window of the same apartment they were both rather wearied by a long journey of the previous day the hotel overlooked the large open kleber platz erect in the midst of which the bronze statue of general kleber received the rays of a warm sun that was powerless to brighten him the whole square with its people and vehicles going to and fro as if they had plenty of time was visible to charlotte in her chair but paula from her horizontal position could see nothing below the level of the many dormered housetops on the opposite side of the platz after watching this upper storey of the city for some time in silence she asked charlotte to hand her a binocular lying on the table through which instrument she quietly regarded the distant roofs  what strange and philosophical creatures storks are she said they give a taciturn ghostly character to the whole town  the birds were crossing and recrossing the field of the glass in their flight hither and thither between the strassburg chimneys their sad grey forms sharply outlined against the sky and their skinny legs showing beneath like the limbs of dead martyrs in crivellis emaciated imaginings the indifference of these birds to all that was going on beneath them impressed her to harmonize with their solemn and silent movements the houses beneath should have been deserted and grass growing in the streets  behind the long roofs thus visible to paula over the windowsill with their tiers of dormerwindows rose the cathedral spire in airy openwork forming the highest object in the scene it suggested something which for a long time she appeared unwilling to utter but natural instinct had its way  a place like this she said where he can study gothic architecture would i should have thought be a spot more congenial to him than monaco  the person referred to was the misrepresented somerset whom the two had been gingerly discussing from time to time allowing any casual subject such as that of the storks to interrupt the personal one at every two or three sentences  it would be more like him to be here replied miss de stancy trusting her tongue with only the barest generalities on this matter  somerset was again dismissed for the stork topic but paula could not let him alone and she presently resumed as if an irresistible fascination compelled what judgment had forbidden the strongestminded persons are sometimes caught unawares at that place if they once think they will retrieve their first losses and i am not aware that he is particularly strongminded  for a moment charlotte looked at her with a mixed expression in which there was deprecation that a woman with any feeling should criticize somerset so frigidly and relief that it was paula who did so for notwithstanding her assumption that somerset could never be anything more to her than he was already charlottes heart would occasionally step down and trouble her views so expressed  whether looking through a glass at distant objects enabled paula to bottle up her affection for the absent one or whether her friend charlotte had so little personality in paulas regard that she could commune with her as with a lay figure it was certain that she evinced remarkable ease in speaking of somerset resuming her words about him in the tone of one to whom he was at most an ordinary professional adviser it would be very awkward for the works at the castle if he has got into a scrape i suppose the builders were well posted with instructions before he left but he ought certainly to return soon why did he leave england at all just now  perhaps it was to see you  he should have waited it would not have been so dreadfully long to may or june charlotte how can a man who does such a harebrained thing as this be deemed trustworthy in an important work like that of rebuilding stancy castle  there was such stress in the inquiry that whatever factitiousness had gone before charlotte perceived paula to be at last speaking her mind and it seemed as if somerset must have considerably lost ground in her opinion or she would not have criticized him thus  my brother will tell us full particulars when he comes perhaps it is not at all as we suppose said charlotte she strained her eyes across the platz and added he ought to have been here before this time  while they waited and talked paula still observing the storks the hotel omnibus came round the corner from the station i believe he has arrived resumed miss de stancy i see something that looks like his portmanteau on the top of the omnibus yes it is his baggage ill run down to him  de stancy had obtained six weeks additional leave on account of his health which had somewhat suffered in india the first use he made of his extra time was in hastening back to meet the travelling ladies here at strassburg mr power and mrs goodman were also at the hotel and when charlotte got downstairs the former was welcoming de stancy at the door  paula had not seen him since he set out from genoa for nice commissioned by her to deliver the hundred pounds to somerset his note stating that he had failed to meet somerset contained no details and she guessed that he would soon appear before her now to answer any question about that peculiar errand  her anticipations were justified by the event she had no sooner gone into the next sittingroom than charlotte de stancy appeared and asked if her brother might come up the closest observer would have been in doubt whether paulas ready reply in the affirmative was prompted by personal consideration for de stancy or by a hope to hear more of his mission to nice as soon as she had welcomed him she reverted at once to the subject  yes as i told you he was not at the place of meeting de stancy replied and taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it intact upon the table  de stancy did this with a hand that shook somewhat more than a long railway journey was adequate to account for and in truth it was the vision of dares position which agitated the unhappy captain for had that young man as de stancy feared been tampering with somersets name his fate now trembled in the balance paula would unquestionably and naturally invoke the aid of the law against him if she discovered such an imposition  were you punctual to the time mentioned she asked curiously  de stancy replied in the affirmative  did you wait long she continued  not very long he answered his instinct to screen the possibly guilty one confining him to guarded statements while still adhering to the literal truth  why was that  somebody came and told me that he would not appear  who  a young man who has been acting as his clerk his name is dare he informed me that mr somerset could not keep the appointment  why  he had gone on to san remo  has he been travelling with mr somerset  he had been with him they know each other very well but as you commissioned me to deliver the money into no hands but mr somersets i adhered strictly to your instructions  but perhaps my instructions were not wise should it in your opinion have been sent by this young man was he commissioned to ask you for it  de stancy murmured that dare was not commissioned to ask for it that upon the whole he deemed her instructions wise and was still of opinion that the best thing had been done  although de stancy was distracted between his desire to preserve dare from the consequences of folly and a gentlemanly wish to keep as close to the truth as was compatible with that condition his answers had not appeared to paula to be particularly evasive the conjuncture being one in which a handsome heiresss shrewdness was prone to overleap itself by setting down embarrassment on the part of the man she questioned to a mere lovers difficulty in steering between honour and rivalry  she put but one other question did it appear as if he mr somerset after telegraphing hadhadregretted doing so and evaded the result by not keeping the appointment  thats just how it appears the words which saved dare from ignominy cost de stancy a good deal he was sorry for somerset sorry for himself and very sorry for paula but dare was to de stancy what somerset could never be and for his kin that is near unto him shall a man be defiled  after that interview charlotte saw with warring impulses that somerset slowly diminished in paulas estimate slowly as the moon wanes but as certainly charlottes own love was of a clinging uncritical sort and though the shadowy intelligence of somersets doings weighed down her soul with regret it seemed to make not the least difference in her affection for him  in the afternoon the whole party including de stancy drove about the streets here they looked at the house in which goethe had lived and afterwards entered the cathedral observing in the south transept a crowd of people waiting patiently they were reminded that they unwittingly stood in the presence of the popular clockwork of schwilgue  mr power and mrs goodman decided that they would wait with the rest of the idlers and see the puppets perform at the striking charlotte also waited with them but as it wanted eight minutes to the hour and as paula had seen the show before she moved on into the nave  presently she found that de stancy had followed he did not come close till she seeing him stand silent said if it were not for this cathedral i should not like the city at all and i have even seen cathedrals i like better luckily we are going on to baden tomorrow  your uncle has just told me he has asked me to keep you company  are you intending to said paula probing the basemoulding of a pier with her parasol  i have nothing better to do nor indeed half so good said de stancy i am abroad for my health you know and whats like the rhine and its neighbourhood in early summer before the crowd comes it is delightful to wander about there or anywhere like a child influenced by no fixed motive more than that of keeping near some friend or friends including the one we most admire in the world  that sounds perilously like lovemaking  tis love indeed  well love is natural to men i suppose rejoined the young lady but you must love within bounds or you will be enervated and cease to be useful as a heavy arm of the service  my dear miss power your didactic and respectable rules wont do for me if you expect straws to stop currents you are sadly mistaken but nolet matters be i am a happy contented mortal at present say what you will you dont ask why perhaps you know it is because all i care for in the world is near me and that i shall never be more than a hundred yards from her as long as the present arrangement continues  we are in a cathedral remember captain de stancy and should not keep up a secular conversation  if i had never said worse in a cathedral than what i have said here i should be content to meet my eternal judge without absolution your uncle asked me this morning how i liked you  well there was no harm in that  how i like you harm no but you should have seen how silly i looked fancy the inadequacy of the expression when my whole sense is absorbed by you  men allow themselves to be made ridiculous by their own feelings in an inconceivable way  true i am a fool but forgive me he rejoined observing her gaze which wandered critically from roof to clerestory and then to the pillars without once lighting on him dont mind saying yesyou look at this thing and that thing but you never look at me though i stand here and see nothing but you  there the clock is strikingand the cock crows please go across to the transept and tell them to come out this way  de stancy went when he had gone a few steps he turned his head she had at last ceased to study the architecture and was looking at him perhaps his words had struck her for it seemed at that moment as if he read in her bright eyes a genuine interest in him and his fortunes    ii  next day they went on to baden de stancy was beginning to cultivate the passion of love even more as an escape from the gloomy relations of his life than as matrimonial strategy paulas juxtaposition had the attribute of making him forget everything in his own history she was a magic alterative and the most foolish boyish shape into which he could throw his feelings for her was in this respect to be aimed at as the act of highest wisdom  he supplemented the natural warmth of feeling that she had wrought in him by every artificial means in his power to make the distraction the more complete he had not known anything like this selfobscuration for a dozen years and when he conjectured that she might really learn to love him he felt exalted in his own eyes and purified from the dross of his former life such uneasiness of conscience as arose when he suddenly remembered dare and the possibility that somerset was getting ousted unfairly had its weight in depressing him but he was inclined to accept his fortune without much question  the journey to baden though short was not without incidents on which he could work out this curious hobby of cultivating to superlative power an already positive passion handing her in and out of the carriage accidentally getting brushed by her clothes of all such as this he made available fuel paula though she might have guessed the general nature of what was going on seemed unconscious of the refinements he was trying to throw into it and sometimes when in stepping into or from a railway carriage she unavoidably put her hand upon his arm the obvious insignificance she attached to the action struck him with misgiving  one of the first things they did at baden was to stroll into the trinkhalle where paula sipped the water she was about to put down the glass when de stancy quickly took it from her hands as though to make use of it himself  o if that is what you mean she said mischievously you should have noticed the exact spot it was there she put her finger on a particular portion of its edge  you ought not to act like that unless you mean something miss power he replied gravely  tell me more plainly  i mean you should not do things which excite in me the hope that you care something for me unless you really do  i put my finger on the edge and said it was there  meaning it was there my lips touched let yours do the same  the latter part i wholly deny she answered with disregard after which she went away and kept between charlotte and her aunt for the rest of the afternoon  since the receipt of the telegram paula had been frequently silent she frequently stayed in alone and sometimes she became quite gloomyan altogether unprecedented phase for her this was the case on the morning after the incident in the trinkhalle not to intrude on her charlotte walked about the landings of the sunny white hotel in which they had taken up their quarters went down into the court and petted the tortoises that were creeping about there among the flowers and plants till at last on going to her friend she caught her reading some old letters of somersets  paula made no secret of them and miss de stancy could see that more than half were written on blue paper with diagrams amid the writing they were in fact simply those sheets of his letters which related to the rebuilding nevertheless charlotte fancied she had caught paula in a sentimental mood and doubtless could somerset have walked in at this moment instead of charlotte it might have fared well with him so insidiously do tender memories reassert themselves in the face of outward mishaps  they took a drive down the lichtenthal road and then into the forest de stancy and abner power riding on horseback alongside the sun streamed yellow behind their backs as they wound up the long inclines lighting the red trunks and even the blueblack foliage itself the summer had already made impression upon that mass of uniform colour by tipping every twig with a tiny sprout of virescent yellow while the minute sounds which issued from the forest revealed that the apparently still place was becoming a perfect reservoir of insect life  abner power was quite sentimental that day in such places as these he said as he rode alongside mrs goodman natures powers in the multiplication of one type strike me as much as the grandeur of the mass  mrs goodman agreed with him and paula said the foliage forms the roof of an interminable green crypt the pillars being the trunks and the vault the interlacing boughs  it is a fine place in a thunderstorm said de stancy i am not an enthusiast but to see the lightning spring hither and thither like lazytongs bristling and striking and vanishing is rather impressive  it must be indeed said paula  and in the winter winds these pines sigh like ten thousand spirits in trouble  indeed they must said paula  at the same time i know a little firplantation about a mile square not far from markton said de stancy which is precisely like this in miniaturestems colours slopes winds and all if we were to go there any time with a highly magnifying pair of spectacles it would look as fine as thisand save a deal of travelling  i know the place and i agree with you said paula  you agree with me on all subjects but one he presently observed in a voice not intended to reach the others  paula looked at him but was silent  onward and upward they went the same pattern and colour of tree repeating themselves endlessly till in a couple of hours they reached the castle hill which was to be the end of their journey and beheld stretched beneath them the valley of the murg they alighted and entered the fortress  what did you mean by that look of kindness you bestowed upon me just now when i said you agreed with me on all subjects but one asked de stancy half humorously as he held open a little door for her the others having gone ahead  i meant i suppose that i was much obliged to you for not requiring agreement on that one subject she said passing on  not more than that said de stancy as he followed her but whenever i involuntarily express towards you sentiments that there can be no mistaking you seem truly compassionate  if i seem so i feel so  if you mean no more than mere compassion i wish you would show nothing at all for your mistaken kindness is only preparing more misery for me than i should have if let alone to suffer without mercy  i implore you to be quiet captain de stancy leave me and look out of the window at the view here or at the pictures or at the armour or whatever it is we are come to see  very well but pray dont extract amusement from my harmless remarks such as they are i mean them  she stopped him by changing the subject for they had entered an octagonal chamber on the first floor presumably full of pictures and curiosities but the shutters were closed and only stray beams of light gleamed in to suggest what was there  cant somebody open the windows said paula  the attendant is about to do it said her uncle and as he spoke the shutters to the east were flung back and one of the loveliest views in the forest disclosed itself outside  some of them stepped out upon the balcony the river lay along the bottom of the valley irradiated with a silver shine little rafts of pinewood floated on its surface like tiny splinters the men who steered them not appearing larger than ants  paula stood on the balcony looking for a few minutes upon the sight and then came into the shadowy room where de stancy had remained while the rest were still outside she resumed you must not suppose that i shrink from the subject you so persistently bring before me i respect deep affectionyou know i do but for me to say that i have any such for you of the particular sort you only will be satisfied with would be absurd i dont feel it and therefore there can be nothing between us one would think it would be better to feel kindly towards you than to feel nothing at all but if you object to that ill try to feel nothing  i dont really object to your sympathy said de stancy rather struck by her seriousness but it is very saddening to think you can feel nothing more  it must be so since i can feel no more she decisively replied adding as she stopped her seriousness you must pray for strength to get over it  one thing i shall never pray for to see you give yourself to another man but i suppose i shall witness that some day  you may she gravely returned  you have no doubt chosen him already cried the captain bitterly  no captain de stancy she said shortly a faint involuntary blush coming into her face as she guessed his allusion  this and a few glances round at the pictures and curiosities completed their survey of the castle de stancy knew better than to trouble her further that day with special remarks during the return journey he rode ahead with mr power and she saw no more of him  she would have been astonished had she heard the conversation of the two gentlemen as they wound gently downwards through the trees  as far as i am concerned captain de stancys companion was saying nothing would give me more unfeigned delight than that you should persevere and win her but you must understand that i have no authority over hernothing more than the natural influence that arises from my being her fathers brother  and for exercising that much whatever it may be in my favour i thank you heartily said de stancy but i am coming to the conclusion that it is useless to press her further she is right i am not the man for her i am too old and too poor and i must put up as well as i can with her lossdrown her image in old falernian till i embark in charons boat for goodreally if i had the industry i could write some good horatian verses on my inauspicious situation ah wellin this way i affect levity over my troubles but in plain truth my life will not be the brightest without her  dont be downhearted you are tootoo gentlemanly de stancy in this matteryou are too soon put offyou should have a touch of the canvasser about you in approaching her and not stick at things you have my hearty invitation to travel with us all the way till we cross to england and there will be heaps of opportunities as we wander on ill keep a slow pace to give you time  you are very good my friend well i will try again i am full of doubt and indecision mind but at present i feel that i will try again there is i suppose a slight possibility of something or other turning up in my favour if it is true that the unexpected always happensfor i foresee no chance whatever which way do we go when we leave here tomorrow  to carlsruhe she says if the rest of us have no objection  carlsruhe then let it be with all my heart or anywhere  to carlsruhe they went next day after a night of soft rain which brought up a warm steam from the schwarzwald valleys and caused the young tufts and grasses to swell visibly in a few hours after the baden slopes the flat thoroughfares of charless rest seemed somewhat uninteresting though a busy fair which was proceeding in the streets created a quaint and unexpected liveliness on reaching the oldfashioned inn in the langestrasse that they had fixed on the women of the party betook themselves to their rooms and showed little inclination to see more of the world that day than could be gleaned from the hotel windows    iii  while the malignant tongues had been playing havoc with somersets fame in the ears of paula and her companion the young man himself was proceeding partly by rail partly on foot below and amid the oliveclad hills vineyards carob groves and lemon gardens of the mediterranean shores arrived at san remo he wrote to nice to inquire for letters and such as had come were duly forwarded but not one of them was from paula this broke down his resolution to hold off and he hastened directly to genoa regretting that he had not taken this step when he first heard that she was there  something in the very aspect of the marble halls of that city which at any other time he would have liked to linger over whispered to him that the bird had flown and inquiry confirmed the fancy nevertheless the architectural beauties of the palacebordered street looking as if mountains of marble must have been levelled to supply the materials for constructing it detained him there two days or rather a feat of resolution by which he set himself to withstand the dragchain of paulas influence was operative for that space of time  at the end of it he moved onward there was no difficulty in discovering their track northwards and feeling that he might as well return to england by the rhine route as by any other he followed in the course they had chosen getting scent of them in strassburg missing them at baden by a day and finally overtaking them at carlsruhe which town he reached on the morning after the power and de stancy party had taken up their quarters at the ancient inn above mentioned when somerset was about to get out of the train at this place little dreaming what a meaning the word carlsruhe would have for him in subsequent years he was disagreeably surprised to see no other than dare stepping out of the adjoining carriage a new brown leather valise in one of his hands a new umbrella in the other and a new suit of fashionable clothes on his back seemed to denote considerable improvement in the young mans fortunes somerset was so struck by the circumstance of his being on this spot that he almost missed his opportunity for alighting  dare meanwhile had moved on without seeing his former employer and somerset resolved to take the chance that offered and let him go there was something so mysterious in their common presence simultaneously at one place five hundred miles from where they had last met that he exhausted conjecture on whether dares errand this way could have anything to do with his own or whether their juxtaposition a second time was the result of pure accident greatly as he would have liked to get this answered by a direct question to dare himself he did not counteract his first instinct and remained unseen  they went out in different directions when somerset for the first time remembered that in learning at baden that the party had flitted towards carlsruhe he had taken no care to ascertain the name of the hotel they were bound for carlsruhe was not a large place and the point was immaterial but the omission would necessitate a little inquiry to follow dare on the chance of his having fixed upon the same quarters was a course which did not commend itself he resolved to get some lunch before proceeding with his businessor fatuityof discovering the elusive lady and drove off to a neighbouring tavern which did not happen to be as he hoped it might the one chosen by those who had preceded him  meanwhile dare previously master of their plans went straight to the house which sheltered them and on entering under the archway from the langestrasse was saved the trouble of inquiring for captain de stancy by seeing him drinking bitters at a little table in the court had somerset chosen this inn for his quarters instead of the one in the marketplace which he actually did choose the three must inevitably have met here at this moment with some possibly striking dramatic results though what they would have been remains for ever hidden in the darkness of the unfulfilled  de stancy jumped up from his chair and went forward to the newcomer you are not long behind us then he said with laconic disquietude i thought you were going straight home  i was said dare but i have been blessed with what i may call a small competency since i saw you last of the two hundred francs you gave me i risked fifty at the tables and i have multiplied them how many times do you think more than four hundred times  de stancy immediately looked grave i wish you had lost them he said with as much feeling as could be shown in a place where strangers were hovering near  nonsense captain i have proceeded purely on a calculation of chances and my calculations proved as true as i expected notwithstanding a little inandout luck at first witness this as the result he smacked his bag with his umbrella and the chink of money resounded from within just feel the weight of it  it is not necessary i take your word  shall i lend you five pounds  god forbid as if that would repay me for what you have cost me but come lets get out of this place to where we can talk more freely he put his hand through the young mans arm and led him round the corner of the hotel towards the schlossplatz  these runs of luck will be your ruin as i have told you before continued captain de stancy you will be for repeating and repeating your experiments and will end by blowing your brains out as wiser heads than yours have done i am glad you have come away at any rate why did you travel this way  simply because i could afford it of coursebut come captain something has ruffled you today i thought you did not look in the best temper the moment i saw you every sip you took of your pickup as you sat there showed me something was wrong tell your worry  poohi can tell you in two words said the captain satirically your arrangement for my wealth and happinessfor i suppose you still claim it to be yourshas fallen through the lady has announced today that she means to send for somerset instantly she is coming to a personal explanation with him so woe to meand in another sense woe to you as i have reason to fear  send for him said dare with the stillness of complete abstraction then hell come  well said de stancy looking him in the face and does it make you feel you had better be off how about that telegram did he ask you to send it or did he not  one minute or i shall be up such a tree as nobody ever saw the like of  then what did you come here for burst out de stancy tis my belief you are no more than abut i wont call you names ill tell you quite plainly that if there is anything wrong in that message to herwhich i believe there isno i cant believe though i fear ityou have the chance of appearing in drab clothes at the expense of the government before the year is out and i of being eternally disgraced  no captain you wont be disgraced i am bad to beat i can tell you and come the worst luck i dont say a word  but those letters pricked in your skin would say a good deal it strikes me  what would they strip mebut it is not coming to that look here now ill tell you the truth for once though you dont believe me capable of it i did concoct that telegramand sent it just as a practical joke and many a worse one has been only laughed at by honest men and officers i could show you a bigger joke stilla joke of jokeson the same individual  dare as he spoke put his hand into his breastpocket as if the said joke lay there but after a moment he withdrew his hand empty as he continued  having invented it i have done enough i was going to explain it to you that you might carry it out but you are so serious that i will leave it alone my second joke shall die with me  so much the better said de stancy i dont like your jokes even though they are not directed against myself they express a kind of humour which does not suit me  you may have reason to alter your mind said dare carelessly your success with your lady may depend on it the truth is captain we aristocrats must not take too high a tone our days as an independent division of society which holds aloof from other sections are past this has been my argument in spite of my strong norman feelings ever since i broached the subject of your marrying this girl who represents both intellect and wealthall in fact except the historical prestige that you represent and we mustnt flinch at things the case is even more pressing than ordinary casesowing to the odd fact that the representative of the new blood who has come in our way actually lives in your own old house and owns your own old lands the ordinary reason for such alliances is quintupled in our case do then just think and be reasonable before you talk tall about not liking my jokes and all that beggars mustnt be choosers  theres really much reason in your argument said de stancy with a bitter laugh and my own heart argues much the same way but leaving me to take care of my aristocratic self i advise your aristocratic self to slip off at once to england like any hanggallows dog and if somerset is here and you have been doing wrong in his name and it all comes out ill try to save you as far as an honest man can if you have done no wrong of course there is no fear though i should be obliged by your going homeward as quickly as possible as being better both for you and for me hullodamnation  they had reached one side of the schlossplatz nobody apparently being near them save a sentinel who was on duty before the palace but turning as he spoke de stancy beheld a group consisting of his sister paula and mr power strolling across the square towards them  it was impossible to escape their observation and putting a bold front upon it de stancy advanced with dare at his side till in a few moments the two parties met paula and charlotte recognizing dare at once as the young man who assisted at the castle  i have met my young photographer said de stancy cheerily what a small world it is as everybody truly observes i am wishing he could take some views for us as we go on but you have no apparatus with you i suppose mr dare  i have not sir i am sorry to say replied dare respectfully  you could get some i suppose asked paula of the interesting young photographer  dare declared that it would be not impossible whereupon de stancy said that it was only a passing thought of his and in a few minutes the two parties again separated going their several ways  that was awkward said de stancy trembling with excitement i would advise you to keep further off in future  dare said thoughtfully that he would be careful adding she is a prize for any man indeed leaving alone the substantial possessions behind her now was i too enthusiastic was i a fool for urging you on  wait till success justifies the undertaking in case of failure it will have been anything but wise it is no light matter to have a carefully preserved repose broken in upon for nothinga repose that could never be restored  they walked down the carlfriedrichsstrasse to the margraves pyramid and back to the hotel where dare also decided to take up his stay de stancy left him with the bookkeeper at the desk and went upstairs to see if the ladies had returned    iv  he found them in their sittingroom with their bonnets on as if they had just come in mr power was also present reading a newspaper but mrs goodman had gone out to a neighbouring shop in the windows of which she had seen something which attracted her fancy  when de stancy entered paulas thoughts seemed to revert to dare for almost at once she asked him in what direction the youth was travelling with some hesitation de stancy replied that he believed mr dare was returning to england after a spring trip for the improvement of his mind  a very praiseworthy thing to do said paula what places has he visited  those which afford opportunities for the study of the old masters i believe said de stancy blandly he has also been to turin genoa marseilles and so on the captain spoke the more readily to her questioning in that he divined her words to be dictated not by any suspicions of his relations with dare but by her knowledge of dare as the draughtsman employed by somerset  has he been to nice she next demanded did he go there in company with my architect  i think not  has he seen anything of him my architect somerset once employed him they know each other  i think he saw somerset for a short time  paula was silent do you know where this young man dare is at the present moment she asked quickly  de stancy said that dare was staying at the same hotel with themselves and that he believed he was downstairs  i think i can do no better than send for him said she he may be able to throw some light upon the matter of that telegram  she rang and despatched the waiter for the young man in question de stancy almost visibly trembling for the result but he opened the town directory which was lying on a table and affected to be engrossed in the names  before dare was shown in she said to her uncle perhaps you will speak to him for me  mr power looking up from the paper he was reading assented to her proposition dare appeared in the doorway and the waiter retired dare seemed a trifle startled out of his usual coolness the message having evidently been unexpected and he came forward somewhat uneasily  mr dare we are anxious to know something of miss powers architect and captain de stancy tells us you have seen him lately said mr power sonorously over the edge of his newspaper  not knowing whether danger menaced or no or if it menaced from what quarter it was to be expected dare felt that honesty was as good as anything else for him and replied boldly that he had seen mr somerset de stancy continuing to cream and mantle almost visibly in anxiety at the situation of the speaker  and where did you see him continued mr power  in the casino at monte carlo  how long did you see him  only for half an hour i left him there  paulas interest got the better of her reserve and she cut in upon her uncle did he seem in any unusual state or in trouble  he was rather excited said dare  and can you remember when that was  dare considered looked at his pocketbook and said that it was on the evening of april the twentysecond  the answer had a significance for paula de stancy and charlotte to which abner power was a stranger the telegraphic request for money which had been kept a secret from him by his niece because of his already unfriendly tone towards somerset arrived on the morning of the twentythirda date which neighboured with painfully suggestive nicety upon that now given by dare  she seemed to be silenced and asked no more questions dare having furbished himself up to a gentlemanly appearance with some of his recent winnings was invited to stay on awhile by paulas uncle who as became a travelled man was not fastidious as to company being a youth of the world dare made himself agreeable to that gentleman and afterwards tried to do the same with miss de stancy at this the captain to whom the situation for some time had been amazingly uncomfortable pleaded some excuse for going out and left the room  dare continued his endeavours to say a few polite nothings to charlotte de stancy in the course of which he drew from his pocket his new silk handkerchief by some chance a card came out with the handkerchief and fluttered downwards his momentary instinct was to make a grasp at the card and conceal it but it had already tumbled to the floor where it lay face upward beside charlotte de stancys chair  it was neither a visiting nor a playing card but one bearing a photographic portrait of a peculiar nature it was what dare had characterized as his best joke in speaking on the subject to captain de stancy he had in the morning put it ready in his pocket to give to the captain and had in fact held it in waiting between his finger and thumb while talking to him in the platz meaning that he should make use of it against his rival whenever convenient but his sharp conversation with that soldier had dulled his zest for this final joke at somersets expense had at least shown him that de stancy would not adopt the joke by accepting the photograph and using it himself and determined him to lay it aside till a more convenient time so fully had he made up his mind on this course that when the photograph slipped out he did not at first perceive the appositeness of the circumstance in putting into his own hands the role he had intended for de stancy though it was asserted afterwards that the whole scene was deliberately planned however once having seen the accident he resolved to take the current as it served  the card having fallen beside her miss de stancy glanced over it which indeed she could not help doing the smile that had previously hung upon her lips was arrested as if by frost and she involuntarily uttered a little distressed cry of o like one in bodily pain  paula who had been talking to her uncle during this interlude started round and wondering what had happened inquiringly crossed the room to poor charlottes side asking her what was the matter charlotte had regained selfpossession though not enough to enable her to reply and paula asked her a second time what had made her exclaim like that miss de stancy still seemed confused whereupon paula noticed that her eyes were continually drawn as if by fascination towards the photograph on the floor which contrary to his first impulse dare as has been said now seemed in no hurry to regain surmising at last that the card whatever it was had something to do with the exclamation paula picked it up  it was a portrait of somerset but by a device known in photography the operator though contriving to produce what seemed to be a perfect likeness had given it the distorted features and wild attitude of a man advanced in intoxication no woman unless specially cognizant of such possibilities could have looked upon it and doubted that the photograph was a genuine illustration of a customary phase in the young mans private life  paula observed it thoroughly took it in but the effect upon her was by no means clear charlottes eyes at once forsook the portrait to dwell on paulas face it paled a little and this was followed by a hot blushperceptibly a blush of shame that was all she flung the picture down on the table and moved away  it was now mr powers turn anticipating dare who was advancing with a deprecatory look to seize the photograph he also grasped it when he saw whom it represented he seemed both amused and startled and after scanning it a while handed it to the young man with a queer smile  i am very sorry began dare in a low voice to mr power i fear i was to blame for thoughtlessness in not destroying it but i thought it was rather funny that a man should permit such a thing to be done and that the humour would redeem the offence  in you for purchasing it said paula with haughty quickness from the other side of the room though probably his friends if he has any would say not in him  there was silence in the room after this and dare finding himself rather in the way took his leave as unostentatiously as a cat that has upset the family china though he continued to say among his apologies that he was not aware mr somerset was a personal friend of the ladies  of all the thoughts which filled the minds of paula and charlotte de stancy the thought that the photograph might have been a fabrication was probably the last to them that picture of somerset had all the cogency of direct vision paulas experience much less charlottes had never lain in the fields of heliographic science and they would as soon have thought that the sun could again stand still upon gibeon as that it could be made to falsify mens characters in delineating their features what abner power thought he himself best knew he might have seen such pictures before or he might never have heard of them  while pretending to resume his reading he closely observed paula as did also charlotte de stancy but thanks to the selfmanagement which was miss powers as much by nature as by art she dissembled whatever emotion was in her  it is a pity a professional man should make himself so ludicrous she said with such careless intonation that it was almost impossible even for charlotte who knew her so well to believe her indifference feigned  yes said mr power since charlotte did not speak it is what i scarcely should have expected  o i am not surprised said paula quickly you dont know all the inference was indeed inevitable that if her uncle were made aware of the telegram he would see nothing unlikely in the picture well you are very silent continued paula petulantly when she found that nobody went on talking what made you cry out o charlotte when mr dare dropped that horrid photograph  i dont know i suppose it frightened me stammered the girl  it was a stupid fuss to make before such a person one would think you were in love with mr somerset  what did you say paula inquired her uncle looking up from the newspaper which he had again resumed  nothing uncle abner she walked to the window and as if to tide over what was plainly passing in their minds about her she began to make remarks on objects in the street what a quaint beinglook charlotte it was an old woman sitting by a stall on the opposite side of the way which seemed suddenly to hit paulas sense of the humorous though beyond the fact that the dame was old and poor and wore a white handkerchief over her head there was really nothing noteworthy about her  paula seemed to be more hurt by what the silence of her companions implieda suspicion that the discovery of somersets depravity was wounding her heartthan by the wound itself the ostensible ease with which she drew them into a bye conversation had perhaps the defect of proving too much though her tacit contention that no love was in question was not incredible on the supposition that affronted pride alone caused her embarrassment the chief symptom of her heart being really tender towards somerset consisted in her apparent blindness to charlottes secret so obviously suggested by her momentary agitation    v  and where was the subject of their condemnatory opinions all this while having secured a room at his inn he came forth to complete the discovery of his dear mistresss haltingplace without delay after one or two inquiries he ascertained where such a party of english were staying and arriving at the hotel knew at once that he had tracked them to earth by seeing the heavier portion of the power luggage confronting him in the hall he sent up intelligence of his presence and awaited her reply with a beating heart  in the meanwhile dare descending from his pernicious interview with paula and the rest had descried captain de stancy in the public drawingroom and entered to him forthwith it was while they were here together that somerset passed the door and sent up his name to paula  the incident at the railway station was now reversed somerset being the observed of dare as dare had then been the observed of somerset immediately on sight of him dare showed real alarm he had imagined that somerset would eventually impinge on paulas route but he had scarcely expected it yet and the architects sudden appearance led dare to ask himself the ominous question whether somerset had discovered his telegraphic trick and was in the mood for prompt measures  there is no more for me to do here said the boy hastily to de stancy miss power does not wish to ask me any more questions i may as well proceed on my way as you advised  de stancy who had also gazed with dismay at somersets passing figure though with dismay of another sort was recalled from his vexation by dares remarks and turning upon him he said sharply well may you be in such a hurry all of a sudden  true i am superfluous now  you have been doing a foolish thing and you must suffer its inconvenienceswill i am sorry for one thing i am sorry i ever owned you for you are not a lad to my heart you have disappointed medisappointed me almost beyond endurance  i have acted according to my illumination what can you expect of a man born to dishonour  thats mere speciousness before you knew anything of me and while you thought you were the child of poverty on both sides you were well enough but ever since you thought you were more than that you have led a life which is intolerable what has become of your plan of alliance between the de stancys and the powers now the man is gone upstairs who can overthrow it all  if the man had not gone upstairs you wouldnt have complained of my nature or my plans said dare drily if i mistake not he will come down again with the flea in his ear however i have done my play is played out all the rest remains with you but captain grant me this if when i am gone this difficulty should vanish and things should go well with you and your suit should prosper will you think of him bad as he is who first put you on the track of such happiness and let him know it was not done in vain  i will said de stancy promise me that you will be a better boy  very wellas soon as ever i can afford it now i am up and away when i have explained to them that i shall not require my room  dare fetched his bag touched his hat with his umbrella to the captain and went out of the hotel archway de stancy sat down in the stuffy drawingroom and wondered what other ironies time had in store for him  a waiter in the interim had announced somerset to the group upstairs paula started as much as charlotte at hearing the name and abner power stared at them both  if mr somerset wishes to see me on business show him in said paula  in a few seconds the door was thrown open for somerset on receipt of the pointed message he guessed that a change had come time absence ambition her uncles influence and a new wooer seemed to account sufficiently well for that change and he accepted his fate but a stoical instinct to show her that he could regard vicissitudes with the equanimity that became a man a desire to ease her mind of any fear she might entertain that his connection with her past would render him troublesome in future induced him to accept her permission and see the act to the end  how do you do mr somerset said abner power with sardonic geniality he had been far enough about the world not to be greatly concerned at somersets apparent failing particularly when it helped to reduce him from the rank of lover to his niece to that of professional adviser  miss de stancy faltered a welcome as weak as that of the maid of neidpath and paula said coldly we are rather surprised to see you perhaps there is something urgent at the castle which makes it necessary for you to call  there is something a little urgent said somerset slowly as he approached her and you have judged rightly that it is the cause of my call he sat down near her chair as he spoke put down his hat and drew a notebook from his pocket with a despairing sang froid that was far more perfect than had been paulas demeanour just before  perhaps you would like to talk over the business with mr somerset alone murmured charlotte to miss power hardly knowing what she said  o no said paula i think not is it necessary she said turning to him  not in the least replied he bestowing a penetrating glance upon his questioners face which seemed however to produce no effect and turning towards charlotte he added you will have the goodness i am sure miss de stancy to excuse the jargon of professional details  he spread some tracings on the table and pointed out certain modified features to paula commenting as he went on and exchanging occasionally a few words on the subject with mr abner power by the distant window  in this architectural dialogue over his sketches somersets head and paulas became unavoidably very close the temptation was too much for the young man under cover of the rustle of the tracings he murmured paula i could not get here before in a low voice inaudible to the other two  she did not reply only busying herself the more with the notes and sketches and he said again i stayed a couple of days at genoa and some days at san remo and mentone  but it is not the least concern of mine where you stayed is it she said with a cold yet disquieted look  do you speak seriously somerset brokenly whispered  paula concluded her examination of the drawings and turned from him with sorrowful disregard he tried no further but when she had signified her pleasure on the points submitted packed up his papers and rose with the bearing of a man altogether superior to such a class of misfortune as this before going he turned to speak a few words of a general kind to mr power and charlotte  you will stay and dine with us said the former rather with the air of being unhappily able to do no less than ask the question my charges here wont go down to the tabledhote i fear but de stancy and myself will be there  somerset excused himself and in a few minutes withdrew at the door he looked round for an instant and his eyes met paulas there was the same milesoff expression in hers that they had worn when he entered but there was also a look of distressful inquiry as if she were earnestly expecting him to say something more this of course somerset did not comprehend possibly she was clinging to a hope of some excuse for the message he was supposed to have sent or for the other and more degrading matter anyhow somerset only bowed and went away  a moment after he had gone paula impelled by something or other crossed the room to the window in a short time she saw his form in the broad street below which he traversed obliquely to an opposite corner his head somewhat bent and his eyes on the ground before vanishing into the ritterstrasse he turned his head and glanced at the hotel windows as if he knew that she was watching him then he disappeared and the only real sign of emotion betrayed by paula during the whole episode escaped her at this moment it was a slight trembling of the lip and a sigh so slowly breathed that scarce anybody could hearscarcely even charlotte who was reclining on a couch her face on her hand and her eyes downcast  not more than two minutes had elapsed when mrs goodman came in with a manner of haste  you have returned said mr power have you made your purchases  without answering she asked whom of all people on earth do you think i have met mr somerset has he been herehe passed me almost without speaking  yes he has been here said paula he is on the way from genoa home and called on business  you will have him here to dinner of course  i asked him said mr power but he declined  o thats unfortunate surely we could get him to come you would like to have him here would you not paula  no indeed i dont want him here said she  you dont  no she said sharply  you used to like him well enough anyhow bluntly rejoined mrs goodman  paula sedately it is a mistake to suppose that i ever particularly liked the gentleman mentioned  then you are wrong mrs goodman it seems said mr power  mrs goodman who had been growing quietly indignant notwithstanding a vigorous use of her fan at this said fie fie paula you did like him you said to me only a week or two ago that you should not at all object to marry him  it is a mistake repeated paula calmly i meant the other one of the two we were talking about  what captain de stancy  yes  knowing this to be a fiction mrs goodman made no remark and hearing a slight noise behind turned her head seeing her aunts action paula also looked round the door had been left ajar and de stancy was standing in the room the last words of mrs goodman and paulas reply must have been quite audible to him  they looked at each other much as if they had unexpectedly met at the altar but after a momentary start paula did not flinch from the position into which hurt pride had betrayed her de stancy bowed gracefully and she merely walked to the furthest window whither he followed her  i am eternally grateful to you for avowing that i have won favour in your sight at last he whispered  she acknowledged the remark with a somewhat reserved bearing really i dont deserve your gratitude she said i did not know you were there  i know you did notthats why the avowal is so sweet to me can i take you at your word  yes i suppose  then your preference is the greatest honour that has ever fallen to my lot it is enough you accept me  as a lover on probationno more  the conversation being carried on in low tones paulas uncle and aunt took it as a hint that their presence could be spared and severally left the roomthe former gladly the latter with some vexation charlotte de stancy followed  and to what am i indebted for this happy change inquired de stancy as soon as they were alone  you shouldnt look a gifthorse in the mouth she replied brusquely and with tears in her eyes for one gone  you mistake my motive i am like a reprieved criminal and can scarcely believe the news  you shouldnt say that to me or i shall begin to think i have been too kind she answered some of the archness of her manner returning now i know what you mean to say in answer but i dont want to hear more at present and whatever you do dont fall into the mistake of supposing i have accepted you in any other sense than the way i say if you dont like such a limitation you can go away i dare say i shall get over it  go away could i go awaybut you are beginning to tease and will soon punish me severely so i will make my escape while all is well it would be presumptuous to expect more in one day  it would indeed said paula with her eyes on a bunch of flowers    vi  on leaving the hotel somersets first impulse was to get out of sight of its windows and his glance upward had perhaps not the tender significance that paula imagined the last look impelled by any such whiff of emotion having been the lingering one he bestowed upon her in passing out of the room unluckily for the prospects of this attachment paulas conduct towards him now as a result of misrepresentation had enough in common with her previous silence at nice to make it not unreasonable as a further development of that silence moreover her social position as a woman of wealth always felt by somerset as a perceptible bar to that full and free eagerness with which he would fain have approached her rendered it impossible for him to return to the charge ascertain the reason of her coldness and dispel it by an explanation without being suspected of mercenary objects continually does it happen that a genial willingness to bottle up affronts is set down to interested motives by those who do not know what generous conduct means had she occupied the financial position of miss de stancy he would readily have persisted further and not improbably have cleared up the cloud  having no further interest in carlsruhe somerset decided to leave by an evening train the intervening hour he spent in wandering into the thick of the fair where steam roundabouts the proprietors of waxwork shows and fancystall keepers maintained a deafening din the animated environment was better than silence for it fostered in him an artificial indifference to the events that had just happenedan indifference which though he too well knew it was only destined to be temporary afforded a passive period wherein to store up strength that should enable him to withstand the wear and tear of regrets which would surely set in soon it was the case with somerset as with others of his temperament that he did not feel a blow of this sort immediately and what often seemed like stoicism after misfortune was only the neutral numbness of transition from palpitating hope to assured wretchedness  he walked round and round the fair till all the exhibitors knew him by sight and when the sun got low he turned into the erbprinzenstrasse now raked from end to end by ensaffroned rays of level light seeking his hotel he dined there and left by the evening train for heidelberg    heidelberg with its romantic surroundings was not precisely the place calculated to heal somersets wounded heart he had known the town of yore and his recollections of that period when unfettered in fancy he had transferred to his sketchbook the fine renaissance details of the ottoheinrichsbau came back with unpleasant force he knew of some carved caskheads and other curious woodwork in the castle cellars copies of which being unobtainable by photographs he had intended to make if all went well between paula and himself the zest for this was now wellnigh over but on awaking in the morning and looking up the valley towards the castle and at the dark green height of the konigsstuhl alongside he felt that to become vanquished by a passion driven to suffer fast and pray in the dull pains and vapours of despised love was a contingency not to be welcomed too readily thereupon he set himself to learn the sad science of renunciation which everybody has to learn in his degreeeither rebelling throughout the lesson or like somerset taking to it kindly by force of judgment a more obstinate pupil might have altogether escaped the lesson in the present case by discovering its illegality  resolving to persevere in the heretofore satisfactory paths of art while life and faculties were left though every instinct must proclaim that there would be no longer any collateral attraction in that pursuit he went along under the trees of the anlage and reached the castle vaults in whose cool shades he spent the afternoon working out his intentions with fair result when he had strolled back to his hotel in the evening the time was approaching for the tabledhote having seated himself rather early he spent the few minutes of waiting in looking over his pocketbook and putting a few finishing touches to the afternoon performance whilst the objects were fresh in his memory thus occupied he was but dimly conscious of the customary rustle of dresses and pulling up of chairs by the crowd of other diners as they gathered around him serving began and he put away his book and prepared for the meal he had hardly done this when he became conscious that the person on his left hand was not the typical cosmopolite with boundless hotel knowledge and irrelevant experiences that he was accustomed to find next him but a face he recognized as that of a young man whom he had met and talked to at stancy castle gardenparty whose name he had now forgotten this young fellow was conversing with somebody on his left handno other personage than paula herself next to paula he beheld de stancy and de stancys sister beyond him it was one of those gratuitous encounters which only happen to discarded lovers who have shown commendable stoicism under disappointment as if on purpose to reopen and aggravate their wounds  it seemed as if the intervening traveller had met the other party by accident there and then in a minute he turned and recognized somerset and by degrees the young mens cursory remarks to each other developed into a pretty regular conversation interrupted only when he turned to speak to paula on his left hand  your architectural adviser travels in your party how very convenient said the young tourist to her far pleasanter than having a medical attendant in ones train  somerset who had no distractions on the other side of him could hear every word of this he glanced at paula she had not known of his presence in the room till now their eyes met for a second and she bowed sedately somerset returned her bow and her eyes were quickly withdrawn with scarcely visible confusion  mr somerset is not travelling with us she said we have met by accident mr somerset came to me on business a little while ago  i must congratulate you on having put the castle into good hands continued the enthusiastic young man  i believe mr somerset is quite competent said paula stiffly  to include somerset in the conversation the young man turned to him and added you carry on your work at the castle con amore no doubt  there is work i should like better said somerset  indeed  the frigidity of his manner seemed to set her at ease by dispersing all fear of a scene and alternate dialogues of this sort with the gentleman in their midst were more or less continued by both paula and somerset till they rose from table  in the bustle of moving out the two latter for one moment stood side by side  miss power said somerset in a low voice that was obscured by the rustle you have nothing more to say to me  i think there is nothing more said paula lifting her eyes with longing reticence  then i take leave of you and tender my best wishes that you may have a pleasant time before you i set out for england tonight  with a special photographer no doubt  it was the first time that she had addressed somerset with a meaning distinctly bitter and her remark which had reference to the forged photograph fell of course without its intended effect  no miss power said somerset gravely but with a deeper sense of womans thoughtless trifling than time will ever eradicate  is not that a mistake she asked in a voice that distinctly trembled  a mistake how  i mean do you not forget many things throwing on him a troubled glance a woman may feel herself justified in her conduct although it admits of no explanation  i dont contest the point for a moment goodbye  goodbye  they parted amid the flowering shrubs and caged birds in the hall and he saw her no more de stancy came up and spoke a few commonplace words his sister having gone out either without perceiving somerset or with intention to avoid him  that night as he had said he was on his way to england    vii  the de stancys and powers remained in heidelberg for some days all remarked that after somersets departure paula was frequently irritable though at other times as serene as ever yet even when in a blithe and saucy mood there was at bottom a tinge of melancholy something did not lie easy in her undemonstrative heart and all her friends excused the inequalities of a humour whose source though not positively known could be fairly well guessed  de stancy had long since discovered that his chance lay chiefly in her recently acquired and fanciful predilection dartiste for hoary mediaeval families with ancestors in alabaster and primogenitive renown seeing this he dwelt on those topics which brought out that aspect of himself more clearly talking feudalism and chivalry with a zest that he had never hitherto shown yet it was not altogether factitious for discovering how much this quondam puritan was interested in the attributes of longchronicled houses a reflected interest in himself arose in his own soul and he began to wonder why he had not prized these things before till now disgusted by the failure of his family to hold its own in the turmoil between ancient and modern he had grown to undervalue its past prestige and it was with corrective ardour that he adopted while he ministered to her views  henceforward the wooing of de stancy took the form of an intermittent address the incidents of their travel furnishing pegs whereon to hang his subject sometimes hindering it but seldom failing to produce in her a greater tolerance of his presence his next opportunity was the day after somersets departure from heidelberg they stood on the great terrace of the schlossgarten looking across the intervening ravine to the northeast front of the castle which rose before them in all its customary warm tints and battered magnificence  this is a spot if any which should bring matters to a crisis between you and me he asserted goodhumouredly but you have been so silent today that i lose the spirit to take advantage of my privilege  she inquired what privilege he spoke of as if quite another subject had been in her mind than de stancy  the privilege of winning your heart if i can which you gave me at carlsruhe  o she said well ive been thinking of that but i do not feel myself absolutely bound by the statement i made in that room and i shall expect if i withdraw it not to be called to account by you  de stancy looked rather blank  if you recede from your promise you will doubtless have good reason but i must solemnly beg you after raising my hopes to keep as near as you can to your word so as not to throw me into utter despair  paula dropped her glance into the thiergarten below them where gay promenaders were clambering up between the bushes and flowers at length she said with evident embarrassment but with much distinctness i deserve much more blame for what i have done than you can express to me i will confess to you the whole truth all that i told you in the hotel at carlsruhe was said in a moment of pique at what had happened just before you came in it was supposed i was much involved with another man and circumstances made the supposition particularly objectionable to escape it i jumped at the alternative of yourself  thats bad for me he murmured  if after this avowal you bind me to my words i shall say no more i do not wish to recede from them without your full permission  what a caprice but i release you unconditionally he said and i beg your pardon if i seemed to show too much assurance please put it down to my gratified excitement i entirely acquiesce in your wish i will go away to whatever place you please and not come near you but by your own permission and till you are quite satisfied that my presence and what it may lead to is not undesirable i entirely give way before you and will endeavour to make my future devotedness if ever we meet again a new ground for expecting your favour  paula seemed struck by the generous and cheerful fairness of his remarks and said gently perhaps your departure is not absolutely necessary for my happiness and i do not wish from what you call caprice  i retract that word  well whatever it is i dont wish you to do anything which should cause you real pain or trouble or humiliation  thats very good of you  but i reserve to myself the right to accept or refuse your addressesjust as if those rash words of mine had never been spoken  i must bear it all as best i can i suppose said de stancy with melancholy humorousness  and i shall treat you as your behaviour shall seem to deserve she said playfully  then i may stay  yes i am willing to give you that pleasure if it is one in return for the attentions you have shown and the trouble you have taken to make my journey pleasant  she walked on and discovered mrs goodman near and presently the whole party met together de stancy did not find himself again at her side till later in the afternoon when they had left the immediate precincts of the castle and decided on a drive to the konigsstuhl  the carriage containing only mrs goodman was driven a short way up the winding incline paula her uncle and miss de stancy walking behind under the shadow of the trees then mrs goodman called to them and asked when they were going to join her  we are going to walk up said mr power  paula seemed seized with a spirit of boisterousness quite unlike her usual behaviour my aunt may drive up and you may walk up but i shall run up she said see heres a way she tripped towards a path through the bushes which instead of winding like the regular track made straight for the summit  paula had not the remotest conception of the actual distance to the top imagining it to be but a couple of hundred yards at the outside whereas it was really nearer a mile the ascent being uniformly steep all the way when her uncle and de stancy had seen her vanish they stood still the former evidently reluctant to forsake the easy ascent for a difficult one though he said we cant let her go alone that way i suppose  no of course not said de stancy  they then followed in the direction taken by paula charlotte entering the carriage when power and de stancy had ascended about fifty yards the former looked back and dropped off from the pursuit to return to the easy route giving his companion a parting hint concerning paula whereupon de stancy went on alone he soon saw paula above him in the path which ascended skyward straight as jacobs ladder but was so overhung by the brushwood as to be quite shut out from the sun when he reached her side she was moving easily upward apparently enjoying the seclusion which the place afforded  is not my uncle with you she said on turning and seeing him  he went back said de stancy  she replied that it was of no consequence that she should meet him at the top she supposed  paula looked up amid the green light which filtered through the leafage as far as her eyes could stretch but the top did not appear and she allowed de stancy to get in front it did not seem such a long way as this to look at she presently said  he explained that the trees had deceived her as to the real height by reason of her seeing the slope foreshortened when she looked up from the castle allow me to help you he added  no thank you said paula lightly we must be near the top  they went on again but no konigsstuhl when next de stancy turned he found that she was sitting down immediately going back he offered his arm she took it in silence declaring that it was no wonder her uncle did not come that wearisome way if he had ever been there before  de stancy did not explain that mr power had said to him at parting theres a chance for you if you want one but at once went on with the subject begun on the terrace if my behaviour is good you will reaffirm the statement made at carlsruhe  it is not fair to begin that now expostulated paula i can only think of getting to the top  her colour deepening by the exertion he suggested that she should sit down again on one of the mossy boulders by the wayside nothing loth she did de stancy standing by and with his cane scratching the moss from the stone  this is rather awkward said paula in her usual circumspect way my relatives and your sister will be sure to suspect me of having arranged this scramble with you  but i know better sighed de stancy i wish to heaven you had arranged it  she was not at the top but she took advantage of the halt to answer his previous question there are many points on which i must be satisfied before i can reaffirm anything do you not see that you are mistaken in clinging to this ideathat you are laying up mortification and disappointment for yourself  a negative reply from you would be disappointment early or late  and you prefer having it late to accepting it now if i were a man i should like to abandon a false scent as soon as possible  i suppose all that has but one meaning that i am to go  o no she magnanimously assured him bounding up from her seat i adhere to my statement that you may stay though it is true something may possibly happen to make me alter my mind  he again offered his arm and from sheer necessity she leant upon it as before  grant me but a moments patience he began  captain de stancy is this fair i am physically obliged to hold your arm so that i must listen to what you say  no it is not fair pon my soul it is not said de stancy i wont say another word  he did not and they clambered on through the boughs nothing disturbing the solitude but the rustle of their own footsteps and the singing of birds overhead they occasionally got a peep at the sky and whenever a twig hung out in a position to strike paulas face the gallant captain bent it aside with his stick but she did not thank him perhaps he was just as well satisfied as if she had done so  paula panting broke the silence will you go on and discover if the top is near  he went on this time the top was near when he returned she was sitting where he had left her among the leaves it is quite near now he told her tenderly and she took his arm again without a word soon the path changed its nature from a steep and rugged watercourse to a level green promenade  thank you captain de stancy she said letting go his arm as if relieved  before them rose the tower and at the base they beheld two of their friends mr power being seen above looking over the parapet through his glass  you will go to the top now said de stancy  no i take no interest in it my interest has turned to fatigue i only want to go home  he took her on to where the carriage stood at the foot of the tower and leaving her with his sister ascended the turret to the top the landscape had quite changed from its afternoon appearance and had become rather marvellous than beautiful the air was charged with a lurid exhalation that blurred the extensive view he could see the distant rhine at its junction with the neckar shining like a thread of blood through the mist which was gradually wrapping up the declining sun the scene had in it something that was more than melancholy and not much less than tragic but for de stancy such evening effects possessed little meaning he was engaged in an enterprise that taxed all his resources and had no sentiments to spare for air earth or skies  remarkable scene said power mildly at his elbow  yes i dare say it is said de stancy time has been when i should have held forth upon such a prospect and wondered if its livid colours shadowed out my own life et caetera et caetera but begad i have almost forgotten theres such a thing as nature and i care for nothing but a comfortable life and a certain woman who does not care for me now shall we go down    viii  it was quite true that de stancy at the present period of his existence wished only to escape from the hurlyburly of active life and to win the affection of paula power there were however occasions when a recollection of his old renunciatory vows would obtrude itself upon him and tinge his present with wayward bitterness so much was this the case that a day or two after they had arrived at mainz he could not refrain from making remarks almost prejudicial to his cause saying to her i am unfortunate in my situation there are unhappily worldly reasons why i should pretend to love you even if i do not they are so strong that though really loving you perhaps they enter into my thoughts of you  i dont want to know what such reasons are said paula with promptness for it required but little astuteness to discover that he alluded to the alienated wessex home and estates you lack tone she gently added thats why the situation of affairs seems distasteful to you  yes i suppose i am ill and yet i am well enough  these remarks passed under a tree in the public gardens during an odd minute of waiting for charlotte and mrs goodman and he said no more to her in private that day few as her words had been he liked them better than any he had lately received the conversation was not resumed till they were gliding between the banks that bear the vine on board one of the rhine steamboats which like the hotels in this early summer time were comparatively free from other english travellers so that everywhere paula and her party were received with open arms and cheerful countenances as among the first swallows of the season  the saloon of the steamboat was quite empty the few passengers being outside and this paucity of voyagers afforded de stancy a roomy opportunity  paula saw him approach her and there appearing in his face signs that he would begin again on the eternal subject she seemed to be struck with a sense of the ludicrous  de stancy reddened something seems to amuse you he said  it is over she replied becoming serious  was it about me and this unhappy fever in me  if i speak the truth i must say it was  you thought heres that absurd man again going to begin his daily supplication  not absurd she said with emphasis because i dont think it is absurd  she continued looking through the windows at the lurlei heights under which they were now passing and he remained with his eyes on her  may i stay here with you he said at last i have not had a word with you alone for fourandtwenty hours  you must be cheerful then  you have said such as that before i wish you would say loving instead of cheerful  yes i know i know she responded with impatient perplexity but why must you think of meme only is there no other woman in the world who has the power to make you happy i am sure there must be  perhaps there is but i have never seen her  then look for her and believe me when i say that you will certainly find her  he shook his head  captain de stancy i have long felt for you she continued with a frank glance into his face you have deprived yourself too long of other womens company why not go away for a little time and when you have found somebody else likely to make you happy you can meet me again i will see you at your fathers house and we will enjoy all the pleasure of easy friendship  very correct and very cold o best of women  you are too full of exclamations and transports i think  they stood in silence paula apparently much interested in the manoeuvring of a raft which was passing by dear miss power he resumed before i go and join your uncle above let me just ask do i stand any chance at all yet is it possible you can never be more pliant than you have been  you put me out of all patience  but why did you raise my hopes you should at least pity me after doing that  yes its that again i unfortunately raised your hopes because i was a foolwas not myself that moment now question me no more as it is i think you presume too much upon my becoming yours as the consequence of my having dismissed another  not on becoming mine but on listening to me  your argument would be reasonable enough had i led you to believe i would listen to youand ultimately accept you but that i have not done i see now that a woman who gives a man an answer one shade less peremptory than a harsh negative may be carried beyond her intentions and out of her own power before she knows it  chide me if you will i dont care  she looked steadfastly at him with a little mischief in her eyes you do care she said  then why dont you listen to me i would not persevere for a moment longer if it were against the wishes of your family your uncle says it would give him pleasure to see you accept me  does he say why she asked thoughtfully  yes he takes of course a practical view of the matter he thinks it commends itself so to reason and common sense that the owner of stancy castle should become a member of the de stancy family  yes thats the horrid plague of it she said with a nonchalance which seemed to contradict her words it is so dreadfully reasonable that we should marry i wish it wasnt  well you are younger than i and perhaps thats a natural wish but to me it seems a felicitous combination not often met with i confess that your interest in our family before you knew me lent a stability to my hopes that otherwise they would not have had  my interest in the de stancys has not been a personal interest except in the case of your sister she returned it has been an historical interest only and is not at all increased by your existence  and perhaps it is not diminished  no i am not aware that it is diminished she murmured as she observed the gliding shore  well you will allow me to say this since i say it without reference to your personality or to minethat the power and de stancy families are the complements to each other and that abstractedly they call earnestly to one another how neat and fit a thing for us to join hands  paula who was not prudish when a direct appeal was made to her common sense answered with ready candour yes from the point of view of domestic politics that undoubtedly is the case but i hope i am not so calculating as to risk happiness in order to round off a social idea  i hope not or that i am either still the social idea exists and my increased years make its excellence more obvious to me than to you  the ice once broken on this aspect of the question the subject seemed further to engross her and she spoke on as if daringly inclined to venture where she had never anticipated going deriving pleasure from the very strangeness of her temerity you mean that in the fitness of things i ought to become a de stancy to strengthen my social position  and that i ought to strengthen mine by alliance with the heiress of a name so dear to engineering science as power  well we are talking with unexpected frankness  but you are not seriously displeased with me for saying what after all one cant help feeling and thinking  no only be so good as to leave off going further for the present indeed of the two i would rather have the other sort of address i mean she hastily added that what you urge as the result of a real affection however unsuitable i have some remote satisfaction in listening tonot the least from any reciprocal love on my side but from a womans gratification at being the object of anybodys devotion for that feeling towards her is always regarded as a merit in a womans eye and taken as a kindness by her even when it is at the expense of her convenience  she had said voluntarily or involuntarily better things than he expected and perhaps too much in her own opinion for she hardly gave him an opportunity of replying  they passed st goar and boppard and when steering round the sharp bend of the river just beyond the latter place de stancy met her again exclaiming you left me very suddenly  you must make allowances please she said i have always stood in need of them  then you shall always have them  i dont doubt it she said quickly but paula was not to be caught again and kept close to the side of her aunt while they glided past brauback and oberlahnstein approaching coblenz her aunt said paula let me suggest that you be not so much alone with captain de stancy  and why said paula quietly  youll have plenty of offers if you want them without taking trouble said the direct mrs goodman your existence is hardly known to the world yet and captain de stancy is too near middleage for a girl like you paula did not reply to either of these remarks being seemingly so interested in ehrenbreitsteins heights as not to hear them    ix  it was midnight at coblenz and the travellers had retired to rest in their respective apartments overlooking the river finding that there was a moon shining paula leant out of her window the tall rock of ehrenbreitstein on the opposite shore was flooded with light and a belated steamer was drawing up to the landingstage where it presently deposited its passengers  we should have come by the last boat so as to have been touched into romance by the rays of this moon like those happy people said a voice  she looked towards the spot whence the voice proceeded which was a window quite near at hand de stancy was smoking outside it and she became aware that the words were addressed to her  you left me very abruptly he continued  paulas instinct of caution impelled her to speak  the windows are all open she murmured please be careful  there are no english in this hotel except ourselves i thank you for what you said today  please be careful she repeated  my dear miss p  dont mention names and dont continue the subject  life and death perhaps depend upon my renewing it soon  she shut the window decisively possibly wondering if de stancy had drunk a glass or two of steinberg more than was good for him and saw no more of moonlit ehrenbreitstein that night and heard no more of de stancy but it was some time before he closed his window and previous to doing so saw a dark form at an adjoining one on the other side  it was mr power also taking the air well what luck today said power  a decided advance said de stancy  none of the speakers knew that a little person in the room above heard all this outofwindow talk charlotte though not looking out had left her casement open and what reached her ears set her wondering as to the result  it is not necessary to detail in full de stancys imperceptible advances with paula during that northward journeyso slowly performed that it seemed as if she must perceive there was a special reason for delaying her return to england at cologne one day he conveniently overtook her when she was ascending the hotel staircase seeing him she went to the window of the entresol landing which commanded a view of the rhine meaning that he should pass by to his room  i have been very uneasy began the captain drawing up to her side and i am obliged to trouble you sooner than i meant to do  paula turned her eyes upon him with some curiosity as to what was coming of this respectful demeanour indeed she said  he then informed her that he had been overhauling himself since they last talked and had some reason to blame himself for bluntness and general want of euphemism which although he had meant nothing by it must have been very disagreeable to her but he had always aimed at sincerity particularly as he had to deal with a lady who despised hypocrisy and was above flattery however he feared he might have carried his disregard for conventionality too far but from that time he would promise that she should find an alteration by which he hoped he might return the friendship at least of a young lady he honoured more than any other in the world  this retrograde movement was evidently unexpected by the honoured young lady herself after being so long accustomed to rebuke him for his persistence there was novelty in finding him do the work for her the guess might even have been hazarded that there was also disappointment  still looking across the river at the bridge of boats which stretched to the opposite suburb of deutz you need not blame yourself she said with the mildest conceivable manner i can make allowances all i wish is that you should remain under no misapprehension  i comprehend he said thoughtfully but since by a perverse fate i have been thrown into your company you could hardly expect me to feel and act otherwise  perhaps not  since i have so much reason to be dissatisfied with myself he added i cannot refrain from criticizing elsewhere to a slight extent and thinking i have to do with an ungenerous person  why ungenerous  in this way that since you cannot love me you see no reason at all for trying to do so in the fact that i so deeply love you hence i say that you are rather to be distinguished by your wisdom than by your humanity  it comes to this that if your words are all seriously meant it is much to be regretted we ever met she murmured now will you go on to where you were going and leave me here  without a remonstrance he went on saying with dejected whimsicality as he smiled back upon her you show a wisdom which for so young a lady is perfectly surprising  it was resolved to prolong the journey by a circuit through holland and belgium but nothing changed in the attitudes of paula and captain de stancy till one afternoon during their stay at the hague when they had gone for a drive down to scheveningen by the long straight avenue of chestnuts and limes under whose boughs tufts of wild parsley waved their flowers except where the buitenplaatsen of retired merchants blazed forth with new paint of every hue on mounting the dune which kept out the sea behind the village a brisk breeze greeted their faces and a fine sand blew up into their eyes de stancy screened paula with his umbrella as they stood with their backs to the wind looking down on the red roofs of the village within the sea wall and pulling at the long grass which by some means found nourishment in the powdery soil of the dune  when they had discussed the scene he continued it always seems to me that this place reflects the average mood of human life i mean if we strike the balance between our best moods and our worst we shall find our average condition to stand at about the same pitch in emotional colour as these sandy dunes and this grey scene do in landscape  paula contended that he ought not to measure everybody by himself  i have no other standard said de stancy and if my own is wrong it is you who have made it so have you thought any more of what i said at cologne  i dont quite remember what you did say at cologne  my dearest life paulas eyes rounding somewhat he corrected the exclamation my dear miss power i will without reserve tell it to you all over again  pray spare yourself the effort she said drily what has that one fatal step betrayed me into do you seriously mean to say that i am the cause of your life being coloured like this scene of grass and sand if so i have committed a very great fault  it can be nullified by a word  such a word  it is a very short one  theres a still shorter one more to the purpose frankly i believe you suspect me to have some latent and unowned inclination for youthat you think speaking is the only point upon which i am backward there now it is raining what shall we do i thought this wind meant rain  do stand on here as we are standing now  your sister and my aunt are gone under the wall i think we will walk towards them  you had made me hope he continued his thoughts apparently far away from the rain and the wind and the possibility of shelter that you might change your mind and give to your original promise a liberal meaning in renewing it in brief i mean this that you would allow it to merge into an engagement dont think it presumptuous he went on as he held the umbrella over her i am sure any man would speak as i do a distinct permission to be with you on probationthat was what you gave me at carlsruhe and flinging casuistry on one side what does that mean  that i am artistically interested in your family history and she went out from the umbrella to the shelter of the hotel where she found her aunt and friend  de stancy could not but feel that his persistence had made some impression it was hardly possible that a woman of independent nature would have tolerated his dangling at her side so long if his presence were wholly distasteful to her that evening when driving back to the hague by a devious route through the dense avenues of the bosch he conversed with her again also the next day when standing by the vijver looking at the swans and in each case she seemed to have at least got over her objection to being seen talking to him apart from the remainder of the travelling party  scenes very similar to those at scheveningen and on the rhine were enacted at later stages of their desultory journey mr power had proposed to cross from rotterdam but a stiff northwesterly breeze prevailing paula herself became reluctant to hasten back to stancy castle turning abruptly they made for brussels  it was here while walking homeward from the park one morning that her uncle for the first time alluded to the situation of affairs between herself and her admirer the captain had gone up the rue royale with his sister and mrs goodman either to show them the house in which the ball took place on the eve of quatre bras or some other site of interest and the two powers were thus left to themselves to reach their hotel they passed into a little street sloping steeply down from the rue royale to the place ste gudule where at the moment of nearing the cathedral a wedding party emerged from the porch and crossed in front of uncle and niece  i hope said the former in his passionless way we shall see a performance of this sort between you and captain de stancy not so very long after our return to england  why asked paula following the bride with her eyes  it is diplomatically as i may say such a highly correct thingsuch an expedient thingsuch an obvious thing to all eyes  not altogether to mine uncle she returned  twould be a thousand pities to let slip such a neat offer of adjusting difficulties as accident makes you in this you could marry more tin thats true but you dont want it paula you want a name and historic whatdotheycallit now by coming to terms with the captain youll be lady de stancy in a few years and a title which is useless to him and a fortune and castle which are in some degree useless to you will make a splendid whole useful to you both  ive thought it overquite she answered and i quite see what the advantages are but how if i dont care one atom for artistic completeness and a splendid whole and do care very much to do what my fancy inclines me to do  then i should say that taking a comprehensive view of human nature of all colours your fancy is about the silliest fancy existing on this earthly ball  paula laughed indifferently and her uncle felt that persistent as was his nature he was the wrong man to influence her by argument paulas blindness to the advantages of the match if she were blind was that of a woman who wouldnt see and the best argument was silence  this was in some measure proved the next morning when paula made her appearance mrs goodman said holding up an envelope heres a letter from mr somerset  dear me said she blandly though a quick little flush ascended her cheek i had nearly forgotten him  the letter on being read contained a request as brief as it was unexpected having prepared all the drawings necessary for the rebuilding somerset begged leave to resign the superintendence of the work into other hands  his letter caps your remarks very aptly said mrs goodman with secret triumph you are nearly forgetting him and he is quite forgetting you  yes said paula affecting carelessness well i must get somebody else i suppose    x  they next deviated to amiens intending to stay there only one night but their schemes were deranged by the sudden illness of charlotte she had been looking unwell for a fortnight past though with her usual selfabnegation she had made light of her ailment even now she declared she could go on but this was said overnight and in the morning it was abundantly evident that to move her was highly unadvisable still she was not in serious danger and having called in a physician who pronounced rest indispensable they prepared to remain in the old picard capital two or three additional days mr power thought he would take advantage of the halt to run up to paris leaving de stancy in charge of the ladies  in more ways than in the illness of charlotte this day was the harbinger of a crisis  it was a summer evening without a cloud charlotte had fallen asleep in her bed and paula who had been sitting by her looked out into the place st denis which the hotel commanded the lawn of the square was all ablaze with red and yellow clumps of flowers the acacia trees were brightly green the sun was soft and low tempted by the prospect paula went and put on her hat and arousing her aunt who was nodding in the next room to request her to keep an ear on charlottes bedroom paula descended into the rue de noyon alone and entered the green enclosure  while she walked round two or three little children in charge of a nurse trundled a large variegated ball along the grass and it rolled to paulas feet she smiled at them and endeavoured to return it by a slight kick the ball rose in the air and passing over the back of a seat which stood under one of the trees alighted in the lap of a gentleman hitherto screened by its boughs the back and shoulders proved to be those of de stancy he turned his head jumped up and was at her side in an instant a nettled flush having meanwhile crossed paulas face  i thought you had gone to the hotoie promenade she said hastily i am going to the cathedral obviously uttered lest it should seem that she had seen him from the hotel windows and entered the square for his company  of course there is nothing else to go to hereeven for roundheads  if you mean me by that you are very much mistaken said she testily  the roundheads were your ancestors and they knocked down my ancestors castle and broke the stained glass and statuary of the cathedral said de stancy slily and now you go not only to a cathedral but to a service of the unreformed church in it  in a foreign country it is different from home said paula in extenuation and you of all men should not reproach me for tergiversationwhen it has been brought about byby my sympathies with  with the troubles of the de stancys  well you know what i mean she answered with considerable anxiety not to be misunderstood my liking for the old castle and what it contains and what it suggests i declare i will not explain to you furtherwhy should i i am not answerable to you  paulas show of petulance was perhaps not wholly because she had appeared to seek him but also from being reminded by his criticism that mr woodwells prophecy on her weakly succumbing to surroundings was slowly working out its fulfilment  she moved forward towards the gate at the further end of the square beyond which the cathedral lay at a very short distance paula did not turn her head and de stancy strolled slowly after her down the rue du college the day happened to be one of the church festivals and people were a second time flocking into the lofty monument of catholicism at its meridian paula vanished into the porch with the rest and almost catching the wicket as it flew back from her hand he too entered the highshouldered edificean edifice doomed to labour under the melancholy misfortune of seeming only half as vast as it really is and as truly as whimsically described by heine as a monument built with the strength of titans and decorated with the patience of dwarfs  de stancy walked up the nave so close beside her as to touch her dress but she would not recognize his presence the darkness that evening had thrown over the interior which was scarcely broken by the few candles dotted about being a sufficient excuse if she required one  miss power de stancy said at last i am coming to the service with you  she received the intelligence without surprise and he knew she had been conscious of him all the way  paula went no further than the middle of the nave where there was hardly a soul and took a chair beside a solitary rushlight which looked amid the vague gloom of the inaccessible architecture like a lighthouse at the foot of tall cliffs  he put his hand on the next chair saying do you object  not at all she replied and he sat down  suppose we go into the choir said de stancy presently nobody sits out here in the shadows  this is sufficiently near and we have a candle paula murmured  before another minute had passed the candle flame began to drown in its own grease slowly dwindled and went out  i suppose that means i am to go into the choir in spite of myself heaven is on your side said paula and rising they left their now totally dark corner and joined the noiseless shadowy figures who in twos and threes kept passing up the nave  within the choir there was a blaze of light partly from the altar and more particularly from the image of the saint whom they had assembled to honour which stood surrounded by candles and a thicket of flowering plants some way in advance of the footpace a secondary radiance from the same source was reflected upward into their faces by the polished marble pavement except when interrupted by the shady forms of the officiating priests  when it was over and the people were moving off de stancy and his companion went towards the saint now besieged by numbers of women anxious to claim the respective flowerpots they had lent for the decoration as each struggled for her own seized and marched off with it paula remarkedthis rather spoils the solemn effect of what has gone before  i perceive you are a harsh puritan  no captain de stancy why will you speak so i am far too much otherwise i have grown to be so much of your way of thinking that i accuse myself and am accused by others of being worldly and halfandhalf and other dreadful thingsthough it isnt that at all  they were now walking down the nave preceded by the sombre figures with the pot flowers who were just visible in the rays that reached them through the distant choir screen at their back while above the grey night sky and stars looked in upon them through the high clerestory windows  do be a little more of my way of thinking rejoined de stancy passionately  dont dont speak she said rapidly there are milly and champreau  milly was one of the maids and champreau the courier and valet who had been engaged by abner power they had been sitting behind the other pair throughout the service and indeed knew rather more of the relations between paula and de stancy than paula knew herself  hastening on the two latter went out and walked together silently up the short street the place st denis was now lit up lights shone from the hotel windows and the world without the cathedral had so far advanced in nocturnal change that it seemed as if they had been gone from it for hours within the hotel they found the change even greater than without mrs goodman met them halfway on the stairs  poor charlotte is worse she said quite feverish and almost delirious  paula reproached herself with why did i go away  the common interest of de stancy and paula in the sufferer at once reproduced an ease between them as nothing else could have done the physician was again called in who prescribed certain draughts and recommended that some one should sit up with her that night if paula allowed demonstrations of love to escape her towards anybody it was towards charlotte and her instinct was at once to watch by the invalids couch herself at least for some hours it being deemed unnecessary to call in a regular nurse unless she should sicken further  but i will sit with her said de stancy surely you had better go to bed paula would not be persuaded and thereupon de stancy saying he was going into the town for a short time before retiring left the room  the last omnibus returned from the last train and the inmates of the hotel retired to rest meanwhile a telegram had arrived for captain de stancy but as he had not yet returned it was put in his bedroom with directions to the nightporter to remind him of its arrival  paula sat on with the sleeping charlotte presently she retired into the adjacent sittingroom with a book and flung herself on a couch leaving the door open between her and her charge in case the latter should awake while she sat a new breathing seemed to mingle with the regular sound of charlottes that reached her through the doorway she turned quickly and saw her uncle standing behind her  oi thought you were in paris said paula  i have just come from therei could not stay something has occurred to my mind about this affair his strangely marked visage now more noticeable from being worn with fatigue had a spectral effect by the nightlight  what affair  this marriage paula de stancy is a good fellow enough but you must not accept him just yet  paula did not answer  do you hear you must not accept him repeated her uncle till i have been to england and examined into matters i start in an hours timeby the tenminutespasttwo train  this is something very new  yestis new he murmured relapsing into his dutch manner you must not accept him till something is made clear to mesomething about a queer relationship i have come from paris to say so  uncle i dont understand this i am my own mistress in all matters and though i dont mind telling you i have by no means resolved to accept him the question of her marriage is especially a womans own affair  her uncle stood irresolute for a moment as if his convictions were more than his proofs i say no more at present he murmured can i do anything for you about a new architect  appoint havill  very well good night and then he left her in a short time she heard him go down and out of the house to cross to england by the morning steamboat  with a little shrug as if she resented his interference in so delicate a point she settled herself down anew to her book  one two three hours passed when charlotte awoke but soon slumbered sweetly again milly had stayed up for some time lest her mistress should require anything but the girl being sleepy paula sent her to bed  it was a lovely night of early summer and drawing aside the window curtains she looked out upon the flowers and trees of the place now quite visible for it was nearly three oclock and the morning light was growing strong she turned her face upwards except in the case of one bedroom all the windows on that side of the hotel were in darkness the room being rather close she left the casement ajar and opening the door walked out upon the staircase landing a number of caged canaries were kept here and she observed in the dim light of the landing lamp how snugly their heads were all tucked in on returning to the sittingroom again she could hear that charlotte was still slumbering and this encouraging circumstance disposed her to go to bed herself before however she had made a move a gentle tap came to the door  paula opened it there in the faint light by the sleeping canaries stood charlottes brother  how is she now he whispered  sleeping soundly said paula  thats a blessing i have not been to bed i came in late and have now come down to know if i had not better take your place  nobody is required i think but you can judge for yourself  up to this point they had conversed in the doorway of the sittingroom which de stancy now entered crossing it to charlottes apartment he came out from the latter at a pensive pace  she is doing well he said gently you have been very good to her was the chair i saw by her bed the one you have been sitting in all night  i sometimes sat there sometimes here  i wish i could have sat beside you and held your handi speak frankly  to excess  and why not i do not wish to hide from you any corner of my breast futile as candour may be just heaven for what reason is it ordered that courtship in which soldiers are usually so successful should be a failure with me  your lack of foresight chiefly in indulging feelings that were not encouraged that and my uncles indiscreet permission to you to travel with us have precipitated our relations in a way that i could neither foresee nor avoid though of late i have had apprehensions that it might come to this you vex and disturb me by such words of regret  not more than you vex and disturb me but you cannot hate the man who loves you so devotedly  i have said before i dont hate you i repeat that i am interested in your family and its associations because of its complete contrast with my own she might have added and i am additionally interested just now because my uncle has forbidden me to be  but you dont care enough for me personally to save my happiness  paula hesitated from the moment de stancy confronted her she had felt that this nocturnal conversation was to be a grave business the cathedral clock struck three i have thought once or twice she said with a naivete unusual in her that if i could be sure of giving peace and joy to your mind by becoming your wife i ought to endeavour to do so and make the best of itmerely as a charity but i believe that feeling is a mistake your discontent is constitutional and would go on just the same whether i accepted you or no my refusal of you is purely an imaginary grievance  not if i think otherwise  o no she murmured with a sense that the place was very lonely and silent if you think it otherwise i suppose it is otherwise  my darling my paula he said seizing her hand do promise me something you must indeed  captain de stancy she said trembling and turning away captain de stancy she tried to withdraw her fingers then faced him exclaiming in a firm voice a third time captain de stancy let go my hand for i tell you i will not marry you  good god he cried dropping her hand what have i driven you to say in your anger retract ito retract it  dont urge me further as you value my good opinion  to lose you now is to lose you for ever come please answer  i wont be compelled she interrupted with vehemence i am resolved not to be yoursnot to give you an answer tonight never never will i be reasoned out of my intention and i say i wont answer you tonight i should never have let you be so much with me but for pity of you and now it is come to this  she had sunk into a chair and now leaned upon her hand and buried her face in her handkerchief he had never caused her any such agitation as this before  you stab me with your words continued de stancy the experience i have had with you is without parallel paula it seems like a distracting dream  i wont be hurried by anybody  that may mean anything he said with a perplexed passionate air well mine is a fallen family and we must abide caprices would to heaven it were extinguished  what was extinguished she murmured  the de stancys here am i a homeless wanderer living on my pay in the next room lies she my sister a poor little fragile feverish invalid with no social positionand hardly a friend we two represent the de stancy line and i wish we were behind the iron door of our old vault at sleepinggreen it can be seen by looking at us and our circumstances that we cry for the earth and oblivion  captain de stancy it is not like that i assure you sympathized paula with damp eyelashes i love charlotte too dearly for you to talk like that indeed i dont want to marry you exactly and yet i cannot bring myself to say i permanently reject you because i remember you are charlottes brother and do not wish to be the cause of any morbid feelings in you which would ruin your future prospects  my dear life what is it you doubt in me your earnestness not to do me harm makes it all the harder for me to think of never being more than a friend  well i have not positively refused she exclaimed in mixed tones of pity and distress let me think it over a little while it is not generous to urge so strongly before i can collect my thoughts and at this midnight time  darling forgive itthere ill say no more  he then offered to sit up in her place for the remainder of the night but paula declined assuring him that she meant to stay only another halfhour after which nobody would be necessary  he had already crossed the landing to ascend to his room when she stepped after him and asked if he had received his telegram  no said de stancy nor have i heard of one  paula explained that it was put in his room that he might see it the moment he came in  it matters very little he replied since i shall see it now goodnight dearest goodnight he added tenderly  she gravely shook her head it is not for you to express yourself like that she answered goodnight captain de stancy  he went up the stairs to the second floor and paula returned to the sittingroom having left a light burning de stancy proceeded to look for the telegram and found it on the carpet where it had been swept from the table when he had opened the sheet a sudden solemnity overspread his face he sat down rested his elbow on the table and his forehead on his hands  captain de stancy did not remain thus long rising he went softly downstairs the grey morning had by this time crept into the hotel rendering a light no longer necessary the old clock on the landing was within a few minutes of four and the birds were hopping up and down their cages and whetting their bills he tapped at the sittingroom and she came instantly  but i told you it was not necessary she began  yes but the telegram he said hurriedly i wanted to let you know first thatit is very serious paulamy father is dead he died suddenly yesterday and i must go at once  about charlotteand how to let her know  she must not be told yet said paula sir william dead  you think we had better not tell her just yet said de stancy anxiously thats what i want to consult you about if youdont mind my intruding  certainly i dont she said  they continued the discussion for some time and it was decided that charlotte should not be informed of what had happened till the doctor had been consulted paula promising to account for her brothers departure  de stancy then prepared to leave for england by the first morning train and roused the nightporter which functionary having packed off abner power was discovered asleep on the sofa of the landlords parlour at halfpast five paula who in the interim had been pensively sitting with her hand to her chin quite forgetting that she had meant to go to bed heard wheels without and looked from the window a fly had been brought round and one of the hotel servants was in the act of putting up a portmanteau with de stancys initials upon it a minute afterwards the captain came to her door  i thought you had not gone to bed after all  i was anxious to see you off said she since neither of the others is awake and you wished me not to rouse them  quite right you are very good and lowering his voice paula it is a sad and solemn time with me will you grant me one wordnot on our last sad subject but on the previous onebefore i part with you to go and bury my father  certainly she said in gentle accents  then have you thought over my position will you at last have pity upon my loneliness by becoming my wife  paula sighed deeply and said yes  your hand upon it  she gave him her hand he held it a few moments then raised it to his lips and was gone  when mrs goodman rose she was informed of sir williams death and of his sons departure  then the captain is now sir william de stancy she exclaimed really paula since you would be lady de stancy by marrying him i almost think  hush aunt  well what are you writing there  only entering in my diary that i accepted him this morning for pitys sake in spite of uncle abner theyll say it was for the title but knowing it was not i dont care    xi  on the evening of the fourth day after the parting between paula and de stancy at amiens when it was quite dark in the markton highway except in so far as the shades were broken by the faint lights from the adjacent town a young man knocked softly at the door of myrtle villa and asked if captain de stancy had arrived from abroad he was answered in the affirmative and in a few moments the captain himself came from an adjoining room  seeing that his visitor was dare from whom as will be remembered he had parted at carlsruhe in no very satisfied mood de stancy did not ask him into the house but putting on his hat went out with the youth into the public road here they conversed as they walked up and down dare beginning by alluding to the death of sir william the suddenness of which he feared would delay captain de stancys overtures for the hand of miss power  no said de stancy moodily on the contrary it has precipitated matters  she has accepted you captain  we are engaged to be married  well done i congratulate you the speaker was about to proceed to further triumphant notes on the intelligence when casting his eye upon the upper windows of the neighbouring villa he appeared to reflect on what was within them and checking himself when is the funeral to be  tomorrow de stancy replied it would be advisable for you not to come near me during the day  i will not i will be a mere spectator the old vault of our ancestors will be opened i presume captain  it is opened  i must see itand ruminate on what we once were it is a thing i like doing the ghosts of our deadah what was that  i heard nothing  i thought i heard a footstep behind us  they stood still but the road appeared to be quite deserted and likely to continue so for the remainder of that evening they walked on again speaking in somewhat lower tones than before  will the late sir williams death delay the wedding much asked the younger man curiously  de stancy languidly answered that he did not see why it should do so some little time would of course intervene but since there were several reasons for despatch he should urge miss power and her relatives to consent to a virtually private wedding which might take place at a very early date and he thought there would be a general consent on that point  there are indeed reasons for despatch your title sir william is a new safeguard over her heart certainly but there is many a slip and you must not lose her now  i dont mean to lose her said de stancy she is too good to be lost and yetsince she gave her promise i have felt more than once that i would not engage in such a struggle again it was not a thing of my beginning though i was easily enough inflamed to follow but i will not lose her nowfor gods sake keep that secret you have so foolishly pricked on your breast it fills me with remorse to think what she with her scrupulous notions will feel should she ever know of you and your history and your relation to me  dare made no reply till after a silence when he said of course mums the word till the wedding is over  and afterwardspromise that for her sake  and probably afterwards  sir william de stancy drew a dejected breath at the tone of the answer they conversed but a little while longer the captain hinting to dare that it was time for them to part not however before he had uttered a hope that the young man would turn over a new leaf and engage in some regular pursuit promising to call upon him at his lodgings de stancy went indoors and dare briskly retraced his steps to markton  when his footfall had died away and the door of the house opposite had been closed another man appeared upon the scene he came gently out of the hedge opposite myrtle villa which he paused to regard for a moment but instead of going townward he turned his back upon the distant sprinkle of lights and did not check his walk till he reached the lodge of stancy castle  here he pulled the wooden acorn beside the arch and when the porter appeared his light revealed the pedestrians countenance to be scathed as by lightning  i beg your pardon mr power said the porter with sudden deference as he opened the wicket but we wasnt expecting anybody tonight as there is nobody at home and the servants on board wages and thats why i was so long acoming  no matter no matter said abner power i have returned on sudden business and have not come to stay longer than tonight your mistress is not with me i meant to sleep in markton but have changed my mind  mr power had brought no luggage with him beyond a small handbag and as soon as a room could be got ready he retired to bed  the next morning he passed in idly walking about the grounds and observing the progress which had been made in the worksnow temporarily suspended but that inspection was less his object in remaining there than meditation was abundantly evident when the bell began to toll from the neighbouring church to announce the burial of sir william de stancy he passed through the castle and went on foot in the direction indicated by the sound reaching the margin of the churchyard he looked over the wall his presence being masked by bushes and a group of idlers from markton who stood in front soon a funeral procession of simplealmost meagre and threadbarecharacter arrived but power did not join the people who followed the deceased into the church de stancy was the chief mourner and only relation present the other followers of the brokendown old man being an ancient lawyer a couple of faithful servants and a bowed villager who had been page to the late sir williams fatherthe single living person left in the parish who remembered the de stancys as people of wealth and influence and who firmly believed that family would come into its rights ere long and oust the uncircumcized philistines who had taken possession of the old lands  the funeral was over and the rusty carriages had gone together with many of the spectators but power lingered in the churchyard as if he were looking for some one at length he entered the church passing by the cavernous pitfall with descending steps which stood open outside the wall of the de stancy aisle arrived within he scanned the few idlers of antiquarian tastes who had remained after the service to inspect the monuments and beside a recumbent effigythe effigy in alabaster whose features paula had wiped with her handkerchief when there with somersethe beheld the man it had been his business to find abner power went up and touched this person who was dare on the shoulder  mr powerso it is said the youth i have not seen you since we met in carlsruhe  you shall see all the more of me now to make up for it shall we walk round the church  with all my heart said dare  they walked round and abner power began in a sardonic recitative i am a traveller and it takes a good deal to astonish me so i neither swooned nor screamed when i learnt a few hours ago what i had suspected for a week that you are of the house and lineage of jacob he flung a nod towards the canopied tombs as he spokein other words that you are of the same breed as the de stancys  dare cursorily glanced round nobody was near enough to hear their words the nearest persons being two workmen just outside who were bringing their tools up from the vault preparatively to closing it  having observed this dare replied i too am a traveller and neither do i swoon nor scream at what you say but i assure you that if you busy yourself about me you may truly be said to busy yourself about nothing  well thats a matter of opinion now theres no scarlet left in my face to blush for mens follies but as an alliance is afoot between my niece and the present sir william this must be looked into  dare reflectively said o as he observed through the window one of the workmen bring up a candle from the vault and extinguish it with his fingers  the marriage is desirable and your relationship in itself is of no consequence continued the elder but just look at this you have forced on the marriage by unscrupulous means your object being only too clearly to live out of the proceeds of that marriage  mr power you mock me because i labour under the misfortune of having an illegitimate father to provide for i really deserve commiseration  you might deserve it if that were all but it looks bad for my nieces happiness as lady de stancy that she and her husband are to be perpetually haunted by a young chevalier dindustrie who can forge a telegram on occasion and libel an innocent man by an ingenious device in photography it looks so bad in short that advantageous as a title and old family name would be to her and her children i wont let my brothers daughter run the risk of having them at the expense of being in the grip of a man like you there are other suitors in the world and other titles and she is a beautiful woman who can well afford to be fastidious i shall let her know at once of these things and break off the businessunless you do one thing  a workman brought up another candle from the vault and prepared to let down the slab well mr power and what is that one thing  go to peru as my agent in a business i have just undertaken there  and settle there  of course i am soon going over myself and will bring you anything you require  how long will you give me to consider said dare  power looked at his watch one two three four hours he said i leave markton by the seven oclock train this evening  and if i meet your proposal with a negative  i shall go at once to my niece and tell her the whole circumstancestell her that by marrying sir william she allies herself with an unhappy gentleman in the power of a criminal son who makes his life a burden to him by perpetual demands upon his purse who will increase those demands with his accession to wealth threaten to degrade her by exposing her husbands antecedents if she opposes his extortions and who will make her miserable by letting her know that her old lover was shamefully victimized by a youth she is bound to screen out of respect to her husbands feelings now a man does not care to let his own flesh and blood incur the danger of such anguish as that and i shall do what i say to prevent it knowing what a lukewarm sentiment hers is for sir william at best i shall not have much difficulty  well i dont feel inclined to go to peru  neither do i want to break off the match though i am ready to do it but you care about your personal freedom and you might be made to wear the broad arrow for your tricks on somerset  mr power i see you are a hard man  i am a hard man you will find me one well will you go to peru or i dont mind australia or california as alternatives as long as you choose to remain in either of those wealthproducing places so long will cunningham haze go uninformed  mr power i am overcome will you allow me to sit down suppose we go into the vestry it is more comfortable  they entered the vestry and seated themselves in two chairs one at each end of the table  in the meantime continued dare to lend a little romance to stern realities ill tell you a singular dream i had just before you returned to england power looked contemptuous but dare went on i dreamt that once upon a time there were two brothers born of a nonconformist family one of whom became a railwaycontractor and the other a mechanical engineer  a mechanical engineergood said power beginning to attend  when the first went abroad in his profession and became engaged on continental railways the second a younger man looking round for a start also betook himself to the continent but though ingenious and scientific he had not the business capacity of the elder whose rebukes led to a sharp quarrel between them and they parted in bitter estrangementnever to meet again as it turned out owing to the dogged obstinacy and selfwill of the younger man he after this seemed to lose his moral ballast altogether and after some eccentric doings he was reduced to a state of poverty and took lodgings in a court in a back street of a town we will call geneva considerably in doubt as to what steps he should take to keep body and soul together  abner power was shooting a narrow ray of eyesight at dare from the corner of his nearly closed lids your dream is so interesting he said with a hard smile that i could listen to it all day  excellent said dare and went on now it so happened that the house opposite to the one taken by the mechanician was peculiar it was a tall narrow building wholly unornamented the walls covered with a layer of white plaster cracked and soiled by time i seem to see that house now six stone steps led up to the door with a rusty iron railing on each side and under these steps were others which went down to a cellarin my dream of course  of coursein your dream said power nodding comprehensively  sitting lonely and apathetic without a light at his own chamberwindow at night time our mechanician frequently observed dark figures descending these steps and ultimately discovered that the house was the meetingplace of a fraternity of political philosophers whose object was the extermination of tyrants and despots and the overthrow of established religions the discovery was startling enough but our hero was not easily startled he kept their secret and lived on as before at last the mechanician and his affairs became known to the society as the affairs of the society had become known to the mechanician and instead of shooting him as one who knew too much for their safety they were struck with his faculty for silence and thought they might be able to make use of him  to be sure said abner power  next like friend bunyan i saw in my dream that denunciation was the breath of life to this society at an earlier date in its history objectionable persons in power had been from time to time murdered and curiously enough numbered that is upon the body of each was set a mark or seal announcing that he was one of a series but at this time the question before the society related to the substitution for the dagger which was vetoed as obsolete of some explosive machine that would be both more effectual and less difficult to manage and in short a large reward was offered to our needy englishman if he would put their ideas of such a machine into shape  abner power nodded again his complexion being peculiarwhich might partly have been accounted for by the reflection of windowlight from the greenbaize tablecloth  he agreed though no politician whatever himself to exercise his wits on their account and brought his machine to such a pitch of perfection that it was the identical one used in the memorable attempt dare whispered the remainder of the sentence in tones so low that not a mouse in the corner could have heard well the inventor of that explosive has naturally been wanted ever since by all the heads of police in europe but the most curiousor perhaps the most natural part of my story is that our hero after the catastrophe grew disgusted with himself and his comrades acquired in a fit of revulsion quite a conservative taste in politics which was strengthened greatly by the news he indirectly received of the great wealth and respectability of his brother who had had no communion with him for years and supposed him dead he abjured his employers and resolved to abandon them but before coming to england he decided to destroy all trace of his combustible inventions by dropping them into the neighbouring lake at night from a boat you feel the room close mr power  no i suffer from attacks of perspiration whenever i sit in a consecrated edificethats all pray go on  in carrying out this project an explosion occurred just as he was throwing the stock overboardit blew up into his face wounding him severely and nearly depriving him of sight the boat was upset but he swam ashore in the darkness and remained hidden till he recovered though the scars produced by the burns had been set on him for ever this accident which was such a misfortune to him as a man was an advantage to him as a conspirators engineer retiring from practice and afforded him a disguise both from his own brotherhood and from the police which he has considered impenetrable but which is getting seen through by one or two keen eyes as time goes on instead of coming to england just then he went to peru connected himself with the guano trade i believe and after his brothers death revisited england his old life obliterated as far as practicable by his new principles he is known only as a great traveller to his surviving relatives though he seldom says where he has travelled unluckily for himself he is wanted by certain european governments as badly as ever  dare raised his eyes as he concluded his narration as has been remarked he was sitting at one end of the vestrytable power at the other the green cloth stretching between them on the edge of the table adjoining mr power a shining nozzle of metal was quietly resting like a dogs nose it was directed pointblank at the young man  dare started aha revolver he said  mr power nodded placidly his hand still grasping the pistol behind the edge of the table as a traveller i always carry one of em he returned and for the last five minutes i have been closely considering whether your numerous brains are worth blowing out or no the vault yonder has suggested itself as convenient and snug for one of the same family but the mental problem that stays my hand is how am i to despatch and bury you there without the workmen seeing  tis a strange problem certainly replied dare and one on which i fear i could not give disinterested advice moreover while you as a traveller always carry a weapon of defence as a traveller so do i and for the last threequarters of an hour i have been thinking concerning you an intensified form of what you have been thinking of me but without any concern as to your interment see here for a proof of it and a second steel nose rested on the edge of the table opposite to the first steadied by dares right hand  they remained for some time motionless the tick of the tower clock distinctly audible  mr power spoke first  well twould be a pity to make a mess here under such dubious circumstances mr dare i perceive that a mean vagabond can be as sharp as a political regenerator i cry quits if you care to do the same  dare assented and the pistols were put away  then we do nothing at all either side but let the course of true love run on to marriagethats the understanding i think said dare as he rose  it is said power and turning on his heel he left the vestry  dare retired to the church and thence to the outside where he idled away a few minutes in looking at the workmen who were now lowering into its place a large stone slab bearing the words de stancy which covered the entrance to the vault when the footway of the churchyard was restored to its normal condition dare pursued his way to markton  abner power walked back to the castle at a slow and equal pace as though he carried an overbrimming vessel on his head he silently let himself in entered the long gallery and sat down the length of time that he sat there was so remarkable as to raise that interval of inanition to the rank of a feat  powers eyes glanced through one of the windowcasements from a hole without he saw the head of a tomtit protruding he listlessly watched the bird during the successive epochs of his thought till night came without any perceptible change occurring in him such fixity would have meant nothing else than sudden death in any other man but in mr power it merely signified that he was engaged in ruminations which necessitated a more extensive survey than usual at last at halfpast eight after having sat for five hours with his eyes on the residence of the tomtits to whom night had brought cessation of thought if not to him who had observed them he rose amid the shades of the furniture and rang the bell there were only a servant or two in the castle one of whom presently came with a light in her hand and a startled look upon her face which was not reduced when she recognized him for in the opinion of that household there was something ghoullike in mr power which made him no desirable guest  he ate a late meal and retired to bed where he seemed to sleep not unsoundly the next morning he received a letter which afforded him infinite satisfaction and gave his stagnant impulses a new momentum he entered the library and amid objects swathed in brown holland sat down and wrote a note to his niece at amiens therein he stated that finding that the anglosouthamerican house with which he had recently connected himself required his presence in peru it obliged him to leave without waiting for her return he felt the less uneasy at going since he had learnt that captain de stancy would return at once to amiens to his sick sister and see them safely home when she improved he afterwards left the castle disappearing towards a railway station some miles above markton the road to which lay across an unfrequented down    xii  it was a fine afternoon of late summer nearly three months subsequent to the death of sir william de stancy and paulas engagement to marry his successor in the title george somerset had started on a professional journey that took him through the charming district which lay around stancy castle having resigned his appointment as architect to that important structurea resignation which had been accepted by paula through her solicitorhe had bidden farewell to the locality after putting matters in such order that his successor whoever he might be should have no difficulty in obtaining the particulars necessary to the completion of the work in hand hardly to his surprise this successor was havill  somersets resignation had been tendered in no hasty mood on returning to england and in due course to the castle everything bore in upon his mind the exceeding sorrowfulnesshe would not say humiliationof continuing to act in his former capacity for a woman who from seeming more than a dear friend had become less than an acquaintance  so he resigned but now as the train drew on into that once beloved tract of country the images which met his eye threw him back in point of emotion to very near where he had been before making himself a stranger here the train entered the cutting on whose brink he had walked when the carriage containing paula and her friends surprised him the previous summer he looked out of the window they were passing the wellknown curve that led up to the tunnel constructed by her father into which he had gone when the train came by and paula had been alarmed for his life there was the path they had both climbed afterwards involuntarily seizing each others hand the bushes the grass the flowers everything just the same              here was the pleasant place           and nothing wanting was save she alas  when they came out of the tunnel at the other end he caught a glimpse of the distant castlekeep and the wellremembered walls beneath it the experience so far transcended the intensity of what is called mournful pleasure as to make him wonder how he could have miscalculated himself to the extent of supposing that he might pass the spot with controllable emotion  on entering markton station he withdrew into a remote corner of the carriage and closed his eyes with a resolve not to open them till the embittering scenes should be passed by he had not long to wait for this event when again in motion his eye fell upon the skirt of a ladys dress opposite the owner of which had entered and seated herself so softly as not to attract his attention  ah indeed he exclaimed as he looked up to her face i had not a notion that it was you he went over and shook hands with charlotte de stancy  i am not going far she said only to the next station we often run down in summer time are you going far  i am going to a building further on thence to normandy by way of cherbourg to finish out my holiday  miss de stancy thought that would be very nice  well i hope so but i fear it wont  after saying that somerset asked himself why he should mince matters with so genuine and sympathetic a girl as charlotte de stancy she could tell him particulars which he burned to know he might never again have an opportunity of knowing them since she and he would probably not meet for years to come if at all  have the castle works progressed pretty rapidly under the new architect he accordingly asked  yes said charlotte in her hastethen adding that she was not quite sure if they had progressed so rapidly as before blushingly correcting herself at this point and that in the tinkering manner of a nervous organization aiming at nicety where it was not required  well i should have liked to carry out the undertaking to its end said somerset but i felt i could not consistently do so miss power here a lump came into somersets throatso responsive was he yet to her imageseemed to have lost confidence in me andit was best that the connection should be severed  there was a long pause she was very sorry about it said charlotte gently  what made her alter soi never can think  charlotte waited again as if to accumulate the necessary force for honest speaking at the expense of pleasantness it was the telegram that began it of course she answered  telegram  she looked up at him in quite a frightened waylittle as there was to be frightened at in a quiet fellow like him in this sad time of his lifeand said yes some telegrami thinkwhen you were in trouble forgive my alluding to it but you asked me the question  somerset began reflecting on what messages he had sent paula troublous or otherwise all he had sent had been sent from the castle and were as gentle and mellifluous as sentences well could be which had neither articles nor pronouns i dont understand he said will you explain a little moreas plainly as you likewithout minding my feelings  a telegram from nice i think  i never sent one  o the one i meant was about money  somerset shook his head no he murmured with the composure of a man who knowing he had done nothing of the sort himself was blinded by his own honesty to the possibility that another might have done it for him that must be some other affair with which i had nothing to do o no it was nothing like that the reason for her change of manner was quite different  so timid was charlotte in somersets presence that her timidity at this juncture amounted to blameworthiness the distressing scene which must have followed a clearing up there and then of any possible misunderstanding terrified her imagination and quite confounded by contradictions that she could not reconcile she held her tongue and nervously looked out of the window  i have heard that miss power is soon to be married continued somerset  yes charlotte murmured it is sooner than it ought to be by rights considering how recently my dear father died but there are reasons in connection with my brothers position against putting it off and it is to be absolutely simple and private  there was another interval may i ask when it is to be he said  almost at oncethis week  somerset started back as if some stone had hit his face  still there was nothing wonderful in such promptitude engagements broken in upon by the death of a near relative of one of the parties had been often carried out in a subdued form with no longer delay  charlottes station was now at hand she bade him farewell and he rattled on to the building he had come to inspect and next to budmouth whence he intended to cross the channel by steamboat that night  he hardly knew how the evening passed away he had taken up his quarters at an inn near the quay and as the night drew on he stood gazing from the coffeeroom window at the steamer outside which nearly thrust its spars through the bedroom casements and at the goods that were being tumbled on board as only shippers can tumble them all the goods were laden a lamp was put on each side the gangway the engines broke into a crackling roar and people began to enter they were only waiting for the last train then they would be off still somerset did not move he was thinking of that curious halftold story of charlottes about a telegram to paula for money from nice not once till within the last halfhour had it recurred to his mind that he had met dare both at nice and at monte carlo that at the latter place he had been absolutely out of money and wished to borrow showing considerable sinister feeling when somerset declined to lend that on one or two previous occasions he had reasons for doubting dares probity and that in spite of the young mans impoverishment at monte carlo he had a few days later beheld him in shining raiment at carlsruhe somerset though misty in his conjectures was seized with a growing conviction that there was something in miss de stancys allusion to the telegram which ought to be explained  he felt an insurmountable objection to cross the water that night or till he had been able to see charlotte again and learn more of her meaning he countermanded the order to put his luggage on board watched the steamer out of the harbour and went to bed he might as well have gone to battle for any rest that he got on rising the next morning he felt rather blank though none the less convinced that a matter required investigation he left budmouth by a morning train and about eleven oclock found himself in markton  the momentum of a practical inquiry took him through that ancient borough without leaving him much leisure for those reveries which had yesterday lent an unutterable sadness to every object there it was just before noon that he started for the castle intending to arrive at a time of the morning when as he knew from experience he could speak to charlotte without difficulty the rising ground soon revealed the old towers to him and jutting out behind them the scaffoldings for the new wing  while halting here on the knoll in some doubt about his movements he beheld a man coming along the road and was soon confronted by his former competitor havill the first instinct of each was to pass with a nod but a second instinct for intercourse was sufficient to bring them to a halt after a few superficial words had been spoken somerset said you have succeeded me  i have said havill but little to my advantage i have just heard that my commission is to extend no further than roofing in the wing that you began and had i known that before i would have seen the castle fall flat as jericho before i would have accepted the superintendence but i know who i have to thank for thatde stancy  somerset still looked towards the distant battlements on the scaffolding among the whitejacketed workmen he could discern one figure in a dark suit  you have a clerk of the works i see he observed  nominally i have but practically i havent  then why do you keep him  i cant help myself he is mr dare and having been recommended by a higher power than i there he must stay in spite of me  who recommended him  the samede stancy  it is very odd murmured somerset but that young man is the object of my visit  you had better leave him alone said havill drily  somerset asked why  since i call no man master over that way i will inform you havill then related in splenetic tones to which somerset did not care to listen till the story began to advance itself how he had passed the night with dare at the inn and the incidents of that night relating how he had seen some letters on the young mans breast which long had puzzled him they were an e a t an n and a c i thought over them long till it eventually occurred to me that the word when filled out was de stancy and that kinship explains the offensive and defensive alliance between them  but good heavens man said somerset more and more disturbed does she know of it  you may depend she does not yet but she will soon enough harkthere it is the notes of the castle clock were heard striking noon then it is all over  whatnot their marriage  yes didnt you know it was the wedding day they were to be at the church at halfpast eleven i should have waited to see her go but it was no sight to hinder business for as she was only going to drive over in her brougham with miss de stancy  my errand has failed said somerset turning on his heel ill walk back to the town with you  however he did not walk far with havill society was too much at that moment as soon as opportunity offered he branched from the road by a path and avoiding the town went by railway to budmouth whence he resumed by the night steamer his journey to normandy    xiii  to return to charlotte de stancy when the train had borne somerset from her side and she had regained her selfpossession she became conscious of the true proportions of the fact he had asserted and further if the telegram had not been his why should the photographic distortion be trusted as a phase of his existence but after a while it seemed so improbable to her that gods sun should bear false witness that instead of doubting both evidences she was inclined to readmit the first still upon the whole she could not question for long the honesty of somersets denial and if that message had indeed been sent by him it must have been done while he was in another such an unhappy state as that exemplified by the portrait the supposition reconciled all differences and yet she could not but fight against it with all the strength of a generous affection  all the afternoon her poor little head was busy on this perturbing question till she inquired of herself whether after all it might not be possible for photographs to represent people as they had never been before rejecting the hypothesis she determined to have the word of a professor on the point which would be better than all her surmises returning to markton early she told the coachman whom paula had sent to drive her to the shop of mr ray an obscure photographic artist in that town instead of straight home  rays establishment consisted of two divisions the respectable and the shabby if on entering the door the visitor turned to the left he found himself in a magazine of old clothes old furniture china umbrellas guns fishingrods dirty fiddles and split flutes entering the righthand room which had originally been that of an independent house he was in an ordinary photographers and printcollectors depository to which a certain artistic solidity was imparted by a few oil paintings in the background charlotte made for the latter department and when she was inside mr ray appeared in person from the lumbershop adjoining which despite its manginess contributed by far the greater share to his income  charlotte put her question simply enough the man did not answer her directly but soon found that she meant no harm to him he told her that such misrepresentations were quite possible and that they embodied a form of humour which was getting more and more into vogue among certain facetious persons of society  charlotte was coming away when she asked as on second thoughts if he had any specimens of such work to show her  none of my own preparation said mr ray with unimpeachable probity of tone i consider them libellous myself still i have one or two samples by me which i keep merely as curiositiestheres one he said throwing out a portrait card from a drawer that represents the german emperor in a violent passion this one shows the prime minister out of his mind this the pope of rome the worse for liquor  she inquired if he had any local specimens  yes he said but i prefer not to exhibit them unless you really ask for a particular one that you mean to buy  i dont want any  o i beg pardon miss well i shouldnt myself own such things were produced if there had not been a young man here at one time who was very ingenious in these mattersa mr dare he was quite a gent and only did it as an amusement and not for the sake of getting a living  charlotte had no wish to hear more on her way home she burst into tears the entanglement was altogether too much for her to tear asunder even had not her own instincts been urging her two ways as they were  to immediately right somersets wrong was her impetuous desire as an honest woman who loved him but such rectification would be the jeopardizing of all else that gratified herthe marriage of her brother with her dearest friendnow on the very point of accomplishment it was a marriage which seemed to promise happiness or at least comfort if the old flutter that had transiently disturbed paulas bosom could be kept from reviving to which end it became imperative to hide from her the discovery of injustice to somerset it involved the advantage of leaving somerset free and though her own tender interest in him had been too well schooled by habitual selfdenial to run ahead on vain personal hopes there was nothing more than human in her feeling pleasure in prolonging somersets singleness paula might even be allowed to discover his wrongs when her marriage had put him out of her power but to let her discover his illtreatment now might upset the impending union of the families and wring her own heart with the sight of somerset married in her brothers place  why dare or any other person should have set himself to advance her brothers cause by such unscrupulous blackening of somersets character was more than her sagacity could fathom her brother was as far as she could see the only man who could directly profit by the machination and was therefore the natural one to suspect of having set it going but she would not be so disloyal as to entertain the thought long and who or what had instigated dare who was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the mischief remained to her an inscrutable mystery  the contention of interests and desires with honour in her heart shook charlotte all that night but good principle prevailed the wedding was to be solemnized the very next morning though for beforementioned reasons this was hardly known outside the two houses interested and there were no visible preparations either at villa or castle de stancy and his groomsmana brother officerslept at the former residence  de stancy was a sorry specimen of a bridegroom when he met his sister in the morning thickcoming fancies for which there was more than good reason had disturbed him only too successfully and he was as full of apprehension as one who has a league with mephistopheles charlotte told him nothing of what made her likewise so wan and anxious but drove off to the castle as had been planned about nine oclock leaving her brother and his friend at the breakfasttable  that clearing somersets reputation from the stain which had been thrown on it would cause a sufficient reaction in paulas mind to dislocate present arrangements she did not so seriously anticipate now that morning had a little calmed her since the rupture with her former architect paula had sedulously kept her own counsel but charlotte assumed from the ease with which she seemed to do it that her feelings towards him had never been inconveniently warm and she hoped that paula would learn of somersets purity with merely the generous pleasure of a friend coupled with a friends indignation against his traducer  still the possibility existed of stronger emotions and it was only too evident to poor charlotte that knowing this she had still less excuse for delaying the intelligence till the strongest emotion would be purposeless  on approaching the castle the first object that caught her eye was dare standing beside havill on the scaffolding of the new wing he was looking down upon the drive and court as if in anticipation of the event his contiguity flurried her and instead of going straight to paula she sought out mrs goodman  you are come early thats right said the latter you might as well have slept here last night we have only mr wardlaw the london lawyer you have heard of in the house your brothers solicitor was here yesterday but he returned to markton for the night we miss mr power so muchit is so unfortunate that he should have been obliged to go abroad and leave us unprotected women with so much responsibility  yes i know said charlotte quickly having a shy distaste for the details of what troubled her so much in the gross  paula has inquired for you  what is she doing  she is in her room she has not begun to dress yet will you go to her  charlotte assented i have to tell her something she said which will make no difference but which i should like her to know this morningat once i have discovered that we have been entirely mistaken about mr somerset she nerved herself to relate succinctly what had come to her knowledge the day before  mrs goodman was much impressed she had never clearly heard before what circumstances had attended the resignation of paulas architect we had better not tell her till the wedding is over she presently said it would only disturb her and do no good  but will it be right asked miss de stancy  yes it will be right if we tell her afterwards o yesit must be right she repeated in a tone which showed that her opinion was unstable enough to require a little fortification by the voice she loves your brother she must since she is going to marry him and it can make little difference whether we rehabilitate the character of a friend now or some few hours hence the author of those wicked tricks on mr somerset ought not to go a moment unpunished  thats what i think and what right have we to hold our tongues even for a few hours  charlotte found that by telling mrs goodman she had simply made two irresolute people out of one and as paula was now inquiring for her she went upstairs without having come to any decision    xiv  paula was in her boudoir writing down some notes previous to beginning her wedding toilet which was designed to harmonize with the simplicity that characterized the other arrangements she owned that it was depriving the neighbourhood of a pageant which it had a right to expect of her but the circumstance was inexorable  mrs goodman entered paulas room immediately behind charlotte perhaps the only difference between the paula of today and the paula of last year was an accession of thoughtfulness natural to the circumstances in any case and more particularly when as now the brides isolation made selfdependence a necessity she was sitting in a light dressinggown and her face which was rather pale flushed at the entrance of charlotte and her aunt  i knew you were come she said when charlotte stooped and kissed her i heard you i have done nothing this morning and feel dreadfully unsettled is all well  the question was put without thought but its aptness seemed almost to imply an intuitive knowledge of their previous conversation yes said charlotte tardily  well now clementine shall dress you and i can do with milly continued paula come along well auntwhats the matterand you charlotte you look harassed  i have not slept well said charlotte  and have not you slept well either aunt you said nothing about it at breakfast  o it is nothing said mrs goodman quickly i have been disturbed by learning of somebodys villainy i am going to tell you all some time today but it is not important enough to disturb you with now  no mystery argued paula come it is not fair  i dont think it is quite fair said miss de stancy looking from one to the other in some distress mrs goodmani must tell her paula mr som  hes dead cried paula sinking into a chair and turning as pale as marble is he deadtell me she whispered  no nohes not deadhe is very well and gone to normandy for a holiday  oi am glad to hear it answered paula with a sudden cool mannerliness  he has been misrepresented said mrs goodman thats all  well said paula with her eyes bent on the floor  i have been feeling that i ought to tell you clearly dear paula declared her friend it is absolutely false about his telegraphing to you for moneyit is absolutely false that his character is such as that dreadful picture represented it therethats the substance of it and i can tell you particulars at any time  but paula would not be told at any time a dreadful sorrow sat in her face she insisted upon learning everything about the matter there and then and there was no withstanding her  when it was all explained she said in a low tone it is that pernicious evil man dareyet why is it hewhat can he have meant by it justice before generosity even on ones weddingday before i become any mans wife this morning ill see that wretch in jail the affair must be sifted o it was a wicked thing to serve anybody soill send for cunningham haze this momentthe culprit is even now on the premises i believeacting as clerk of the works the usually wellbalanced paula was excited and scarcely knowing what she did went to the bellpull  dont act hastily paula said her aunt had you not better consult sir william he will act for you in this  yeshe is coming round in a few minutes said charlotte jumping at this happy thought of mrs goodmans hes going to run across to see how you are getting on he will be here by ten  yeshe promised last night  she had scarcely done speaking when the prancing of a horse was heard in the ward below and in a few minutes a servant announced sir william de stancy  de stancy entered saying i have ridden across for ten minutes as i said i would do to know if everything is easy and straightforward for you there will be time enough for me to get back and prepare if i start shortly well  i am ruffled said paula allowing him to take her hand  what is it said her betrothed  as paula did not immediately answer mrs goodman beckoned to charlotte and they left the room together  a man has to be given in charge or a boy or a demon she replied i was going to do it but you can do it better than i he will run away if we dont mind  but my dear paula who is itwhat has he done  it is darethat young man you see out there against the sky she looked from the window sideways towards the new wing on the roof of which dare was walking prominently about after having assisted two of the workmen in putting a red streamer on the tallest scaffoldpole you must send instantly for mr cunningham haze  my dearest paula repeated de stancy faintly his complexion changing to that of a man who had died  please send for mr haze at once returned paula with graceful firmness i said i would be just to a wronged man before i was generous to youand i will that lad dareto take a practical view of ithas attempted to defraud me of one hundred pounds sterling and he shall suffer i wont tell you what he has done besides for though it is worse it is less tangible when he is handcuffed and sent off to jail ill proceed with my dressing will you ring the bell  had you not better consider began de stancy  consider said paula with indignation i have considered will you kindly ring sir william and get thomas to ride at once to mr haze or must i rise from this chair and do it myself  you are very hasty and abrupt this morning i think he faltered  paula rose determinedly from the chair since you wont do it i must she said  no dearestlet me beg you not to  sir william de stancy  she moved towards the bellpull but he stepped before and intercepted her  you must not ring the bell for that purpose he said with husky deliberateness looking into the depths of her face  it wants two hours to the time when you might have a right to express such a command as that she said haughtily  i certainly have not the honour to be your husband yet he sadly replied but surely you can listen there exist reasons against giving this boy in charge which i could easily get you to admit by explanation but i would rather without explanation have you take my word when i say that by doing so you are striking a blow against both yourself and me  paula however had rung the bell  you are jealous of somebody or something perhaps she said in tones which showed how fatally all this was telling against the intention of that day i will not be a party to baseness if it is to save all my fortune  the bell was answered quickly but de stancy though plainly in great misery did not give up his point meeting the servant at the door before he could enter the room he said it is nothing you can go again  paula looked at the unhappy baronet in amazement then turning to the servant who stood with the door in his hand said tell thomas to saddle the chestnut and  its all a mistake insisted de stancy leave the room james  james looked at his mistress  yes james leave the room she calmly said sitting down now what have you to say she asked when they were again alone why must i not issue orders in my own house who is this young criminal that you value his interests higher than my honour i have delayed for one moment sending my messenger to the chief constable to hear your explanationonly for that  you will still persevere  certainly who is he  paula he is my son  she remained still as death while one might count ten then turned her back upon him i think you had better go away she whispered you need not come again  he did not move paulado you indeed mean this he asked  i do  de stancy walked a few paces then said in a low voice miss power i knewi guessed just now as soon as it beganthat we were going to split on this rock welllet it beit cannot be helped destiny is supreme the boy was to be my ruin he is my ruin and rightly but before i go grant me one request do not prosecute him believe me i will do everything i can to get him out of your way he shall annoy you no more do you promise  i do she said now please leave me  once moream i to understand that no marriage is to take place today between you and me  you are  sir william de stancy left the room it was noticeable throughout the interview that his manner had not been the manner of a man altogether taken by surprise during the few preceding days his mood had been that of the gambler seasoned in illluck who adopts pessimist surmises as a safe background to his most sanguine hopes  she remained alone for some time then she rang and requested that mr wardlaw her fathers solicitor and friend would come up to her a messenger was despatched not to mr cunningham haze but to the parson of the parish who in his turn sent to the clerk and clerks wife then busy in the church on receipt of the intelligence the two latter functionaries proceeded to roll up the carpet which had been laid from the door to the gate put away the kneelingcushions locked the doors and went off to inquire the reason of so strange a countermand it was soon proclaimed in markton that the marriage had been postponed for a fortnight in consequence of the brides sudden indisposition and less public emotion was felt than the case might have drawn forth from the ignorance of the majority of the populace that a wedding had been going to take place at all  meanwhile miss de stancy had been closeted with paula for more than an hour it was a difficult meeting and a severe test to any friendship but that of the most sterling sort in the turmoil of her distraction charlotte had the consolation of knowing that if her act of justice to somerset at such a moment were the act of a simpleton it was the only course open to honesty but paulas cheerful serenity in some measure laid her own troubles to rest till they were reawakened by a rumourwhich got wind some weeks later and quite drowned all other surprisesof the true relation between the vanished clerk of works mr dare and the fallen family of de stancy     book the sixth paula   i  i have decided that i cannot see sir william again i shall go away said paula on the evening of the next day as she lay on her bed in a flushed and highlystrung condition though a person who had heard her words without seeing her face would have assumed perfect equanimity to be the mood which expressed itself with such quietness this was the case with her aunt who was looking out of the window at some idlers from markton walking round the castle with their eyes bent upon its windows and she made no haste to reply  those people have come to see me as they have a right to do when a person acts so strangely paula continued and hence i am better away  where do you think to go to  paula replied in the tone of one who was actuated entirely by practical considerations out of england certainly and as normandy lies nearest i think i shall go there it is a very nice country to ramble in  yes it is a very nice country to ramble in echoed her aunt in moderate tones when do you intend to start  i should like to cross tonight you must go with me aunt will you not  mrs goodman expostulated against such suddenness it will redouble the rumours that are afloat if after being supposed ill you are seen going off by railway perfectly well  thats a contingency which i am quite willing to run the risk of well it would be rather sudden as you say to go tonight but well go tomorrow night at latest under the influence of the decision she bounded up like an elastic ball and went to the glass which showed a light in her eye that had not been there before this resolution to travel in normandy had been taken  the evening and the next morning were passed in writing a final and kindly note of dismissal to sir william de stancy in making arrangements for the journey and in commissioning havill to take advantage of their absence by emptying certain rooms of their furniture and repairing their dilapidationsa work which with that in hand would complete the section for which he had been engaged mr wardlaw had left the castle so also had charlotte by her own wish her residence there having been found too oppressive to herself to be continued for the present accompanied by mrs goodman milly and clementine the elderly french maid who still remained with them paula drove into markton in the twilight and took the train to budmouth  when they got there they found that an unpleasant breeze was blowing out at sea though inland it had been calm enough mrs goodman proposed to stay at budmouth till the next day in hope that there might be smooth water but an english seaport inn being a thing that paula disliked more than a rough passage she would not listen to this counsel other impatient reasons too might have weighed with her when night came their looming miseries began paula found that in addition to her own troubles she had those of three other people to support but she did not audibly complain  paula paula said mrs goodman from beneath her load of wretchedness why did we think of undergoing this  a slight gleam of humour crossed paulas not particularly blooming face as she answered ah why indeed  what is the real reason my dear for gods sake tell me  it begins with s  well i would do anything for that young man short of personal martyrdom but really when it comes to that  dont criticize me auntie and i wont criticize you  well i am open to criticism just now i am sure said her aunt with a green smile and speech was again discontinued  the morning was bright and beautiful and it could again be seen in paulas looks that she was glad she had come though in taking their rest at cherbourg fate consigned them to an hotel breathing an atmosphere that seemed specially compounded for depressing the spirits of a young woman indeed nothing had particularly encouraged her thus far in her somewhat peculiar scheme of searching out and expressing sorrow to a gentleman for having believed those who traduced him and this coup daudace to which she had committed herself began to look somewhat formidable when in england the plan of following him to normandy had suggested itself as the quickest sweetest and most honest way of making amends but having arrived there she seemed further off from his sphere of existence than when she had been at stancy castle virtually she was for if he thought of her at all he probably thought of her there if he sought her he would seek her there however as he would probably never do the latter it was necessary to go on it had been her sudden dream before starting to light accidentally upon him in some romantic old town of this romantic old province but she had become aware that the recorded fortune of lovers in that respect was not to be trusted too implicitly  somersets search for her in the south was now inversely imitated by diligent inquiry in cherbourg during the gloom of evening in the disguise of a hooded cloak she learnt out the place of his stay while there and that he had gone thence to lisieux what she knew of the architectural character of lisieux half guaranteed the truth of the information without telling her aunt of this discovery she announced to that lady that it was her great wish to go on and see the beauties of lisieux  but though her aunt was simple there were bounds to her simplicity paula she said with an undeceivable air i dont think you should run after a young man like this suppose he shouldnt care for you by this time  it was no occasion for further affectation i am sure he will answered her niece flatly i have not the least fear about itnor would you if you knew how he is he will forgive me anything  well pray dont show yourself forward some people are apt to fly into extremes  paula blushed a trifle and reflected and made no answer however her purpose seemed not to be permanently affected for the next morning she was up betimes and preparing to depart and they proceeded almost without stopping to the architectural curiositytown which had so quickly interested her nevertheless her ardent manner of yesterday underwent a considerable change as if she had a fear that as her aunt suggested in her endeavour to make amends for cruel injustice she was allowing herself to be carried too far  on nearing the place she said aunt i think you had better call upon him and you need not tell him we have come on purpose let him think if he will that we heard he was here and would not leave without seeing him you can also tell him that i am anxious to clear up a misunderstanding and ask him to call at our hotel  but as she looked over the dreary suburban erections which lined the road from the railway to the old quarter of the town it occurred to her that somerset would at that time of day be engaged in one or other of the mediaeval buildings thereabout and that it would be a much neater thing to meet him as if by chance in one of these edifices than to call upon him anywhere instead of putting up at any hotel they left the maids and baggage at the station and hiring a carriage paula told the coachman to drive them to such likely places as she could think of  hell never forgive you said her aunt as they rumbled into the town  wont he said paula with soft faith ill see about that  what are you going to do when you find him tell him pointblank that you are in love with him  act in such a manner that he may tell me he is in love with me  they first visited a large church at the upper end of a square that sloped its gravelled surface to the western shine and was pricked out with little avenues of young pollard limes the church within was one to make any gothic architect take lodgings in its vicinity for a fortnight though it was just now crowded with a forest of scaffolding for repairs in progress mrs goodman sat down outside and paula entering took a walk in the form of a horseshoe that is up the south aisle round the apse and down the north side but no figure of a melancholy young man sketching met her eye anywhere the sun that blazed in at the west doorway smote her face as she emerged from beneath it and revealed real sadness there  this is not all the old architecture of the town by far she said to her aunt with an air of confidence coachman drive to st jacques  he was not at st jacques looking from the west end of that building the girl observed the end of a steep narrow street of antique character which seemed a likely haunt beckoning to her aunt to follow in the fly paula walked down the street  she was transported to the middle ages it contained the shops of tinkers braziers bellowsmenders hollowturners and other quaintest trades their fronts open to the street beneath stories of timber overhanging so far on each side that a slit of sky was left at the top for the light to descend and no more a blue misty obscurity pervaded the atmosphere into which the sun thrust oblique staves of light it was a street for a mediaevalist to revel in toss up his hat and shout hurrah in send for his luggage come and live in die and be buried in she had never supposed such a street to exist outside the imaginations of antiquarians smells direct from the sixteenth century hung in the air in all their original integrity and without a modern taint the faces of the people in the doorways seemed those of individuals who habitually gazed on the great francis and spoke of henry the eighth as the king across the sea  she inquired of a coppersmith if an english artist had been seen here lately with a suddenness that almost discomfited her he announced that such a man had been seen sketching a house just belowthe vieux manoir de francois premier just turning to see that her aunt was following in the fly paula advanced to the house the wood framework of the lower story was black and varnished the upper story was brown and not varnished carved figures of dragons griffins satyrs and mermaids swarmed over the front an ape stealing apples was the subject of this cantilever a man undressing of that these figures were cloaked with little cobwebs which waved in the breeze so that each figure seemed alive  she examined the woodwork closely here and there she discerned pencilmarks which had no doubt been jotted thereon by somerset as points of admeasurement in the way she had seen him mark them at the castle some fragments of paper lay below there were pencilled lines on them and they bore a strong resemblance to a spoilt leaf of somersets sketchbook paula glanced up and from a window above protruded an old womans head which with the exception of the white handkerchief tied round it was so nearly of the colour of the carvings that she might easily have passed as of a piece with them the aged woman continued motionless the remains of her eyes being bent upon paula who asked her in englishwomans french where the sketcher had gone without replying the crone produced a hand and extended finger from her side and pointed towards the lower end of the street  paula went on the carriage following with difficulty on account of the obstructions in the thoroughfare at bottom the street abutted on a wide one with customary modern life flowing through it and as she looked somerset crossed her front along this street hurrying as if for a wager  by the time that paula had reached the bottom somerset was a long way to the left and she recognized to her dismay that the busy transverse street was one which led to the railway she quickened her pace to a run he did not see her he even walked faster she looked behind for the carriage the driver in emerging from the sixteenthcentury street to the nineteenth had apparently turned to the right instead of to the left as she had done so that her aunt had lost sight of her however she dare not mind it if somerset would but look back he partly turned but not far enough and it was only to hail a passing omnibus upon which she discerned his luggage somerset jumped in the omnibus drove on and diminished up the long road paula stood hopelessly still and in a few minutes puffs of steam showed her that the train had gone  she turned and waited the two or three children who had gathered round her looking up sympathizingly in her face her aunt having now discovered the direction of her flight drove up and beckoned to her  whats the matter asked mrs goodman in alarm  why  that you should run like that and look so woebegone  nothing only i have decided not to stay in this town  what he is gone i suppose  yes exclaimed paula with tears of vexation in her eyes it isnt every man who gets a woman of my position to run after him on foot and alone and he ought to have looked round drive to the station i want to make an inquiry  on reaching the station she asked the bookingclerk some questions and returned to her aunt with a cheerful countenance mr somerset has only gone to caen she said he is the only englishman who went by this train so there is no mistake there is no other train for two hours we will go on thenshall we  i am indifferent said mrs goodman but paula do you think this quite right perhaps he is not so anxious for your forgiveness as you think perhaps he saw you and wouldnt stay  a momentary dismay crossed her face but it passed and she answered aunt thats nonsense i know him well enough and can assure you that if he had only known i was running after him he would have looked round sharply enough and would have given his little finger rather than have missed me i dont make myself so silly as to run after a gentleman without good grounds for i know well that it is an undignified thing to do indeed i could never have thought of doing it if i had not been so miserably in the wrong    ii  that evening when the sun was dropping out of sight they started for the city of somersets pilgrimage paula seated herself with her face toward the western sky watching from her window the broad red horizon across which moved thin poplars lopped to human shapes like the walking forms in nebuchadnezzars furnace it was dark when the travellers drove into caen  she still persisted in her wish to casually encounter somerset in some aisle ladychapel or crypt to which he might have betaken himself to copy and learn the secret of the great artists who had erected those nooks mrs goodman was for discovering his inn and calling upon him in a straightforward way but paula seemed afraid of it and they went out in the morning on foot first they searched the church of st sauveur he was not there next the church of st jean then the church of st pierre but he did not reveal himself nor had any verger seen or heard of such a man outside the latter church was a public flowergarden and she sat down to consider beside a round pool in which waterlilies grew and goldfish swam near beds of fiery geraniums dahlias and verbenas just past their bloom her enterprise had not been justified by its results so far but meditation still urged her to listen to the little voice within and push on she accordingly rejoined her aunt and they drove up the hill to the abbaye aux dames the day by this time having grown hot and oppressive  the church seemed absolutely empty the void being emphasized by its grateful coolness but on going towards the east end they perceived a bald gentleman close to the screen looking to the right and to the left as if much perplexed paula merely glanced over him his back being toward her and turning to her aunt said softly i wonder how we get into the choir  thats just what i am wondering said the old gentleman abruptly facing round and paula discovered that the countenance was not unfamiliar to her eye since knowing somerset she had added to her gallery of celebrities a photograph of his father the academician and he it was now who confronted her  for the moment embarrassment due to complicated feelings brought a slight blush to her cheek but being well aware that he did not know her she answered coolly enough i suppose we must ask some one  and we certainly would if there were any one to ask he said still looking eastward and not much at her i have been here a long time but nobody comes not that i want to get in on my own account for though it is thirty years since i last set foot in this place i remember it as if it were but yesterday  indeed i have never been here before said paula  naturally but i am looking for a young man who is making sketches in some of these buildings and it is as likely as not that he is in the crypt under this choir for it is just such outoftheway nooks that he prefers it is very provoking that he should not have told me more distinctly in his letter where to find him  mrs goodman who had gone to make inquiries now came back and informed them that she had learnt that it was necessary to pass through the hoteldieu to the choir to do which they must go outside thereupon they walked on together and mr somerset quite ignoring his troubles made remarks upon the beauty of the architecture and in absence of mind by reason either of the subject or of his listener retained his hat in his hand after emerging from the church while they walked all the way across the place and into the hospital gardens  a very civil man said mrs goodman to paula privately  yes said paula who had not told her aunt that she recognized him  one of the sisters now preceded them towards the choir and crypt mr somerset asking her if a young englishman was or had been sketching there on receiving a reply in the negative paula nearly betrayed herself by turning as if her business there too ended with the information however she went on again and made a pretence of looking round mr somerset also staying in a spirit of friendly attention to his countrywomen they did not part from him till they had come out from the crypt and again reached the west front on their way to which he additionally explained that it was his son he was looking for who had arranged to meet him here but had mentioned no inn at which he might be expected  when he had left them paula informed her aunt whose company they had been sharing her aunt began expostulating with paula for not telling mr somerset what they had seen of his sons movements it would have eased his mind at least she said  i was not bound to ease his mind at the expense of showing what i would rather conceal i am continually hampered in such generosity as that by the circumstance of being a woman  well it is getting too late to search further tonight  it was indeed almost evening twilight in the streets though the graceful freestone spires to a depth of about twenty feet from their summits were still dyed with the orange tints of a vanishing sun the two relatives dined privately as usual after which paula looked out of the window of her room and reflected upon the events of the day a tower rising into the sky quite near at hand showed her that some church or other stood within a few steps of the hotel archway and saying nothing to mrs goodman she quietly cloaked herself and went out towards it apparently with the view of disposing of a portion of a dull dispiriting evening the church was open and on entering she found that it was only lighted by seven candles burning before the altar of a chapel on the south side the mass of the building being in deep shade motionless outlines which resolved themselves into the forms of kneeling women were darkly visible among the chairs and in the triforium above the arcades there was one hitherto unnoticed radiance dim as that of a glowworm in the grass it was seemingly the effect of a solitary tallowcandle behind the masonry  a priest came in unlocked the door of a confessional with a click which sounded in the silence and entered it a woman followed disappeared within the curtain of the same emerging again in about five minutes followed by the priest who locked up his door with another loud click like a tradesman full of business and came down the aisle to go out in the lobby he spoke to another woman who replied ah oui monsieur labbe  two women having spoken to him there could be no harm in a third doing likewise monsieur labbe said paula in french could you indicate to me the stairs of the triforium and she signified her reason for wishing to know by pointing to the glimmering light above  ah he is a friend of yours the englishman pleasantly said the priest recognizing her nationality and taking her to a little door he conducted her up a stone staircase at the top of which he showed her the long blind story over the aisle arches which led round to where the light was cautioning her not to stumble over the uneven floor he left her and descended his words had signified that somerset was here  it was a gloomy place enough that she found herself in but the seven candles below on the opposite altar and a faint sky light from the clerestory lent enough rays to guide her paula walked on to the bend of the apse here were a few chairs and the origin of the light  this was a candle stuck at the end of a sharpened stick the latter entering a joint in the stones a young man was sketching by the glimmer but there was no need for the blush which had prepared itself beforehand the young man was mr cockton somersets youngest draughtsman  paula could have cried aloud with disappointment cockton recognized miss power and appearing much surprised rose from his seat with a bow and said hastily mr somerset left today  i did not ask for him said paula  no miss power but i thought  yes yesyou know of course that he has been my architect well it happens that i should like to see him if he can call on me which way did he go  hes gone to etretat  what for there are no abbeys to sketch at etretat  cockton looked at the point of his pencil and with a hesitating motion of his lip answered mr somerset said he was tired  of what  he said he was sick and tired of holy places and would go to some wicked spot or other to get that consolation which holiness could not give but he only said it casually to knowles and perhaps he did not mean it  knowles is here too  yes miss power and bowles mr somerset has been kind enough to give us a chance of enlarging our knowledge of french earlypointed and pays half the expenses  paula said a few other things to the young man walked slowly round the triforium as if she had come to examine it and returned down the staircase on getting back to the hotel she told her aunt who had just been having a nap that next day they would go to etretat for a change  why there are no old churches at etretat  no but i am sick and tired of holy places and want to go to some wicked spot or other to find that consolation which holiness cannot give  for shame paula now i know what it is you have heard that hes gone there you neednt try to blind me  i dont care where hes gone cried paula petulantly in a moment however she smiled at herself and added you must take that for what it is worth i have made up my mind to let him know from my own lips how the misunderstanding arose that done i shall leave him and probably never see him again my conscience will be clear  the next day they took the steamboat down the orne intending to reach etretat by way of havre just as they were moving off an elderly gentleman under a large white sunshade and carrying his hat in his hand was seen leisurely walking down the wharf at some distance but obviously making for the boat  a gentleman said the mate  who is he said the captain  an english said clementine  nobody knew more but as leisure was the order of the day the engines were stopped on the chance of his being a passenger and all eyes were bent upon him in conjecture he disappeared and reappeared from behind a pile of merchandise and approached the boat at an easy pace whereupon the gangway was replaced and he came on board removing his hat to paula quietly thanking the captain for stopping and saying to mrs goodman i am nicely in time  it was mr somerset the elder who by degrees informed our travellers as sitting on their campstools they advanced between the green banks bordered by elms that he was going to etretat that the young man he had spoken of yesterday had gone to that romantic wateringplace instead of studying art at caen and that he was going to join him there  paula preserved an entire silence as to her own intentions partly from natural reticence and partly as it appeared from the difficulty of explaining a complication which was not very clear to herself at havre they parted from mr somerset and did not see him again till they were driving over the hills towards etretat in a carriage and four when the white umbrella became visible far ahead among the outside passengers of the coach to the same place in a short time they had passed and cut in before this vehicle but soon became aware that their carriage like the coach was one of a straggling procession of conveyances some mile and a half in length all bound for the village between the cliffs  in descending the long hill shaded by limetrees which sheltered their place of destination this procession closed up and they perceived that all the visitors and native population had turned out to welcome them the daily arrival of new sojourners at this hour being the chief excitement of etretat the coach which had preceded them all the way at more or less remoteness was now quite close and in passing along the village street they saw mr somerset wave his hand to somebody in the crowd below a felt hat was waved in the air in response the coach swept into the innyard followed by the idlers and all disappeared paulas face was crimson as their own carriage swept round in the opposite direction to the rival inn  once in her room she breathed like a person who had finished a long chase they did not go down before dinner but when it was almost dark paula begged her aunt to wrap herself up and come with her to the shore hard by the beach was deserted everybody being at the casino the gate stood invitingly open and they went in here the brilliantly lit terrace was crowded with promenaders and outside the yellow palings surmounted by its row of lamps rose the voice of the invisible sea groups of people were sitting under the verandah the women mostly in wraps for the air was growing chilly through the windows at their back an animated scene disclosed itself in the shape of a roomfull of waltzers the strains of the band striving in the ear for mastery over the sounds of the sea the dancers came round a couple at a time and were individually visible to those people without who chose to look that way which was what paula did  come away come away she suddenly said it is not right for us to be here  her exclamation had its origin in what she had at that moment seen within the spectacle of mr george somerset whirling round the room with a young lady of uncertain nationality but pleasing figure paula was not accustomed to show the white feather too clearly but she soon had passed out through those yellow gates and retreated till the mixed music of sea and band had resolved into that of the sea alone  well said her aunt half in soliloquy do you know who i saw dancing there paula our mr somerset if i dont make a great mistake  it was likely enough that you did sedately replied her niece he left caen with the intention of seeking distractions of a lighter kind than those furnished by art and he has merely succeeded in finding them but he has made my duty rather a difficult one still it was my duty for i very greatly wronged him perhaps however i have done enough for honours sake i would have humiliated myself by an apology if i had found him in any other situation but of course one cant he expected to take much trouble when he is seen going on like that  the coolness with which she began her remarks had developed into something like warmth as she concluded  he is only dancing with a lady he probably knows very well  he doesnt know her the idea of his dancing with a woman of that description we will go away tomorrow this place has been greatly overpraised  the place is well enough as far as i can see  he is carrying out his programme to the letter he plunges into excitement in the most reckless manner and i tremble for the consequences i can do no more i have humiliated myself into following him believing that in giving too ready credence to appearances i had been narrow and inhuman and had caused him much misery but he does not mind and he has no misery he seems just as well as ever how much this finding him has cost me after all i did not deceive him he must have acquired a natural aversion for me i have allowed myself to be interested in a man of very common qualities and am now bitterly alive to the shame of having sought him out i heartily detest him i will go backaunt you are righti had no business to come his light conduct has rendered him uninteresting to me    iii  when she rose the next morning the bell was clanging for the second breakfast and people were pouring in from the beach in every variety of attire paula whom a restless night had left with a headache which however she said nothing about was reluctant to emerge from the seclusion of her chamber till her aunt discovering what was the matter with her suggested that a few minutes in the open air would refresh her and they went downstairs into the hotel gardens  the clatter of the big breakfast within was audible from this spot and the noise seemed suddenly to inspirit paula who proposed to enter her aunt assented in the verandah under which they passed was a rustic hatstand in the form of a tree upon which hats and other bodygear hung like bunches of fruit paulas eye fell upon a felt hat to which a small blockbook was attached by a string she knew that hat and blockbook well and turning to mrs goodman said after all i dont want the breakfast they are having let us order one of our own as usual and well have it here  she led on to where some little tables were placed under the tall shrubs followed by her aunt who was in turn followed by the proprietress of the hotel that lady having discovered from the french maid that there was good reason for paying these ladies ample personal attention  is the gentleman to whom that sketchbook belongs staying here paula carelessly inquired as she indicated the object on the hatstand  ah no deplored the proprietress the hotel was full when mr somerset came he stays at a cottage beyond the rue anicet bourgeois he only has his meals here  paula had taken her seat under the fuchsiatrees in such a manner that she could observe all the exits from the salle a manger but for the present none of the breakfasters emerged the only moving objects on the scene being the waitresses who ran hither and thither across the court the cooks assistants with baskets of long bread and the laundresses with baskets of sunbleached linen further back towards the innyard stablemen were putting in the horses for starting the flys and coaches to les ifs the nearest railwaystation  suppose the somersets should be going off by one of these conveyances said mrs goodman as she sipped her tea  well aunt then they must replied the younger lady with composure  nevertheless she looked with some misgiving at the nearest stableman as he led out four white horses harnessed them and leisurely brought a brush with which he began blacking their yellow hoofs all the vehicles were ready at the door by the time breakfast was over and the inmates soon turned out some to mount the omnibuses and carriages some to ramble on the adjacent beach some to climb the verdant slopes and some to make for the cliffs that shut in the vale the fuchsiatrees which sheltered paulas breakfasttable from the blaze of the sun also screened it from the eyes of the outpouring company and she sat on with her aunt in perfect comfort till among the last of the stream came somerset and his father paula reddened at being so near the former at last it was with sensible relief that she observed them turn towards the cliffs and not to the carriages and thus signify that they were not going off that day  neither of the two saw the ladies and when the latter had finished their tea and coffee they followed to the shore where they sat for nearly an hour reading and watching the bathers at length footsteps crunched among the pebbles in their vicinity and looking out from her sunshade paula saw the two somersets close at hand  the elder recognized her and the younger observing his fathers action of courtesy turned his head it was a revelation to paula for she was shocked to see that he appeared worn and ill the expression of his face changed at sight of her increasing its shade of paleness but he immediately withdrew his eyes and passed by  somerset was as much surprised at encountering her thus as she had been distressed to see him as soon as they were out of hearing he asked his father quietly what strange thing is this that lady de stancy should be here and her husband not with her did she bow to me or to you  lady de stancythat young lady asked the puzzled painter he proceeded to explain all he knew that she was a young lady he had met on his journey at two or three different times moreover that if she were his sons clientthe woman who was to have become lady de stancyshe was miss power still for he had seen in some newspaper two days before leaving england that the wedding had been postponed on account of her illness  somerset was so greatly moved that he could hardly speak connectedly to his father as they paced on together but she is not ill as far as i can see he said the wedding postponedyou are sure the word was postponedwas it broken off  no it was postponed i meant to have told you before knowing you would be interested as the castle architect but it slipped my memory in the bustle of arriving  i am not the castle architect  the devil you are notwhat are you then  well i am not that  somerset the elder though not of penetrating nature began to see that here lay an emotional complication of some sort and reserved further inquiry till a more convenient occasion they had reached the end of the level beach where the cliff began to rise and as this impediment naturally stopped their walk they retraced their steps on again nearing the spot where paula and her aunt were sitting the painter would have deviated to the hotel but as his son persisted in going straight on in due course they were opposite the ladies again by this time miss power who had appeared anxious during their absence regained her selfcontrol going towards her old lover she said with a smile i have been looking for you  why have you been doing that said somerset in a voice which he failed to keep as steady as he could wish  becausei want some architect to continue the restoration do you withdraw your resignation  somerset appeared unable to decide for a few instants yes he then answered  for the moment they had ignored the presence of the painter and mrs goodman but somerset now made them known to one another and there was friendly intercourse all round  when will you be able to resume operations at the castle she asked as soon as she could again speak directly to somerset  as soon as i can get back of course i only resume it at your special request  of course to one who had known all the circumstances it would have seemed a thousand pities that after again getting face to face with him she did not explain without delay the whole mischief that had separated them but she did not do itperhaps from the inherent awkwardness of such a topic at this idle time she confined herself simply to the abovementioned businesslike request and when the party had walked a few steps together they separated with mutual promises to meet again  i hope you have explained your mistake to him and how it arose and everything said her aunt when they were alone  no i did not  what not explain after all said her amazed relative  i decided to put it off  then i think you decided very wrongly poor young man he looked so ill  did you too think he looked ill but he danced last night why did he dance she turned and gazed regretfully at the corner round which the somersets had disappeared  i dont know why he danced but if i had known you were going to be so silent i would have explained the mistake myself  i wish you had but no i have said i would and i must  paulas avoidance of tables dhote did not extend to the present one it was quite with alacrity that she went down and with her entry the antecedent hotel beauty who had reigned for the last five days at that meal was unceremoniously deposed by the guests mr somerset the elder came in but nobody with him his seat was on paulas left hand mrs goodman being on paulas right so that all the conversation was between the academician and the younger lady when the latter had again retired upstairs with her aunt mrs goodman expressed regret that young mr somerset was absent from the table why has he kept away she asked  i dont knowi didnt ask said paula sadly perhaps he doesnt care to meet us again  thats because you didnt explain  wellwhy didnt the old man give me an opportunity exclaimed the niece with suppressed excitement he would scarcely say anything but yes and no and gave me no chance at all of introducing the subject i wanted to explaini came all the way on purposei would have begged georges pardon on my two knees if there had been any way of beginning but there was not and i could not do it  though she slept badly that night paula promptly appeared in the public room to breakfast and that not from motives of vanity for while not unconscious of her accession to the unstable throne of queenbeauty in the establishment she seemed too preoccupied to care for the honour just then and would readily have changed places with her unhappy predecessor who lingered on in the background like a candle after sunrise  mrs goodman was determined to trust no longer to paula for putting an end to what made her so restless and selfreproachful seeing old mr somerset enter to a little sidetable behind for lack of room at the crowded centre tables again without his son she turned her head and asked pointblank where the young man was  mr somersets face became a shade graver than before my son is unwell he replied so unwell that he has been advised to stay indoors and take perfect rest  i do hope it is nothing serious  i hope so too the fact is he has overdone himself a little he was not well when he came here and to make himself worse he must needs go dancing at the casino with this lady and thatamong others with a young american lady who is here with her family and whom he met in london last year i advised him against it but he seemed desperately determined to shake off lethargy by any rash means and wouldnt listen to me luckily he is not in the hotel but in a quiet cottage a hundred yards up the hill  paula who had heard all did not show or say what she felt at the news but after breakfast on meeting the landlady in a passage alone she asked with some anxiety if there were a really skilful medical man in etretat and on being told that there was and his name she went back to look for mr somerset but he had gone  they heard nothing more of young somerset all that morning but towards evening while paula sat at her window looking over the heads of fuchsias upon the promenade beyond she saw the painter walk by she immediately went to her aunt and begged her to go out and ask mr somerset if his son had improved  i will send milly or clementine said mrs goodman  i wish you would see him yourself  he has gone on i shall never find him  he has only gone round to the front persisted paula do walk that way auntie and ask him  thus pressed mrs goodman acquiesced and brought back intelligence to miss power who had watched them through the window that his son did not positively improve but that his american friends were very kind to him  having made use of her aunt paula seemed particularly anxious to get rid of her again and when that lady sat down to write letters paula went to her own room hastily dressed herself without assistance asked privately the way to the cottage and went off thitherward unobserved  at the upper end of the lane she saw a little house answering to the description whose front garden windowsills palings and doorstep were literally ablaze with nasturtiums in bloom  she entered this inhabited nosegay quietly asked for the invalid and if he were well enough to see miss power the woman of the house soon returned and she was conducted up a crooked staircase to somersets modest apartments it appeared that some rooms in this dwelling had been furnished by the landlady of the inn who hired them of the tenant during the summer season to use as an annexe to the hotel  admitted to the outer room she beheld her architect looking as unarchitectural as possible lying on a small couch which was drawn up to the open casement whence he had a back view of the window flowers and enjoyed a green transparency through the undersides of the same nasturtium leaves that presented their faces to the passers without  when the latch had again clicked into the catch of the closed door paula went up to the invalid upon whose pale and interesting face a flush had arisen simultaneously with the announcement of her name he would have sprung up to receive her but she pressed him down and throwing all reserve on one side for the first time in their intercourse she crouched beside the sofa whispering with roguish solicitude her face not too far from his own how foolish you are george to get ill just now when i have been wanting so much to see you againi am so sorry to see you like thiswhat i said to you when we met on the shore was not what i had come to say  somerset took her by the hand then what did you come to say paula he asked  i wanted to tell you that the mere wanton wandering of a capricious mind was not the cause of my estrangement from you there has been a great deception practisedthe exact nature of it i cannot tell you plainly just at present it is too painfulbut it is all over and i can assure you of my sorrow at having behaved as i did and of my sincere friendship now as ever  there is nothing i shall value so much as that it will make my work at the castle very pleasant to feel that i can consult you about it without fear of intruding on you against your wishes  yes perhaps it will butyou do not comprehend me  you have been an enigma always  and you have been provoking but never so provoking as now i wouldnt for the world tell you the whole of my fancies as i came hither this evening but i should think your natural intuition would suggest what they were  it does paula but there are motives of delicacy which prevent my acting on what is suggested to me  delicacy is a gift and you should thank god for it but in some cases it is not so precious as we would persuade ourselves  not when the woman is rich and the man is poor  o george somersetbe cold or angry or anything but dont be like this it is never worth a womans while to show regret for her injustice for all she gets by it is an accusation of want of delicacy  indeed i dont accuse you of thati warmly tenderly thank you for your kindness in coming here to see me  well perhaps you do but i am now in i cannot tell what moodi will not tell what mood for it would be confessing more than i ought this finding you out is a piece of weakness that i shall not repeat and i have only one thing more to say i have served you badly george i know that but it is never too late to mend and i have come back to you however i shall never run after you again trust me for that for it is not the womans part still before i go that there may be no mistake as to my meaning and misery entailed on us for want of a word ill add this that if you want to marry me as you once did you must say so for i am here to be asked  it would be superfluous to transcribe somersets reply and the remainder of the scene between the pair let it suffice that halfanhour afterwards when the sun had almost gone down paula walked briskly into the hotel troubled herself nothing about dinner but went upstairs to their sittingroom where her aunt presently found her upon the couch looking up at the ceiling through her fingers they talked on different subjects for some time till the old lady said mr somersets cottage is the one covered with flowers up the lane i hear  yes said paula  how do you know  ive been there we are going to be married aunt  indeed replied mrs goodman well i thought this might be the end of it you were determined on the point and i am not much surprised at your news your father was very wise after all in entailing everything so strictly upon your offspring for if he had not i should have been driven wild with the responsibility  and now that the murder is out continued paula passing over that view of the case i dont mind telling you that somehow or other i have got to like george somerset as desperately as a woman can care for any man i thought i should have died when i saw him dancing and feared i had lost him he seemed ten times nicer than ever then so silly we women are that i wouldnt marry a duke in preference to him there thats my honest feeling and you must make what you can of it my conscience is clear thank heaven  have you fixed the day  no continued the young lady still watching the sleeping flies on the ceiling it is left unsettled between us while i come and ask you if there would be any harmif it could conveniently be before we return to england  paula this is too precipitate  on the contrary aunt in matrimony as in some other things you should be slow to decide but quick to execute nothing on earth would make me marry another man i know every fibre of his character and he knows a good many fibres of mine so as there is nothing more to be learnt why shouldnt we marry at once on one point i am firm i will never return to that castle as miss power a nameless dread comes over me when i think of ita fear that some uncanny influence of the dead de stancys would drive me again from him o if it were to do that she murmured burying her face in her hands i really think it would be more than i could bear  very well said mrs goodman we will see what can be done i will write to mr wardlaw    iv  on a windy afternoon in november when more than two months had closed over the incidents previously recorded a number of farmers were sitting in a room of the lordquantockarms inn markton that was used for the weekly ordinary it was a long low apartment formed by the union of two or three smaller rooms with a bowwindow looking upon the street and at the present moment was pervaded by a blue fog from tobaccopipes and a temperature like that of a kiln the body of farmers who still sat on there was greater than usual owing to the cold air without the tables having been cleared of dinner for some time and their surface stamped with liquid circles by the feet of the numerous glasses  besides the farmers there were present several professional men of the town who found it desirable to dine here on marketdays for the opportunity it afforded them of increasing their practice among the agriculturists many of whom were men of large balances even luxurious livers who drove to market in elegant phaetons drawn by horses of supreme blood bone and action in a style never anticipated by their fathers when jogging thither in light carts or afoot with a butter basket on each arm  the buzz of groggy conversation was suddenly impinged on by the notes of a peal of bells from the tower hard by almost at the same instant the door of the room opened and there entered the landlord of the little inn at sleepinggreen drawing his supply of cordials from this superior house to which he was subject he came here at stated times like a prebendary to the cathedral of his diocesan afterwards retailing to his own humbler audience the sentiments which he had learnt of this but curiosity being awakened by the church bells the usual position was for the moment reversed and one of the farmers saluting him by name asked him the reason of their striking up at that time of day  my misess out yonder replied the rural landlord nodding sideways is coming home with her fancyman they have been agaying together this turk of a while in foreign partshere maidwhat with the wind and standing about my bloods as low as waterbring us a thimbleful of that that isnt gin and not far from it  it is true then that shes become mrs somerset indifferently asked a farmer in broadcloth tenant of an estate in quite another direction than hers as he contemplated the grain of the table immediately surrounding the foot of his glass  trueof course it is said havill who was also present in the tone of one who though sitting in this rubicund company was not of it i could have told you the truth of it any day these last five weeks  among those who had lent an ear was dairyman jinks an old gnarled character who wore a white fustian coat and yellow leggings the only man in the room who never dressed up in dark clothes for marketing he now asked married abroad was they and how long will a wedding abroad stand good for in this country  as long as a wedding at home  will it faith i didnt know how should i i thought it might be some new plan o folks for leasing women now they be so plentiful so as to get rid o em when the men be tired o em and hev spent all their money  he wont be able to spend her money said the landlord of sleepinggreen tis her very own personssettled upon the hairs of her head for ever  o nation then if i were the man i shouldnt care for such a oneeyed benefit as that said dairyman jinks turning away to listen to the talk on his other hand  is that true asked the gentlemanfarmer in broadcloth  it is sufficiently near the truth said havill there is nothing at all unusual in the arrangement it was only settled so to prevent any schemer making a beggar of her if somerset and she have any children which probably they will it will be theirs and what can a man want more besides there is a large portion of property left to her personal usequite as much as they can want oddly enough the curiosities and pictures of the castle which belonged to the de stancys are not restricted from sale they are hers to do what she likes with old power didnt care for articles that reminded him so much of his predecessors  hey said dairyman jinks turning back again having decided that the conversation on his right hand was after all the more interesting wellwhy cant em hire a travelling chap to touch up the picters into her own gaffers and gammers then theyd be worth sommat to her  ah here they are i thought so said havill who had been standing up at the window for the last few moments the ringers were told to begin as soon as the train signalled  as he spoke a carriage drew up to the hoteldoor followed by another with the maid and luggage the inmates crowded to the bowwindow except dairyman jinks who had become absorbed in his own reflections  what be they stopping here for asked one of the previous speakers  they are going to stay here tonight said havill they have come quite unexpectedly and the castle is in such a state of turmoil that there is not a single carpet down or room for them to use we shall get two or three in order by next week  two little people like them will be lost in the chammers of that wandering place satirized dairyman jinks they will be bound to have a randy every fortnight to keep the moth out of the furniture  by this time somerset was handing out the wife of his bosom and dairyman jinks went on thats no more miss power that was than my nieces daughter kezia is miss powerin short it is a different woman altogether  there is no mistake about the woman said the landlord it is her fur clothes that make her look so like a caterpillar on end well she is not a bad bargain as for captain de stancy hell fret his gizzard green  hes the man she ought to ha married declared the farmer in broadcloth as the world goes she ought to have been lady de stancy she gave up her chapelgoing and you might have thought she would have given up her first young man but she stuck to him though by all accounts he would soon have been interested in another party  tis womans nature to be false except to a man and mans nature to be true except to a woman said the landlord of sleepinggreen however alls well that ends well and i have something else to think of than newmarried couples saying which the speaker moved off and the others returned to their seats the young pair who had been their theme vanishing through the hotel into some private paradise to rest and dine  by this time their arrival had become known and a crowd soon gathered outside acquiring audacity with continuance there raising a hurrah the group would not leave till somerset had showed himself on the balcony above and then declined to go away till paula also had appeared when remarking that her husband seemed a quiet young man enough and would make a very good borough member when their present one misbehaved himself the assemblage goodhumouredly dispersed    among those whose ears had been reached by the hurrahs of these idlers was a man in silence and solitude far out of the town he was leaning over a gate that divided two meads in a watery level between stancy castle and markton he turned his head for a few seconds then continued his contemplative gaze towards the towers of the castle visible over the trees as far as was possible in the leaden gloom of the november eve the military form of the solitary lounger was recognizable as that of sir william de stancy notwithstanding the failing light and his attitude of so resting his elbows on the gate that his hands enclosed the greater part of his face  the scene was inexpressibly cheerless no other human creature was apparent and the only sounds audible above the wind were those of the trickling streams which distributed the water over the meadow a heron had been standing in one of these rivulets about twenty yards from the officer and they vied with each other in stillness till the bird suddenly rose and flew off to the plantation in which it was his custom to pass the night with others of his tribe de stancy saw the heron rise and seemed to imagine the creatures departure without a supper to be owing to the increasing darkness but in another minute he became conscious that the heron had been disturbed by sounds too distant to reach his own ears at the time they were nearer now and there came along under the hedge a young man known to de stancy exceedingly well  ah he said listlessly you have ventured back  yes captain why do you walk out here  the bells began ringing because she and he were expected and my thoughts naturally dragged me this way thank heaven the battery leaves markton in a few days and then the precious place will know me no more  i have heard of it turning to where the dim lines of the castle rose he continued well there it stands  and i am not in it  they are not in it yet either  they soon will be  wellwhat tune is that you were humming captain  all is lost now replied the captain grimly  o no you have got me and i am a treasure to any man i have another match in my eye for you and shall get you well settled yet if you keep yourself respectable so thank god and take courage  ah willyou are a flippant young foolwise in your own conceit i say it to my sorrow twas your dishonesty spoilt all that lady would have been my wife by fair dealingtime was all i required but base attacks on a mans character never deserve to win and if i had once been certain that you had made them my course would have been very different both towards you and others but why should i talk to you about this if i cared an atom what becomes of you i would take you in hand severely enough not caring i leave you alone to go to the devil your own way  thank you kindly captain well since you have spoken plainly i will do the same we de stancys are a wornout old partythats the long and the short of it we represent conditions of life that have had their dayespecially me our one remaining chance was an alliance with new aristocrats and we have failed we are past and done for our line has had five hundred years of glory and we ought to be content enfin les renards se trouvent chez le pelletier  speak for yourself young consequence and leave the destinies of old families to respectable philosophers this fiasco is the direct result of evil conduct and of nothing else at all i have managed badly i countenanced you too far when i saw your impish tendencies i should have forsworn the alliance  dont sting me captain what i have told you is true as for my conduct cat will after kind you know you should have held your tongue on the wedding morning and have let me take my chance  is that all i get for saving you from jail gadi alone am the sufferer and feel i am alone the fool come off with youi never want to see you any more  part we will thentill we meet again it will be a light night hereabouts i think this evening  a very dark one for me  nevertheless i think it will be a light night au revoir  dare went his way and after a while de stancy went his both were soon lost in the shades    v  the castle tonight was as gloomy as the meads as havill had explained the habitable rooms were just now undergoing a scour and the main block of buildings was empty even of the few servants who had been retained they having for comforts sake taken up their quarters in the detached rooms adjoining the entrance archway hence not a single light shone from the lonely windows at which ivy leaves tapped like woodpeckers moved by gusts that were numerous and contrary rather than violent within the walls all was silence chaos and obscurity till towards eleven oclock when the thick immovable cloud that had dulled the daytime broke into a scudding fleece through which the moon forded her way as a nebulous spot of watery white sending light enough though of a rayless kind into the castle chambers to show the confusion that reigned there  at this time an eye might have noticed a figure flitting in and about those draughty apartments and making no more noise in so doing than a puff of wind its motion hither and thither was rapid but methodical its bearing absorbed yet cautious though it ran more or less through all the principal rooms the chief scene of its operations was the long gallery overlooking the pleasance which was covered by an ornamental woodandplaster roof and contained a whole throng of family portraits besides heavy old cabinets and the like the portraits which were of value as works of art were smaller than these and hung in adjoining rooms  the manifest occupation of the figure was that of removing these small and valuable pictures from other chambers to the gallery in which the rest were hung and piling them in a heap in the midst included in the group were nine by sir peter lely five by vandyck four by cornelius jansen one by salvator rosa remarkable as being among the few english portraits ever painted by that master many by kneller and two by romney apparently by accident the light being insufficient to distinguish them from portraits the figure also brought a raffaelle virginandchild a magnificent tintoretto a titian and a giorgione  on these was laid a large collection of enamelled miniature portraits of the same illustrious line afterwards tapestries and cushions embroidered with the initials de s and next the cradle presented by charles the first to the contemporary de stancy mother till at length there arose in the middle of the floor a huge heap containing most of what had been personal and peculiar to members of the de stancy family as distinct from general furniture  then the figure went from door to door and threw open each that was unfastened it next proceeded to a room on the ground floor at present fitted up as a carpenters shop and kneedeep in shavings an armful of these was added to the pile of objects in the gallery a window at each end of the gallery was opened causing a brisk draught along the walls and then the activity of the figure ceased and it was seen no more  five minutes afterwards a light shone upon the lawn from the windows of the long gallery which glowed with more brilliancy than it had known in the meridian of its caroline splendours thereupon the framed gentleman in the lace collar seemed to open his eyes more widely he with the flowing locks and turnup mustachios to part his lips he in the armour who was so much like captain de stancy to shake the plates of his mail with suppressed laughter the lady with the threestringed pearl necklace and vast expanse of neck to nod with satisfaction and triumphantly signify to her adjoining husband that this was a meet and glorious end  the flame increased and blown upon by the wind roared round the pictures the tapestries and the cradle up to the plaster ceiling and through it into the forest of oak timbers above    the best sittingroom at the lordquantockarms in markton was as cosy this evening as a room can be that lacks the minuter furniture on which cosiness so largely depends by the fire sat paula and somerset the former with a shawl round her shoulders to keep off the draught which despite the curtains forced its way in on this gusty night through the windows opening upon the balcony paula held a letter in her hand the contents of which formed the subject of their conversation happy as she was in her general situation there was for the nonce a tear in her eye   my ever dear paula ran the letteryour last letter has just reached me and i have followed your account of your travels and intentions with more interest than i can tell you who know me need no assurance of this at the present moment however i am in the whirl of a change that has resulted from a resolution taken some time ago but concealed from almost everybody till now why well i will ownfrom cowardicefear lest i should be reasoned out of my plan i am going to steal from the world paula from the social world for whose gaieties and ambitions i never had much liking and whose circles i have not the ability to grace my home and restingplace till the great rest comes is with the protestant sisterhood at  whatever shortcomings may be found in such a community i believe that i shall be happier there than in any other place  whatever you may think of my judgment in taking this step i can assure you that i have not done it without consideration my reasons are good and my determination is unalterable but my own very best friend and more than sister dont think that i mean to leave my love and friendship for you behind me no paula you will always be with me and i believe that if an increase in what i already feel for you be possible it will be furthered by the retirement and meditation i shall enjoy in my secluded home my heart is very full deartoo full to write more god bless you and your husband you must come and see me there i have not so many friends that i can afford to lose you who have been so kind i write this with the fellowpen to yours that you gave me when we went to budmouth together goodbyeever your own sister charlotte   paula had first read this through silently and now in reading it a second time aloud to somerset her voice faltered and she wept outright i had been expecting her to live with us always she said through her tears and to think she should have decided to do this  it is a pity certainly said somerset gently she was genuine if anybody ever was and simple as she was true  i am the more sorry paula presently resumed because of a little plan i had been thinking of with regard to her you know that the pictures and curiosities of the castle are not included in the things i cannot touch or impeach or whatever it is they are our own to do what we like with my father felt in devising the estate that however interesting to the de stancys those objects might be they did not concern uswere indeed rather in the way having been come by so strangely through mr wilkins though too valuable to be treated lightly now i was going to suggest that we would not sell themindeed i could not bear to do such a thing with what had belonged to charlottes forefathersbut to hand them over to her as a gift either to keep for herself or to pass on to her brother as she should choose now i fear there is no hope of it and yet i shall never like to see them in the house  it can be done still i should think she can accept them for her brother when he settles without absolutely taking them into her own possession  it would be a kind of generosity which hardly amounts to more than justice although they were purchased from a recusant usurper to a dear friendnot that i am a usurper exactly well from a representative of the new aristocracy of internationality to a representative of the old aristocracy of exclusiveness  what do you call yourself paula since you are not of your fathers creed  i suppose i am what poor mr woodwell saidby the way we must call and see himsomething or other thats in revelation neither cold nor hot but of course thats a subspeciesi may be a lukewarm anything what i really am as far as i know is one of that body to whom lukewarmth is not an accident but a provisional necessity till they see a little more clearly she had crossed over to his side and pulling his head towards her whispered a name in his ear  why mr woodwell said you were that too you carry your beliefs very comfortably i shall be glad when enthusiasm is come again  i am going to revise and correct my beliefs one of these days when i have thought a little further she suddenly breathed a sigh and added how transitory our best emotions are in talking of myself i am heartlessly forgetting charlotte and becoming happy again i wont be happy tonight for her sake  a few minutes after this their attention was attracted by a noise of footsteps running along the street then a heavy tramp of horses and lumbering of wheels other feet were heard scampering at intervals and soon somebody ascended the staircase and approached their door the head waiter appeared  maam stancy castle is all afire said the waiter breathlessly  somerset jumped up drew aside the curtains and stepped into the bowwindow right before him rose a blaze the window looked upon the street and along the turnpike road to the very hill on which the castle stood the keep being visible in the daytime above the trees here rose the light which appeared little further off than a stones throw instead of nearly three miles every curl of the smoke and every wave of the flame was distinct and somerset fancied he could hear the crackling  paula had risen from her seat and joined him in the window where she heard some people in the street saying that the servants were all safe after which she gave her mind more fully to the material aspects of the catastrophe  the whole town was now rushing off to the scene of the conflagration which shining straight along the street showed the burgesses running figures distinctly upon the illumined road paula was quite ready to act upon somersets suggestion that they too should hasten to the spot and a fly was got ready in a few minutes with lapse of time paula evinced more anxiety as to the fate of her castle and when they had driven as near as it was prudent to do they dismounted and went on foot into the throng of people which was rapidly gathering from the town and surrounding villages among the faces they recognized mr woodwell havill the architect the rector of the parish the curate and many others known to them by sight these as soon as they saw the young couple came forward with words of condolence imagining them to have been burnt out of bed and vied with each other in offering them a lodging somerset explained where they were staying and that they required no accommodation paula interrupting with o my poor horses what has become of them  the fire is not near the stables said mr woodwell it broke out in the body of the building the horses however are driven into the field  i can assure you you need not be alarmed madam said havill the chief constable is here and the two town engines and i am doing all i can the castle engine unfortunately is out of repair  somerset and paula then went on to another point of view near the gymnasium where they could not be seen by the crowd threequarters of a mile off on their left hand the powerful irradiation fell upon the brick chapel in which somerset had first seen the woman who now stood beside him as his wife it was the only object visible in that direction the dull hills and trees behind failing to catch the light she significantly pointed it out to somerset who knew her meaning and they turned again to the more serious matter  it had long been apparent that in the face of such a wind all the pigmy appliances that the populace could bring to act upon such a mass of combustion would be unavailing as much as could burn that night was burnt while some of that which would not burn crumbled and fell as a formless heap whence new flames towered up and inclined to the northeast so far as to singe the trees of the park the thicker walls of norman date remained unmoved partly because of their thickness and partly because in them stone vaults took the place of wood floors  the tower clock kept manfully going till it had struck one its face smiling out from the smoke as if nothing were the matter after which hour something fell down inside and it went no more  cunningham haze with his body of men was devoted in his attention and came up to say a word to our two spectators from time to time towards four oclock the flames diminished and feeling thoroughly weary somerset and paula remained no longer returning to markton as they had come  on their journey they pondered and discussed what course it would be best to pursue in the circumstances gradually deciding not to attempt rebuilding the castle unless they were absolutely compelled true the main walls were still standing as firmly as ever but there was a feeling common to both of them that it would be well to make an opportunity of a misfortune and leaving the edifice in ruins start their married life in a mansion of independent construction hard by the old one unencumbered with the ghosts of an unfortunate line  we will build a new house from the ground eclectic in style we will remove the ashes charred wood and so on from the ruin and plant more ivy the winter rains will soon wash the unsightly smoke from the walls and stancy castle will be beautiful in its decay you paula will be yourself again and recover if you have not already from the warp given to your mind according to woodwell by the mediaevalism of that place  and be a perfect representative of the modern spirit she inquired representing neither the senses and understanding nor the heart and imagination but what a finished writer calls the imaginative reason  yes for since it is rather in your line you may as well keep straight on  very well ill keep straight on and well build a new house beside the ruin and show the modern spirit for evermore but george i wish and paula repressed a sigh  well  i wish my castle wasnt burnt and i wish you were a de stancy
