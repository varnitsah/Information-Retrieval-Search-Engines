1907 1908 by joseph conrad    list of illustrations  you will fight no more duels now frontispiece  bowing before a sylphlike form reclining on a couch  the angry clash of arms filled that prim garden  you take the nearest brute colonel dhubert     i  napoleon the first whose career had the quality of a duel against the whole of europe disliked duelling between the officers of his army the great military emperor was not a swashbuckler and had little respect for tradition  nevertheless a story of duelling which became a legend in the army runs through the epic of imperial wars to the surprise and admiration of their fellows two officers like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or paint the lily pursued their private contest through the years of universal carnage they were officers of cavalry and their connection with the highspirited but fanciful animal which carries men into battle seems particularly appropriate it would be difficult to imagine for heroes of this legend two officers of infantry of the line for example whose fantasy is tamed by much walking exercise and whose valour necessarily must be of a more plodding kind as to artillery or engineers whose heads are kept cool on a diet of mathematics it is simply unthinkable  the names of the two officers were feraud and dhubert and they were both lieutenants in a regiment of hussars but not in the same regiment  feraud was doing regimental work but lieutenant dhubert had the good fortune to be attached to the person of the general commanding the division as officier dordonnance it was in strasbourg and in this agreeable and important garrison they were enjoying greatly a short interval of peace they were enjoying it though both intensely warlike because it was a swordsharpening firelockcleaning peace dear to a military heart and undamaging to military prestige inasmuch that no one believed in its sincerity or duration  under those historical circumstances so favourable to the proper appreciation of military leisure lieutenant dhubert could have been seen one fine afternoon making his way along the street of a cheerful suburb towards lieutenant ferauds quarters which were in a private house with a garden at the back belonging to an old maiden lady  his knock at the door was answered instantly by a young maid in alsatian costume her fresh complexion and her long eyelashes which she lowered modestly at the sight of the tall officer caused lieutenant dhubert who was accessible to esthetic impressions to relax the cold onduty expression of his face at the same time he observed that the girl had over her arm a pair of hussars breeches red with a blue stripe  lieutenant feraud at home he inquired benevolently  oh no sir he went out at six this morning  and the little maid tried to close the door but lieutenant dhubert opposing this move with gentle firmness stepped into the anteroom jingling his spurs  come my dear you dont mean to say he has not been home since six oclock this morning  saying these words lieutenant dhubert opened without ceremony the door of a room so comfortable and neatly ordered that only from internal evidence in the shape of boots uniforms and military accoutrements did he acquire the conviction that it was lieutenant ferauds room and he saw also that lieutenant feraud was not at home the truthful maid had followed him and looked up inquisitively  hm said lieutenant dhubert greatly disappointed for he had already visited all the haunts where a lieutenant of hussars could be found of a fine afternoon and do you happen to know my dear why he went out at six this morning  no she answered readily he came home late at night and snored i heard him when i got up at five then he dressed himself in his oldest uniform and went out service i suppose  service not a bit of it cried lieutenant dhubert learn my child that he went out so early to fight a duel with a civilian  she heard the news without a quiver of her dark eyelashes it was very obvious that the actions of lieutenant feraud were generally above criticism she only looked up for a moment in mute surprise and lieutenant dhubert concluded from this absence of emotion that she must have seen lieutenant feraud since the morning he looked around the room  come he insisted with confidential familiarity hes perhaps somewhere in the house now  she shook her head  so much the worse for him continued lieutenant dhubert in a tone of anxious conviction but he has been home this morning  this time the pretty maid nodded slightly  he has cried lieutenant dhubert and went out again what for couldnt he keep quietly indoors what a lunatic my dear child  lieutenant dhuberts natural kindness of disposition and strong sense of comradeship helped his powers of observation which generally were not remarkable he changed his tone to a most insinuating softness and gazing at the hussars breeches hanging over the arm of the girl he appealed to the interest she took in lieutenant ferauds comfort and happiness he was pressing and persuasive he used his eyes which were large and fine with excellent effect his anxiety to get hold at once of lieutenant feraud for lieutenant ferauds own good seemed so genuine that at last it overcame the girls discretion unluckily she had not much to tell lieutenant feraud had returned home shortly before ten had walked straight into his room and had thrown himself on his bed to resume his slumbers she had heard him snore rather louder than before far into the afternoon then he got up put on his best uniform and went out that was all she knew  she raised her candid eyes up to lieutenant dhubert who stared at her incredulously  its incredible gone parading the town in his best uniform my dear child dont you know that he ran that civilian through this morning clean through as you spit a hare  she accepted this gruesome intelligence without any signs of distress but she pressed her lips together thoughtfully  he isnt parading the town she remarked in a low tone far from it  the civilians family is making an awful row continued lieutenant dhubert pursuing his train of thought and the general is very angry its one of the best families in the town feraud ought to have kept close at least  what will the general do to him inquired the girl anxiously  he wont have his head cut off to be sure answered lieutenant dhubert but his conduct is positively indecent hes making no end of trouble for himself by this sort of bravado  but he isnt parading the town the maid murmured again  why yes now i think of it i havent seen him anywhere what on earth has he done with himself  hes gone to pay a call suggested the maid after a moment of silence  lieutenant dhubert was surprised a call do you mean a call on a lady the cheek of the man but how do you know this  without concealing her womans scorn for the denseness of the masculine mind the pretty maid reminded him that lieutenant feraud had arrayed himself in his best uniform before going out he had also put on his newest dolman she added in a tone as if this conversation were getting on her nerves and turned away brusquely lieutenant dhubert without questioning the accuracy of the implied deduction did not see that it advanced him much on his official quest for his quest after lieutenant feraud had an official character he did not know any of the women this fellow who had run a man through in the morning was likely to call on in the afternoon the two officers knew each other but slightly he bit his gloved finger in perplexity  call he exclaimed call on the devil the girl with her back to him and folding the hussars breeches on a chair said with a vexed little laugh  oh no on madame de lionne lieutenant dhubert whistled softly madame de lionne the wife of a high official had a wellknown salon and some pretensions to sensibility and elegance the husband was a civilian and old but the society of the salon was young and military for the greater part lieutenant dhubert had whistled not because the idea of pursuing lieutenant feraud into that very salon was in the least distasteful to him but because having but lately arrived in strasbourg he had not the time as yet to get an introduction to madame de lionne and what was that swashbuckler feraud doing there he did not seem the sort of man who  are you certain of what you say asked lieutenant dhubert  the girl was perfectly certain without turning round to look at him she explained that the coachman of their nextdoor neighbours knew the maitredh√¥tel of madame de lionne in this way she got her information and she was perfectly certain in giving this assurance she sighed lieutenant feraud called there nearly every afternoon  ah bah exclaimed dhubert ironically his opinion of madame de lionne went down several degrees lieutenant feraud did not seem to him specially worthy of attention on the part of a woman with a reputation for sensibility and elegance but there was no saying at bottom they were all alikevery practical rather than idealistic lieutenant dhubert however did not allow his mind to dwell on these considerations by thunder he reflected aloud the general goes there sometimes if he happens to find the fellow making eyes at the lady there will be the devil to pay our general is not a very accommodating person i can tell you  go quickly then dont stand here now ive told you where he is cried the girl colouring to the eyes  thanks my dear i dont know what i would have done without you  after manifesting his gratitude in an aggressive way which at first was repulsed violently and then submitted to with a sudden and still more repellent indifference lieutenant dhubert took his departure  he clanked and jingled along the streets with a martial swagger to run a comrade to earth in a drawingroom where he was not known did not trouble him in the least a uniform is a social passport his position as officier dordonnance of the general added to his assurance moreover now he knew where to find lieutenant feraud he had no option it was a service matter  madame de lionnes house had an excellent appearance a man in livery opening the door of a large drawingroom with a waxed floor shouted his name and stood aside to let him pass it was a reception day the ladies wearing hats surcharged with a profusion of feathers sheathed in clinging white gowns from their armpits to the tips of their low satin shoes looked sylphlike and cool in a great display of bare necks and arms the men who talked with them on the contrary were arrayed heavily in ample coloured garments with stiff collars up to their ears and thick sashes round their waists lieutenant dhubert made his unabashed way across the room and bowing low before a sylphlike form reclining on a couch offered his apologies for this intrusion which nothing could excuse but the extreme urgency of the service order he had to communicate to his comrade feraud he proposed to himself to come presently in a more regular manner and beg forgiveness for interrupting this interesting conversation  a bare arm was extended to him with gracious condescension even before he had finished speaking he pressed the hand respectfully to his lips and made the mental remark that it was bony madame de lionne was a blonde with too fine a skin and a long face  cest √ßa she said with an ethereal smile disclosing a set of large teeth come this evening to plead for your forgiveness  i will not fail madame  meantime lieutenant feraud splendid in his new dolman and the extremely polished boots of his calling sat on a chair within a foot of the couch and one hand propped on his thigh with the other twirled his moustache to a point without uttering a sound at a significant glance from dhubert he rose without alacrity and followed him into the recess of a window  what is it you want with me he asked in a tone of annoyance which astonished not a little the other lieutenant dhubert could not imagine that in the innocence of his heart and simplicity of his conscience lieutenant feraud took a view of his duel in which neither remorse nor yet a rational apprehension of consequences had any place though lieutenant feraud had no clear recollection how the quarrel had originated it was begun in an establishment where beer and wine are drunk late at night he had not the slightest doubt of being himself the outraged party he had secured two experienced friends or his seconds everything had been done according to the rules governing that sort of adventure and a duel is obviously fought for the purpose of someone being at least hurt if not killed outright the civilian got hurt that also was in order lieutenant feraud was perfectly tranquil but lieutenant dhubert mistook this simple attitude for affectation and spoke with some heat  i am directed by the general to give you the order to go at once to your quarters and remain there under close arrest  it was now the turn of lieutenant feraud to be astonished  what the devil are you telling me there he murmured faintly and fell into such profound wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of lieutenant dhubert the two officersone tall with an interesting face and a moustache the colour of ripe corn the other short and sturdy with a hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hairapproached the mistress of the house to take their leave madame de lionne a woman of eclectic taste smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an equal share of interest madame de lionne took her delight in the infinite variety of the human species all the eyes in the drawingroom followed the departing officers one strutting the other striding with curiosity when the door had closed after them one or two men who had already heard of the duel imparted the information to the sylphlike ladies who received it with little shrieks of humane concern  meantime the two hussars walked side by side lieutenant feraud trying to fathom the hidden reason of things which in this instance eluded the grasp of his intellect lieutenant dhubert feeling bored by the part he had to play because the generals instructions were that he should see personally that lieutenant feraud carried out his orders to the letter and at once  the chief seems to know this animal he thought eyeing his companion whose round face the round eyes and even the twistedup jet black little moustache seemed animated by his mental exasperation before the incomprehensible and aloud he observed rather reproachfully the general is in a devilish fury with you  lieutenant feraud stopped short on the edge of the pavement and cried in the accents of unmistakable sincerity what on earth for the innocence of the fiery gascon soul was depicted in the manner in which he seized his head in both his hands as if to prevent it bursting with perplexity  for the duel said lieutenant dhubert curtly he was annoyed greatly by this sort of perverse fooling  the duel the  lieutenant feraud passed from one paroxysm of astonishment into another he dropped his hands and walked on slowly trying to reconcile this information with the state of his own feelings it was impossible he burst out indignantly  was i to let that sauerkrauteating civilian wipe his boots on the uniform of the seventh hussars  lieutenant dhubert could not be altogether unsympathetic toward that sentiment this little fellow is a lunatic he thought to himself but there is something in what he says  of course i dont know how far you were justified he said soothingly and the general himself may not be exactly informed a lot of people have been deafening him with their lamentations  ah he is not exactly informed mumbled lieutenant feraud walking faster and faster as his choler at the injustice of his fate began to rise he is not exactly and he orders me under close arrest with god knows what afterward  dont excite yourself like this remonstrated the other that young mans people are very influential you know and it looks bad enough on the face of it the general had to take notice of their complaint at once i dont think he means to be oversevere with you it is best for you to be kept out of sight for a while  i am very much obliged to the general muttered lieutenant feraud through his teeth  and perhaps you would say i ought to be grateful to you too for the trouble you have taken to hunt me up in the drawingroom of a lady who  frankly interrupted lieutenant dhubert with an innocent laugh i think you ought to be i had no end of trouble to find out where you were it wasnt exactly the place for you to disport yourself in under the circumstances if the general had caught you there making eyes at the goddess of the temple oh my word he hates to be bothered with complaints against his officers you know and it looked uncommonly like sheer bravado  the two officers had arrived now at the street door of lieutenant ferauds lodgings the latter turned toward his companion lieutenant dhubert he said i have something to say to you which cant be said very well in the street you cant refuse to come in  the pretty maid had opened the door lieutenant feraud brushed past her brusquely and she raised her scared questioning eyes to lieutenant dhubert who could do nothing but shrug his shoulders slightly as he followed with marked reluctance  in his room lieutenant feraud unhooked the clasp flung his new dolman on the bed and folding his arms across his chest turned to the other hussar  do you imagine i am a man to submit tamely to injustice he inquired in a boisterous voice  oh do be reasonable remonstrated lieutenant dhubert  i am reasonable i am perfectly reasonable retorted the other ominously lowering his voice i cant call the general to account for his behaviour but you are going to answer to me for yours  i cant listen to this nonsense murmured lieutenant dhubert making a slightly contemptuous grimace  you call that nonsense it seems to me perfectly clear unless you dont understand french  what on earth do you mean  i mean screamed suddenly lieutenant feraud to cut off your ears to teach you not to disturb me orders or no orders when i am talking to a lady  a profound silence followed this mad declarationand through the open window lieutenant dhubert heard the little birds singing sanely in the garden he said coldly  why if you take that tone of course i will hold myself at your disposal whenever you are at liberty to attend to this affair but i dont think you will cut off my ears  i am going to attend to it at once declared lieutenant feraud with extreme truculence if you are thinking of displaying your airs and graces tonight in madame de lionnes salon you are very much mistaken  really said lieutenant dhubert who was beginning to feel irritated you are an impracticable sort of fellow the generals orders to me were to put you under arrest not to carve you into small pieces goodmorning turning his back on the little gascon who always sober in his potations was as though born intoxicated with the sunshine of his wineripening country the northman who could drink hard on occasion but was born sober under the watery skies of picardy made calmly for the door hearing however the unmistakable sound behind his back of a sword drawn from the scabbard he had no option but to stop  devil take this mad southerner he thought spinning round and surveying with composure the warlike posture of lieutenant feraud with the unsheathed sword in his hand  at once at once stuttered feraud beside himself  you had my answer said the other keeping his temper very well  at first he had been only vexed and somewhat amused but now his face got clouded he was asking himself seriously how he could manage to get away obviously it was impossible to run from a man with a sword and as to fighting him it seemed completely out of the question  he waited awhile then said exactly what was in his heart  drop this i wont fight you now i wont be made ridiculous  ah you wont hissed the gascon i suppose you prefer to be made infamous do you hear what i say infamous infamous infamous he shrieked raising and falling on his toes and getting very red in the face lieutenant dhubert on the contrary became very pale at the sound of the unsavoury word then flushed pink to the roots of his fair hair  but you cant go out to fight you are under arrest you lunatic he objected with angry scorn  theres the garden its big enough to lay out your long carcass in spluttered out lieutenant feraud with such ardour that somehow the anger of the cooler man subsided  this is perfectly absurd he said glad enough to think he had found a way out of it for the moment we will never get any of our comrades to serve as seconds its preposterous  seconds damn the seconds we dont want any seconds dont you worry about any seconds i will send word to your friends to come and bury you when i am done this is no time for ceremonies and if you want any witnesses ill send word to the old girl to put her head out of a window at the back stay theres the gardener hell do hes as deaf as a post but he has two eyes in his head come along i will teach you my staff officer that the carrying about of a generals orders is not always childs play  while thus discoursing he had unbuckled his empty scabbard he sent it flying under the bed and lowering the point of the sword brushed past the perplexed lieutenant dhubert crying follow me directly he had flung open the door a faint shriek was heard and the pretty maid who had been listening at the keyhole staggered backward putting the backs of her hands over her eyes he didnt seem to see her but as he was crossing the anteroom she ran after him and seized his left arm he shook her off and then she rushed upon lieutenant dhubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform  wretched man she sobbed despairingly is this what you wanted to find him for  let me go entreated lieutenant dhubert trying to disengage himself gently its like being in a madhouse he protested with exasperation do let me go i wont do him any harm  a fiendish laugh from lieutenant feraud commented that assurance come along he cried impatiently with a stamp of his foot  and lieutenant dhubert did follow he could do nothing else but in vindication of his sanity it must be recorded that as he passed out of the anteroom the notion of opening the street door and bolting out presented itself to this brave youth only of course to be instantly dismissed for he felt sure that the other would pursue him without shame or compunction and the prospect of an officer of hussars being chased along the street by another officer of hussars with a naked sword could not be for a moment entertained therefore he followed into the garden behind them the girl tottered out too with ashy lips and wild scared eyes she surrendered to a dreadful curiosity she had also a vague notion of rushing if need be between lieutenant feraud and death  the deaf gardener utterly unconscious of approaching footsteps went on watering his flowers till lieutenant feraud thumped him on the back beholding suddenly an infuriated man flourishing a big sabre the old chap trembling in all his limbs dropped the watering pot at once lieutenant feraud kicked it away with great animosity then seizing the gardener by the throat backed him against a tree and held him there shouting in his ear  stay here and look on you understand youve got to look on dont dare budge from the spot  lieutenant dhubert coming slowly down the walk unclasped his dolman with undisguised reluctance even then with his hand already on his sword he hesitated to draw till a roar en garde fichtre what do you think you came here for and the rush of his adversary forced him to put himself as quickly as possible in a posture of defence  the angry clash of arms filled that prim garden which hitherto had known no more warlike sound than the click of clipping shears and presently the upper part of an old ladys body was projected out of a window upstairs she flung her arms above her white cap and began scolding in a thin cracked voice the gardener remained glued to the tree looking on his toothless mouth open in idiotic astonishment and a little farther up the walk the pretty girl as if held by a spell ran to and fro on a small grass plot wringing her hands and muttering crazily she did not rush between the combatants the onslaughts of lieutenant feraud were so fierce that her heart failed her  lieutenant dhubert his faculties concentrated upon defence needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes of his adversary twice already he had had to break ground  illustration 028jpg the angry clash of arms filled that prim garden  it bothered him to feel his foothold made insecure by the round dry gravel of the path rolling under the hard soles of his boots this was most unsuitable ground he thought keeping a watchful narrowed gaze shaded by long eyelashes upon the fiery staring eyeballs of his thickset adversary this absurd affair would ruin his reputation of a sensible steady promising young officer it would damage at any rate his immediate prospects and lose him the good will of his general these worldly preoccupations were no doubt misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment for a duel whether regarded as a ceremony in the cult of honour or even when regrettably casual and reduced in its moral essence to a distinguished form of manly sport demands perfect singleness of intention a homicidal austerity of mood on the other hand this vivid concern for the future in a man occupied in keeping sudden death at swords length from his breast had not a bad effect inasmuch as it began to rouse the slow anger of lieutenant dhubert some seventy seconds had elapsed since they had crossed steel and lieutenant dhubert had to break ground again in order to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet of specimens the result was that misapprehending the motive lieutenant feraud giving vent to triumphant snarls pressed his attack with renewed vigour  this enraged animal thought dhubert will have me against the wall directly he imagined himself much closer to the house than he was and he dared not turn his head such an act under the circumstances being equivalent to deliberate suicide it seemed to him that he was keeping his adversary off with his eyes much more than with his point lieutenant feraud crouched and bounded with a tigerish ferocious agilityenough to trouble the stoutest heart but what was more appalling than the fury of a wild beast accomplishing in all innocence of heart a natural function was the fixity of savage purpose man alone is capable of displaying lieutenant dhubert in the midst of his worldly preoccupations perceived it at last it was an absurd and damaging affair to be drawn into but whatever silly intention the fellow had started with it was clear that by this time he meant to killnothing else he meant it with an intensity of will utterly beyond the inferior faculties of a tiger  as is the case with constitutionally brave men the full view of the danger interested lieutenant dhubert and directly he got properly interested the length of his arm and the coolness of his head told in his favour it was the turn of lieutenant feraud to recoil he did this with a bloodcurdling grunt of baffled rage he made a swift feint and then rushed straight forward  ah you would would you lieutenant dhubert exclaimed mentally to himself the combat had lasted nearly two minutes time enough for any man to get embittered apart from the merits of the quarrel and all at once it was over trying to close breast to breast under his adversarys guard lieutenant feraud received a slash on his shortened arm he did not feel it in the least but it checked his rush and his feet slipping on the gravel he fell backward with great violence the shock jarred his boiling brain into the perfect quietude of insensibility simultaneously with his fall the pretty servant girl shrieked piercingly but the old maiden lady at the window ceased her scolding and with great presence of mind began to cross herself  in the first moment seeing his adversary lying perfectly still his face to the sky and his toes turned up lieutenant dhubert thought he had killed him outright the impression of having slashed hard enough to cut his man clean in two abode with him for awhile in an exaggerated impression of the right good will he had put into the blow he went down on his knees by the side of the prostrate body discovering that not even the arm was severed a slight sense of disappointment mingled with the feeling of relief but indeed he did not want the death of that sinner the affair was ugly enough as it stood lieutenant dhubert addressed himself at once to the task of stopping the bleeding in this task it was his fate to be ridiculously impeded by the pretty maid the girl filling the garden with cries for help flung herself upon his defenceless back and twining her fingers in his hair tugged at his head why she should choose to hinder him at this precise moment he could not in the least understand he did not try it was all like a very wicked and harassing dream twice to save himself from being pulled over he had to rise and throw her off he did this stoically without a word kneeling down again at once to go on with his work but when the work was done he seized both her arms and held them down her cap was half off her face was red her eyes glared with crazy boldness he looked mildly into them while she called him a wretch a traitor and a murderer many times in succession this did not annoy him so much as the conviction that in her scurries she had managed to scratch his face abundantly ridicule would be added to the scandal of the story he imagined it making its way through the garrison through the whole army with every possible distortion of motive and sentiment and circumstance spreading a doubt upon the sanity of his conduct and the distinction of his taste even into the very bosom of his honourable family it was all very well for that fellow feraud who had no connections no family to speak of and no quality but courage which anyhow was a matter of course and possessed by every single trooper in the whole mass of french cavalry still holding the wrists of the girl in a strong grip lieutenant dhubert looked over his shoulder lieutenant feraud had opened his eyes he did not move like a man just waking from a deep sleep he stared with a drowsy expression at the evening sky  lieutenant dhuberts urgent shouts to the old gardener produced no effectnot so much as to make him shut his toothless mouth then he remembered that the man was stone deaf all that time the girl attempting to free her wrists struggled not with maidenly coyness but like a sort of pretty dumb fury not even refraining from kicking his shins now and then he continued to hold her as if in a vice his instinct telling him that were he to let her go she would fly at his eyes but he was greatly humiliated by his position at last she gave up more exhausted than appeased he feared nevertheless he attempted to get out of this wicked dream by way of negotiation  listen to me he said as calmly as he could will you promise to run for a surgeon if i let you go  he was profoundly afflicted when panting sobbing and choking she made it clear that she would do nothing of the kind on the contrary her incoherent intentions were to remain in the garden and fight with her nails and her teeth for the protection of the prostrate man this was horrible  my dear child he cried in despair is it possible that you think me capable of murdering a wounded adversary is it be quiet you little wildcat you he added  she struggled a thick sleepy voice said behind him  what are you up to with that girl  lieutenant feraud had raised himself on his good arm he was looking sleepily at his other arm at the mess of blood on his uniform at a small red pool on the ground at his sabre lying a foot away on the path then he laid himself down gently again to think it all out as far as a thundering headache would permit of mental operations  lieutenant dhubert released the girls wrists she flew away down the path and crouched wildly by the side of the vanquished warrior the shades of night were falling on the little trim garden with this touching group whence proceeded low murmurs of sorrow and compassion with other feeble sounds of a different character as if an imperfectly awake invalid were trying to swear lieutenant dhubert went away too exasperated to care what would happen  he passed through the silent house and congratulated himself upon the dusk concealing his gory hands and scratched face from the passersby but this story could by no means be concealed he dreaded the discredit and ridicule above everything and was painfully aware of sneaking through the back streets to his quarters in one of these quiet side streets the sounds of a flute coming out of the open window of a lighted upstairs room in a modest house interrupted his dismal reflections it was being played with a deliberate persevering virtuosity and through the fioritures of the tune one could even hear the thump of the foot beating time on the floor  lieutenant dhubert shouted a name which was that of an army surgeon whom he knew fairly well the sounds of the flute ceased and the musician appeared at the window his instrument still in his hand peering into the street  who calls you dhubert what brings you this way  he did not like to be disturbed when he was playing the flute he was a man whose hair had turned gray already in the thankless task of tying up wounds on battlefields where others reaped advancement and glory  i want you to go at once and see feraud you know lieutenant feraud he lives down the second street its but a step from here  whats the matter with him  wounded  are you sure  sure cried dhubert i come from there  thats amusing said the elderly surgeon amusing was his favourite word but the expression of his face when he pronounced it never corresponded he was a stolid man come in he added ill get ready in a moment  thanks i will i want to wash my hands in your room  lieutenant dhubert found the surgeon occupied in unscrewing his flute and packing the pieces methodically in a velvetlined case he turned his head  water therein the corner your hands do want washing  ive stopped the bleeding said lieutenant dhubert but you had better make haste its rather more than ten minutes ago you know  the surgeon did not hurry his movements  whats the matter dressing came off thats amusing ive been busy in the hospital all day but somebody has told me that he hadnt a scratch  not the same duel probably growled moodily lieutenant dhubert wiping his hands on a coarse towel  not the same what another it would take the very devil to make me go out twice in one day he looked narrowly at lieutenant dhubert how did you come by that scratched face both sides tooand symmetrical its amusing  very snarled lieutenant dhubert and you will find his slashed arm amusing too it will keep both of you amused for quite a long time  the doctor was mystified and impressed by the brusque bitterness of lieutenant dhuberts tone they left the house together and in the street he was still more mystified by his conduct  arent you coming with me he asked  no said lieutenant dhubert you can find the house by yourself the front door will be open very likely  all right wheres his room  ground floor but you had better go right through and look in the garden first  this astonishing piece of information made the surgeon go off without further parley lieutenant dhubert regained his quarters nursing a hot and uneasy indignation he dreaded the chaff of his comrades almost as much as the anger of his superiors he felt as though he had been entrapped into a damaging exposure the truth was confoundedly grotesque and embarrassing to justify putting aside the irregularity of the combat itself which made it come dangerously near a criminal offence like all men without much imagination which is such a help in the processes of reflective thought lieutenant dhubert became frightfully harassed by the obvious aspects of his predicament he was certainly glad that he had not killed lieutenant feraud outside all rules and without the regular witnesses proper to such a transaction uncommonly glad at the same time he felt as though he would have liked to wring his neck for him without ceremony  he was still under the sway of these contradictory sentiments when the surgeon amateur of the flute came to see him more than three days had elapsed lieutenant dhubert was no longer officier dordonnance to the general commanding the division he had been sent back to his regiment and he was resuming his connection with the soldiers military family by being shut up in close confinement not at his own quarters in town but in a room in the barracks owing to the gravity of the incident he was allowed to see no one he did not know what had happened what was being said or what was being thought the arrival of the surgeon was a most unexpected event to the worried captive the amateur of the flute began by explaining that he was there only by a special favour of the colonel who had thought fit to relax the general isolation order for this one occasion  i represented to him that it would be only fair to give you authentic news of your adversary he continued youll be glad to hear hes getting better fast  lieutenant dhuberts face exhibited no conventional signs of gladness he continued to walk the floor of the dusty bare room  take this chair doctor he mumbled  the doctor sat down  this affair is variously appreciated in town and in the army in fact the diversity of opinions is amusing  is it mumbled lieutenant dhubert tramping steadily from wall to wall but within himself he marvelled that there could be two opinions on the matter the surgeon continued  of course as the real facts are not known  i should have thought interrupted dhubert that the fellow would have put you in possession of the facts  he did say something admitted the other the first time i saw him and bythebye i did find him in the garden the thump on the back of his head had made him a little incoherent then afterwards he was rather reticent than otherwise  didnt think he would have the grace to be ashamed grunted dhubert who had stood still for a moment he resumed his pacing while the doctor murmured  its very amusing ashamed shame was not exactly his frame of mind however you may look at the matter otherwise  what are you talking about what matter asked dhubert with a sidelong look at the heavyfaced grayhaired figure seated on a wooden chair  whatever it is said the surgeon i wouldnt pronounce an opinion on your conduct  by heavens you had better not burst out dhubert  there there dont be so quick in flourishing the sword it doesnt pay in the long run understand once for all that i would not carve any of you youngsters except with the tools of my trade but my advice is good moderate your temper if you go on like this you will make for yourself an ugly reputation  go on like what demanded lieutenant dhubert stopping short quite startled i i make for myself a reputation what do you imagine  i told you i dont wish to judge of the rights and wrongs of this incident its not my business nevertheless  what on earth has he been telling you interrupted lieutenant dhubert in a sort of awed scare  i told you already that at first when i picked him up in the garden he was incoherent afterwards he was naturally reticent but i gather at least that he could not help himself  he couldnt shouted lieutenant dhubert then lowering his voice and what about me could i help myself  the surgeon rose his thoughts were running upon the flute his constant companion with a consoling voice in the vicinity of field ambulances after twentyfour hours hard work he had been known to trouble with its sweet sounds the horrible stillness of battlefields given over to silence and the dead the solacing hour of his daily life was approaching and in peace time he held on to the minutes as a miser to his hoard  of course of course he said perfunctorily you would think so its amusing however being perfectly neutral and friendly to you both i have consented to deliver his message say that i am humouring an invalid if you like he says that this affair is by no means at an end he intends to send you his seconds directly he has regained his strengthproviding of course the army is not in the field at that time  he intendsdoes he why certainly spluttered lieutenant dhubert passionately the secret of this exasperation was not apparent to the visitor but this passion confirmed him in the belief which was gaining ground outside that some very serious difference had arisen between these two young men something serious enough to wear an air of mystery some fact of the utmost gravity to settle their urgent difference those two young men had risked being broken and disgraced at the outset almost of their career and he feared that the forthcoming inquiry would fail to satisfy the public curiosity they would not take the public into their confidence as to that something which had passed between them of a nature so outrageous as to make them face a charge of murderneither more nor less but what could it be  the surgeon was not very curious by temperament but that question haunting his mind caused him twice that evening to hold the instrument off his lips and sit silent for a whole minuteright in the middle of a tunetrying to form a plausible conjecture     ii  he succeeded in this object no better than the rest of the garrison and the whole of society the two young officers of no especial consequence till then became distinguished by the universal curiosity as to the origin of their quarrel madame de lionnes salon was the centre of ingenious surmises that lady herself was for a time assailed with inquiries as the last person known to have spoken to these unhappy and reckless young men before they went out together from her house to a savage encounter with swords at dusk in a private garden she protested she had noticed nothing unusual in their demeanour lieutenant feraud had been visibly annoyed at being called away that was natural enough no man likes to be disturbed in a conversation with a lady famed for her elegance and sensibility¬ª but in truth the subject bored madame de lionne since her personality could by no stretch of imagination be connected with this affair and it irritated her to hear it advanced that there might have been some woman in the case this irritation arose not from her elegance or sensibility but from a more instinctive side of her nature it became so great at last that she peremptorily forbade the subject to be mentioned under her roof near her couch the prohibition was obeyed but farther off in the salon the pall of the imposed silence continued to be lifted more or less a diplomatic personage with a long pale face resembling the countenance of a sheep opined shaking his head that it was a quarrel of long standing envenomed by time it was objected to him that the men themselves were too young for such a theory to fit their proceedings they belonged also to different and distant parts of france a subcommissary of the intendence an agreeable and cultivated bachelor in keysermere breeches hessian boots and a blue coat embroidered with silver lace who affected to believe in the transmigration of souls suggested that the two had met perhaps in some previous existence the feud was in the forgotten past it might have been something quite inconceivable in the present state of their being but their souls remembered the animosity and manifested an instinctive antagonism he developed his theme jocularly yet the affair was so absurd from the worldly the military the honourable or the prudential point of view that this weird explanation seemed rather more reasonable than any other  the two officers had confided nothing definite to any one resentment humiliation at having been worsted arms in hand and an uneasy feeling of having been involved into a scrape by the injustice of fate kept lieutenant feraud savagely dumb he mistrusted the sympathy of mankind that would of course go to that dandified staff officer lying in bed he raved to himself in his mind or aloud to the pretty maid who ministered to his needs with devotion and listened to his horrible imprecations with alarm that lieutenant dhubert should be made to pay for it whatever it was seemed to her just and natural her principal concern was that lieutenant feraud should not excite himself he appeared so wholly admirable and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern was to see him get well quickly even if it were only to resume his visits to madame de lionnes salon  lieutenant dhubert kept silent for the immediate reason that there was no one except a stupid young soldier servant to speak to but he was not anxious for the opportunities of which his severe arrest deprived him he would have been uncommunicative from dread of ridicule he was aware that the episode so grave professionally had its comic side when reflecting upon it he still felt that he would like to wring lieutenant ferauds neck for him but this formula was figurative rather than precise and expressed more a state of mind than an actual physical impulse at the same time there was in that young man a feeling of comradeship and kindness which made him unwilling to make the position of lieutenant feraud worse than it was  he did not want to talk at large about this wretched affair at the inquiry he would have of course to speak the truth in selfdefence this prospect vexed him  but no inquiry took place the army took the field instead lieutenant dhubert liberated without remark returned to his regimental duties and lieutenant feraud his arm still in a sling rode unquestioned with his squadron to complete his convalescence in the smoke of battlefields and the fresh air of night bivouacs this bracing treatment suited his case so well that at the first rumour of an armistice being signed he could turn without misgivings to the prosecution of his private warfare  this time it was to be regular warfare he dispatched two friends to lieutenant dhubert whose regiment was stationed only a few miles away those friends had asked no questions of their principal i must pay him off that pretty staff officer he had said grimly and they went away quite contentedly on their mission lieutenant dhubert had no difficulty in finding two friends equally discreet and devoted to their principal theres a sort of crazy fellow to whom i must give another lesson he had curtly declared and they asked for no better reasons  on these grounds an encounter with duelling swords was arranged one early morning in a convenient field at the third setto lieutenant dhubert found himself lying on his back on the dewy grass with a hole in his side a serene sun rising over a german landscape of meadows and wooded hills hung on his left a surgeonnot the fluteplayer but anotherwas bending over him feeling around the wound  narrow squeak but it will be nothing he pronounced  lieutenant dhubert heard these words with pleasure one of his secondsthe one who sitting on the wet grass was sustaining his head on his lapsaid  the fortune of war mon pauvre vieux what will you have you had better make it up like two good fellows do  you dont know what you ask murmured lieutenant dhubert in a feeble voice however if he  in another part of the meadow the seconds of lieutenant feraud were urging him to go over and shake hands with his adversary  you have paid him off nowque diable its the proper thing to do this dhubert is a decent fellow  i know the decency of these generals pets muttered lieutenant feraud through his teeth for all answer the sombre expression of his face discouraged further efforts at reconciliation the seconds bowing from a distance took their men off the field in the afternoon lieutenant dhubert very popular as a good comrade uniting great bravery with a frank and equable temper had many visitors it was remarked that lieutenant feraud did not as customary show himself much abroad to receive the felicitations of his friends they would not have failed him because he too was liked for the exuberance of his southern nature and the simplicity of his character in all the places where officers were in the habit of assembling at the end of the day the duel of the morning was talked over from every point of view though lieutenant dhubert had got worsted this time his swordplay was commended no one could deny that it was very close very scientific if he got touched some said it was because he wished to spare his adversary but by many the vigour and dash of lieutenant ferauds attack were pronounced irresistible  the merits of the two officers as combatants were frankly discussed but their attitude to each other after the duel was criticised lightly and with caution it was irreconcilable and that was to be regretted after all they knew best what the care of their honour dictated it was not a matter for their comrades to pry into overmuch as to the origin of the quarrel the general impression was that it dated from the time they were holding garrison in strasburg only the musical surgeon shook his head at that it went much farther back he hinted discreetly  why you must know the whole story cried several voices eager with curiosity you were there what was it  he raised his eyes from his glass deliberately and said  even if i knew ever so well you cant expect me to tell you since both the principals choose to say nothing  he got up and went out leaving the sense of mystery behind him he could not stay longer because the witching hour of fluteplaying was drawing near after he had gone a very young officer observed solemnly  obviously his lips are sealed  nobody questioned the high propriety of that remark somehow it added to the impressiveness of the affair several older officers of both regiments prompted by nothing but sheer kindness and love of harmony proposed to form a court of honour to which the two officers would leave the task of their reconciliation unfortunately they began by approaching lieutenant feraud the assumption was that having just scored heavily he would be found placable and disposed to moderation  the reasoning was sound enough nevertheless the move turned out unfortunate in that relaxation of moral fibre which is brought about by the ease of soothed vanity lieutenant feraud had condescended in the secret of his heart to review the case and even to doubt not the justice of his cause but the absolute sagacity of his conduct this being so he was disinclined to talk about it the suggestion of the regimental wise men put him in a difficult position he was disgusted and this disgust by a sort of paradoxical logic reawakened his animosity against lieutenant dhubert was he to be pestered with this fellow for everthe fellow who had an infernal knack of getting round people somehow on the other hand it was difficult to refuse pointblank that sort of mediation sanctioned by the code of honour  lieutenant feraud met the difficulty by an attitude of fierce reserve he twisted his moustache and used vague words his case was perfectly clear he was not ashamed to present it neither was he afraid to defend it personally he did not see any reason to jump at the suggestion before ascertaining how his adversary was likely to take it  later in the day his exasperation growing upon him he was heard in a public place saying sardonically that it would be the very luckiest thing for lieutenant dhubert since next time of meeting he need not hope to get off with a mere trifle of three weeks in bed  this boastful phrase might have been prompted by the most profound machiavelism southern natures often hide under the outward impulsiveness of action and speech a certain amount of astuteness  lieutenant feraud mistrusting the justice of men by no means desired a court of honour and these words according so well with his temperament had also the merit of serving his turn whether meant for that purpose or not they found their way in less than fourandtwenty hours into lieutenant dhuberts bedroom in consequence lieutenant dhubert sitting propped up with pillows received the overtures made to him next day by the statement that the affair was of a nature which could not bear discussion  the pale face of the wounded officer his weak voice which he had yet to use cautiously and the courteous dignity of his tone had a great effect on his hearers reported outside all this did more for deepening the mystery than the vapourings of lieutenant feraud this last was greatly relieved at the issue he began to enjoy the state of general wonder and was pleased to add to it by assuming an attitude of moody reserve  the colonel of lieutenant dhuberts regiment was a grayhaired weatherbeaten warrior who took a simple view of his responsibilities i canthe thought to himselflet the best of my subalterns get damaged like this for nothing i must get to the bottom of this affair privately he must speak out if the devil were in it the colonel should be more than a father to these youngsters and indeed he loved all his men with as much affection as a father of a large family can feel for every individual member of it if human beings by an oversight of providence came into the world in the state of civilians they were born again into a regiment as infants are born into a family and it was that military birth alone which really counted  at the sight of lieutenant dhubert standing before him bleached and holloweyed the heart of the old warrior was touched with genuine compassion all his affection for the regimentthat body of men which he held in his hand to launch forward and draw back who had given him his rank ministered to his pride and commanded his thoughtsseemed centred for a moment on the person of the most promising subaltern he cleared his throat in a threatening manner and frowned terribly  you must understand he began that i dont care a rap for the life of a single man in the regiment you know that i would send the 748 of you men and horses galloping into the pit of perdition with no more compunction than i would kill a fly  yes colonel you would be riding at our head said lieutenant dhubert with a wan smile  the colonel who felt the need of being very diplomatic fairly roared at this  i want you to know lieutenant dhubert that i could stand aside and see you all riding to hades if need be i am a man to do even that if the good of the service and my duty to my country required it from me but thats unthinkable so dont you even hint at such a thing  he glared awfully but his voice became gentle theres some milk yet about that moustache of yours my boy you dont know what a man like me is capable of i would hide behind a haystack if dont grin at me sir how dare you if this were not a private conversation i would look here i am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment do you understand that well then what the devil do you mean by letting yourself be spitted like this by that fellow of the seventh hussars its simply disgraceful  lieutenant dhubert who expected another sort of conclusion felt vexed beyond measure his shoulders moved slightly he made no other answer he could not ignore his responsibility the colonel softened his glance and lowered his voice  its deplorable he murmured and again he changed his tone come he went on persuasively but with that note of authority which dwells in the throat of a good leader of men this affair must be settled i desire to be told plainly what it is all about i demand as your best friend to know  the compelling power of authority the softening influence of the kindness affected deeply a man just risen from a bed of sickness lieutenant dhuberts hand which grasped the knob of a stick trembled slightly but his northern temperament sentimental but cautious and clearsighted too in its idealistic way predominated over his impulse to make a clean breast of the whole deadly absurdity according to the precept of transcendental wisdom he turned his tongue seven times in his mouth before he spoke he made then only a speech of thanks nothing more the colonel listened interested at first then looked mystified at last he frowned  you hesitatemille tonerres havent i told you that i will condescend to argue with youas a friend  yes colonel answered lieutenant dhubert softly but i am afraid that after you have heard me out as a friend you will take action as my superior officer  the attentive colonel snapped his jaws  well what of that he said frankly is it so damnably disgraceful  it is not negatived lieutenant dhubert in a faint but resolute voice  of course i shall act for the good of the servicenothing can prevent me doing that what do you think i want to be told for  i know it is not from idle curiosity tested lieutenant dhubert i know you will act wisely but what about the good fame of the regiment  it cannot be affected by any youthful folly of a lieutenant the colonel said severely  no it cannot be but it can be by evil tongues it will be said that a lieutenant of the fourth hussars afraid of meeting his adversary is hiding behind his colonel and that would be worse than hiding behind a haystackfor the good of the service i cannot afford to do that colonel  nobody would dare to say anything of the kind the colonel beginning very fiercely ended on an uncertain note the bravery of lieutenant dhubert was well known but the colonel was well aware that the duelling courage the single combat courage is rightly or wrongly supposed to be courage of a special sort and it was eminently necessary that an officer of his regiment should possess every kind of courageand prove it too the colonel stuck out his lower lip and looked far away with a peculiar glazed stare this was the expression of his perplexity an expression practically unknown to his regiment for perplexity is a sentiment which is incompatible with the rank of colonel of cavalry the colonel himself was overcome by the unpleasant novelty of the sensation as he was not accustomed to think except on professional matters connected with the welfare of men and horses and the proper use thereof on the field of glory his intellectual efforts degenerated into mere mental repetitions of profane language mille tonerres sacr√© nom de nom he thought  lieutenant dhubert coughed painfully and went on in a weary voice  there will be plenty of evil tongues to say that ive been cowed and i am sure you will not expect me to pass that sort of thing over i may find myself suddenly with a dozen duels on my hands instead of this one affair  the direct simplicity of this argument came home to the colonels understanding he looked at his subordinate fixedly  sit down lieutenant he said gruffly this is the very devil of a sit down  mon colonel dhubert began again i am not afraid of evil tongues theres a way of silencing them but theres my peace of mind too i wouldnt be able to shake off the notion that ive ruined a brother officer whatever action you take it is bound to go further the inquiry has been droppedlet it rest now it would have been the end of feraud  hey what did he behave so badly  yes it was pretty bad muttered lieutenant dhubert being still very weak he felt a disposition to cry  as the other man did not belong to his own regiment the colonel had no difficulty in believing this he began to pace up and down the room he was a good chief and a man capable of discreet sympathy but he was human in other ways too and they were apparent because he was not capable of artifice  the very devil lieutenant he blurted out in the innocence of his heart is that i have declared my intention to get to the bottom of this affair and when a colonel says something you see  lieutenant dhubert broke in earnestly  let me entreat you colonel to be satisfied with taking my word of honour that i was put into a damnable position where i had no option i had no choice whatever consistent with my dignity as a man and an officer after all colonel this fact is the very bottom of this affair here youve got it the rest is a mere detail  the colonel stopped short the reputation of lieutenant dhubert for good sense and good temper weighed in the balance a cool head a warm heart open as the day always correct in his behaviour one had to trust him the colonel repressed manfully an immense curiosity  hm you affirm that as a man and an officer no option eh  as an officer an officer of the fourth hussars too repeated lieutenant dhubert i had not and that is the bottom of the affair colonel  yes but still i dont see why to ones colonel a colonel is a fatherque diable  lieutenant dhubert ought not to have been allowed out as yet he was becoming aware of his physical insufficiency with humiliation and despairbut the morbid obstinacy of an invalid possessed himand at the same time he felt with dismay his eyes filling with water this trouble seemed too big to handle a tear fell down the thin pale cheek of lieutenant dhubert the colonel turned his back on him hastily you could have heard a pin drop  this is some silly woman storyis it not  the chief spun round to seize the truth which is not a beautiful shape living in a well but a shy bird best caught by stratagem this was the last move of the colonels diplomacy and he saw the truth shining unmistakably in the gesture of lieutenant dhubert raising his weak arms and his eyes to heaven in supreme protest  not a woman affaireh growled the colonel staring hard i dont ask you who or where all i want to know is whether there is a woman in it  lieutenant dhuberts arms dropped and his weak voice was pathetically broken  nothing of the kind mon colonel  on your honour insisted the old warrior  on my honour  very well said the colonel thoughtfully and bit his lip the arguments of lieutenant dhubert helped by his liking for the person had convinced him yet it was highly improper that his intervention of which he had made no secret should produce no visible effect he kept lieutenant dhubert a little longer and dismissed him kindly  take a few days more in bed lieutenant what the devil does the surgeon mean by reporting you fit for duty  on coming out of the colonels quarters lieutenant dhubert said nothing to the friend who was waiting outside to take him home he said nothing to anybody lieutenant dhubert made no confidences but in the evening of that day the colonel strolling under the elms growing near his quarters in the company of his second in command opened his lips  ive got to the bottom of this affair he remarked  the lieutenantcolonel a dry brown chip of a man with short sidewhiskers pricked up his ears without letting a sound of curiosity escape him  its no trifle added the colonel oracularly the other waited for a long while before he murmured  indeed sir  no trifle repeated the colonel looking straight before him ive however forbidden dhubert either to send to or receive a challenge from feraud for the next twelve months  he had imagined this prohibition to save the prestige a colonel should have the result of it was to give an official seal to the mystery surrounding this deadly quarrel lieutenant dhubert repelled by an impassive silence all attempts to worm the truth out of him lieutenant feraud secretly uneasy at first regained his assurance as time went on he disguised his ignorance of the meaning of the imposed truce by little sardonic laughs as though he were amused by what he intended to keep to himself but what will you do his chums used to ask him he contented himself by replying qui vivra verra with a truculent air and everybody admired his discretion  before the end of the truce lieutenant dhubert got his promotion it was well earned but somehow no one seemed to expect the event when lieutenant feraud heard of it at a gathering of officers he muttered through his teeth is that so unhooking his sword from a peg near the door he buckled it on carefully and left the company without another word he walked home with measured steps struck a light with his flint and steel and lit his tallow candle then snatching an unlucky glass tumbler off the mantelpiece he dashed it violently on the floor  now that dhubert was an officer of a rank superior to his own there could be no question of a duel neither could send nor receive a challenge without rendering himself amenable to a courtmartial it was not to be thought of lieutenant feraud who for many days now had experienced no real desire to meet lieutenant dhubert arms in hand chafed at the systematic injustice of fate does he think he will escape me in that way he thought indignantly he saw in it an intrigue a conspiracy a cowardly manoeuvre that colonel knew what he was doing he had hastened to recommend his pet for promotion it was outrageous that a man should be able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark and tortuous manner  of a happygolucky disposition of a temperament more pugnacious than military lieutenant feraud had been content to give and receive blows for sheer love of armed strife and without much thought of advancement but after this disgusting experience an urgent desire of promotion sprang up in his breast this fighter by vocation resolved in his mind to seize showy occasions and to court the favourable opinion of his chiefs like a mere worldling he knew he was as brave as any one and never doubted his personal charm it would be easy he thought nevertheless neither the bravery nor the charm seemed to work very swiftly lieutenant ferauds engaging careless truculence of a beau sabreur underwent a change he began to make bitter allusions to clever fellows who stick at nothing to get on the army was full of them he would say you had only to look round and all the time he had in view one person only his adversary dhubert once he confided to an appreciative friend you see i dont know how to fawn on the right sort of people it isnt in me  he did not get his step till a week after austerlitz the light cavalry of the grande arm√©e had its hands very full of interesting work for a little while but directly the pressure of professional occupation had been eased by the armistice captain feraud took measures to arrange a meeting without loss of time i know his tricks he observed grimly if i dont look sharp he will take care to get himself promoted over the heads of a dozen better men than himself hes got the knack of that sort of thing this duel was fought in silesia if not fought out to a finish it was at any rate fought to a standstill the weapon was the cavalry sabre and the skill the science the vigour and the determination displayed by the adversaries compelled the outspoken admiration of the beholders it became the subject of talk on both shores of the danube and as far south as the garrisons of gratz and laybach they crossed blades seven times both had many slight cutsmere scratches which bled profusely both refused to have the combat stopped time after time with what appeared the most deadly animosity this appearance was caused on the part of captain dhubert by a rational desire to be done once for all with this worry on the part of feraud by a tremendous exaltation of his pugnacious instincts and the rage of wounded vanity at last dishevelled their shirts in rags covered with gore and hardly able to stand they were carried forcibly off the field by their marvelling and horrified seconds later on besieged by comrades avid of details these gentlemen declared that they could not have allowed that sort of hacking to go on asked whether the quarrel was settled this time they gave it out as their conviction that it was a difference which could only be settled by one of the parties remaining lifeless on the ground the sensation spread from army to army corps and penetrated at last to the smallest detachments of the troops cantoned between the rhine and the save in the caf√©s in vienna where the masters of europe took their ease it was generally estimated from details to hand that the adversaries would be able to meet again in three weeks time on the outside something really transcendental in the way of duelling was expected  these expectations were brought to naught by the necessities of the service which separated the two officers no official notice had been taken of their quarrel it was now the property of the army and not to be meddled with lightly but the story of the duel or rather their duelling propensities must have stood somewhat in the way of their advancement because they were still captains when they came together again during the war with prussia detached north after jena with the army commanded by marshal bernadotte prince of pontecorvo they entered lubeck together it was only after the occupation of that town that captain feraud had leisure to consider his future conduct in view of the fact that captain dhubert had been given the position of third aidedecamp to the marshal he considered it a great part of a night and in the morning summoned two sympathetic friends  ive been thinking it over calmly he said gazing at them with bloodshot tired eyes i see that i must get rid of that intriguing personage here hes managed to sneak onto the personal staff of the marshal its a direct provocation to me i cant tolerate a situation in which i am exposed any day to receive an order through him and god knows what order too that sort of thing has happened once beforeand thats once too often he understands this perfectly never fear i cant tell you more than this now go you know what it is you have to do  this encounter took place outside the town of lubeck on very open ground selected with special care in deference to the general sense of the cavalry division belonging to the army corps that this time the two officers should meet on horseback after all this duel was a cavalry affair and to persist in fighting on foot would look like a slight on ones own arm of the service the seconds startled by the unusual nature of the suggestion hastened to refer to their principals captain feraud jumped at it with savage alacrity for some obscure reason depending no doubt on his psychology he imagined himself invincible on horseback all alone within the four walls of his room he rubbed his hands exultingly aha my staff officer ive got you now  captain dhubert on his side after staring hard for a considerable time at his bothered seconds shrugged his shoulders slightly this affair had hopelessly and unreasonably complicated his existence for him one absurdity more or less in the development did not matter all absurdity was distasteful to him but urbane as ever he produced a faintly ironic smile and said in his calm voice  it certainly will do away to some extent with the monotony of the thing  but left to himself he sat down at a table and took his head into his hands he had not spared himself of late and the marshal had been working his aidesdecamp particularly hard the last three weeks of campaigning in horrible weather had affected his health when overtired he suffered from a stitch in his wounded side and that uncomfortable sensation always depressed him its that brutes doing he thought bitterly  the day before he had received a letter from home announcing that his only sister was going to be married he reflected that from the time she was sixteen when he went away to garrison life in strasburg he had had but two short glimpses of her they had been great friends and confidants and now they were going to give her away to a man whom he did not knowa very worthy fellow no doubt but not half good enough for her he would never see his old l√©onie again she had a capable little head and plenty of tact she would know how to manage the fellow to be sure he was easy about her happiness but he felt ousted from the first place in her affection which had been his ever since the girl could speak and a melancholy regret of the days of his childhood settled upon captain dhubert third aidedecamp to the prince of pontecorvo  he pushed aside the letter of congratulation he had begun to write as in duty bound but without pleasure he took a fresh sheet of paper and wrote this is my last will and testament and looking at these words he gave himself up to unpleasant reflection a presentiment that he would never see the scenes of his childhood overcame captain dhubert he jumped up pushing his chair back yawned leisurely which demonstrated to himself that he didnt care anything for presentiments and throwing himself on the bed went to sleep during the night he shivered from time to time without waking up in the morning he rode out of town between his two seconds talking of indifferent things and looking right and left with apparent detachment into the heavy morning mists shrouding the flat green fields bordered by hedges he leaped a ditch and saw the forms of many mounted men moving in the low fog we are to fight before a gallery he muttered bitterly  his seconds were rather concerned at the state of the atmosphere but presently a pale and sympathetic sun struggled above the vapours captain dhubert made out in the distance three horsemen riding a little apart it was his adversary and his seconds he drew his sabre and assured himself that it was properly fastened to his wrist and now the seconds who had been standing in a close group with the heads of their horses together separated at an easy canter leaving a large clear field between him and his adversary captain dhubert looked at the pale sun at the dismal landscape and the imbecility of the impending fight filled him with desolation from a distant part of the field a stentorian voice shouted commands at proper intervals au pasau trotchargez presentiments of death dont come to a man for nothing he thought at the moment he put spurs to his horse  and therefore nobody was more surprised than himself when at the very first setto captain feraud laid himself open to a cut extending over the forehead blinding him with blood and ending the combat almost before it had fairly begun the surprise of captain feraud might have been even greater captain dhubert leaving him swearing horribly and reeling in the saddle between his two appalled friends leaped the ditch again and trotted home with his two seconds who seemed rather awestruck at the speedy issue of that encounter in the evening captain dhubert finished the congratulatory letter on his sisters marriage  he finished it late it was a long letter captain dhubert gave reins to his fancy he told his sister he would feel rather lonely after this great change in her life but he continued the day will come for me too to get married in fact i am thinking already of the time when there will be no one left to fight in europe and the epoch of wars will be over i shall expect then to be within measurable distance of a marshals baton and you will be an experienced married woman you shall look out a nice wife for me i will be moderately bald by then and a little blas√© i will require a young girlpretty of course and with a large fortune you know to help me close my glorious career with the splendour befitting my exalted rank he ended with the information that he had just given a lesson to a worrying quarrelsome fellow who imagined he had a grievance against him but if you in the depth of your province he continued ever hear it said that your brother is of a quarrelsome disposition dont you believe it on any account there is no saying what gossip from the army may reach your innocent ears whatever you hear you may assure our father that your ever loving brother is not a duellist then captain dhubert crumpled up the sheet of paper with the words this is my last will and testament and threw it in the fire with a great laugh at himself he didnt care a snap for what that lunatic fellow could do he had suddenly acquired the conviction that this man was utterly powerless to affect his life in any sort of way except perhaps in the way of putting a certain special excitement into the delightful gay intervals between the campaigns  from this on there were however to be no peaceful intervals in the career of captain dhubert he saw the fields of eylau and friedland marched and countermarched in the snow the mud and the dust of polish plains picking up distinction and advancement on all the roads of northeastern europe meantime captain feraud despatched southward with his regiment made unsatisfactory war in spain it was only when the preparations for the russian campaign began that he was ordered north again he left the country of mantillas and oranges without regret  the first signs of a not unbecoming baldness added to the lofty aspect of colonel dhuberts forehead this feature was no longer white and smooth as in the days of his youth and the kindly open glance of his blue eyes had grown a little hard as if from much peering through the smoke of battles the ebony crop on colonel ferauds head coarse and crinkly like a cap of horsehair showed many silver threads about the temples a detestable warfare of ambushes and inglorious surprises had not improved his temper the beaklike curve of his nose was unpleasantly set off by deep folds on each side of his mouth the round orbits of his eyes radiated fine wrinkles more than ever he recalled an irritable and staring fowlsomething like a cross between a parrot and an owl he still manifested an outspoken dislike for intriguing fellows he seized every opportunity to state that he did not pick up his rank in the anterooms of marshals  the unlucky persons civil or military who with an intention of being pleasant begged colonel feraud to tell them how he came by that very apparent scar on the forehead were astonished to find themselves snubbed in various ways some of which were simply rude and others mysteriously sardonic young officers were warned kindly by their more experienced comrades not to stare openly at the colonels scar but indeed an officer need have been very young in his profession not to have heard the legendary tale of that duel originating in some mysterious unforgivable offence     iii  the retreat from moscow submerged all private feelings in a sea of disaster and misery colonels without regiments dhubert and feraud carried the musket in the ranks of the sacred battaliona battalion recruited from officers of all arms who had no longer any troops to lead  in that battalion promoted colonels did duty as sergeants the generals captained the companies a marshal of france prince of the empire commanded the whole all had provided themselves with muskets picked up on the road and cartridges taken from the dead in the general destruction of the bonds of discipline and duty holding together the companies the battalions the regiments the brigades and divisions of an armed host this body of men put their pride in preserving some semblance of order and formation the only stragglers were those who fell out to give up to the frost their exhausted souls they plodded on doggedly stumbling over the corpses of men the carcasses of horses the fragments of guncarriages covered by the white windingsheet of the great disaster their passage did not disturb the mortal silence of the plains shining with a livid light under a sky the colour of ashes whirlwinds of snow ran along the fields broke against the dark column rose in a turmoil of flying icicles and subsided disclosing it creeping on without the swing and rhythm of the military pace they struggled onward exchanging neither words nor lookswhole ranks marched touching elbows day after day and never raising their eyes as if lost in despairing reflections on calm days in the dumb black forests of pines the cracking of overloaded branches was the only sound often from daybreak to dusk no one spoke in the whole column it was like a macabre march of struggling corpses towards a distant grave only an alarm of cossacks could restore to their lacklustre eyes a semblance of martial resolution the battalion deployed facing about or formed square under the endless fluttering of snowflakes a cloud of horsemen with fur caps on their heads levelled long lances and yelled hurrah hurrah around their menacing immobility whence with muffled detonations hundreds of darkred flames darted through the air thick with falling snow in a very few moments the horsemen would disappear as if carried off yelling in the gale and the battalion standing still alone in the blizzard heard only the wind searching their very hearts then with a cry or two of vive lempereur it would resume its march leaving behind a few lifeless bodies lying huddled up tiny dark specks on the white ground  though often marching in the ranks or skirmishing in the woods side by side the two officers ignored each other this not so much from inimical intention as from a very real indifference all their store of moral energy was expended in resisting the terrific enmity of nature and the crushing sense of irretrievable disaster  neither of them allowed himself to be crushed to the last they counted among the most active the least demoralised of the battalion their vigorous vitality invested them both with the appearance of an heroic pair in the eyes of their comrades and they never exchanged more than a casual word or two except one day when skirmishing in front of the battalion against a worrying attack of cavalry they found themselves cut off by a small party of cossacks a score of wildlooking hairy horsemen rode to and fro brandishing their lances in ominous silence the two officers had no mind to lay down their arms and colonel feraud suddenly spoke up in a hoarse growling voice bringing his firelock to the shoulder  you take the nearest brute colonel dhubert ill settle the next one i am a better shot than you are  colonel dhubert only nodded over his levelled musket their shoulders were pressed against the trunk of a large tree in front deep snowdrifts protected them from a direct charge  illustration 088jpg you take the nearest brute colonel dhubert  two carefully aimed shots rang out in the frosty air two cossacks reeled in their saddles the rest not thinking the game good enough closed round their wounded comrades and galloped away out of range the two officers managed to rejoin their battalion halted for the night during that afternoon they had leaned upon each other more than once and towards the last colonel dhubert whose long legs gave him an advantage in walking through soft snow peremptorily took the musket from colonel feraud and carried it on his shoulder using his own as a staff  on the outskirts of a village halfburied in the snow an old wooden barn burned with a clear and immense flame the sacred battalion of skeletons muffled in rags crowded greedily the windward side stretching hundreds of numbed bony hands to the blaze nobody had noted their approach before entering the circle of light playing on the multitude of sunken glassyeyed starved faces colonel dhubert spoke in his turn  heres your firelock colonel feraud i can walk better than you  colonel feraud nodded and pushed on towards the warmth of the fierce flames colonel dhubert was more deliberate but not the less bent on getting a place in the front rank those they pushed aside tried to greet with a faint cheer the reappearance of the two indomitable companions in activity and endurance those manly qualities had never perhaps received a higher tribute than this feeble acclamation  this is the faithful record of speeches exchanged during the retreat from moscow by colonels feraud and dhubert colonel ferauds taciturnity was the outcome of concentrated rage short hairy blackfaced with layers of grime and a thick sprouting of a wiry beard a frostbitten hand wrapped in filthy rags carried in a sling he accused fate bitterly of unparalleled perfidy towards the sublime man of destiny colonel dhubert his long moustache pendent in icicles on each side of his cracked blue lips his eyelids inflamed with the glare of snows the principal part of his costume consisting of a sheepskin coat looted with difficulty from the frozen corpse of a camp follower found in an abandoned cart took a more thoughtful view of events his regularly handsome features now reduced to mere bony fines and fleshless hollows looked out of a womans black velvet hood over which was rammed forcibly a cocked hat picked up under the wheels of an empty army fourgon which must have contained at one time some general officers luggage the sheepskin coat being short for a man of his inches ended very high up his elegant person and the skin of his legs blue with the cold showed through the tatters of his nether garments this under the circumstances provoked neither jeers nor pity no one cared how the next man felt or looked colonel dhubert himself hardened to exposure suffered mainly in his selfrespect from the lamentable indecency of his costume a thoughtless person may think that with a whole host of inanimate bodies bestrewing the path of retreat there could not have been much difficulty in supplying the deficiency but the great majority of these bodies lay buried under the falls of snow others had been already despoiled and besides to loot a pair of breeches from a frozen corpse is not so easy as it may appear to a mere theorist it requires time you must remain behind while your companions march on and colonel dhubert had his scruples as to falling out they arose from a point of honour and also a little from dread once he stepped aside he could not be sure of ever rejoining his battalion and the enterprise demanded a physical effort from which his starved body shrank the ghastly intimacy of a wrestling match with the frozen dead opposing the unyielding rigidity of iron to your violence was repugnant to the inborn delicacy of his feelings  luckily one day grubbing in a mound of snow between the huts of a village in the hope of finding there a frozen potato or some vegetable garbage he could put between his long and shaky teeth colonel dhubert uncovered a couple of mats of the sort russian peasants use to line the sides of their carts these shaken free of frozen snow bent about his person and fastened solidly round his waist made a bellshaped nether garment a sort of stiff petticoat rendering colonel dhubert a perfectly decent but a much more noticeable figure than before  thus accoutred he continued to retreat never doubting of his personal escape but full of other misgivings the early buoyancy of his belief in the future was destroyed if the road of glory led through such unforeseen passageshe asked himself for he was reflective whether the guide was altogether trustworthy and a patriotic sadness not unmingled with some personal concern altogether unlike the unreasoning indignation against men and things nursed by colonel feraud oppressed the equable spirits of colonel dhubert recruiting his strength in a little german town for three weeks he was surprised to discover within himself a love of repose his returning vigour was strangely pacific in its aspirations he meditated silently upon that bizarre change of mood no doubt many of his brother officers of field rank had the same personal experience but these were not the times to talk of it in one of his letters home colonel dhubert wrote all your plans my dear leonie of marrying me to the charming girl you have discovered in your neighbourhood seem farther off than ever peace is not yet europe wants another lesson it will be a hard task for us but it will be done well because the emperor is invincible  thus wrote colonel dhubert from pomerania to his married sister l√©onie settled in the south of france and so far the sentiments expressed would not have been disowned by colonel feraud who wrote no letters to anybody whose father had been in life an illiterate blacksmith who had no sister or brother and whom no one desired ardently to pair off for a life of peace with a charming young girl but colonel dhuberts letter contained also some philosophical generalities upon the uncertainty of all personal hopes if bound up entirely with the prestigious fortune of one incomparably great it is true yet still remaining but a man in his greatness this sentiment would have appeared rank heresy to colonel feraud some melancholy forebodings of a military kind expressed cautiously would have been pronounced as nothing short of high treason by colonel feraud but l√©onie the sister of colonel dhubert read them with positive satisfaction and folding the letter thoughtfully remarked to herself that armand was likely to prove eventually a sensible fellow since her marriage into a southern family she had become a convinced believer in the return of the legitimate king hopeful and anxious she offered prayers night and morning and burned candles in churches for the safety and prosperity of her brother  she had every reason to suppose that her prayers were heard colonel dhubert passed through lutzen bautzen and leipsic losing no limbs and acquiring additional reputation adapting his conduct to the needs of that desperate time he had never voiced his misgivings he concealed them under a cheerful courtesy of such pleasant character that people were inclined to ask themselves with wonder whether colonel dhubert was aware of any disasters not only his manners but even his glances remained untroubled the steady amenity of his blue eyes disconcerted all grumblers silenced doleful remarks and made even despair pause  this bearing was remarked at last by the emperor himself for colonel dhubert attached now to the majorgenerals staff came on several occasions under the imperial eye but it exasperated the higher strung nature of colonel feraud passing through magdeburg on service this last allowed himself while seated gloomily at dinner with the commandant de place to say of his lifelong adversary this man does not love the emperorand as his words were received in profound silence colonel feraud troubled in his conscience at the atrocity of the aspersion felt the need to back it up by a good argument i ought to know him he said adding some oaths one studies ones adversary i have met him on the ground half a dozen times as all the army knows what more do you want if that isnt opportunity enough for any fool to size up his man may the devil take me if i can tell what is and he looked around the table with sombre obstinacy  later on in paris while feverishly busy reorganising his regiment colonel feraud learned that colonel dhubert had been made a general he glared at his informant incredulously then folded his arms and turned away muttering  nothing surprises me on the part of that man  and aloud he added speaking over his shoulder you would greatly oblige me by telling general dhubert at the first opportunity that his advancement saves him for a time from a pretty hot encounter i was only waiting for him to turn up here  the other officer remonstrated  could you think of it colonel feraud at this time when every life should be consecrated to the glory and safety of france  but the strain of unhappiness caused by military reverses had spoiled colonel ferauds character like many other men he was rendered wicked by misfortune  i cannot consider general dhuberts person of any account either for the glory or safety of france he snapped viciously you dont pretend perhaps to know him better than i dowho have been with him half a dozen times on the grounddo you  his interlocutor a young man was silenced colonel feraud walked up and down the room  this is not a time to mince matters he said i cant believe that that man ever loved the emperor he picked up his generals stars under the boots of marshal berthier very well ill get mine in another fashion and then we shall settle this business which has been dragging on too long  general dhubert informed indirectly of colonel ferauds attitude made a gesture as if to put aside an importunate person his thoughts were solicited by graver cares he had had no time to go and see his family his sister whose royalist hopes were rising higher every day though proud of her brother regretted his recent advancement in a measure because it put on him a prominent mark of the usurpers favour which later on could have an adverse influence upon his career he wrote to her that no one but an inveterate enemy could say he had got his promotion by favour as to his career he assured her that he looked no farther forward into the future than the next battlefield  beginning the campaign of france in that state of mind general dhubert was wounded on the second day of the battle under laon while being carried off the field he heard that colonel feraud promoted that moment to general had been sent to replace him in the command of his brigade he cursed his luck impulsively not being able at the first glance to discern all the advantages of a nasty wound and yet it was by this heroic method that providence was shaping his future travelling slowly south to his sisters country house under the care of a trusty old servant general dhubert was spared the humiliating contacts and the perplexities of conduct which assailed the men of the napoleonic empire at the moment of its downfall lying in his bed with the windows of his room open wide to the sunshine of provence he perceived at last the undisguised aspect of the blessing conveyed by that jagged fragment of a prussian shell which killing his horse and ripping open his thigh saved him from an active conflict with his conscience after fourteen years spent sword in hand in the saddle and strong in the sense of his duty done to the end general dhubert found resignation an easy virtue his sister was delighted with his reasonableness i leave myself altogether in your hands my dear l√©onie he had said  he was still laid up when the credit of his brotherinlaws family being exerted on his behalf he received from the royal government not only the confirmation of his rank but the assurance of being retained on the active list to this was added an unlimited convalescent leave the unfavourable opinion entertained of him in the more irreconcilable bonapartist circles though it rested on nothing more solid than the unsupported pronouncement of general feraud was directly responsible for general dhuberts retention on the active list as to general feraud his rank was confirmed too it was more than he dared to expect but marshal soult then minister of war to the restored king was partial to officers who had served in spain only not even the marshals protection could secure for him active employment he remained irreconcilable idle and sinister seeking in obscure restaurants the company of other halfpay officers who cherished dingy but glorious old tricolour cockades in their breast pockets and buttoned with the forbidden eagle buttons their shabby uniform declaring themselves too poor to afford the expense of the prescribed change  the triumphant return of the emperor a historical fact as marvellous and incredible as the exploits of some mythological demigod found general dhubert still quite unable to sit a horse neither could he walk very well these disabilities which his sister thought most lucky helped her immensely to keep her brother out of all possible mischief his frame of mind at that time she noted with dismay became very far from reasonable that general officer still menaced by the loss of a limb was discovered one night in the stables of the ch√¢teau by a groom who seeing a light raised an alarm of thieves his crutch was lying half buried in the straw of the litter and he himself was hopping on one leg in a loose box around a snorting horse he was trying to saddle such were the effects of imperial magic upon an unenthusiastic temperament and a pondered mind beset in the light of stable lanterns by the tears entreaties indignation remonstrances and reproaches of his family he got out of the difficult situation by fainting away there and then in the arms of his nearest relatives and was carried off to bed before he got out of it again the second reign of napoleon the hundred days of feverish agitation and supreme effort passed away like a terrifying dream the tragic year 1815 begun in the trouble and unrest of consciences was ending in vengeful proscriptions  how general feraud escaped the clutches of the special commission and the last offices of a firing squad he never knew himself it was partly due to the subordinate position he was assigned during the hundred days he was not given active command but was kept busy at the cavalry depot in paris mounting and despatching hastily drilled troopers into the field considering this task as unworthy of his abilities he discharged it with no offensively noticeable zeal but for the greater part he was saved from the excesses of royalist reaction by the interference of general dhubert  this last still on convalescent leave but able now to travel had been despatched by his sister to paris to present himself to his legitimate sovereign as no one in the capital could possibly know anything of the episode in the stable he was received there with distinction military to the very bottom of his soul the prospect of rising in his profession consoled him from finding himself the butt of bonapartist malevolence which pursued him with a persistence he could not account for all the rancour of that embittered and persecuted party pointed to him as the man who had never loved the emperora sort of monster essentially worse than a mere betrayer  general dhubert shrugged his shoulders without anger at this ferocious prejudice rejected by his old friends and mistrusting profoundly the advances of royalist society the young and handsome general he was barely forty adopted a manner of punctilious and cold courtesy which at the merest shadow of an intended slight passed easily into harsh haughtiness thus prepared general dhubert went about his affairs in paris feeling inwardly very happy with the peculiar uplifting happiness of a man very much in love the charming girl looked out by his sister had come upon the scene and had conquered him in the thorough manner in which a young girl by merely existing in his sight can make a man of forty her own they were going to be married as soon as general dhubert had obtained his official nomination to a promised command  one afternoon sitting on the terrasse of the caf√© tortoni general dhubert learned from the conversation of two strangers occupying a table near his own that general feraud included in the batch of superior officers arrested after the second return of the king was in danger of passing before the special commission living all his spare moments as is frequently the case with expectant lovers a day in advance of reality as it were and in a state of bestarred hallucination it required nothing less than the name of his perpetual antagonist pronounced in a loud voice to call the youngest of napoleons generals away from the mental contemplation of his betrothed he looked round the strangers wore civilian clothes lean and weatherbeaten lolling back in their chairs they looked at people with moody and defiant abstraction from under their hats pulled low over their eyes it was not difficult to recognise them for two of the compulsorily retired officers of the old guard as from bravado or carelessness they chose to speak in loud tones general dhubert who saw no reason why he should change his seat heard every word they did not seem to be the personal friends of general feraud his name came up with some others and hearing it repeated general dhuberts tender anticipations of a domestic future adorned by a womans grace were traversed by the harsh regret of that warlike past of that one long intoxicating clash of arms unique in the magnitude of its glory and disasterthe marvellous work and the special possession of his own generation he felt an irrational tenderness toward his old adversary and appreciated emotionally the murderous absurdity their encounter had introduced into his life it was like an additional pinch of spice in a hot dish he remembered the flavour with sudden melancholy he would never taste it again it was all over i fancy it was being left lying in the garden that had exasperated him so against me he thought indulgently  the two strangers at the next table had fallen silent upon the third mention of general ferauds name presently the oldest of the two speaking in a bitter tone affirmed that general ferauds account was settled and why simply because he was not like some bigwigs who loved only themselves the royalists knew that they could never make anything of him he loved the other too well  the other was the man of st helena the two officers nodded and touched glasses before they drank to an impossible return then the same who had spoken before remarked with a sardonic little laugh  his adversary showed more cleverness  what adversary asked the younger as if puzzled  dont you know they were two hussars at each promotion they fought a duel havent you heard of the duel that is going on since 1801  his friend had heard of the duel of course now he understood the allusion general baron dhubert would be able now to enjoy his fat kings favour in peace  much good may it do to him mumbled the elder they were both brave men i never saw this dhuberta sort of intriguing dandy i understand but i can well believe what ive heard feraud say once of himthat he never loved the emperor  they rose and went away  general dhubert experienced the horror of a somnambulist who wakes up from a complacent dream of activity to find himself walking on a quagmire a profound disgust of the ground on which he was making his way overcame him even the image of the charming girl was swept from his view in the flood of moral distress everything he had ever been or hoped to be would be lost in ignominy unless he could manage to save general feraud from the fate which threatened so many braves under the impulse of this almost morbid need to attend to the safety of his adversary general dhubert worked so well with hands and feet as the french saying is that in less than twentyfour hours he found means of obtaining an extraordinary private audience from the minister of police  general baron dhubert was shown in suddenly without preliminaries in the dusk of the ministers cabinet behind the shadowy forms of writing desk chairs and tables between two bunches of wax candles blazing in sconces he beheld a figure in a splendid coat posturing before a tall mirror the old conventional fouch√© exsenator of the empire traitor to every man every principle and motive of human conduct duke of otranto and the wily artisan of the second restoration was trying the fit of a court suit in which his young and accomplished fianc√©e had declared her wish to have his portrait painted on porcelain it was a caprice a charming fancy which the minister of police of the second restoration was anxious to gratify for that man often compared in wiliness of intellect to a fox but whose ethical side could be worthily symbolised by nothing less emphatic than a skunk was as much possessed by his love as general dhubert himself  startled to be discovered thus by the blunder of a servant he met this little vexation with the characteristic effrontery which had served his turn so well in the endless intrigues of his selfseeking career without altering his attitude a hairs breadth one leg in a silk stocking advanced his head twisted over his left shoulder he called out calmly  this way general pray approach well i am all attention  while general dhubert as ill at ease as if one of his own little weaknesses had been exposed presented his request as shortly as possible the minister went on feeling the fit of his collar settling the lappels before the glass or buckling his back in his efforts to behold the set of the goldembroidered coat skirts behind his still face his attentive eyes could not have expressed a more complete interest in those matters if he had been alone  exclude from the operations of the special commission a certain feraud gabriel florian general of brigade of the promotion of 1814 he repeated in a slightly wondering tone and then turned away from the glass why exclude him precisely  i am surprised that your excellency so competent in the valuation of men of his time should have thought it worth while to have that name put down on the list  a rabid bonapartist  so is every grenadier and every trooper of the army as your excellency well knows and the individuality of general feraud can have no more weight than that of any casual grenadier he is a man of no mental grasp of no capacity whatever it is inconceivable that he should ever have any influence  he has a wellhung tongue though interjected fouch√©  noisy i admit but not dangerous  i will not dispute with you i know next to nothing of him hardly his name in fact  and yet your excellency had the presidency of the commission charged by the king to point out those who were to be tried said general dhubert with an emphasis which did not miss the ministers ear  yes general he said walking away into the dark part of the vast room and throwing himself into a highbacked armchair whose overshadowed depth swallowed him up all but the gleam of gold embroideries on the coat and the pallid patch of the face yes general take that chair there  general dhubert sat down  yes general continued the archmaster in the arts of intrigue and betrayal whose duplicity as if at times intolerable to his selfknowledge worked itself off in bursts of cynical openness i did hurry on the formation of the proscribing commission and took its presidency and do you know why simply from fear that if i did not take it quickly into my hands my own name would head the list of the proscribed such are the times in which we live but i am minister of the king as yet and i ask you plainly why i should take the name of this obscure feraud off the list you wonder how his name got there is it possible that you know men so little my dear general at the very first sitting of the commission names poured on us like rain off the tiles of the tuileries names we had our choice of thousands how do you know that the name of this feraud whose life or death dont matter to france does not keep out some other name  the voice out of the armchair stopped general dhubert sat still shadowy and silent only his sabre clinked slightly the voice in the armchair began again and we must try to satisfy the exigencies of the allied sovereigns the prince de talleyrand told me only yesterday that nesselrode had informed him officially that his majesty the emperor alexander was very disappointed at the small number of examples the government of the king intends to makeespecially amongst military men i tell you this confidentially  upon my word broke out general dhubert speaking through his teeth if your excellency deigns to favour me with any more confidential information i dont know what i will do its enough to make one break ones sword over ones knee and fling the pieces  what government do you imagine yourself to be serving interrupted the minister sharply after a short pause the crestfallen voice of general dhubert answered  the government of france  thats paying your conscience off with mere words general the truth is that you are serving a government of returned exiles of men who have been without country for twenty years of men also who have just got over a very bad and humiliating fright have no illusions on that score  the duke of otranto ceased he had relieved himself and had attained his object of stripping some selfrespect off that man who had inconveniently discovered him posturing in a goldembroidered court costume before a mirror but they were a hotheaded lot in the army and it occurred to him that it would be inconvenient if a welldisposed general officer received by him on the recommendation of one of the princes were to go and do something rashly scandalous directly after a private interview with the minister in a changed voice he put a question to the point  your relationthis feraud  no no relation at all  intimate friend  intimate yes there is between us an intimate connection of a nature which makes it a point of honour with me to try  the minister rang a bell without waiting for the end of the phrase when the servant had gone after bringing in a pair of heavy silver candelabra for the writing desk the duke of otranto stood up his breast glistening all over with gold in the strong light and taking a piece of paper out of a drawer held it in his hand ostentatiously while he said with persuasive gentleness  you must not talk of breaking your sword across your knee general perhaps you would never get another the emperor shall not return this time diable dhomme there was just a moment here in paris soon after waterloo when he frightened me it looked as though he were going to begin again luckily one never does begin again really you must not think of breaking your sword general  general dhubert his eyes fixed on the ground made with his hand a hopeless gesture of renunciation the minister of police turned his eyes away from him and began to scan deliberately the paper he had been holding up all the time  there are only twenty general officers to be brought before the special commission twenty a round number and lets see feraud ah hes there gabriel florian parfaitement thats your man well there will be only nineteen examples made now  general dhubert stood up feeling as though he had gone through an infectious illness  i must beg your excellency to keep my interference a profound secret i attach the greatest importance to his never knowing  who is going to inform him i should like to know said fouch√© raising his eyes curiously to general dhuberts white face take one of these pens and run it through the name yourself this is the only list in existence if you are careful to take up enough ink no one will be able to tell even what was the name thus struck out but par example i am not responsible for what clarke will do with him if he persist in being rabid he will be ordered by the minster of war to reside in some provincial town under the supervision of the police  a few days later general dhubert was saying to his sister after the first greetings had been got over  ah my dear l√©onie it seemed to me i couldnt get away from paris quick enough  effect of love she suggested with a malicious smile  and horror added general dhubert with profound seriousness i have nearly died there of of nausea  his face was contracted with disgust and as his sister looked at him attentively he continued  i have had to see fouch√© i have had an audience i have been in his cabinet there remains with one after the misfortune of having to breathe the air of the same room with that man a sense of diminished dignity the uneasy feeling of being not so clean after all as one hoped one was but you cant understand  she nodded quickly several times she understood very well on the contrary she knew her brother thoroughly and liked him as he was moreover the scorn and loathing of mankind were the lot of the jacobin fouch√© who exploiting for his own advantage every weakness every virtue every generous illusion of mankind made dupes of his whole generation and died obscurely as duke of otranto  my dear armand she said compassionately what could you want from that man  nothing less than a life answered general dhubert and ive got it it had to be done but i feel yet as if i could never forgive the necessity to the man i had to save  general feraud totally unable as is the case with most men to comprehend what was happening to him received the minister of wars order to proceed at once to a small town of central france with feelings whose natural expression consisted in a fierce rolling of the eye and savage grinding of the teeth but he went the bewilderment and awe at the passing away of the state of warthe only condition of society he had ever knownthe prospect of a world at peace frightened him he went away to his little town firmly persuaded that this could not last there he was informed of his retirement from the army and that his pension calculated on the scale of a colonels halfpay was made dependent on the circumspection of his conduct and on the good reports of the police no longer in the army he felt suddenly a stranger to the earth like a disembodied spirit it was impossible to exist but at first he reacted from sheer incredulity this could not be it could not last the heavens would fall presently he called upon thunder earthquakes natural cataclysms but nothing happened the leaden weight of an irremediable idleness descended upon general feraud who having no resources within himself sank into a state of aweinspiring hebetude he haunted the streets of the little town gazing before him with lacklustre eyes disregarding the hats raised on his passage and the people nudging each other as he went by said thats poor general feraud his heart is broken behold how he loved the emperor  the other living wreckage of napoleonic tempest to be found in that quiet nook of france clustered round him infinitely respectful of that sorrow he himself imagined his soul to be crushed by grief he experienced quickly succeeding impulses to weep to howl to bite his fists till blood came to lie for days on his bed with his head thrust under the pillow but they arose from sheer ennui from the anguish of an immense indescribable inconceivable boredom only his mental inability to grasp the hopeless nature of his case as a whole saved him from suicide he never even thought of it once he thought of nothing but his appetite abandoned him and the difficulty of expressing the overwhelming horror of his feelings the most furious swearing could do no justice to it induced gradually a habit of silencea sort of death to a southern temperament  great therefore was the emotion amongst the anciens militaires frequenting a certain little caf√© full of flies when one stuffy afternoon that poor general feraud let out suddenly a volley of formidable curses  he had been sitting quietly in his own privileged corner looking through the paris gazettes with about as much interest as a condemned man on the eve of execution could be expected to show in the news of the day a cluster of martial bronzed faces including one lacking an eye and another lacking the tip of a nose frostbitten in russia surrounded him anxiously  whats the matter general  general feraud sat erect holding the newspaper at arms length in order to make out the small print better he was reading very low to himself over again fragments of the intelligence which had caused what may be called his resurrection  we are informed till now on sick leave is to be called to the command of the 5th cavalry brigade in  he dropped the paper stonily mumbled once more called to the command and suddenly gave his forehead a mighty slap  i had almost forgotten him he cried in a consciencestricken tone  a deepchested veteran shouted across the caf√©  some new villainy of the government general  the villainies of these scoundrels thundered general feraud are innumerable one more one less he lowered his tone but i will set good order to one of them at least  he looked all round the faces theres a pomaded curled staff officer the darling of some of the marshals who sold their father for a handful of english gold he will find out presently that i am alive yet he declared in a dogmatic tone however this is a private affair an old affair of honour bah our honour does not matter here we are driven off with a split ear like a lot of cast troop horsesgood only for a knackers yard who cares for our honour now but it would be like striking a blow for the emperor messieurs i require the assistance of two of you  every man moved forward general feraud deeply touched by this demonstration called with visible emotion upon the oneeyed veteran cuirassier and the officer of the chasseurs √† cheval who had left the tip of his nose in russia he excused his choice to the others  a cavalry affair thisyou know  he was answered with a varied chorus of parfaitement mon g√©n√©ral cest juste parbleu cest connu everybody was satisfied the three left the caf√© together followed by cries of bonne chance  outside they linked arms the general in the middle the three rusty cocked hats worn en bataille with a sinister forward slant barred the narrow street nearly right across the overheated little town of gray stones and red tiles was drowsing away its provincial afternoon under a blue sky far off the loud blows of some coopers hooping a cask reverberated regularly between the houses the general dragged his left foot a little in the shade of the walls  that damned winter of 1813 got into my bones for good never mind we must take pistols thats all a little lumbago we must have pistols hes sure game for my bag my eyes are as keen as ever always were you should have seen me picking off the dodging cossacks with a beastly old infantry musket i have a natural gift for firearms  in this strain general feraud ran on holding up his head with owlish eyes and rapacious beak a mere fighter all his life a cavalry man a sabreur he conceived war with the utmost simplicity as in the main a massed lot of personal contests a sort of gregarious duelling and here he had on hand a war of his own he revived the shadow of peace had passed away from him like the shadow of death it was a marvellous resurrection of the named feraud gabriel florian engag√© volontaire of 1793 general of 1814 buried without ceremony by means of a service order signed by the war minister of the second restoration     iv  no man succeeds in everything he undertakes in that sense we are all failures the great point is not to fail in ordering and sustaining the effort of our life in this matter vanity is what leads us astray it is our vanity which hurries us into situations from which we must come out damaged whereas pride is our safeguard by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our endeavour as much as by the virtue of its sustaining power  general dhubert was proud and reserved he had not been damaged by casual love affairs successful or otherwise in his warscarred body his heart at forty remained unscratched entering with reserve into his sisters matrimonial plans he felt himself falling irremediably in love as one falls off a roof he was too proud to be frightened indeed the sensation was too delightful to be alarming  the inexperience of a man of forty is a much more serious thing than the inexperience of a youth of twenty for it is not helped out by the rashness of hot blood the girl was mysterious as all young girls are by the mere effect of their guarded ingenuity and to him the mysteriousness of that young girl appeared exceptional and fascinating but there was nothing mysterious about the arrangements of the match which madame l√©onie had arranged there was nothing peculiar either it was a very appropriate match commending itself extremely to the young ladys mother her father was dead and tolerable to the young ladys unclean old √©migr√© lately returned from germany and pervading cane in hand like a lean ghost of the ancien r√©gime in a longskirted brown coat and powdered hair the garden walks of the young ladys ancestral home  general dhubert was not the man to be satisfied merely with the girl and the fortunewhen it came to the point his prideand pride aims always at true successwould be satisfied with nothing short of love but as pride excludes vanity he could not imagine any reason why this mysterious creature with deep and candid eyes of a violet colour should have any feeling for him warmer than indifference the young lady her name was ad√®le baffled every attempt at a clear understanding on that point it is true that the attempts were clumsy and timidly made because by then general dhubert had become acutely aware of the number of his years of his wounds of his many moral imperfections of his secret unworthinessand had incidentally learned by experience the meaning of the word funk as far as he could make it out she seemed to imply that with a perfect confidence in her mothers affection and sagacity she had no pronounced antipathy for the person of general dhubert and that this was quite sufficient for a wellbroughtup dutiful young lady to begin married life upon this view hurt and tormented the pride of general dhubert and yet he asked himself with a sort of sweet despair what more could he expect she had a quiet and luminous forehead her violet eyes laughed while the lines of her lips and chin remained composed in an admirable gravity all this was set off by such a glorious mass of fair hair by a complexion so marvellous by such a grace of expression that general dhubert really never found the opportunity to examine with sufficient detachment the lofty exigencies of his pride in fact he became shy of that line of inquiry since it had led once or twice to a crisis of solitary passion in which it was borne upon him that he loved her enough to kill her rather than lose her from such passages not unknown to men of forty he would come out broken exhausted remorseful a little dismayed he derived however considerable comfort from the quietist practice of sitting up now and then half the night by an open window and meditating upon the wonder of her existence like a believer lost in the mystic contemplation of his faith  it must not be supposed that all these variations of his inward state were made manifest to the world general dhubert found no difficulty in appearing wreathed in smiles because in fact he was very happy he followed the established rules of his condition sending over flowers from his sisters garden and hothouses early every morning and a little later following himself to have lunch with his intended her mother and her √©migr√© uncle the middle of the day was spent in strolling or sitting in the shade a watchful deferential gallantry trembling on the verge of tenderness was the note of their intercourse on his sidewith a playful turn of the phrase concealing the profound trouble of his whole being caused by her inaccessible nearness late in the afternoon general dhubert walked home between the fields of vines sometimes intensely miserable sometimes supremely happy sometimes pensively sad but always feeling a special intensity of existence that elation common to artists poets and lovers to men haunted by a great passion by a noble thought or a new vision of plastic beauty  the outward world at that time did not exist with any special distinctness for general dhubert one evening however crossing a ridge from which he could see both houses general dhubert became aware of two figures far down the road the day had been divine the festal decoration of the inflamed sky cast a gentle glow on the sober tints of the southern land the gray rocks the brown fields the purple undulating distances harmonised in luminous accord exhaled already the scents of the evening the two figures down the road presented themselves like two rigid and wooden silhouettes all black on the ribbon of white dust general dhubert made out the long straightcut military capotes buttoned closely right up to the black stocks the cocked hats the lean carven brown countenancesold soldiersvieilles moustaches the taller of the two had a black patch over one eye the others hard dry countenance presented some bizarre disquieting peculiarity which on nearer approach proved to be the absence of the tip of the nose lifting their hands with one movement to salute the slightly lame civilian walking with a thick stick they inquired for the house where the general baron dhubert lived and what was the best way to get speech with him quietly  if you think this quiet enough said general dhubert looking round at the ripening vinefields framed in purple lines and dominated by the nest of gray and drab walls of a village clustering around the top of a steep conical hill so that the blunt church tower seemed but the shape of a crowning rockif you think this quiet enough you can speak to him at once and i beg you comrades to speak openly with perfect confidence  they stepped back at this and raised again their hands to their hats with marked ceremoniousness then the one with the chipped nose speaking for both remarked that the matter was confidential enough and to be arranged discreetly their general quarters were in that village over there where the infernal clodhoppersdamn their false royalist heartslooked remarkably crosseyed at three unassuming military men for the present he should only ask for the name of general dhuberts friends  what friends said the astonished general dhubert completely off the track i am staying with my brotherinlaw over there  well he will do for one suggested the chipped veteran  were the friends of general feraud interjected the other who had kept silent till then only glowering with his one eye at the man who had never loved the emperor that was something to look at for even the goldlaced judases who had sold him to the english the marshals and princes had loved him at some time or other but this man had never loved the emperor general feraud had said so distinctly  general dhubert felt a sort of inward blow in his chest for an infinitesimal fraction of a second it was as if the spinning of the earth had become perceptible with an awful slight rustle in the eternal stillness of space but that was the noise of the blood in his ears and passed off at once involuntarily he murmured  feraud i had forgotten his existence  hes existing at present very uncomfortably it is true in the infamous inn of that nest of savages up there said the oneeyed cuirassier drily we arrived in your parts an hour ago on post horses hes awaiting our return with impatience there is hurry you know the general has broken the ministerial order of sojourn to obtain from you the satisfaction hes entitled to by the laws of honour and naturally hes anxious to have it all over before the gendarmerie gets the scent  the other elucidated the idea a little further  get back on the quietyou understand phitt no one the wiser we have broken out too your friend the king would be glad to cut off our scurvy pittances at the first chance its a risk but honour before everything  general dhubert had recovered his power of speech  so you come like this along the road to invite me to a throatcutting match with thatthat a laughing sort of rage took possession of him  ha ha ha ha  his fists on his hips he roared without restraint while they stood before him lank and straight as unexpected as though they had been shot up with a snap through a trapdoor in the ground only fourandtwenty months ago the masters of europe they had already the air of antique ghosts they seemed less substantial in their faded coats than their own narrow shadows falling so black across the white roadthe military and grotesque shadows of twenty years of war and conquests they had the outlandish appearance of two imperturbable bronzes of the religion of the sword and general dhubert also one of the exmasters of europe laughed at these serious phantoms standing in his way  said one indicating the laughing general with a jerk of the head  a merry companion that  there are some of us that havent smiled from the day the other went away said his comrade  a violent impulse to set upon and beat these unsubstantial wraiths to the ground frightened general dhubert he ceased laughing suddenly his urgent desire now was to get rid of them to get them away from his sight quickly before he lost control of himself he wondered at this fury he felt rising in his breast but he had no time to look into that peculiarity just then  i understand your wish to be done with me as quickly as possible then why waste time in empty ceremonies do you see that wood there at the foot of that slope yes the wood of pines let us meet there tomorrow at sunrise i will bring with me my sword or my pistols or both if you like  the seconds of general feraud looked at each other  pistols general said the cuirassier  so be it au revoirtomorrow morning till then let me advise you to keep close if you dont want the gendarmerie making inquiries about you before dark strangers are rare in this part of the country  they saluted in silence general dhubert turning his back on their retreating figures stood still in the middle of the road for a long time biting his lower lip and looking on the ground then he began to walk straight before him thus retracing his steps till he found himself before the park gate of his intendeds home motionless he stared through the bars at the front of the house gleaming clear beyond the thickets and trees footsteps were heard on the gravel and presently a tall stooping shape emerged from the lateral alley following the inner side of the park wall  le chevalier de valmassigue uncle of the adorable ad√®le exbrigadier in the army of the princes bookbinder in altona afterwards shoemaker with a great reputation for elegance in the fit of ladies shoes in another small german town wore silk stockings on his lean shanks low shoes with silver buckles a brocaded waistcoat a longskirted coat √† la fran√ßaise covered loosely his bowed back a small threecornered hat rested on a lot of powdered hair tied behind in a queue  monsieur le chevalier called general dhubert softly  what you again here mon ami have you forgotten something  by heavens thats just it i have forgotten something i am come to tell you of it nooutside behind this wall its too ghastly a thing to be let in at all where she lives  the chevalier came out at once with that benevolent resignation some old people display towards the fugue of youth older by a quarter of a century than general dhubert he looked upon him in the secret of his heart as a rather troublesome youngster in love he had heard his enigmatical words very well but attached no undue importance to what a mere man of forty so hard hit was likely to do or say the turn of mind of the generation of frenchmen grown up during the years of his exile was almost unintelligible to him their sentiments appeared to him unduly violent lacking fineness and measure their language needlessly exaggerated he joined the general on the road and they made a few steps in silence the general trying to master his agitation and get proper control of his voice  chevalier it is perfectly true i forgot something i forgot till half an hour ago that i had an urgent affair of honour on my hands its incredible but so it is  all was still for a moment then in the profound evening silence of the countryside the thin aged voice of the chevalier was heard trembling slightly  monsieur thats an indignity  it was his first thought the girl born during his exile the posthumous daughter of his poor brother murdered by a band of jacobins had grown since his return very dear to his old heart which had been starving on mere memories of affection for so many years  it is an inconceivable thingi say a man settles such affairs before he thinks of asking for a young girls hand why if you had forgotten for ten days longer you would have been married before your memory returned to you in my time men did not forget such thingsnor yet whats due to the feelings of an innocent young woman if i did not respect them myself i would qualify your conduct in a way which you would not like  general dhubert relieved himself frankly by a groan  dont let that consideration prevent you you run no risk of offending her mortally  but the old man paid no attention to this lovers nonsense its doubtful whether he even heard  what is it he asked whats the nature of  call it a youthful folly monsieur le chevalier an inconceivable incredible result of  he stopped short he will never believe the story he thought he will only think i am taking him for a fool and get offended general dhubert spoke up again yes originating in youthful folly it has become  the chevalier interrupted well then it must be arranged  arranged  yes no matter what it may cost your amour propre you should have remembered you were engaged you forgot that too i suppose and then you go and forget your quarrel its the most revolting exhibition of levity i ever heard of  good heavens chevalier you dont imagine i have been picking up that quarrel last time i was in paris or anything of the sort do you  eh what matters the precise date of your insane conduct exclaimed the chevalier testily the principal thing is to arrange it  noticing general dhubert getting restive and trying to place a word the old √©migr√© raised his arm and added with dignity  ive been a soldier too i would never dare to suggest a doubtful step to the man whose name my niece is to bear i tell you that entre gallants hommes an affair can be always arranged  but saperlotte monsieur le chevalier its fifteen or sixteen years ago i was a lieutenant of hussars then  the old chevalier seemed confounded by the vehemently despairing tone of this information  you were a lieutenant of hussars sixteen years ago he mumbled in a dazed manner  why yes you did not suppose i was made a general in my cradle like a royal prince  in the deepening purple twilight of the fields spread with vine leaves backed by a low band of sombre crimson in the west the voice of the old exofficer in the army of the princes sounded collected punctiliously civil  do i dream is this a pleasantry or do you mean me to understand that you have been hatching an affair of honour for sixteen years  it has clung to me for that length of time that is my precise meaning the quarrel itself is not to be explained easily we have been on the ground several times during that time of course  what manners what horrible perversion of manliness nothing can account for such inhumanity but the sanguinary madness of the revolution which has tainted a whole generation mused the returned √©migr√© in a low tone who is your adversary he asked a little louder  what my adversary his name is feraud shadowy in his tricorne and oldfashioned clothes like a bowed thin ghost of the ancien r√©gime the chevalier voiced a ghostly memory  i can remember the feud about little sophie derval between monsieur de brissac captain in the bodyguards and danjorrant not the pockmarked one the other the beau danjorrant as they called him they met three times in eighteen months in a most gallant manner it was the fault of that little sophie too who would keep on playing  this is nothing of the kind interrupted general dhubert he laughed a little sardonically not at all so simple he added nor yet half so reasonable he finished inaudibly between his teeth and ground them with rage  after this sound nothing troubled the silence for a long time till the chevalier asked without animation  what is hethis feraud  lieutenant of hussars tooi mean hes a general a gascon son of a blacksmith i believe  there i thought so that bonaparte had a special predilection for the canaille i dont mean this for you dhubert you are one of us though you have served this usurper who  lets leave him out of this broke in general dhubert  the chevalier shrugged his peaked shoulders  a feraud of sorts offspring of a blacksmith and some village troll see what comes of mixing yourself up with that sort of people  you have made shoes yourself chevalier  yes but i am not the son of a shoemaker neither are you monsieur dhubert you and i have something that your bonapartes princes dukes and marshals have not because theres no power on earth that could give it to them retorted the √©migr√© with the rising animation of a man who has got hold of a hopeful argument those people dont existall these ferauds feraud what is feraud a vanupieds disguised into a general by a corsican adventurer masquerading as an emperor there is no earthly reason for a dhubert to sencanailler by a duel with a person of that sort you can make your excuses to him perfectly well and if the manant takes it into his head to decline them you may simply refuse to meet him you say i may do that yes with the clearest conscience monsieur le chevalier to what do you think you have returned from your emigration  this was said in such a startling tone that the old exile raised sharply his bowed head glimmering silvery white under the points of the little tricorne for a long time he made no sound  god knows he said at last pointing with a slow and grave gesture at a tall roadside cross mounted on a block of stone and stretching its arms of forged stone all black against the darkening red band in the sky god knows if it were not for this emblem which i remember seeing in this spot as a child i would wonder to what we who have remained faithful to our god and our king have returned the very voices of the people have changed  yes it is a changed france said general dhubert he had regained his calm his tone was slightly ironic therefore i cannot take your advice besides how is one to refuse to be bitten by a dog that means to bite its impracticable take my word for it he isnt a man to be stopped by apologies or refusals but there are other ways i could for instance send a mounted messenger with a word to the brigadier of the gendarmerie in senlac these fellows are liable to arrest on my simple order it would make some talk in the army both the organised and the disbanded especially the disbanded all canaille all my comrades oncethe companions in arms of armand dhubert but what need a dhubert care what people who dont exist may think or better still i might get my brotherinlaw to send for the mayor of the village and give him a hint no more would be needed to get the three brigands set upon with flails and pitchforks and hunted into some nice deep wet ditch and nobody the wiser it has been done only ten miles from here to three poor devils of the disbanded red lancers of the guard going to their homes what says your conscience chevalier can a dhubert do that thing to three men who do not exist  a few stars had come out on the blue obscurity clear as crystal of the sky the dry thin voice of the chevalier spoke harshly  why are you telling me all this  the general seized a withered frail old hand with a strong grip  because i owe you my fullest confidence who could tell ad√®le but you you understand why i dare not trust my brotherinlaw nor yet my own sister chevalier i have been so near doing these things that i tremble yet you dont know how terrible this duel appears to me and theres no escape from it  he murmured after a pause its a fatality dropped the chevaliers passive hand and said in his ordinary conversational voice  i shall have to go without seconds if it is my lot to remain on the ground you at least will know all that can be made known of this affair  the shadowy ghost of the ancien r√©gime seemed to have become more bowed during the conversation  how am i to keep an indifferent face this evening before those two women he groaned general i find it very difficult to forgive you  general dhubert made no answer  is your cause good at least  i am innocent  this time he seized the chevaliers ghostly arm above the elbow gave it a mighty squeeze  i must kill him he hissed and opening his hand strode away down the road  the delicate attentions of his adoring sister had secured for the general perfect liberty of movement in the house where he was a guest he had even his own entrance through a small door in one corner of the orangery thus he was not exposed that evening to the necessity of dissembling his agitation before the calm ignorance of the other inmates he was glad of it it seemed to him that if he had to open his lips he would break out into horrible imprecation start breaking furniture smashing china and glasses from the moment he opened the private door and while ascending the twentyeight steps of winding staircase giving access to the corridor on which his room opened he went through a horrible and humiliating scene in which an infuriated madman with bloodshot eyes and a foaming mouth played inconceivable havoc with everything inanimate that may be found in a wellappointed dining room when he opened the door of his apartment the fit was over and his bodily fatigue was so great that he had to catch at the backs of the chairs as he crossed the room to reach a low and broad divan on which he let himself fall heavily his moral prostration was still greater that brutality of feeling which he had known only when charging sabre in hand amazed this man of forty who did not recognise in it the instinctive fury of his menaced passion it was the revolt of jeopardised desire in his mental and bodily exhaustion it got cleared fined down purified into a sentiment of melancholy despair at having perhaps to die before he had taught this beautiful girl to love him  on that night general dhubert either stretched on his back with his hands over his eyes or lying on his breast with his face buried in a cushion made the full pilgrimage of emotions nauseating disgust at the absurdity of the situation dread of the fate that could play such a vile trick on a man awe at the remote consequences of an apparently insignificant and ridiculous event in his past doubt of his own fitness to conduct his existence and mistrust of his best sentimentsfor what the devil did he want to go to fouch√© forhe knew them all in turn i am an idiot neither more nor less he thought a sensitive idiot because i overheard two men talk in a caf√© i am an idiot afraid of lieswhereas in life it is only truth that matters  several times he got up and walking about in his socks so as not to be heard by anybody downstairs drank all the water he could find in the dark and he tasted the torments of jealousy too she would marry somebody else his very soul writhed the tenacity of that feraud the awful persistence of that imbecile brute came to him with the tremendous force of a relentless fatality general dhubert trembled as he put down the empty water ewer he will have me he thought general dhubert was tasting every emotion that life has to give he had in his dry mouth the faint sickly flavour of fear not the honourable fear of a young girls candid and amused glance but the fear of death and the honourable mans fear of cowardice  but if true courage consists in going out to meet an odious danger from which our body soul and heart recoil together general dhubert had the opportunity to practise it for the first time in his life he had charged exultingly at batteries and infantry squares and ridden with messages through a hail of bullets without thinking anything about it his business now was to sneak out unheard at break of day to an obscure and revolting death general dhubert never hesitated he carried two pistols in a leather bag which he slung over his shoulder before he had crossed the garden his mouth was dry again he picked two oranges it was only after shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness  he stepped out disregarding it and after going a few yards regained the command of his legs he sucked an orange as he walked it was a colourless and pellucid dawn the wood of pines detached its columns of brown trunks and its darkgreen canopy very clearly against the rocks of the gray hillside behind he kept his eyes fixed on it steadily that temperamental goodhumoured coolness in the face of danger which made him an officer liked by his men and appreciated by his superiors was gradually asserting itself it was like going into battle arriving at the edge of the wood he sat down on a boulder holding the other orange in his hand and thought that he had come ridiculously early on the ground before very long however he heard the swishing of bushes footsteps on the hard ground and the sounds of a disjointed loud conversation a voice somewhere behind him said boastfully hes game for my bag  he thought to himself here they are whats this about game are they talking of me and becoming aware of the orange in his hand he thought further these are very good oranges leonies own tree i may just as well eat this orange instead of flinging it away  emerging from a tangle of rocks and bushes general feraud and his seconds discovered general dhubert engaged in peeling the orange they stood still waiting till he looked up then the seconds raised their hats and general feraud putting his hands behind his back walked aside a little way  i am compelled to ask one of you messieurs to act for me i have brought no friends will you  the oneeyed cuirassier said judicially  that cannot be refused  the other veteran remarked  its awkward all the same  owing to the state of the peoples minds in this part of the country there was no one i could trust with the object of your presence here explained general dhubert urbanely they saluted looked round and remarked both together  poor ground  its unfit  why bother about ground measurements and so on let us simplify matters load the two pairs of pistols i will take those of general feraud and let him take mine or better still let us take a mixed pair one of each pair then we will go into the wood while you remain outside we did not come here for ceremonies but for war war to the death any ground is good enough for that if i fall you must leave me where i lie and clear out it wouldnt be healthy for you to be found hanging about here after that  it appeared after a short parley that general feraud was willing to accept these conditions while the seconds were loading the pistols he could be heard whistling and was seen to rub his hands with an air of perfect contentment he flung off his coat briskly and general dhubert took off his own and folded it carefully on a stone  suppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood and let him enter exactly in ten minutes from now suggested general dhubert calmly but feeling as if he were giving directions for his own execution this however was his last moment of weakness  wait let us compare watches first  he pulled out his own the officer with the chipped nose went over to borrow the watch of general feraud they bent their heads over them for a time  thats it at four minutes to five by yours seven to by mine  it was the cuirassier who remained by the side of general dhubert keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch he held in the palm of his hand he opened his mouth wide waiting for the beat of the last second long before he snapped out the word  avancez  general dhubert moved on passing from the glaring sunshine of the proven√ßal morning into the cool and aromatic shade of the pines the ground was clear between the reddish trunks whose multitude leaning at slightly different angles confused his eye at first it was like going into battle the commanding quality of confidence in himself woke up in his breast he was all to his affair the problem was how to kill his adversary nothing short of that would free him from this imbecile nightmare its no use wounding that brute he thought he was known as a resourceful officer his comrades years ago used to call him the strategist and it was a fact that he could think in the presence of the enemy whereas feraud had been always a mere fighter but a dead shot unluckily  i must draw his fire at the greatest possible range said general dhubert to himself  at that moment he saw something white moving far off between the trees the shirt of his adversary he stepped out at once between the trunks exposing himself freely then quick as lightning leaped back it had been a risky move but it succeeded in its object almost simultaneously with the pop of a shot a small piece of bark chipped off by the bullet stung his ear painfully  and now general feraud with one shot expended was getting cautious peeping round his sheltering tree general dhubert could not see him at all this ignorance of his adversarys whereabouts carried with it a sense of insecurity general dhubert felt himself exposed on his flanks and rear again something white fluttered in his sight ha the enemy was still on his front then he had feared a turning movement but apparently general feraud was not thinking of it general dhubert saw him pass without special haste from one tree to another in the straight line of approach with great firmness of mind general dhubert stayed his hand too far yet he knew he was no marksman his must be a waiting gameto kill  he sank down to the ground wishing to take advantage of the greater thickness of the trunk extended at full length head on to his enemy he kept his person completely protected exposing himself would not do now because the other was too near by this time a conviction that feraud would presently do something rash was like balm to general dhuberts soul but to keep his chin raised off the ground was irksome and not much use either he peeped round exposing a fraction of his head with dread but really with little risk his enemy as a matter of fact did not expect to see anything of him so low down as that general dhubert caught a fleeting view of general feraud shifting trees again with deliberate caution he despises my shooting he thought with that insight into the mind of his antagonist which is of such great help in winning battles it confirmed him in his tactics of immobility ah if i only could watch my rear as well as my front he thought longing for the impossible  it required some fortitude to lay his pistols down but on a sudden impulse general dhubert did this very gentlyone on each side he had been always looked upon as a bit of a dandy because he used to shave and put on a clean shirt on the days of battle as a matter of fact he had been always very careful of his personal appearance in a man of nearly forty in love with a young and charming girl this praiseworthy selfrespect may run to such little weaknesses as for instance being provided with an elegant leather folding case containing a small ivory comb and fitted with a piece of lookingglass on the outside general dhubert his hands being free felt in his breeches pockets for that implement of innocent vanity excusable in the possessor of long silky moustaches he drew it out and then with the utmost coolness and promptitude turned himself over on his back in this new attitude his head raised a little holding the lookingglass in one hand just clear of his tree he squinted into it with one eye while the other kept a direct watch on the rear of his position thus was proved napoleons saying that for a french soldier the word impossible does not exist he had the right tree nearly filling the field of his little mirror  if he moves from there he said to himself exultingly i am bound to see his legs and in any case he cant come upon me unawares  and sure enough he saw the boots of general feraud flash in and out eclipsing for an instant everything else reflected in the little mirror he shifted its position accordingly but having to form his judgment of the change from that indirect view he did not realise that his own feet and a portion of his legs were now in plain and startling view of general feraud  general feraud had been getting gradually impressed by the amazing closeness with which his enemy had been keeping cover he had spotted the right tree with bloodthirsty precision he was absolutely certain of it and yet he had not been able to sight as much as the tip of an ear as he had been looking for it at the level of about five feet ten inches it was no great wonderbut it seemed very wonderful to general feraud  the first view of these feet and legs determined a rush of blood to his head he literally staggered behind his tree and had to steady himself with his hand the other was lying on the groundon the ground perfectly still too exposed what did it mean the notion that he had knocked his adversary over at the first shot then entered general ferauds head once there it grew with every second of attentive gazing overshadowing every other suppositionirresistibletriumphantferocious  what an ass i was to think i could have missed him he said to himself he was exposed en pleinthe foolfor quite a couple of seconds  and the general gazed at the motionless limbs the last vestiges of surprise fading before an unbounded admiration of his skill  turned up his toes by the god of war that was a shot he continued mentally got it through the head just where i aimed staggered behind that tree rolled over on his back and died  and he stared he stared forgetting to move almost awed almost sorry but for nothing in the world would he have had it undone such a shot such a shot rolled over on his back and died  for it was this helpless position lying on the back that shouted its sinister evidence at general feraud he could not possibly imagine that it might have been deliberately assumed by a living man it was inconceivable it was beyond the range of sane supposition there was no possibility to guess the reason for it and it must be said that general dhuberts turnedup feet looked thoroughly dead general feraud expanded his lungs for a stentorian shout to his seconds but from what he felt to be an excessive scrupulousness refrained for a while  i will just go and see first whether he breathes yet he mumbled to himself stepping out from behind his tree this was immediately perceived by the resourceful general dhubert he concluded it to be another shift when he lost the boots out of the field of the mirror he became uneasy general feraud had only stepped a little out of the line but his adversary could not possibly have supposed him walking up with perfect unconcern general dhubert beginning to wonder where the other had dodged to was come upon so suddenly that the first warning he had of his danger consisted in the long earlymorning shadow of his enemy falling aslant on his outstretched legs he had not even heard a footfall on the soft ground between the trees  it was too much even for his coolness he jumped up instinctively leaving the pistols on the ground the irresistible instinct of most people unless totally paralysed by discomfiture would have been to stoopexposing themselves to the risk of being shot down in that position instinct of course is irreflective it is its very definition but it may be an inquiry worth pursuing whether in reflective mankind the mechanical promptings of instinct are not affected by the customary mode of thought years ago in his young days armand dhubert the reflective promising officer had emitted the opinion that in warfare one should never cast back on the lines of a mistake this idea afterward restated defended developed in many discussions had settled into one of the stock notions of his brain became a part of his mental individuality and whether it had gone so inconceivably deep as to affect the dictates of his instinct or simply because as he himself declared he was too scared to remember the confounded pistols the fact is that general dhubert never attempted to stoop for them instead of going back on his mistake he seized the rough trunk with both hands and swung himself behind it with such impetuosity that going right round in the very flash and report of a pistol shot he reappeared on the other side of the tree face to face with general feraud who completely unstrung by such a show of agility on the part of a dead man was trembling yet a very faint mist of smoke hung before his face which had an extraordinary aspect as if the lower jaw had come unhinged  not missed he croaked hoarsely from the depths of a dry throat  this sinister sound loosened the spell which had fallen on general dhuberts senses  yes misseda bout portant he heard himself saying exultingly almost before he had recovered the full command of his faculties the revulsion of feeling was accompanied by a gust of homicidal fury resuming in its violence the accumulated resentment of a lifetime for years general dhubert had been exasperated and humiliated by an atrocious absurdity imposed upon him by that mans savage caprice besides general dhubert had been in this last instance too unwilling to confront death for the reaction of his anguish not to take the shape of a desire to kill  and i have my two shots to fire yet he added pitilessly  general feraud snapped his teeth and his face assumed an irate undaunted expression  go on he growled  these would have been his last words on earth if general dhubert had been holding the pistols in his hand but the pistols were lying on the ground at the foot of a tall pine general dhubert had the seconds leisure necessary to remember that he had dreaded death not as a man but as a lover not as a danger but as a rivalnot as a foe to life but as an obstacle to marriage and behold there was the rival defeated miserably defeatedcrusheddone for  he picked up the weapons mechanically and instead of firing them into general ferauds breast gave expression to the thought uppermost in his mind  you will fight no more duels now  illustration frontispiece166jpg you will fight no more duels now  his tone of leisurely ineffable satisfaction was too much for general ferauds stoicism  dont dawdle then damn you for a coldblooded staffcoxcomb he roared out suddenly out of an impassive face held erect on a rigid body  general dhubert uncocked the pistols carefully this proceeding was observed with a sort of gloomy astonishment by the other general  you missed me twice he began coolly shifting both pistols to one hand the last time within a foot or so by every rule of single combat your life belongs to me that does not mean that i want to take it now  i have no use for your forbearance muttered general feraud savagely  allow me to point out that this is no concern of mine said general dhubert whose every word was dictated by a consummate delicacy of feeling in anger he could have killed that man but in cold blood he recoiled from humiliating this unreasonable beinga fellow soldier of the grand arm√©e his companion in the wonders and terrors of the military epic you dont set up the pretension of dictating to me what i am to do with what is my own  general feraud looked startled and the other continued  youve forced me on a point of honour to keep my life at your disposal as it were for fifteen years very well now that the matter is decided to my advantage i am going to do what i like with your life on the same principle you shall keep it at my disposal as long as i choose neither more nor less you are on your honour  i am but sacrebleu this is an absurd position for a general of the empire to be placed in cried general feraud in the accents of profound and dismayed conviction it means for me to be sitting all the rest of my life with a loaded pistol in a drawer waiting for your word its its idiotic i shall be an object of of derision  absurd idiotic do you think so queried argumentatively general dhubert with sly gravity perhaps but i dont see how that can be helped however i am not likely to talk at large of this adventure nobody need ever know anything about it just as no one to this day i believe knows the origin of our quarrel not a word more he added hastily i cant really discuss this question with a man who as far as i am concerned does not exist  when the duellists came out into the open general feraud walking a little behind and rather with the air of walking in a trance the two seconds hurried towards them each from his station at the edge of the wood general dhubert addressed them speaking loud and distinctly  messieurs i make it a point of declaring to you solemnly in the presence of general feraud that our difference is at last settled for good you may inform all the world of that fact  a reconciliation after all they exclaimed together  reconciliation not that exactly it is something much more binding is it not so general  general feraud only lowered his head in sign of assent the two veterans looked at each other later in the day when they found themselves alone out of their moody friends earshot the cuirassier remarked suddenly  generally speaking i can see with my one eye as far or even a little farther than most people but this beats me he wont say anything  in this affair of honour i understand there has been from first to last always something that no one in the army could quite make out declared the chasseur with the imperfect nose in mystery it began in mystery it went on and in mystery it is to end apparently  general dhubert walked home with long hasty strides by no means uplifted by a sense of triumph he had conquered but it did not seem to him he had gained very much by his conquest the night before he had grudged the risk of his life which appeared to him magnificent worthy of preservation as an opportunity to win a girls love he had even moments when by a marvellous illusion this love seemed to him already his and his threatened life a still more magnificent opportunity of devotion now that his life was safe it had suddenly lost it special magnificence it wore instead a specially alarming aspect as a snare for the exposure of unworthiness as to the marvellous illusion of conquered love that had visited him for a moment in the agitated watches of the night which might have been his last on earth he comprehended now its true nature it had been merely a paroxysm of delirious conceit thus to this man sobered by the victorious issue of a duel life appeared robbed of much of its charm simply because it was no longer menaced  approaching the house from the back through the orchard and the kitchen gardens he could not notice the agitation which reigned in front he never met a single soul only upstairs while walking softly along the corridor he became aware that the house was awake and much more noisy than usual names of servants were being called out down below in a confused noise of coming and going he noticed with some concern that the door of his own room stood ajar though the shutters had not been opened yet he had hoped that his early excursion would have passed unperceived he expected to find some servant just gone in but the sunshine filtering through the usual cracks enabled him to see lying on the low divan something bulky which had the appearance of two women clasped in each others arms tearful and consolatory murmurs issued mysteriously from that appearance general dhubert pulled open the nearest pair of shutters violently one of the women then jumped up it was his sister she stood for a moment with her hair hanging down and her arms raised straight up above her head and then flung herself with a stifled cry into his arms he returned her embrace trying at the same time to disengage himself from it the other woman had not risen she seemed on the contrary to cling closer to the divan hiding her face in the cushions her hair was also loose it was admirably fair general dhubert recognised it with staggering emotion mlle de valmassigue ad√®le in distress  he became greatly alarmed and got rid of his sisters hug definitely madame l√©onie then extended her shapely bare arm out of her peignoir pointing dramatically at the divan  this poor terrified child has rushed here two miles from home on footrunning all the way  what on earth has happened asked general dhubert in a low agitated voice but madame l√©onie was speaking loudly  she rang the great bell at the gate and roused all the householdwe were all asleep yet you may imagine what a terrible shock ad√®le my dear child sit up  general dhuberts expression was not that of a man who imagines with facility he did however fish out of chaos the notion that his prospective motherinlaw had died suddenly but only to dismiss it at once he could not conceive the nature of the event of the catastrophe which could induce mlle de valmassigue living in a house full of servants to bring the news over the fields herself two miles running all the way  but why are you in this room he whispered full of awe  of course i ran up to see and this child i did not notice itshe followed me its that absurd chevalier went on madame l√©onie looking towards the divan her hairs come down you may imagine she did not stop to call her maid to dress it before she started ad√®le my dear sit up he blurted it all out to her at halfpast four in the morning she woke up early and opened her shutters to breathe the fresh air and saw him sitting collapsed on a garden bench at the end of the great alley at that houryou may imagine and the evening before he had declared himself indisposed she just hurried on some clothes and flew down to him one would be anxious for less he loves her but not very intelligently he had been up all night fully dressed the poor old man perfectly exhausted he wasnt in a state to invent a plausible story what a confidant you chose there my husband was furious he said we cant interfere now so we sat down to wait it was awful and this poor child running over here publicly with her hair loose she has been seen by people in the fields she has roused the whole household too its awkward for her luckily you are to be married next week ad√®le sit up he has come home on his own legs thank god we expected you to come back on a stretcher perhapswhat do i know go and see if the carriage is ready i must take this child to her mother at once it isnt proper for her to stay here a minute longer  general dhubert did not move it was as though he had heard nothing madame l√©onie changed her mind  i will go and see to it myself she said i want also to get my cloak ad√®le she began but did not say sit up she went out saying in a loud cheerful tone i leave the door open  general dhubert made a movement towards the divan but then ad√®le sat up and that checked him dead he thought i havent washed this morning i must look like an old tramp theres earth on the back of my coat and pine needles in my hair it occurred to him that the situation required a good deal of circumspection on his part  i am greatly concerned mademoiselle he began timidly and abandoned that line she was sitting up on the divan with her cheeks unusually pink and her hair brilliantly fair falling all over her shoulderswhich was a very novel sight to the general he walked away up the room and looking out of the window for safety said i fear you must think i behaved like a madman in accents of sincere despair then he spun round and noticed that she had followed him with her eyes they were not cast down on meeting his glance and the expression of her face was novel to him also it was one might have said reversed her eyes looked at him with grave thoughtfulness while the exquisite lines of her mouth seemed to suggest a restrained smile this change made her transcendental beauty much less mysterious much more accessible to a mans comprehension an amazing ease of mind came to the generaland even some ease of manner he walked down the room with as much pleasurable excitement as he would have found in walking up to a battery vomiting death fire and smoke then stood looking down with smiling eyes at the girl whose marriage with him next week had been so carefully arranged by the wise the good the admirable l√©onie  ah mademoiselle he said in a tone of courtly deference if i could be certain that you did not come here this morning only from a sense of duty to your mother  he waited for an answer imperturbable but inwardly elated it came in a demure murmur eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect  you mustnt be m√©chant as well as mad  and then general dhubert made an aggressive movement towards the divan which nothing could check this piece of furniture was not exactly in the line of the open door but madame l√©onie coming back wrapped up in a light cloak and carrying a lace shawl on her arm for ad√®le to hide her incriminating hair under had a vague impression of her brother gettingup from his knees  come along my dear child she cried from the doorway  the general now himself again in the fullest sense showed the readiness of a resourceful cavalry officer and the peremptoriness of a leader of men  you dont expect her to walk to the carriage he protested she isnt fit i will carry her downstairs  this he did slowly followed by his awed and respectful sister but he rushed back like a whirlwind to wash away all the signs of the night of anguish and the morning of war and to put on the festive garments of a conqueror before hurrying over to the other house had it not been for that general dhubert felt capable of mounting a horse and pursuing his late adversary in order simply to embrace him from excess of happiness i owe this piece of luck to that stupid brute he thought this duel has made plain in one morning what might have taken me years to find outfor i am a timid fool no selfconfidence whatever perfect coward and the chevalier dear old man general dhubert longed to embrace him too  the chevalier was in bed for several days he was much indisposed the men of the empire and the postrevolution young ladies were too much for him he got up the day before the wedding and being curious by nature took his niece aside for a quiet talk he advised her to find out from her husband the true story of the affair of honour whose claim so imperative and so persistent had led her to within an ace of tragedy it is very proper that his wife should know and next month or so will be your time to learn from him anything you ought to know my dear child  later on when the married couple came on a visit to the mother of the bride madame la g√©n√©rale dhubert made no difficulty in communicating to her beloved old uncle what she had learned without any difficulty from her husband the chevalier listened with profound attention to the end then took a pinch of snuff shook the grains of tobacco off the frilled front of his shirt and said calmly and thats all what it was  yes uncle said madame la g√©n√©rale opening her pretty eyes very wide isnt it funny cest insens√©to think what men are capable of  hm commented the old √©migr√© it depends what sort of men that bonapartes soldiers were savages as a wife my dear it is proper for you to believe implicitly what your husband says  but to l√©onies husband the chevalier confided his true opinion if thats the tale the fellow made up for his wife and during the honeymoon too you may depend on it no one will ever know the secret of this affair  considerably later still general dhubert judged the time come and the opportunity propitious to write a conciliatory letter to general feraud i have never protested the general baron dhubert wished for your death during all the time of our deplorable quarrel allow me to give you back in all form your forfeited life we two who have been partners in so much military glory should be friendly to each other publicly  the same letter contained also an item of domestic information it was alluding to this last that general feraud answered from a little village on the banks of the garonne  if one of your boys names had been napoleon or joseph or even joachim i could congratulate you with a better heart as you have thought proper to name him charles henri armand i am confirmed in my conviction that you never loved the emperor the thought of that sublime hero chained to a rock in the middle of a savage ocean makes life of so little value that i would receive with positive joy your instructions to blow my brains out from suicide i consider myself in honour debarred but i keep a loaded pistol in my drawer  madame la g√©n√©rale dhubert lifted up her hands in horror after perusing that letter  you see he wont be reconciled said her husband we must take care that he never by any chance learns where the money he lives on comes from it would be simply appalling  you are a brave homme armand said madame la g√©n√©rale appreciatively  my dear i had the right to blow his brains outstrictly speaking but as i did not we cant let him starve he has been deprived of his pension for breach of military discipline when he broke bounds to fight his last duel with me hes crippled with rheumatism we are bound to take care of him to the end of his days and after all i am indebted to him for the radiant discovery that you loved me a littleyou sly person ha ha two miles running all the way it is extraordinary how all through this affair that man has managed to engage my deeper feelings  the end
