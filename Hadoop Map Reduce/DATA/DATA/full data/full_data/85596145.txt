85596145	illustration     second variety   by philip k dick   illustrated by ebel      the claws were bad enough in the first placenasty crawling     little deathrobots but when they began to imitate their     creators it was time for the human race to make peaceif it     could   the russian soldier made his way nervously up the ragged side of the hill holding his gun ready he glanced around him licking his dry lips his face set from time to time he reached up a gloved hand and wiped perspiration from his neck pushing down his coat collar  eric turned to corporal leone want him or can i have him he adjusted the view sight so the russians features squarely filled the glass the lines cutting across his hard somber features  leone considered the russian was close moving rapidly almost running dont fire wait leone tensed i dont think were needed  the russian increased his pace kicking ash and piles of debris out of his way he reached the top of the hill and stopped panting staring around him the sky was overcast drifting clouds of gray particles bare trunks of trees jutted up occasionally the ground was level and bare rubblestrewn with the ruins of buildings standing out here and there like yellowing skulls  the russian was uneasy he knew something was wrong he started down the hill now he was only a few paces from the bunker eric was getting fidgety he played with his pistol glancing at leone  dont worry leone said he wont get here theyll take care of him  are you sure hes got damn far  they hang around close to the bunker hes getting into the bad part get set  the russian began to hurry sliding down the hill his boots sinking into the heaps of gray ash trying to keep his gun up he stopped for a moment lifting his fieldglasses to his face  hes looking right at us eric said                                       the russian came on they could see his eyes like two blue stones his mouth was open a little he needed a shave his chin was stubbled on one bony cheek was a square of tape showing blue at the edge a fungoid spot his coat was muddy and torn one glove was missing as he ran his belt counter bounced up and down against him  leone touched erics arm here one comes  across the ground something small and metallic came flashing in the dull sunlight of midday a metal sphere it raced up the hill after the russian its treads flying it was small one of the baby ones its claws were out two razor projections spinning in a blur of white steel the russian heard it he turned instantly firing the sphere dissolved into particles but already a second had emerged and was following the first the russian fired again  a third sphere leaped up the russians leg clicking and whirring it jumped to the shoulder the spinning blades disappeared into the russians throat  eric relaxed well thats that god those damn things give me the creeps sometimes i think we were better off before  if we hadnt invented them they would have leone lit a cigarette shakily i wonder why a russian would come all this way alone i didnt see anyone covering him  lt scott came slipping up the tunnel into the bunker what happened something entered the screen  an ivan  just one  eric brought the view screen around scott peered into it now there were numerous metal spheres crawling over the prostrate body dull metal globes clicking and whirring sawing up the russian into small parts to be carried away  what a lot of claws scott murmured  they come like flies not much game for them any more  scott pushed the sight away disgusted like flies i wonder why he was out there they know we have claws all around  a larger robot had joined the smaller spheres it was directing operations a long blunt tube with projecting eyepieces there was not much left of the soldier what remained was being brought down the hillside by the host of claws  sir leone said if its all right id like to go out there and take a look at him  why  maybe he came with something  scott considered he shrugged all right but be careful  i have my tab leone patted the metal band at his wrist ill be out of bounds                                       he picked up his rifle and stepped carefully up to the mouth of the bunker making his way between blocks of concrete and steel prongs twisted and bent the air was cold at the top he crossed over the ground toward the remains of the soldier striding across the soft ash a wind blew around him swirling gray particles up in his face he squinted and pushed on  the claws retreated as he came close some of them stiffening into immobility he touched his tab the ivan would have given something for that short hard radiation emitted from the tab neutralized the claws put them out of commission even the big robot with its two waving eyestalks retreated respectfully as he approached  he bent down over the remains of the soldier the gloved hand was closed tightly there was something in it leone pried the fingers apart a sealed container aluminum still shiny  he put it in his pocket and made his way back to the bunker behind him the claws came back to life moving into operation again the procession resumed metal spheres moving through the gray ash with their loads he could hear their treads scrabbling against the ground he shuddered  scott watched intently as he brought the shiny tube out of his pocket he had that  in his hand leone unscrewed the top maybe you should look at it sir  scott took it he emptied the contents out in the palm of his hand a small piece of silk paper carefully folded he sat down by the light and unfolded it  whats it say sir eric said several officers came up the tunnel major hendricks appeared  major scott said look at this  hendricks read the slip this just come  a single runner just now  where is he hendricks asked sharply  the claws got him  major hendricks grunted here he passed it to his companions i think this is what weve been waiting for they certainly took their time about it  so they want to talk terms scott said are we going along with them  thats not for us to decide hendricks sat down wheres the communications officer i want the moon base  leone pondered as the communications officer raised the outside antenna cautiously scanning the sky above the bunker for any sign of a watching russian ship  sir scott said to hendricks its sure strange they suddenly came around weve been using the claws for almost a year now all of a sudden they start to fold  maybe claws have been getting down in their bunkers  one of the big ones the kind with stalks got into an ivan bunker last week eric said it got a whole platoon of them before they got their lid shut  how do you know  a buddy told me the thing came back withwith remains  moon base sir the communications officer said  on the screen the face of the lunar monitor appeared his crisp uniform contrasted to the uniforms in the bunker and he was clean shaven moon base  this is forward command lwhistle on terra let me have general thompson  the monitor faded presently general thompsons heavy features came into focus what is it major  our claws got a single russian runner with a message we dont know whether to act on itthere have been tricks like this in the past  whats the message  the russians want us to send a single officer on policy level over to their lines for a conference they dont state the nature of the conference they say that matters of he consulted the slip matters of grave urgency make it advisable that discussion be opened between a representative of the un forces and themselves  he held the message up to the screen for the general to scan thompsons eyes moved  what should we do hendricks said  send a man out  you dont think its a trap  it might be but the location they give for their forward command is correct its worth a try at any rate  ill send an officer out and report the results to you as soon as he returns  all right major thompson broke the connection the screen died up above the antenna came slowly down  hendricks rolled up the paper deep in thought  ill go leone said  they want somebody at policy level hendricks rubbed his jaw policy level i havent been outside in months maybe i could use a little air  dont you think its risky  hendricks lifted the view sight and gazed into it the remains of the russian were gone only a single claw was in sight it was folding itself back disappearing into the ash like a crab like some hideous metal crab  thats the only thing that bothers me hendricks rubbed his wrist i know im safe as long as i have this on me but theres something about them i hate the damn things i wish wed never invented them theres something wrong with them relentless little  if we hadnt invented them the ivans would have  hendricks pushed the sight back anyhow it seems to be winning the war i guess thats good  sounds like youre getting the same jitters as the ivans hendricks examined his wrist watch i guess i had better get started if i want to be there before dark                                       he took a deep breath and then stepped out onto the gray rubbled ground after a minute he lit a cigarette and stood gazing around him the landscape was dead nothing stirred he could see for miles endless ash and slag ruins of buildings a few trees without leaves or branches only the trunks above him the eternal rolling clouds of gray drifting between terra and the sun  major hendricks went on off to the right something scuttled something round and metallic a claw going licketysplit after something probably after a small animal a rat they got rats too as a sort of sideline  he came to the top of the little hill and lifted his fieldglasses the russian lines were a few miles ahead of him they had a forward command post there the runner had come from it  a squat robot with undulating arms passed by him its arms weaving inquiringly the robot went on its way disappearing under some debris hendricks watched it go he had never seen that type before there were getting to be more and more types he had never seen new varieties and sizes coming up from the underground factories  hendricks put out his cigarette and hurried on it was interesting the use of artificial forms in warfare how had they got started necessity the soviet union had gained great initial success usual with the side that got the war going most of north america had been blasted off the map retaliation was quick in coming of course the sky was full of circling discbombers long before the war began they had been up there for years the discs began sailing down all over russia within hours after washington got it                                       but that hadnt helped washington  the american bloc governments moved to the moon base the first year there was not much else to do europe was gone a slag heap with dark weeds growing from the ashes and bones most of north america was useless nothing could be planted no one could live a few million people kept going up in canada and down in south america but during the second year soviet parachutists began to drop a few at first then more and more they wore the first really effective antiradiation equipment what was left of american production moved to the moon along with the governments  all but the troops the remaining troops stayed behind as best they could a few thousand here a platoon there no one knew exactly where they were they stayed where they could moving around at night hiding in ruins in sewers cellars with the rats and snakes it looked as if the soviet union had the war almost won except for a handful of projectiles fired off from the moon daily there was almost no weapon in use against them they came and went as they pleased the war for all practical purposes was over nothing effective opposed them                                       and then the first claws appeared and overnight the complexion of the war changed  the claws were awkward at first slow the ivans knocked them off almost as fast as they crawled out of their underground tunnels but then they got better faster and more cunning factories all on terra turned them out factories a long way under ground behind the soviet lines factories that had once made atomic projectiles now almost forgotten  the claws got faster and they got bigger new types appeared some with feelers some that flew there were a few jumping kinds  the best technicians on the moon were working on designs making them more and more intricate more flexible they became uncanny the ivans were having a lot of trouble with them some of the little claws were learning to hide themselves burrowing down into the ash lying in wait  and then they started getting into the russian bunkers slipping down when the lids were raised for air and a look around one claw inside a bunker a churning sphere of blades and metalthat was enough and when one got in others followed with a weapon like that the war couldnt go on much longer  maybe it was already over  maybe he was going to hear the news maybe the politburo had decided to throw in the sponge too bad it had taken so long six years a long time for war like that the way they had waged it the automatic retaliation discs spinning down all over russia hundreds of thousands of them bacteria crystals the soviet guided missiles whistling through the air the chain bombs and now this the robots the claws  the claws werent like other weapons they were alive from any practical standpoint whether the governments wanted to admit it or not they were not machines they were living things spinning creeping shaking themselves up suddenly from the gray ash and darting toward a man climbing up him rushing for his throat and that was what they had been designed to do their job  they did their job well especially lately with the new designs coming up now they repaired themselves they were on their own radiation tabs protected the un troops but if a man lost his tab he was fair game for the claws no matter what his uniform down below the surface automatic machinery stamped them out human beings stayed a long way off it was too risky nobody wanted to be around them they were left to themselves and they seemed to be doing all right the new designs were faster more complex more efficient  apparently they had won the war                                       major hendricks lit a second cigarette the landscape depressed him nothing but ash and ruins he seemed to be alone the only living thing in the whole world to the right the ruins of a town rose up a few walls and heaps of debris he tossed the dead match away increasing his pace suddenly he stopped jerking up his gun his body tense for a minute it looked like  from behind the shell of a ruined building a figure came walking slowly toward him walking hesitantly  hendricks blinked stop  the boy stopped hendricks lowered his gun the boy stood silently looking at him he was small not very old perhaps eight but it was hard to tell most of the kids who remained were stunted he wore a faded blue sweater ragged with dirt and short pants his hair was long and matted brown hair it hung over his face and around his ears he held something in his arms  whats that you have hendricks said sharply  the boy held it out it was a toy a bear a teddy bear the boys eyes were large but without expression  hendricks relaxed i dont want it keep it  the boy hugged the bear again  where do you live hendricks said  in there  the ruins  yes  underground  yes  how many are there  howhow many  how many of you how bigs your settlement  the boy did not answer  hendricks frowned youre not all by yourself are you  the boy nodded  how do you stay alive  theres food  what kind of food  different  hendricks studied him how old are you  thirteen                                       it wasnt possible or was it the boy was thin stunted and probably sterile radiation exposure years straight no wonder he was so small his arms and legs were like pipecleaners knobby and thin hendricks touched the boys arm his skin was dry and rough radiation skin he bent down looking into the boys face there was no expression big eyes big and dark  are you blind hendricks said  no i can see some  how do you get away from the claws  the claws  the round things that run and burrow  i dont understand  maybe there werent any claws around a lot of areas were free they collected mostly around bunkers where there were people the claws had been designed to sense warmth warmth of living things  youre lucky hendricks straightened up well which way are you going backback there  can i come with you  with me hendricks folded his arms im going a long way miles i have to hurry he looked at his watch i have to get there by nightfall  i want to come  hendricks fumbled in his pack it isnt worth it here he tossed down the food cans he had with him you take these and go back okay  the boy said nothing  ill be coming back this way in a day or so if youre around here when i come back you can come along with me all right  i want to go with you now  its a long walk  i can walk  hendricks shifted uneasily it made too good a target two people walking along and the boy would slow him down but he might not come back this way and if the boy were really all alone  okay come along                                       the boy fell in beside him hendricks strode along the boy walked silently clutching his teddy bear  whats your name hendricks said after a time  david edward derring  david whatwhat happened to your mother and father  they died  how  in the blast  how long ago  six years  hendricks slowed down youve been alone six years  no there were other people for awhile they went away  and youve been alone since  yes  hendricks glanced down the boy was strange saying very little withdrawn but that was the way they were the children who had survived quiet stoic a strange kind of fatalism gripped them nothing came as a surprise they accepted anything that came along there was no longer any normal any natural course of things moral or physical for them to expect custom habit all the determining forces of learning were gone only brute experience remained  am i walking too fast hendricks said  no  how did you happen to see me  i was waiting  waiting hendricks was puzzled what were you waiting for  to catch things  what kind of things  things to eat  oh hendricks set his lips grimly a thirteen year old boy living on rats and gophers and halfrotten canned food down in a hole under the ruins of a town with radiation pools and claws and russian divemines up above coasting around in the sky  where are we going david asked  to the russian lines  russian  the enemy the people who started the war they dropped the first radiation bombs they began all this  the boy nodded his face showed no expression  im an american hendricks said  there was no comment on they went the two of them hendricks walking a little ahead david trailing behind him hugging his dirty teddy bear against his chest                                       about four in the afternoon they stopped to eat hendricks built a fire in a hollow between some slabs of concrete he cleared the weeds away and heaped up bits of wood the russians lines were not very far ahead around him was what had once been a long valley acres of fruit trees and grapes nothing remained now but a few bleak stumps and the mountains that stretched across the horizon at the far end and the clouds of rolling ash that blew and drifted with the wind settling over the weeds and remains of buildings walls here and there once in awhile what had been a road  hendricks made coffee and heated up some boiled mutton and bread here he handed bread and mutton to david david squatted by the edge of the fire his knees knobby and white he examined the food and then passed it back shaking his head  no  no dont you want any  no  hendricks shrugged maybe the boy was a mutant used to special food it didnt matter when he was hungry he would find something to eat the boy was strange but there were many strange changes coming over the world life was not the same anymore it would never be the same again the human race was going to have to realize that  suit yourself hendricks said he ate the bread and mutton by himself washing it down with coffee he ate slowly finding the food hard to digest when he was done he got to his feet and stamped the fire out  david rose slowly watching him with his youngold eyes  were going hendricks said  all right  hendricks walked along his gun in his arms they were close he was tense ready for anything the russians should be expecting a runner an answer to their own runner but they were tricky there was always the possibility of a slipup he scanned the landscape around him nothing but slag and ash a few hills charred trees concrete walls but someplace ahead was the first bunker of the russian lines the forward command underground buried deep with only a periscope showing a few gun muzzles maybe an antenna  will we be there soon david asked  yes getting tired  no  why then  david did not answer he plodded carefully along behind picking his way over the ash his legs and shoes were gray with dust his pinched face was streaked lines of gray ash in riverlets down the pale white of his skin there was no color to his face typical of the new children growing up in cellars and sewers and underground shelters                                       hendricks slowed down he lifted his fieldglasses and studied the ground ahead of him were they there someplace waiting for him watching him the way his men had watched the russian runner a chill went up his back maybe they were getting their guns ready preparing to fire the way his men had prepared made ready to kill  hendricks stopped wiping perspiration from his face damn it made him uneasy but he should be expected the situation was different  he strode over the ash holding his gun tightly with both hands behind him came david hendricks peered around tightlipped any second it might happen a burst of white light a blast carefully aimed from inside a deep concrete bunker  he raised his arm and waved it around in a circle  nothing moved to the right a long ridge ran topped with dead tree trunks a few wild vines had grown up around the trees remains of arbors and the eternal dark weeds hendricks studied the ridge was anything up there perfect place for a lookout he approached the ridge warily david coming silently behind if it were his command hed have a sentry up there watching for troops trying to infiltrate into the command area of course if it were his command there would be the claws around the area for full protection  he stopped feet apart hands on his hips  are we there david said  almost  why have we stopped  i dont want to take any chances hendricks advanced slowly now the ridge lay directly beside him along his right overlooking him his uneasy feeling increased if an ivan were up there he wouldnt have a chance he waved his arm again they should be expecting someone in the un uniform in response to the note capsule unless the whole thing was a trap  keep up with me he turned toward david dont drop behind  with you  up beside me were close we cant take any chances come on  ill be all right david remained behind him in the rear a few paces away still clutching his teddy bear  have it your way hendricks raised his glasses again suddenly tense for a momenthad something moved he scanned the ridge carefully everything was silent dead no life up there only tree trunks and ash maybe a few rats the big black rats that had survived the claws mutantsbuilt their own shelters out of saliva and ash some kind of plaster adaptation he started forward again                                       a tall figure came out on the ridge above him cloak flapping graygreen a russian behind him a second soldier appeared another russian both lifted their guns aiming  hendricks froze he opened his mouth the soldiers were kneeling sighting down the side of the slope a third figure had joined them on the ridge top a smaller figure in graygreen a woman she stood behind the other two  hendricks found his voice stop he waved up at them frantically im  the two russians fired behind hendricks there was a faint pop waves of heat lapped against him throwing him to the ground ash tore at his face grinding into his eyes and nose choking he pulled himself to his knees it was all a trap he was finished he had come to be killed like a steer the soldiers and the woman were coming down the side of the ridge toward him sliding down through the soft ash hendricks was numb his head throbbed awkwardly he got his rifle up and took aim it weighed a thousand tons he could hardly hold it his nose and cheeks stung the air was full of the blast smell a bitter acrid stench  dont fire the first russian said in heavily accented english  the three of them came up to him surrounding him put down your rifle yank the other said  hendricks was dazed everything had happened so fast he had been caught and they had blasted the boy he turned his head david was gone what remained of him was strewn across the ground  the three russians studied him curiously hendricks sat wiping blood from his nose picking out bits of ash he shook his head trying to clear it why did you do it he murmured thickly the boy  why one of the soldiers helped him roughly to his feet he turned hendricks around look  hendricks closed his eyes  look the two russians pulled him forward see hurry up there isnt much time to spare yank  hendricks looked and gasped  see now now do you understand                                       from the remains of david a metal wheel rolled relays glinting metal parts wiring one of the russians kicked at the heap of remains parts popped out rolling away wheels and springs and rods a plastic section fell in half charred hendricks bent shakily down the front of the head had come off he could make out the intricate brain wires and relays tiny tubes and switches thousands of minute studs  a robot the soldier holding his arm said we watched it tagging you  tagging me  thats their way they tag along with you into the bunker thats how they get in  hendricks blinked dazed but  come on they led him toward the ridge we cant stay here it isnt safe there must be hundreds of them all around here  the three of them pulled him up the side of the ridge sliding and slipping on the ash the woman reached the top and stood waiting for them  the forward command hendricks muttered i came to negotiate with the soviet  there is no more forward command they got in well explain they reached the top of the ridge were all thats left the three of us the rest were down in the bunker  this way down this way the woman unscrewed a lid a gray manhole cover set in the ground get in  hendricks lowered himself the two soldiers and the woman came behind him following him down the ladder the woman closed the lid after them bolting it tightly into place  good thing we saw you one of the two soldiers grunted it had tagged you about as far as it was going to                                       give me one of your cigarettes the woman said i havent had an american cigarette for weeks  hendricks pushed the pack to her she took a cigarette and passed the pack to the two soldiers in the corner of the small room the lamp gleamed fitfully the room was lowceilinged cramped the four of them sat around a small wood table a few dirty dishes were stacked to one side behind a ragged curtain a second room was partly visible hendricks saw the corner of a cot some blankets clothes hung on a hook  we were here the soldier beside him said he took off his helmet pushing his blond hair back im corporal rudi maxer polish impressed in the soviet army two years ago he held out his hand  hendricks hesitated and then shook major joseph hendricks  klaus epstein the other soldier shook with him a small dark man with thinning hair epstein plucked nervously at his ear austrian impressed god knows when i dont remember the three of us were here rudi and i with tasso he indicated the woman thats how we escaped all the rest were down in the bunker  andand they got in  epstein lit a cigarette first just one of them the kind that tagged you then it let others in  hendricks became alert the kind are there more than one kind  the little boy david david holding his teddy bear thats variety three the most effective  what are the other types  epstein reached into his coat here he tossed a packet of photographs onto the table tied with a string look for yourself  hendricks untied the string  you see rudi maxer said that was why we wanted to talk terms the russians i mean we found out about a week ago found out that your claws were beginning to make up new designs on their own new types of their own better types down in your underground factories behind our lines you let them stamp themselves repair themselves made them more and more intricate its your fault this happened                                       hendricks examined the photos they had been snapped hurriedly they were blurred and indistinct the first few showeddavid david walking along a road by himself david and another david three davids all exactly alike each with a ragged teddy bear  all pathetic  look at the others tasso said  the next pictures taken at a great distance showed a towering wounded soldier sitting by the side of a path his arm in a sling the stump of one leg extended a crude crutch on his lap then two wounded soldiers both the same standing side by side  thats variety one the wounded soldier klaus reached out and took the pictures you see the claws were designed to get to human beings to find them each kind was better than the last they got farther closer past most of our defenses into our lines but as long as they were merely machines metal spheres with claws and horns feelers they could be picked off like any other object they could be detected as lethal robots as soon as they were seen once we caught sight of them  variety one subverted our whole north wing rudi said it was a long time before anyone caught on then it was too late they came in wounded soldiers knocking and begging to be let in so we let them in and as soon as they were in they took over we were watching out for machines  at that time it was thought there was only the one type klaus epstein said no one suspected there were other types the pictures were flashed to us when the runner was sent to you we knew of just one type variety one the big wounded soldier we thought that was all  your line fell to  to variety three david and his bear that worked even better klaus smiled bitterly soldiers are suckers for children we brought them in and tried to feed them we found out the hard way what they were after at least those who were in the bunker  the three of us were lucky rudi said klaus and i werewere visiting tasso when it happened this is her place he waved a big hand around this little cellar we finished and climbed the ladder to start back from the ridge we saw there they were all around the bunker fighting was still going on david and his bear hundreds of them klaus took the pictures  klaus tied up the photographs again                                       and its going on all along your line hendricks said  yes  how about our lines without thinking he touched the tab on his arm can they  theyre not bothered by your radiation tabs it makes no difference to them russian american pole german its all the same theyre doing what they were designed to do carrying out the original idea they track down life wherever they find it  they go by warmth klaus said that was the way you constructed them from the very start of course those you designed were kept back by the radiation tabs you wear now theyve got around that these new varieties are leadlined  whats the other variety hendricks asked the david type the wounded soldierwhats the other  we dont know klaus pointed up at the wall on the wall were two metal plates ragged at the edges hendricks got up and studied them they were bent and dented  the one on the left came off a wounded soldier rudi said we got one of them it was going along toward our old bunker we got it from the ridge the same way we got the david tagging you  the plate was stamped iv hendricks touched the other plate and this came from the david type  yes the plate was stamped iiiv  klaus took a look at them leaning over hendricks broad shoulder you can see what were up against theres another type maybe it was abandoned maybe it didnt work but there must be a second variety theres one and three  you were lucky rudi said the david tagged you all the way here and never touched you probably thought youd get it into a bunker somewhere  one gets in and its all over klaus said they move fast one lets all the rest inside theyre inflexible machines with one purpose they were built for only one thing he rubbed sweat from his lip we saw  they were silent  let me have another cigarette yank tasso said they are good i almost forgot how they were                                       it was night the sky was black no stars were visible through the rolling clouds of ash klaus lifted the lid cautiously so that hendricks could look out  rudi pointed into the darkness over that way are the bunkers where we used to be not over half a mile from us it was just chance klaus and i were not there when it happened weakness saved by our lusts  all the rest must be dead klaus said in a low voice it came quickly this morning the politburo reached their decision they notified usforward command our runner was sent out at once we saw him start toward the direction of your lines we covered him until he was out of sight  alex radrivsky we both knew him he disappeared about six oclock the sun had just come up about noon klaus and i had an hour relief we crept off away from the bunkers no one was watching we came here there used to be a town here a few houses a street this cellar was part of a big farmhouse we knew tasso would be here hiding down in her little place we had come here before others from the bunkers came here today happened to be our turn  so we were saved klaus said chance it might have been others wewe finished and then we came up to the surface and started back along the ridge that was when we saw them the davids we understood right away we had seen the photos of the first variety the wounded soldier our commissar distributed them to us with an explanation if we had gone another step they would have seen us as it was we had to blast two davids before we got back there were hundreds of them all around like ants we took pictures and slipped back here bolting the lid tight  theyre not so much when you catch them alone we moved faster than they did but theyre inexorable not like living things they came right at us and we blasted them  major hendricks rested against the edge of the lid adjusting his eyes to the darkness is it safe to have the lid up at all  if were careful how else can you operate your transmitter  hendricks lifted the small belt transmitter slowly he pressed it against his ear the metal was cold and damp he blew against the mike raising up the short antenna a faint hum sounded in his ear thats true i suppose  but he still hesitated  well pull you under if anything happens klaus said  thanks hendricks waited a moment resting the transmitter against his shoulder interesting isnt it  what  this the new types the new varieties of claws were completely at their mercy arent we by now theyve probably gotten into the un lines too it makes me wonder if were not seeing the beginning of a now species the new species evolution the race to come after man                                       rudi grunted there is no race after man  no why not maybe were seeing it now the end of human beings the beginning of the new society  theyre not a race theyre mechanical killers you made them to destroy thats all they can do theyre machines with a job  so it seems now but how about later on after the war is over maybe when there arent any humans to destroy their real potentialities will begin to show  you talk as if they were alive  arent they  there was silence theyre machines rudi said they look like people but theyre machines  use your transmitter major klaus said we cant stay up here forever  holding the transmitter tightly hendricks called the code of the command bunker he waited listening no response only silence he checked the leads carefully everything was in place  scott he said into the mike can you hear me  silence he raised the gain up full and tried again only static  i dont get anything they may hear me but they may not want to answer  tell them its an emergency  theyll think im being forced to call under your direction he tried again outlining briefly what he had learned but still the phone was silent except for the faint static  radiation pools kill most transmission klaus said after awhile maybe thats it  hendricks shut the transmitter up no use no answer radiation pools maybe or they hear me but wont answer frankly thats what i would do if a runner tried to call from the soviet lines they have no reason to believe such a story they may hear everything i say  or maybe its too late  hendricks nodded  we better get the lid down rudi said nervously we dont want to take unnecessary chances                                       they climbed slowly back down the tunnel klaus bolted the lid carefully into place they descended into the kitchen the air was heavy and close around them  could they work that fast hendricks said i left the bunker this noon ten hours ago how could they move so quickly  it doesnt take them long not after the first one gets in it goes wild you know what the little claws can do even one of these is beyond belief razors each finger maniacal  all right hendricks moved away impatiently he stood with his back to them  whats the matter rudi said  the moon base god if theyve gotten there  the moon base  hendricks turned around they couldnt have got to the moon base how would they get there it isnt possible i cant believe it  what is this moon base weve heard rumors but nothing definite what is the actual situation you seem concerned  were supplied from the moon the governments are there under the lunar surface all our people and industries thats what keeps us going if they should find some way of getting off terra onto the moon  it only takes one of them once the first one gets in it admits the others hundreds of them all alike you should have seen them identical like ants  perfect socialism tasso said the ideal of the communist state all citizens interchangeable  klaus grunted angrily thats enough well what next  hendricks paced back and forth around the small room the air was full of smells of food and perspiration the others watched him presently tasso pushed through the curtain into the other room im going to take a nap  the curtain closed behind her rudi and klaus sat down at the table still watching hendricks  its up to you klaus said we dont know your situation  hendricks nodded  its a problem rudi drank some coffee filling his cup from a rusty pot were safe here for awhile but we cant stay here forever not enough food or supplies  but if we go outside  if we go outside theyll get us or probably theyll get us we couldnt go very far how far is your command bunker major  three or four miles  we might make it the four of us four of us could watch all sides they couldnt slip up behind us and start tagging us we have three rifles three blast rifles tasso can have my pistol rudi tapped his belt in the soviet army we didnt have shoes always but we had guns with all four of us armed one of us might get to your command bunker preferably you major  what if theyre already there klaus said  rudi shrugged well then we come back here                                       hendricks stopped pacing what do you think the chances are theyre already in the american lines  hard to say fairly good theyre organized they know exactly what theyre doing once they start they go like a horde of locusts they have to keep moving and fast its secrecy and speed they depend on surprise they push their way in before anyone has any idea  i see hendricks murmured  from the other room tasso stirred major  hendricks pushed the curtain back what  illustration  tasso looked up at him lazily from the cot have you any more american cigarettes left  hendricks went into the room and sat down across from her on a wood stool he felt in his pockets no all gone  too bad  what nationality are you hendricks asked after awhile  russian  how did you get here  here  this used to be france this was part of normandy did you come with the soviet army  why  just curious he studied her she had taken off her coat tossing it over the end of the cot she was young about twenty slim her long hair stretched out over the pillow she was staring at him silently her eyes dark and large  whats on your mind tasso said  nothing how old are you  eighteen she continued to watch him unblinking her arms behind her head she had on russian army pants and shirt graygreen thick leather belt with counter and cartridges medicine kit  youre in the soviet army  no  where did you get the uniform  she shrugged it was given to me she told him  howhow old were you when you came here  sixteen  that young  her eyes narrowed what do you mean                                       hendricks rubbed his jaw your life would have been a lot different if there had been no war sixteen you came here at sixteen to live this way  i had to survive  im not moralizing  your life would have been different too tasso murmured she reached down and unfastened one of her boots she kicked the boot off onto the floor major do you want to go in the other room im sleepy  its going to be a problem the four of us here its going to be hard to live in these quarters are there just the two rooms  yes  how big was the cellar originally was it larger than this are there other rooms filled up with debris we might be able to open one of them  perhaps i really dont know tasso loosened her belt she made herself comfortable on the cot unbuttoning her shirt youre sure you have no more cigarettes  i had only the one pack  too bad maybe if we get back to your bunker we can find some the other boot fell tasso reached up for the light cord good night  youre going to sleep  thats right  the room plunged into darkness hendricks got up and made his way past the curtain into the kitchen  and stopped rigid  rudi stood against the wall his face white and gleaming his mouth opened and closed but no sounds came klaus stood in front of him the muzzle of his pistol in rudis stomach neither of them moved klaus his hand tight around his gun his features set rudi pale and silent spreadeagled against the wall  what hendricks muttered but klaus cut him off  be quiet major come over here your gun get out your gun  hendricks drew his pistol what is it  cover him klaus motioned him forward beside me hurry  rudi moved a little lowering his arms he turned to hendricks licking his lips the whites of his eyes shone wildly sweat dripped from his forehead down his cheeks he fixed his gaze on hendricks major hes gone insane stop him rudis voice was thin and hoarse almost inaudible  whats going on hendricks demanded  without lowering his pistol klaus answered major remember our discussion the three varieties we knew about one and three but we didnt know about two at least we didnt know before klaus fingers tightened around the gun butt we didnt know before but we know now  he pressed the trigger a burst of white heat rolled out of the gun licking around rudi  major this is the second variety                                       tasso swept the curtain aside klaus what did you do  klaus turned from the charred form gradually sinking down the wall onto the floor the second variety tasso now we know we have all three types identified the danger is less i  tasso stared past him at the remains of rudi at the blackened smouldering fragments and bits of cloth you killed him  him it you mean i was watching i had a feeling but i wasnt sure at least i wasnt sure before but this evening i was certain klaus rubbed his pistol butt nervously were lucky dont you understand another hour and it might  you were certain tasso pushed past him and bent down over the steaming remains on the floor her face became hard major see for yourself bones flesh  hendricks bent down beside her the remains were human remains seared flesh charred bone fragments part of a skull ligaments viscera blood blood forming a pool against the wall  no wheels tasso said calmly she straightened up no wheels no parts no relays not a claw not the second variety she folded her arms youre going to have to be able to explain this  klaus sat down at the table all the color drained suddenly from his face he put his head in his hands and rocked back and forth  snap out of it tassos fingers closed over his shoulder why did you do it why did you kill him  he was frightened hendricks said all this the whole thing building up around us  maybe  what then what do you think  i think he may have had a reason for killing rudi a good reason  what reason  maybe rudi learned something  hendricks studied her bleak face about what he asked  about him about klaus                                       klaus looked up quickly you can see what shes trying to say she thinks im the second variety dont you see major now she wants you to believe i killed him on purpose that im  why did you kill him then tasso said  i told you klaus shook his head wearily i thought he was a claw i thought i knew  why  i had been watching him i was suspicious  why  i thought i had seen something heard something i thought i he stopped  go on  we were sitting at the table playing cards you two were in the other room it was silent i thought i heard himwhirr  there was silence  do you believe that tasso said to hendricks  yes i believe what he says  i dont i think he killed rudi for a good purpose tasso touched the rifle resting in the corner of the room major  no hendricks shook his head lets stop it right now one is enough were afraid the way he was if we kill him well be doing what he did to rudi  klaus looked gratefully up at him thanks i was afraid you understand dont you now shes afraid the way i was she wants to kill me  no more killing hendricks moved toward the end of the ladder im going above and try the transmitter once more if i cant get them were moving back toward my lines tomorrow morning  klaus rose quickly ill come up with you and give you a hand                                       the night air was cold the earth was cooling off klaus took a deep breath filling his lungs he and hendricks stepped onto the ground out of the tunnel klaus planted his feet wide apart the rifle up watching and listening hendricks crouched by the tunnel mouth tuning the small transmitter  any luck klaus asked presently  not yet  keep trying tell them what happened  hendricks kept trying without success finally he lowered the antenna its useless they cant hear me or they hear me and wont answer or  or they dont exist  ill try once more hendricks raised the antenna scott can you hear me come in  he listened there was only static then still very faintly  this is scott  his fingers tightened scott is it you  this is scott  klaus squatted down is it your command  scott listen do you understand about them the claws did you get my message did you hear me  yes faintly almost inaudible he could hardly make out the word  you got my message is everything all right at the bunker none of them have got in  everything is all right  have they tried to get in  the voice was weaker  no  hendricks turned to klaus theyre all right  have they been attacked  no hendricks pressed the phone tighter to his ear scott i can hardly hear you have you notified the moon base do they know are they alerted  no answer  scott can you hear me  silence  hendricks relaxed sagging faded out must be radiation pools                                       hendricks and klaus looked at each other neither of them said anything after a time klaus said did it sound like any of your men could you identify the voice  it was too faint  you couldnt be certain  no  then it could have been  i dont know now im not sure lets go back down and get the lid closed  they climbed back down the ladder slowly into the warm cellar klaus bolted the lid behind them tasso waited for them her face expressionless  any luck she asked  neither of them answered well klaus said at last what do you think major was it your officer or was it one of them  i dont know  then were just where we were before  hendricks stared down at the floor his jaw set well have to go to be sure  anyhow we have food here for only a few weeks wed have to go up after that in any case  apparently so  whats wrong tasso demanded did you get across to your bunker whats the matter  it may have been one of my men hendricks said slowly or it may have been one of them but well never know standing here he examined his watch lets turn in and get some sleep we want to be up early tomorrow  early  our best chance to get through the claws should be early in the morning hendricks said                                       the morning was crisp and clear major hendricks studied the countryside through his fieldglasses  see anything klaus said  no  can you make out our bunkers  which way  here klaus took the glasses and adjusted them i know where to look he looked a long time silently  tasso came to the top of the tunnel and stepped up onto the ground anything  no klaus passed the glasses back to hendricks theyre out of sight come on lets not stay here  the three of them made their way down the side of the ridge sliding in the soft ash across a flat rock a lizard scuttled they stopped instantly rigid  what was it klaus muttered  a lizard  the lizard ran on hurrying through the ash it was exactly the same color as the ash  perfect adaptation klaus said proves we were right lysenko i mean  they reached the bottom of the ridge and stopped standing close together looking around them  lets go hendricks started off its a good long trip on foot  klaus fell in beside him tasso walked behind her pistol held alertly major ive been meaning to ask you something klaus said how did you run across the david the one that was tagging you  i met it along the way in some ruins  what did it say  not much it said it was alone by itself  you couldnt tell it was a machine it talked like a living person you never suspected  it didnt say much i noticed nothing unusual  its strange machines so much like people that you can be fooled almost alive i wonder where itll end  theyre doing what you yanks designed them to do tasso said you designed them to hunt out life and destroy human life wherever they find it                                       hendricks was watching klaus intently why did you ask me whats on your mind  nothing klaus answered  klaus thinks youre the second variety tasso said calmly from behind them now hes got his eye on you  klaus flushed why not we sent a runner to the yank lines and he comes back maybe he thought hed find some good game here  hendricks laughed harshly i came from the un bunkers there were human beings all around me  maybe you saw an opportunity to get into the soviet lines maybe you saw your chance maybe you  the soviet lines had already been taken over your lines had been invaded before i left my command bunker dont forget that  tasso came up beside him that proves nothing at all major  why not  there appears to be little communication between the varieties each is made in a different factory they dont seem to work together you might have started for the soviet lines without knowing anything about the work of the other varieties or even what the other varieties were like  how do you know so much about the claws hendricks said  ive seen them ive observed them i observed them take over the soviet bunkers  you know quite a lot klaus said actually you saw very little strange that you should have been such an acute observer  tasso laughed do you suspect me now  forget it hendricks said they walked on in silence  are we going the whole way on foot tasso said after awhile im not used to walking she gazed around at the plain of ash stretching out on all sides of them as far as they could see how dreary  its like this all the way klaus said  in a way i wish you had been in your bunker when the attack came  somebody else would have been with you if not me klaus muttered  tasso laughed putting her hands in her pockets i suppose so  they walked on keeping their eyes on the vast plain of silent ash around them                                       the sun was setting hendricks made his way forward slowly waving tasso and klaus back klaus squatted down resting his gun butt against the ground  tasso found a concrete slab and sat down with a sigh its good to rest  be quiet klaus said sharply  hendricks pushed up to the top of the rise ahead of them the same rise the russian runner had come up the day before hendricks dropped down stretching himself out peering through his glasses at what lay beyond  nothing was visible only ash and occasional trees but there not more than fifty yards ahead was the entrance of the forward command bunker the bunker from which he had come hendricks watched silently no motion no sign of life nothing stirred  klaus slithered up beside him where is it  down there hendricks passed him the glasses clouds of ash rolled across the evening sky the world was darkening they had a couple of hours of light left at the most probably not that much  i dont see anything klaus said  that tree there the stump by the pile of bricks the entrance is to the right of the bricks  ill have to take your word for it  you and tasso cover me from here youll be able to sight all the way to the bunker entrance  youre going down alone  with my wrist tab ill be safe the ground around the bunker is a living field of claws they collect down in the ash like crabs without tabs you wouldnt have a chance  maybe youre right  ill walk slowly all the way as soon as i know for certain  if theyre down inside the bunker you wont be able to get back up here they go fast you dont realize  what do you suggest  klaus considered i dont know get them to come up to the surface so you can see  hendricks brought his transmitter from his belt raising the antenna lets get started                                       klaus signalled to tasso she crawled expertly up the side of the rise to where they were sitting  hes going down alone klaus said well cover him from here as soon as you see him start back fire past him at once they come quick  youre not very optimistic tasso said  no im not  hendricks opened the breech of his gun checking it carefully maybe things are all right  you didnt see them hundreds of them all the same pouring out like ants  i should be able to find out without going down all the way hendricks locked his gun gripping it in one hand the transmitter in the other well wish me luck  klaus put out his hand dont go down until youre sure talk to them from up here make them show themselves                                       hendricks stood up he stepped down the side of the rise  a moment later he was walking slowly toward the pile of bricks and debris beside the dead tree stump toward the entrance of the forward command bunker  nothing stirred he raised the transmitter clicking it on scott can you hear me  silence  scott this is hendricks can you hear me im standing outside the bunker you should be able to see me in the view sight  he listened the transmitter gripped tightly no sound only static he walked forward a claw burrowed out of the ash and raced toward him it halted a few feet away and then slunk off a second claw appeared one of the big ones with feelers it moved toward him studied him intently and then fell in behind him dogging respectfully after him a few paces away a moment later a second big claw joined it silently the claws trailed him as he walked slowly toward the bunker  hendricks stopped and behind him the claws came to a halt he was close now almost to the bunker steps  scott can you hear me im standing right above you outside on the surface are you picking me up                                       he waited holding his gun against his side the transmitter tightly to his ear time passed he strained to hear but there was only silence silence and faint static  then distantly metallically  this is scott  the voice was neutral cold he could not identify it but the earphone was minute  scott listen im standing right above you im on the surface looking down into the bunker entrance  yes  can you see me  yes  through the view sight you have the sight trained on me  yes  hendricks pondered a circle of claws waited quietly around him graymetal bodies on all sides of him is everything all right in the bunker nothing unusual has happened  everything is all right  will you come up to the surface i want to see you for a moment hendricks took a deep breath come up here with me i want to talk to you  come down  im giving you an order  silence  are you coming hendricks listened there was no response i order you to come to the surface  come down  hendricks set his jaw let me talk to leone  there was a long pause he listened to the static then a voice came hard thin metallic the same as the other this is leone  hendricks im on the surface at the bunker entrance i want one of you to come up here  come down  why come down im giving you an order  silence hendricks lowered the transmitter he looked carefully around him the entrance was just ahead almost at his feet he lowered the antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt carefully he gripped his gun with both hands he moved forward a step at a time if they could see him they knew he was starting toward the entrance he closed his eyes a moment  then he put his foot on the first step that led downward  two davids came up at him their faces identical and expressionless he blasted them into particles more came rushing silently up a whole pack of them all exactly the same  hendricks turned and raced back away from the bunker back toward the rise  at the top of the rise tasso and klaus were firing down the small claws were already streaking up toward them shining metal spheres going fast racing frantically through the ash but he had no time to think about that he knelt down aiming at the bunker entrance gun against his cheek the davids were coming out in groups clutching their teddy bears their thin knobby legs pumping as they ran up the steps to the surface hendricks fired into the main body of them they burst apart wheels and springs flying in all directions he fired again through the mist of particles  a giant lumbering figure rose up in the bunker entrance tall and swaying hendricks paused amazed a man a soldier with one leg supporting himself with a crutch  major tassos voice came more firing the huge figure moved forward davids swarming around it hendricks broke out of his freeze the first variety the wounded soldier  he aimed and fired the soldier burst into bits parts and relays flying now many davids were out on the flat ground away from the bunker he fired again and again moving slowly back halfcrouching and aiming  from the rise klaus fired down the side of the rise was alive with claws making their way up hendricks retreated toward the rise running and crouching tasso had left klaus and was circling slowly to the right moving away from the rise  a david slipped up toward him its small white face expressionless brown hair hanging down in its eyes it bent over suddenly opening its arms its teddy bear hurtled down and leaped across the ground bounding toward him hendricks fired the bear and the david both dissolved he grinned blinking it was like a dream  up here tassos voice hendricks made his way toward her she was over by some columns of concrete walls of a ruined building she was firing past him with the hand pistol klaus had given her  thanks he joined her grasping for breath she pulled him back behind the concrete fumbling at her belt  close your eyes she unfastened a globe from her waist rapidly she unscrewed the cap locking it into place close your eyes and get down                                       she threw the bomb it sailed in an arc an expert rolling and bouncing to the entrance of the bunker two wounded soldiers stood uncertainly by the brick pile more davids poured from behind them out onto the plain one of the wounded soldiers moved toward the bomb stooping awkwardly down to pick it up  the bomb went off the concussion whirled hendricks around throwing him on his face a hot wind rolled over him dimly he saw tasso standing behind the columns firing slowly and methodically at the davids coming out of the raging clouds of white fire  back along the rise klaus struggled with a ring of claws circling around him he retreated blasting at them and moving back trying to break through the ring  hendricks struggled to his feet his head ached he could hardly see everything was licking at him raging and whirling his right arm would not move  tasso pulled back toward him come on lets go  klaushes still up there  come on tasso dragged hendricks back away from the columns hendricks shook his head trying to clear it tasso led him rapidly away her eyes intense and bright watching for claws that had escaped the blast  one david came out of the rolling clouds of flame tasso blasted it no more appeared  but klaus what about him hendricks stopped standing unsteadily he  come on                                       they retreated moving farther and farther away from the bunker a few small claws followed them for a little while and then gave up turning back and going off  at last tasso stopped we can stop here and get our breaths  hendricks sat down on some heaps of debris he wiped his neck gasping we left klaus back there  tasso said nothing she opened her gun sliding a fresh round of blast cartridges into place  hendricks stared at her dazed you left him back there on purpose  tasso snapped the gun together she studied the heaps of rubble around them her face expressionless as if she were watching for something  what is it hendricks demanded what are you looking for is something coming he shook his head trying to understand what was she doing what was she waiting for he could see nothing ash lay all around them ash and ruins occasional stark tree trunks without leaves or branches what  tasso cut him off be still her eyes narrowed suddenly her gun came up hendricks turned following her gaze                                       back the way they had come a figure appeared the figure walked unsteadily toward them its clothes were torn it limped as it made its way along going very slowly and carefully stopping now and then resting and getting its strength once it almost fell it stood for a moment trying to steady itself then it came on  klaus  hendricks stood up klaus he started toward him how the hell did you  tasso fired hendricks swung back she fired again the blast passing him a searing line of heat the beam caught klaus in the chest he exploded gears and wheels flying for a moment he continued to walk then he swayed back and forth he crashed to the ground his arms flung out a few more wheels rolled away  silence  tasso turned to hendricks now you understand why he killed rudi  hendricks sat down again slowly he shook his head he was numb he could not think  do you see tasso said do you understand  hendricks said nothing everything was slipping away from him faster and faster darkness rolling and plucking at him  he closed his eyes                                       hendricks opened his eyes slowly his body ached all over he tried to sit up but needles of pain shot through his arm and shoulder he gasped  dont try to get up tasso said she bent down putting her cold hand against his forehead  it was night a few stars glinted above shining through the drifting clouds of ash hendricks lay back his teeth locked tasso watched him impassively she had built a fire with some wood and weeds the fire licked feebly hissing at a metal cup suspended over it everything was silent unmoving darkness beyond the fire  so he was the second variety hendricks murmured  i had always thought so  why didnt you destroy him sooner he wanted to know  you held me back tasso crossed to the fire to look into the metal cup coffee itll be ready to drink in awhile  she came back and sat down beside him presently she opened her pistol and began to disassemble the firing mechanism studying it intently  this is a beautiful gun tasso said halfaloud the construction is superb  what about them the claws  the concussion from the bomb put most of them out of action theyre delicate highly organized i suppose  the davids too  yes  how did you happen to have a bomb like that  tasso shrugged we designed it you shouldnt underestimate our technology major without such a bomb you and i would no longer exist  very useful  tasso stretched out her legs warming her feet in the heat of the fire it surprised me that you did not seem to understand after he killed rudi why did you think he  i told you i thought he was afraid  really you know major for a little while i suspected you because you wouldnt let me kill him i thought you might be protecting him she laughed  are we safe here hendricks asked presently  for awhile until they get reinforcements from some other area tasso began to clean the interior of the gun with a bit of rag she finished and pushed the mechanism back into place she closed the gun running her finger along the barrel  we were lucky hendricks murmured  yes very lucky  thanks for pulling me away                                       tasso did not answer she glanced up at him her eyes bright in the fire light hendricks examined his arm he could not move his fingers his whole side seemed numb down inside him was a dull steady ache  how do you feel tasso asked  my arm is damaged  anything else  internal injuries  you didnt get down when the bomb went off  hendricks said nothing he watched tasso pour the coffee from the cup into a flat metal pan she brought it over to him  thanks he struggled up enough to drink it was hard to swallow his insides turned over and he pushed the pan away thats all i can drink now  tasso drank the rest time passed the clouds of ash moved across the dark sky above them hendricks rested his mind blank after awhile he became aware that tasso was standing over him gazing down at him  what is it he murmured  do you feel any better  some  you know major if i hadnt dragged you away they would have got you you would be dead like rudi  i know  do you want to know why i brought you out i could have left you i could have left you there  why did you bring me out  because we have to get away from here tasso stirred the fire with a stick peering calmly down into it no human being can live here when their reinforcements come we wont have a chance ive pondered about it while you were unconscious we have perhaps three hours before they come  and you expect me to get us away  thats right i expect you to get us out of here  why me  because i dont know any way her eyes shone at him in the halflight bright and steady if you cant get us out of here theyll kill us within three hours i see nothing else ahead well major what are you going to do ive been waiting all night while you were unconscious i sat here waiting and listening its almost dawn the night is almost over                                       hendricks considered its curious he said at last  curious  that you should think i can get us out of here i wonder what you think i can do  can you get us to the moon base  the moon base how  there must be some way  hendricks shook his head no theres no way that i know of  tasso said nothing for a moment her steady gaze wavered she ducked her head turning abruptly away she scrambled to her feet more coffee  no  suit yourself tasso drank silently he could not see her face he lay back against the ground deep in thought trying to concentrate it was hard to think his head still hurt and the numbing daze still hung over him  there might be one way he said suddenly  oh  how soon is dawn  two hours the sun will be coming up shortly  theres supposed to be a ship near here ive never seen it but i know it exists  what kind of a ship her voice was sharp  a rocket cruiser  will it take us off to the moon base  its supposed to in case of emergency he rubbed his forehead  whats wrong  my head its hard to think i can hardlyhardly concentrate the bomb  is the ship near here tasso slid over beside him settling down on her haunches how far is it where is it  im trying to think  her fingers dug into his arm nearby her voice was like iron where would it be would they store it underground hidden underground  yes in a storage locker  how do we find it is it marked is there a code marker to identify it  hendricks concentrated no no markings no code symbol  what then  a sign  what sort of sign                                       hendricks did not answer in the flickering light his eyes were glazed two sightless orbs tassos fingers dug into his arm  what sort of sign what is it  ii cant think let me rest  all right she let go and stood up hendricks lay back against the ground his eyes closed tasso walked away from him her hands in her pockets she kicked a rock out of her way and stood staring up at the sky the night blackness was already beginning to fade into gray morning was coming  tasso gripped her pistol and walked around the fire in a circle back and forth on the ground major hendricks lay his eyes closed unmoving the grayness rose in the sky higher and higher the landscape became visible fields of ash stretching out in all directions ash and ruins of buildings a wall here and there heaps of concrete the naked trunk of a tree  the air was cold and sharp somewhere a long way off a bird made a few bleak sounds  hendricks stirred he opened his eyes is it dawn already  yes  hendricks sat up a little you wanted to know something you were asking me  do you remember now  yes  what is it she tensed what she repeated sharply  a well a ruined well its in a storage locker under a well  a well tasso relaxed then well find a well she looked at her watch we have about an hour major do you think we can find it in an hour                                       give me a hand up hendricks said  tasso put her pistol away and helped him to his feet this is going to be difficult  yes it is hendricks set his lips tightly i dont think were going to go very far  they began to walk the early sun cast a little warmth down on them the land was flat and barren stretching out gray and lifeless as far as they could see a few birds sailed silently far above them circling slowly  see anything hendricks said any claws  no not yet  they passed through some ruins upright concrete and bricks a cement foundation rats scuttled away tasso jumped back warily  this used to be a town hendricks said a village provincial village this was all grape country once where we are now  they came onto a ruined street weeds and cracks crisscrossing it over to the right a stone chimney stuck up  be careful he warned her  a pit yawned an open basement ragged ends of pipes jutted up twisted and bent they passed part of a house a bathtub turned on its side a broken chair a few spoons and bits of china dishes in the center of the street the ground had sunk away the depression was filled with weeds and debris and bones  over here hendricks murmured  this way  to the right  they passed the remains of a heavy duty tank hendricks belt counter clicked ominously the tank had been radiation blasted a few feet from the tank a mummified body lay sprawled out mouth open beyond the road was a flat field stones and weeds and bits of broken glass  there hendricks said                                       a stone well jutted up sagging and broken a few boards lay across it most of the well had sunk into rubble hendricks walked unsteadily toward it tasso beside him  are you certain about this tasso said this doesnt look like anything  im sure hendricks sat down at the edge of the well his teeth locked his breath came quickly he wiped perspiration from his face this was arranged so the senior command officer could get away if anything happened if the bunker fell  that was you  yes  where is the ship is it here  were standing on it hendricks ran his hands over the surface of the well stones the eyelock responds to me not to anybody else its my ship or it was supposed to be  there was a sharp click presently they heard a low grating sound from below them  step back hendricks said he and tasso moved away from the well  a section of the ground slid back a metal frame pushed slowly up through the ash shoving bricks and weeds out of the way the action ceased as the ship nosed into view  there it is hendricks said  the ship was small it rested quietly suspended in its mesh frame like a blunt needle a rain of ash sifted down into the dark cavity from which the ship had been raised hendricks made his way over to it he mounted the mesh and unscrewed the hatch pulling it back inside the ship the control banks and the pressure seat were visible                                       tasso came and stood beside him gazing into the ship im not accustomed to rocket piloting she said after awhile  hendricks glanced at her ill do the piloting  will you theres only one seat major i can see its built to carry only a single person  hendricks breathing changed he studied the interior of the ship intently tasso was right there was only one seat the ship was built to carry only one person i see he said slowly and the one person is you  she nodded  of course  why  you cant go you might not live through the trip youre injured you probably wouldnt get there  an interesting point but you see i know where the moon base is and you dont you might fly around for months and not find it its well hidden without knowing what to look for  ill have to take my chances maybe i wont find it not by myself but i think youll give me all the information i need your life depends on it  how  if i find the moon base in time perhaps i can get them to send a ship back to pick you up if i find the base in time if not then you havent a chance i imagine there are supplies on the ship they will last me long enough  hendricks moved quickly but his injured arm betrayed him tasso ducked sliding lithely aside her hand came up lightning fast hendricks saw the gun butt coming he tried to ward off the blow but she was too fast the metal butt struck against the side of his head just above his ear numbing pain rushed through him pain and rolling clouds of blackness he sank down sliding to the ground                                       dimly he was aware that tasso was standing over him kicking him with her toe  major wake up  he opened his eyes groaning  listen to me she bent down the gun pointed at his face i have to hurry there isnt much time left the ship is ready to go but you must tell me the information i need before i leave  hendricks shook his head trying to clear it  hurry up where is the moon base how do i find it what do i look for  hendricks said nothing  answer me  sorry  major the ship is loaded with provisions i can coast for weeks ill find the base eventually and in a half hour youll be dead your only chance of survival she broke off  along the slope by some crumbling ruins something moved something in the ash tasso turned quickly aiming she fired a puff of flame leaped something scuttled away rolling across the ash she fired again the claw burst apart wheels flying  see tasso said a scout it wont be long  youll bring them back here to get me  yes as soon as possible  hendricks looked up at her he studied her intently youre telling the truth a strange expression had come over his face an avid hunger you will come back for me youll get me to the moon base  ill get you to the moon base but tell me where it is theres only a little time left  all right hendricks picked up a piece of rock pulling himself to a sitting position watch  hendricks began to scratch in the ash tasso stood by him watching the motion of the rock hendricks was sketching a crude lunar map                                       this is the appenine range here is the crater of archimedes the moon base is beyond the end of the appenine about two hundred miles i dont know exactly where no one on terra knows but when youre over the appenine signal with one red flare and a green flare followed by two red flares in quick succession the base monitor will record your signal the base is under the surface of course theyll guide you down with magnetic grapples  and the controls can i operate them  the controls are virtually automatic all you have to do is give the right signal at the right time  i will  the seat absorbs most of the takeoff shock air and temperature are automatically controlled the ship will leave terra and pass out into free space itll line itself up with the moon falling into an orbit around it about a hundred miles above the surface the orbit will carry you over the base when youre in the region of the appenine release the signal rockets  tasso slid into the ship and lowered herself into the pressure seat the arm locks folded automatically around her she fingered the controls too bad youre not going major all this put here for you and you cant make the trip  leave me the pistol  tasso pulled the pistol from her belt she held it in her hand weighing it thoughtfully dont go too far from this location itll be hard to find you as it is  no ill stay here by the well  tasso gripped the takeoff switch running her fingers over the smooth metal a beautiful ship major well built i admire your workmanship you people have always done good work you build fine things your work your creations are your greatest achievement  give me the pistol hendricks said impatiently holding out his hand he struggled to his feet  goodbye major tasso tossed the pistol past hendricks the pistol clattered against the ground bouncing and rolling away hendricks hurried after it he bent down snatching it up  the hatch of the ship clanged shut the bolts fell into place hendricks made his way back the inner door was being sealed he raised the pistol unsteadily                                       there was a shattering roar the ship burst up from its metal cage fusing the mesh behind it hendricks cringed pulling back the ship shot up into the rolling clouds of ash disappearing into the sky  hendricks stood watching a long time until even the streamer had dissipated nothing stirred the morning air was chill and silent he began to walk aimlessly back the way they had come better to keep moving around it would be a long time before help cameif it came at all  he searched his pockets until he found a package of cigarettes he lit one grimly they had all wanted cigarettes from him but cigarettes were scarce  a lizard slithered by him through the ash he halted rigid the lizard disappeared above the sun rose higher in the sky some flies landed on a flat rock to one side of him hendricks kicked at them with his foot  it was getting hot sweat trickled down his face into his collar his mouth was dry  presently he stopped walking and sat down on some debris he unfastened his medicine kit and swallowed a few narcotic capsules he looked around him where was he  something lay ahead stretched out on the ground silent and unmoving  hendricks drew his gun quickly it looked like a man then he remembered it was the remains of klaus the second variety where tasso had blasted him he could see wheels and relays and metal parts strewn around on the ash glittering and sparkling in the sunlight  hendricks got to his feet and walked over he nudged the inert form with his foot turning it over a little he could see the metal hull the aluminum ribs and struts more wiring fell out like viscera heaps of wiring switches and relays endless motors and rods  he bent down the brain cage had been smashed by the fall the artificial brain was visible he gazed at it a maze of circuits miniature tubes wires as fine as hair he touched the brain cage it swung aside the type plate was visible hendricks studied the plate  and blanched  iviv  for a long time he stared at the plate fourth variety not the second they had been wrong there were more types not just three many more perhaps at least four and klaus wasnt the second variety  but if klaus wasnt the second variety  suddenly he tensed something was coming walking through the ash beyond the hill what was it he strained to see figures figures coming slowly along making their way through the ash  coming toward him  hendricks crouched quickly raising his gun sweat dripped down into his eyes he fought down rising panic as the figures neared  the first was a david the david saw him and increased its pace the others hurried behind it a second david a third three davids all alike coming toward him silently without expression their thin legs rising and falling clutching their teddy bears  he aimed and fired the first two davids dissolved into particles the third came on and the figure behind it climbing silently toward him across the gray ash a wounded soldier towering over the david and                                       and behind the wounded soldier came two tassos walking side by side heavy belt russian army pants shirt long hair the familiar figure as he had seen her only a little while before sitting in the pressure seat of the ship two slim silent figures both identical  they were very near the david bent down suddenly dropping its teddy bear the bear raced across the ground automatically hendricks fingers tightened around the trigger the bear was gone dissolved into mist the two tasso types moved on expressionless walking side by side through the gray ash  when they were almost to him hendricks raised the pistol waist high and fired  the two tassos dissolved but already a new group was starting up the rise five or six tassos all identical a line of them coming rapidly toward him  and he had given her the ship and the signal code because of him she was on her way to the moon to the moon base he had made it possible  he had been right about the bomb after all it had been designed with knowledge of the other types the david type and the wounded soldier type and the klaus type not designed by human beings it had been designed by one of the underground factories apart from all human contact  the line of tassos came up to him hendricks braced himself watching them calmly the familiar face the belt the heavy shirt the bomb carefully in place  the bomb  as the tassos reached for him a last ironic thought drifted through hendricks mind he felt a little better thinking about it the bomb made by the second variety to destroy the other varieties made for that end alone  they were already beginning to design weapons to use against each other
