50860088	they and i  by jerome k jerome    chapter i    it is not a large house i said  we dont want a large house two spare bedrooms and the little threecornered place you see marked there on the plan next to the bathroom and which will just do for a bachelor will be all we shall requireat all events for the present  later on if i ever get rich we can throw out a wing the kitchen i shall have to break to your mother gently  whatever the original architect could have been thinking of  never mind the kitchen said dick  what about the billiardroom  the way children nowadays will interrupt a parent is nothing short of a national disgrace  i also wish dick would not sit on the table swinging his legs  it is not respectful  why when i was a boy as i said to him i should as soon have thought of sitting on a table interrupting my father  whats this thing in the middle of the hall that looks like a grating demanded robina  she means the stairs explained dick  then why dont they look like stairs commented robina  they do replied dick to people with sense  they dont persisted robina they look like a grating  robina with the plan spread out across her knee was sitting balanced on the arm of an easychair  really i hardly see the use of buying chairs for these people  nobody seems to know what they are forexcept it be one or another of the dogs  perches are all they want  if we threw the drawingroom into the hall and could do away with the stairs thought robina we should be able to give a dance now and then  perhaps i suggested you would like to clear out the house altogether leaving nothing but the four bare walls  that would give us still more room that would  for just living in we could fix up a shed in the garden or  im talking seriously said robina  whats the good of a drawing room  one only wants it to show the sort of people into that one wishes hadnt come  theyd sit about looking miserable just as well anywhere else  if we could only get rid of the stairs  oh of course we could get rid of the stairs i agreed  it would be a bit awkward at first when we wanted to go to bed  but i daresay we should get used to it  we could have a ladder and climb up to our rooms through the windows  or we might adopt the norwegian method and have the stairs outside  i wish you would be sensible said robin  i am trying to be i explained and i am also trying to put a little sense into you  at present you are crazy about dancing  if you had your way you would turn the house into a dancingsaloon with primitive sleepingaccommodation attached  it will last six months your dancing craze  then you will want the house transformed into a swimmingbath or a skatingrink or cleared out for hockey  my idea may be conventional  i dont expect you to sympathise with it  my notion is just an ordinary christian house not a gymnasium  there are going to be bedrooms in this house and theres going to be a staircase leading to them  it may strike you as sordid but there is also going to be a kitchen  though why when building the house they should have put the kitchen   dont forget the billiardroom said dick  if you thought more of your future career and less about billiards robin pointed out to him perhaps youd get through your littlego in the course of the next few years  if pa only had sensei mean if he wasnt so absurdly indulgent wherever you are concerned he would not have a billiardtable in the house  you talk like that retorted dick merely because you cant play  i can beat you anyhow retorted robin  once admitted dickonce in six weeks  twice corrected robin  you dont play dick explained to her you just whack round and trust to providence  i dont whack round said robin i always aim at something  when you try and it doesnt come off you say its hard luck and when i try and it does come off you say its fluking  so like a man  you both of you i said attach too much importance to the score when you try for a cannon off the white and hit it on the wrong side and send it into a pocket and your own ball travels on and makes a losing hazard off the red instead of being vexed with yourselves  if you get a really good table governor said dick ill teach you billiards  i do believe dick really thinks he can play  it is the same with golf  beginners are invariably lucky  i think i shall like it they tell you i seem to have the game in me if you understand  there is a friend of mine an old seacaptain  he is the sort of man that when the three balls are lying in a straight line tucked up under the cushion looks pleased because then he knows he can make a cannon and leave the red just where he wants it  an irish youngster named malooney a college chum of dicks was staying with us and the afternoon being wet the captain said he would explain it to malooney how a young man might practise billiards without any danger of cutting the cloth  he taught him how to hold the cue and he told him how to make a bridge  malooney was grateful and worked for about an hour  he did not show much promise  he is a powerfully built young man and he didnt seem able to get it into his head that he wasnt playing cricket  whenever he hit a little low the result was generally lost ball  to save timeand damage to furnituredick and i fielded for him  dick stood at longstop and i was short slip  it was dangerous work however and when dick had caught him out twice running we agreed that we had won and took him in to tea in the eveningnone of the rest of us being keen to try our luck a second timethe captain said that just for the joke of the thing he would give malooney eightyfive and play him a hundred up  to confess the truth i find no particular fun myself in playing billiards with the captain  the game consists as far as i am concerned in walking round the table throwing him back the balls and saying good  by the time my turn comes i dont seem to care what happens  everything seems against me  he is a kind old gentleman and he means well but the tone in which he says hard lines whenever i miss an easy stroke irritates me  i feel id like to throw the balls at his head and fling the table out of window  i suppose it is that i am in a fretful state of mind but the mere way in which he chalks his cue aggravates me  he carries his own chalk in his waistcoat pocketas if our chalk wasnt good enough for him and when he has finished chalking he smooths the tip round with his finger and thumb and taps the cue against the table  oh go on with the game i want to say to him dont be so full of tricks   the captain led off with a miss in baulk  malooney gripped his cue drew in a deep breath and let fly  the result was ten  a cannon and all three balls in the same pocket  as a matter of fact he made the cannon twice but the second time as we explained to him of course did not count  good beginning said the captain  malooney seemed pleased with himself and took off his coat  malooneys ball missed the red on its first journey up the table by about a foot but found it later on and sent it into a pocket  ninetynine plays nothing said dick who was marking  better make it a hundred and fifty hadnt we captain  well id like to get in a shot said the captain before the game is over  perhaps we had better make it a hundred and fifty if mr malooney has no objection  whatever you think right sir said rory malooney  malooney finished his break for twentytwo leaving himself hanging over the middle pocket and the red tucked up in baulk  nothing plays a hundred and eight said dick  when i want the score said the captain ill ask for it  beg pardon sir said dick  i hate a noisy game said the captain  the captain making up his mind without much waste of time sent his ball under the cushion six inches outside baulk  what will i do here asked malooney  i dont know what you will do said the captain im waiting to see  owing to the position of the ball malooney was unable to employ his whole strength  all he did that turn was to pocket the captains ball and leave himself under the bottom cushion four inches from the red  the captain said a nautical word and gave another miss malooney squared up to the balls for the third time  they flew before him panicstricken  they banged against one another came back and hit one another again for no reason whatever  the red in particular malooney had succeeded apparently in frightening out of its wits  it is a stupid ball generally speaking our redits one idea to get under a cushion and watch the game  with malooney it soon found it was safe nowhere on the table  its only hope was pockets  i may have been mistaken my eye may have been deceived by the rapidity of the play but it seemed to me that the red never waited to be hit  when it saw malooneys ball coming for it at the rate of forty miles an hour it just made for the nearest pocket  it rushed round the table looking for pockets  if in its excitement it passed an empty pocket it turned back and crawled in  there were times when in its terror it jumped the table and took shelter under the sofa or behind the sideboard  one began to feel sorry for the red  the captain had scored a legitimate thirtyeight and malooney had given him twentyfour when it really seemed as if the captains chance had come  i could have scored myself as the balls were then  sixtytwo plays one hundred and twentyeight  now then captain game in your hands said dick  we gathered round  the children left their play  it was a pretty picture  the bright young faces eager with expectation the old worn veteran squinting down his cue as if afraid that watching malooneys play might have given it the squirms  now follow this i whispered to malooney  dont notice merely what he does but try and understand why he does it  any foolafter a little practice that iscan hit a ball  but why do you hit it what happens after youve hit it  what  hush said dick  the captain drew his cue back and gently pushed it forward  pretty stroke i whispered to malooney now thats the sort  i offer by way of explanation that the captain by this time was probably too full of bottledup language to be master of his nerves the ball travelled slowly past the red  dick said afterwards that you couldnt have put so much as a sheet of paper between them  it comforts a man sometimes when you tell him this and at other times it only makes him madder  it travelled on and passed the whiteyou could have put quite a lot of paper between it and the whiteand dropped with a contented thud into the top lefthand pocket  why does he do that malooney whispered  malooney has a singularly hearty whisper  dick and i got the women and children out of the room as quickly as we could but of course veronica managed to tumble over something on the wayveronica would find something to tumble over in the desert of sahara and a few days later i overheard expressions scorching their way through the nursery door that made my hair rise up  i entered and found veronica standing on the table  jumbo was sitting upon the musicstool  the poor dog himself was looking scared though he must have heard a bit of language in his time one way and another  veronica i said are you not ashamed of yourself  you wicked child how dare you  its all right said veronica  i dont really mean any harm hes a sailor and i have to talk to him like that else he dont know hes being talked to  i pay hardworking conscientious ladies to teach this child things right and proper for her to know  they tell her clever things that julius caesar said observations made by marcus aurelius that pondered over might help her to become a beautiful character  she complains that it produces a strange buzzy feeling in her head and her mother argues that perhaps her brain is of the creative order not intended to remember muchthinks that perhaps she is going to be something  a good rounddozen oaths the captain must have let fly before dick and i succeeded in rolling her out of the room  she had only heard them once yet so far as i could judge she had got them letter perfect  the captain now no longer under the necessity of employing all his energies to suppress his natural instincts gradually recovered form and eventually the game stood at one hundred and fortynine all malooney to play  the captain had left the balls in a position that would have disheartened any other opponent than malooney  to any other opponent than malooney the captain would have offered irritating sympathy  afraid the balls are not rolling well for you tonight the captain would have said or sorry sir i dont seem to have left you very much  tonight the captain wasnt feeling playful  well if he scores off that said dick  short of locking up the balls and turning out the lights i dont myself see how one is going to stop him sighed the captain  the captains ball was in hand  malooney went for the red and hit perhaps it would be more correct to say frightenedit into a pocket  malooneys ball with the table to itself then gave a solo performance and ended up by breaking a window  it was what the lawyers call a nice point  what was the effect upon the score  malooney argued that seeing he had pocketed the red before his own ball left the table his three should be counted first and that therefore he had won  dick maintained that a ball that had ended up in a flowerbed couldnt be deemed to have scored anything  the captain declined to assist  he said that although he had been playing billiards for upwards of forty years the incident was new to him  my own feeling was that of thankfulness that we had got through the game without anybody being really injured  we agreed that the person to decide the point would be the editor of the field  it remains still undecided  the captain came into my study the next morning  he said  if you havent written that letter to the field dont mention my name  they know me on the field  i would rather it did not get about that i have been playing with a man who cannot keep his ball within the four walls of a billiardroom  well i answered i know most of the fellows on the field myself they dont often get hold of anything novel in the way of a story when they do they are apt to harp upon it  my idea was to keep my own name out of it altogether  it is not a point likely to crop up often said the captain  id let it rest if i were you  i should like to have had it settled  in the end i wrote the editor a careful letter in a disguised hand giving a false name and address  but if any answer ever appeared i must have missed it  myself i have a sort of consciousness that somewhere inside me there is quite a good player if only i could persuade him to come out  he is shy that is all  he does not seem able to play when people are looking on  the shots he misses when people are looking on would give you a wrong idea of him  when nobody is about a prettier game you do not often see  if some folks who fancy themselves could see me when there is nobody about it might take the conceit out of them only once i played up to what i feel is my real form and then it led to argument  i was staying at an hotel in switzerland and the second evening a pleasantspoken young fellow who said he had read all my bookslater he appeared surprised on learning i had written more than twoasked me if i would care to play a hundred up  we played even and i paid for the table  the next evening he said he thought it would make a better game if he gave me forty and i broke it was a fairly close finish and afterwards he suggested that i should put down my name for the handicap they were arranging  i am afraid i answered that i hardly play well enough  just a quiet game with you is one thing but in a handicap with a crowd looking on  i should not let that trouble you he said there are some here who play worse than youjust one or two  it passes the evening  it was merely a friendly affair  i paid my twenty marks and was given plus a hundred  i drew for my first game a chatty type of man who started minus twenty  we neither of us did much for the first five minutes and then i made a break of fortyfour  there was not a fluke in it from beginning to end  i was never more astonished in my life  it seemed to me it was the cue was doing it  minus twenty was even more astonished  i heard him as i passed  who handicapped this man he asked  i did said the pleasantspoken youngster  oh said minus twentyfriend of yours i presume  there are evenings that seem to belong to you  we finished that two hundred and fifty under the threequarters of an hour  i explained to minus twentyhe was plus sixtythree at the endthat my play that night had been exceptional  he said that he had heard of cases similar  i left him talking volubly to the committee  he was not a nice man at all  after that i did not care to win and that of course was fatal  the less i tried the more impossible it seemed for me to do wrong  i was left in at the last with a man from another hotel  but for that i am convinced i should have carried off the handicap  our hotel didnt anyhow want the other hotel to win  so they gathered round me and offered me sound advice and begged me to be careful with the natural result that i went back to my usual form quite suddenly  never before or since have i played as i played that week  but it showed me what i could do  i shall get a new table with proper pockets this time  there is something wrong about our pockets  the balls go into them and then come out again  you would think they had seen something there to frighten them  they come out trembling and hold on to the cushion  i shall also get a new red ball  i fancy it must be a very old ball our red  it seems to me to be always tired  the billiardroom i said to dick i see my way to easily enough adding another ten feet to what is now the dairy will give us twenty eight by twenty  i am hopeful that will be sufficient even for your friend malooney  the drawingroom is too small to be of any use  i may decideas robina has suggestedto throw it into the hall but the stairs will remain  for dancing private theatricalsthings to keep you children out of mischiefi have an idea i will explain to you later on  the kitchen  can i have a room to myself asked veronica  veronica was sitting on the floor staring into the fire her chin supported by her hand  veronica in those rare moments when she is resting from her troubles wears a holy faraway expression apt to mislead the stranger  governesses new to her have their doubts whether on these occasions they are justified in dragging her back to discuss mere dates and tables  poets who are friends of mine coming unexpectedly upon veronica standing by the window gazing upward at the evening star have thought it was a vision until they got closer and found that she was sucking peppermints  i should so like to have a room all to myself added veronica  it would be a room commented robin  it wouldnt have your hairpins sticking up all over the bed anyhow murmured veronica dreamily  i like that said robin why  youre harder than i am said veronica  i should wish you to have a room veronica i said  my fear is that in place of one untidy bedroom in the housea room that makes me shudder every time i see it through the open door and the door in spite of all i can say generally is wide open  im not untidy said robin not really  i know where everything is in the darkif people would only leave them alone  you are  youre about the most untidy girl i know said dick  im not said robin you dont see other girls rooms  look at yours at cambridge  malooney told us youd had a fire and we all believed him at first  when a mans working said dick  he must have an orderly place to work in suggested robin  dick sighed  its never any good talking to you said dick  you dont even see your own faults  i can said robin i see them more than anyone  all i claim is justice  show me veronica i said that you are worthy to possess a room at present you appear to regard the whole house as your room  i find your gaiters on the croquet lawn  a portion of your costumean article that anyone possessed of the true feelings of a lady would desire to keep hidden from the worldis discovered waving from the staircase window  i put it out to be mended explained veronica  you opened the door and flung it out  i told you of it at the time said robin  you do the same with your boots  you are too highspirited for your size explained dick to her try to be less dashing  i could also wish veronica i continued that you shed your back comb less easily or at least that you knew when you had shed it  as for your gloveswell hunting your gloves has come to be our leading winter sport  people look in such funny places for them said veronica  granted  but be just veronica i pleaded  admit that it is in funny places we occasionally find them  when looking for your things one learns veronica never to despair  so long as there remains a corner unexplored inside or outside the house within the halfmile radius hope need not be abandoned  veronica was still gazing dreamily into the fire  i suppose said veronica its reditty  its what i said  she means heredity suggested dickcheeky young beggar  i wonder you let her talk to you the way she does  besides added robin as i am always explaining to you pa is a literary man  with him it is part of his temperament  its hard on us children said veronica  we were all agreedwith the exception of veronicathat it was time veronica went to bed  as chairman i took it upon myself to closure the debate    chapter ii    do you mean governor that you have actually bought the house demanded dick or are we only talking about it  this time dick i answered i have done it  dick looked serious  is it what you wanted he asked  no dick i replied it is not what i wanted  i wanted an old fashioned picturesque rambling sort of a place all gables and ivy and oriel windows  you are mixing things up dick interrupted gables and oriel windows dont go together  i beg your pardon dick i corrected him in the house i wanted they do  it is the style of house you find in the christmas number i have never seen it anywhere else but i took a fancy to it from the first  it is not too far from the church and it lights up well at night  one of these days i used to say to myself when a boy ill be a clever man and live in a house just like that  it was my dream  and what is this place like demanded robin this place you have bought  the agent i explained claims for it that it is capable of improvement  i asked him to what school of architecture he would say it belonged he said he thought that it must have been a local school and pointed outwhat seems to be the truththat nowadays they do not build such houses  near to the river demanded dick  well by the road i answered i daresay it may be a couple of miles  and by the shortest way questioned dick  that is the shortest way i explained theres a prettier way through the woods but that is about three miles and a half  but we had decided it was to be near the river said robin  we also decided i replied that it was to be on sandy soil with a southwest aspect  only one thing in this house has a southwest aspect and thats the back door  i asked the agent about the sand he advised me if i wanted it in any quantity to get an estimate from the railway company  i wanted it on a hill  it is on a hill with a bigger hill in front of it  i didnt want that other hill  i wanted an uninterrupted view of the southern half of england  i wanted to take people out on the step and cram them with stories about our being able on clear days to see the bristol channel  they might not have believed me but without that hill i could have stuck to it and they could not have been certainnot dead certaini was lying  personally i should have liked a house where something had happened  i should have liked myself a bloodstainnot a fussy bloodstain a neat unobtrusive bloodstain that would have been content most of its time to remain hidden under the mat shown only occasionally as a treat to visitors  i had hopes even of a ghost  i dont mean one of those noisy ghosts that doesnt seem to know it is dead  a lady ghost would have been my fancy a gentle ghost with quiet pretty ways  this housewell it is such a sensiblelooking house that is my chief objection to it  it has got an echo  if you go to the end of the garden and shout at it very loudly it answers you back  this is the only bit of fun you can have with it  even then it answers you in such a tone you feel it thinks the whole thing sillyis doing it merely to humour you  it is one of those houses that always seems to be thinking of its rates and taxes  any reason at all for your having bought it asked dick  yes dick i answered  we are all of us tired of this suburb  we want to live in the country and be good  to live in the country with any comfort it is necessary to have a house there  this being admitted it follows we must either build a house or buy one  i would rather not build a house  talboys built himself a house  you know talboys  when i first met him before he started building he was a cheerful soul with a kindly word for everyone  the builder assures him that in another twenty years when the colour has had time to tone down his house will be a picture  at present it makes him bilious the mere sight of it  year by year they tell him as the dampness wears itself away he will suffer less and less from rheumatism ague and lumbago  he has a hedge round the garden it is eighteen inches high  to keep the boys out he has put up barbed wire fencing  but wire fencing affords no real privacy  when the talboys are taking coffee on the lawn there is generally a crowd from the village watching them  there are trees in the garden you know they are treesthere is a label tied to each one telling you what sort of tree it is  for the moment there is a similarity about them  thirty years hence talboys estimates they will afford him shade and comfort but by that time he hopes to be dead  i want a house that has got over all its troubles i dont want to spend the rest of my life bringing up a young and inexperienced house  but why this particular house urged robin if as you say it is not the house you wanted  because my dear girl i answered it is less unlike the house i wanted than other houses i have seen  when we are young we make up our minds to try and get what we want when we have arrived at years of discretion we decide to try and want what we can get  it saves time  during the last two years i have seen about sixty houses and out of the lot there was only one that was really the house i wanted hitherto i have kept the story to myself  even now thinking about it irritates me  it was not an agent who told me of it  i met a man by chance in a railway carriage  he had a black eye  if ever i meet him again ill give him another  he accounted for it by explaining that he had had trouble with a golf ball and at the time i believed him  i mentioned to him in conversation i was looking for a house he described this place to me and it seemed to me hours before the train stopped at a station  when it did i got out and took the next train back  i did not even wait for lunch  i had my bicycle with me and i went straight there  it waswell it was the house i wanted  if it had vanished suddenly and i had found myself in bed the whole thing would have seemed more reasonable  the proprietor opened the door to me himself  he had the bearing of a retired military man  it was afterwards i learnt he was the proprietor  i said good afternoon if it is not troubling you i would like to look over the house  we were standing in the oakpanelled hall  i noticed the carved staircase about which the man in the train had told me also the tudor fireplaces  that is all i had time to notice  the next moment i was lying on my back in the middle of the gravel with the door shut  i looked up  i saw the old maniacs head sticking out of a little window  it was an evil face  he had a gun in his hand  im going to count twenty he said  if you are not the other side of the gate by then i shoot  i ran over the figures myself on my way to the gate  i made it eighteen  i had an hour to wait for the train  i talked the matter over with the stationmaster  yes he said therell be trouble up there one of these days  i said it seems to me to have begun  he said its the indian sun  it gets into their heads  we have one or two in the neighbourhood  they are quiet enough till something happens  if id been two seconds longer i said i believe hed have done it  its a taking house said the stationmaster not too big and not too little  its the sort of house people seem to be looking for  i dont envy i said the next person that finds it  he settled himself down here said the stationmaster about ten years ago  since then if one person has offered to take the house off his hands i suppose a thousand have  at first he would laugh at them goodtemperedlyexplain to them that his idea was to live there himself in peace and quietness till he died  two out of every three of them would express their willingness to wait for that and suggest some arrangement by which they might enter into possession say a week after the funeral  the last few months it has been worse than ever  i reckon youre about the eighth that has been up there this week and today only thursday  theres something to be said you know for the old man  and did he asked dickdid he shoot the next party that came along  dont be so silly dick said robin its a story  tell us another pa  i dont know what you mean robina by a story i said  if you mean to imply  robina said she didnt but i know quite well she did  because i am an author and have to tell stories for my living people think i dont know any truth  it is vexing enough to be doubted when one is exaggerating to have sneers flung at one by ones own kith and kin when one is struggling to confine oneself to bald bare narrative well where is the inducement to be truthful  there are times when i almost say to myself that i will never tell the truth again  as it happens i said the story is true in many places  i pass over your indifference to the risk i ran though a nice girl at the point where the gun was mentioned would have expressed alarm anyhow at the end you might have said something more sympathetic than merely tell us another  he did not shoot the next party that arrived for the reason that the very next day his wife alarmed at what had happened went up to london and consulted an expertnone too soon as it turned out  the poor old fellow died six months later in a private lunatic asylum i had it from the stationmaster on passing through the junction again this spring  the house fell into the possession of his nephew who is living in it now  he is a youngish man with a large family and people have learnt that the place is not for sale  it seems to me rather a sad story  the indian sun as the stationmaster thinks may have started the trouble but the end was undoubtedly hastened by the annoyance to which the unfortunate gentleman had been subjected and i myself might have been shot  the only thing that comforts me is thinking of that fools black eyethe fool that sent me there  and none of the other houses suggested dick were any good at all  there were drawbacks dick i explained  there was a house in essex it was one of the first your mother and i inspected  i nearly shed tears of joy when i read the advertisement  it had once been a priory  queen elizabeth had slept there on her way to greenwich  a photograph of the house accompanied the advertisement  i should not have believed the thing had it been a picture  it was under twelve miles from charing cross  the owner it was stated was open to offers  all humbug i suppose suggested dick  the advertisement if anything i replied had underestimated the attractiveness of that house  all i blame the advertisement for is that it did not mention other things  it did not mention for instance that since queen elizabeths time the neighbourhood had changed  it did not mention that the entrance was between a public house one side of the gate and a friedfish shop on the other that the great eastern railwaycompany had established a goods depot at the bottom of the garden that the drawingroom windows looked out on extensive chemical works and the diningroom windows which were round the corner on a stonemasons yard  the house itself was a dream  but what is the sense of it demanded dick  what do house agents think is the good of it  do they think people likely to take a house after reading the advertisement without ever going to see it  i asked an agent once that very question i replied  he said they did it first and foremost to keep up the spirits of the ownerthe man who wanted to sell the house  he said that when a man was trying to part with a house he had to listen to so much abuse of it from people who came to see it that if somebody did not stick up for the housesay all that could be said for it and gloss over its defects he would end by becoming so ashamed of it he would want to give it away or blow it up with dynamite  he said that reading the advertisement in the agents catalogue was the only thing that reconciled him to being the owner of the house  he said one client of his had been trying to sell his house for yearsuntil one day in the office he read by chance the agents description of it  upon which he went straight home took down the board and has lived there contentedly ever since  from that point of view there is reason in the system but for the househunter it works badly  one agent sent me a days journey to see a house standing in the middle of a brickfield with a view of the grand junction canal  i asked him where was the river he had mentioned  he explained it was the other side of the canal but on a lower level that was the only reason why from the house you couldnt see it  i asked him for his picturesque scenery  he explained it was farther on round the bend he seemed to think me unreasonable expecting to find everything i wanted just outside the frontdoor  he suggested my shutting out the brickfieldif i didnt like the brickfieldwith trees  he suggested the eucalyptustree  he said it was a rapid grower  he also told me that it yielded gum  another house i travelled down into dorsetshire to see  it contained according to the advertisement perhaps the most perfect specimen of norman arch extant in southern england  it was to be found mentioned in dugdale and dated from the thirteenth century  i dont quite know what i expected  i argued to myself that there must have been ruffians of only moderate means even in those days  here and there some robber baron who had struck a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely little castle  a few such hidden away in unfrequented districts had escaped destruction more civilised descendants had adapted them to later requirements  i had in my mind before the train reached dorchester something between a miniature tower of london and a mediaeval edition of ann hathaways cottage at stratford  i pictured dungeons and a drawbridge perhaps a secret passage  lamchick has a secret passage leading from behind a sort of portrait in the diningroom to the back of the kitchen chimney  they use it for a linen closet  it seems to me a pity  of course originally it went on farther  the vicar who is a bit of an antiquarian believes it comes out somewhere in the churchyard  i tell lamchick he ought to have it opened up but his wife doesnt want it touched  she seems to think it just right as it is  i have always had a fancy for a secret passage  i decided i would have the drawbridge repaired and made practicable  flanked on each side with flowers in tubs it would have been a novel and picturesque approach  was there a drawbridge asked dick  there was no drawbridge i explained  the entrance to the house was through what the caretaker called the conservatory  it was not the sort of house that goes with a drawbridge  then what about the norman arches argued dick  not arches i corrected him arch  the norman arch was downstairs in the kitchen  it was the kitchen that had been built in the thirteenth centuryand had not had much done to it since apparently  originally i should say it had been the torture chamber it gave you that idea  i think your mother would have raised objections to the kitchenanyhow when she came to think of the cook  it would have been necessary to put it to the woman before engaging her  you dont mind cooking in a dungeon in the dark do you  some cooks would  the rest of the house was what i should describe as presentday mixed style  the last tenant but one had thrown out a bathroom in corrugated iron  then there was a house in berkshire that i took your mother to see with a trout stream running through the grounds  i imagined myself going out after lunch catching trout for dinner inviting swagger friends down to my little place in berkshire for a few days trout fishing  there is a man i once knew who is now a baronet  he used to be keen on fishing  i thought maybe id get him  it would have looked well in the literary gossip column  among the other distinguished guestsyou know the sort of thing  i had the paragraph already in my mind  the wonder is i didnt buy a rod  wasnt there any trout stream questioned robin  there was a stream i answered if anything too much stream  the stream was the first thing your mother noticed  she noticed it a quarter of an hour before we came to itbefore we knew it was the stream  we drove back to the town and she bought a smellingbottle the larger size  it gave your mother a headache that stream and made me mad  the agents office was opposite the station  i allowed myself half an hour on my way back to tell him what i thought of him and then i missed the train  i could have got it in if he had let me talk all the time but he would interrupt  he said it was the people at the papermillthat he had spoken to them about it more than once he seemed to think sympathy was all i wanted  he assured me on his word as a houseagent that it had once been a trout stream  the fact was historical  isaac walton had fished therethat was prior to the papermill  he thought a collection of trout male and female might be bought and placed in it preference being given to some hardy breed of trout accustomed to roughing it  i told him i wasnt looking for a place where i could play at being noah and left him as i explained to him with the intention of going straight to my solicitors and instituting proceedings against him for talking like a fool and he put on his hat and went across to his solicitors to commence proceedings against me for libel  i suppose that with myself he thought better of it in the end but im tired of having my life turned into one perpetual first of april  this house that i have bought is not my hearts desire but about it there are possibilities  we will put in lattice windows and fussup the chimneys  maybe we will let in a tablet over the frontdoor with a datealways looks well  it is a picturesque figure the oldfashioned five  by the time we have done with it for all practical purposesit will be a tudor manorhouse  i have always wanted an old tudor manorhouse  there is no reason so far as i can see why there should not be stories connected with this house  why should not we have a room in which somebody once slept we wont have queen elizabeth  im tired of queen elizabeth besides i dont believe shed have been nice  why not queen anne a quiet gentle old lady from all accounts who would not have given trouble  or better still shakespeare  he was constantly to and fro between london and stratford  it would not have been so very much out of his way  the room where shakespeare slept  why its a new idea  nobody ever seems to have thought of shakespeare  there is the fourpost bedstead  your mother never liked it  she will insist it harbours things  we might hang the wall with scenes from his plays and have a bust of the old gentleman himself over the door  if im left alone and not worried ill probably end by believing that he really did sleep there  what about cupboards suggested dick  the little mother will clamour for cupboards  it is unexplainable the average womans passion for cupboards  in heaven her first request i am sure is always can i have a cupboard  she would keep her husband and children in cupboards if she had her way  that would be her idea of the perfect home everybody wrapped up with a piece of camphor in his or her own proper cupboard  i knew a woman once who was happyfor a woman  she lived in a house with twentynine cupboards  i think it must have been built by a woman  they were spacious cupboards many of them with doors in no way different from other doors  visitors would wish each other goodnight and disappear with their candles into cupboards staggering out backwards the next moment looking scared  one poor gentleman this womans husband told me having to go downstairs again for something he had forgotten and unable on his return to strike anything else but cupboards lost heart and finished up the night in a cupboard  at breakfasttime guests would hurry down and burst open cupboard doors with a cheery goodmorning  when that woman was out nobody in that house ever knew where anything was and when she came home she herself only knew where it ought to have been yet once when one of those twentynine cupboards had to be cleared out temporarily for repairs she never smiled her husband told me for more than three weeksnot till the workmen were out of the house and that cupboard in working order again  she said it was so confusing having nowhere to put her things  the average woman does not want a house in the ordinary sense of the word  what she wants is something made by a genii  you have found as you think the ideal house  you show her the adams fireplace in the drawingroom  you tap the wainscoting of the hall with your umbrella  oak you impress upon her all oak  you draw her attention to the view  you tell her the local legend  by fixing her head against the windowpane she can see the tree on which the man was hanged  you dwell upon the sundial you mention for a second time the adams fireplace  its all very nice she answers but where are the children going to sleep  it is so disheartening  if it isnt the children its the water  she wants waterwants to know where it comes from  you show her where it comes from  what out of that nasty place she exclaims  she is equally dissatisfied whether it be drawn from a well or whether it be water that has fallen from heaven and been stored in tanks  she has no faith in natures water  a woman never believes that water can be good that does not come from a waterworks  her idea appears to be that the company makes it fresh every morning from some old family recipe  if you do succeed in reconciling her to the water then she feels sure that the chimneys smoke they look as if they smoked  whyas you tell herthe chimneys are the best part of the house  you take her outside and make her look at them  they are genuine sixteenth century chimneys with carving on them  they couldnt smoke  they wouldnt do anything so inartistic  she says she only hopes you are right and suggests cowls if they do  after that she wants to see the kitchenwheres the kitchen  you dont know where it is  you didnt bother about the kitchen  there must be a kitchen of course  you proceed to search for the kitchen when you find it she is worried because it is the opposite end of the house to the diningroom  you point out to her the advantage of being away from the smell of the cooking  at that she gets personal tells you that you are the first to grumble when the dinner is cold and in her madness accuses the whole male sex of being impractical the mere sight of an empty house makes a woman fretful  of course the stove is wrong  the kitchen stove always is wrong you promise she shall have a new one  six months later she will want the old one back again  but it would be cruel to tell her this  the promise of that new stove comforts her  the woman never loses hope that one day it will comethe allsatisfying kitchen stove the stove of her girlish dreams  the question of the stove settled you imagine you have silenced all opposition  at once she begins to talk about things that nobody but a woman or a sanitary inspector can talk about without blushing  it calls for tact getting a woman into a new house  she is nervous suspicious  i am glad my dear dick i answered that you have mentioned cupboards  it is with cupboards that i am hoping to lure your mother  the cupboards from her point of view will be the one bright spot there are fourteen of them  i am trusting to cupboards to tide me over many things  i shall want you to come with me dick whenever your mother begins a sentence with  but now to be practical dear i want you to murmur something about cupboardsnot irritatingly as if it had been prearranged  have a little gumption  will there be room for a tennis court demanded dick  an excellent tennis court already exists i informed him  i have also purchased the adjoining paddock  we shall be able to keep our own cow  maybe well breed horses  we might have a croquet lawn suggested robin  we might easily have a croquet lawn i agreed  on a fullsized lawn i believe veronica might be taught to play  there are natures that demand space  on a fullsized lawn protected by a stout iron border less time might be wasted exploring the surrounding scenery for veronicas lost ball  no chance of a golf links anywhere in the neighbourhood feared dick  i am not so sure i answered  barely a mile away there is a pretty piece of gorse land that appears to be no good to anyone  i daresay for a reasonable offer  i say when will this show be ready interrupted dick  i propose beginning the alterations at once i explained  by luck there happens to be a gamekeepers cottage vacant and within distance  the agent is going to get me the use of it for a yeara primitive little place but charmingly situate on the edge of a wood i shall furnish a couple of rooms and for part of every week i shall make a point of being down there superintending  i have always been considered good at superintending  my poor father used to say it was the only work i seemed to take an interest in  by being on the spot to hurry everybody on i hope to have the show as you term it ready by the spring  i shall never marry said robin  dont be so easily discouraged advised dick you are still young  i dont ever want to get married continued robin  i should only quarrel with my husband if i did  and dick will never do anything not with his head  forgive me if i am dull i pleaded but what is the connection between this house your quarrels with your husband if you ever get one and dicks head  by way of explanation robin sprang to the ground and before he could stop her had flung her arms around dicks neck  we cant help it dick dear she told him  clever parents always have duffing children  but well be of some use in the world after all you and i  the idea was that dick when he had finished failing in examinations should go out to canada and start a farm taking robin with him they would breed cattle and gallop over the prairies and camp out in the primeval forest and slide about on snowshoes and carry canoes on their backs and shoot rapids and stalk thingsso far as i could gather have a sort of everlasting buffalobills show all to themselves  how and when the farm work was to get itself done was not at all clear  the little mother and myself were to end our days with them  we were to sit about in the sun for a time and then pass peacefully away  robin shed a few tears at this point but regained her spirits thinking of veronica who was to be lured out on a visit and married to some truehearted yeoman  which is not at present veronicas ambition  veronicas conviction is that she would look well in a coronet  her own idea is something in the ducal line robina talked for about ten minutes  by the time she had done she had persuaded dick that life in the backwoods of canada had been his dream from infancy  she is that sort of girl  i tried talking reason but talking to robin when she has got a notion in her head is like trying to fix a halter on a twoyearold colt  this tumbledown sixroomed cottage was to be the saving of the family  an ecstatic look transfigured robinas face even as she spoke of it  you might have fancied it a shrine  robina would do the cooking  robina would rise early and milk the cow and gather the morning egg  we would lead the simple life learn to fend for ourselves  it would be so good for veronica  the higher education could wait let the higher ideals have a chance  veronica would make the beds dust the rooms  in the evening veronica her little basket by her side would sit and sew while i talked telling them things and robina moved softly to and fro about her work the household fairy  the little mother whenever strong enough would come to us we would hover round her tending her with loving hands  the english farmer must know something in spite of all that is said  dick could arrange for lessons in practical farming  she did not say it crudely but hinted that surrounded by example even i might come to take an interest in honest labour might end by learning to do something useful  robina talked i should say for a quarter of an hour  by the time she had done it appeared to me rather a beautiful idea  dicks vacation had just commenced  for the next three months there would be nothing else for him to do butto employ his own expressive phraserot round  in any event it would be keeping him out of mischief  veronicas governess was leaving  veronicas governess generally does leave at the end of about a year  i think sometimes of advertising for a lady without a conscience  at the end of a year they explain to me that their conscience will not allow them to remain longer they do not feel they are earning their salary  it is not that the child is not a dear child it is not that she is stupid simply it isas a german lady to whom dick had been giving what he called finishing lessons in english once put itthat she does not seem to be taking any  her mothers idea is that it is sinking in  perhaps if we allowed veronica to lie fallow for awhile something might show itself  robina speaking for herself held that a period of quiet usefulness away from the society of other silly girls and sillier boys would result in her becoming a sensible woman  it is not often that robinas yearnings take this direction to thwart them when they did seemed wrong  we had some difficulty with the little mother  that these three babies of hers will ever be men and women capable of running a six roomed cottage appears to the little mother in the light of a fantastic dream  i explained to her that i should be there at all events for two or three days in every week to give an eye to things even that did not content her  she gave way eventually on robinas solemn undertaking that she should be telegraphed for the first time veronica coughed  on monday we packed a onehorse van with what we deemed essential dick and robina rode their bicycles  veronica supported by assorted bedding made herself comfortable upon the tailboard  i followed down by train on the wednesday afternoon    chapter iii    it was the cow that woke me the first morning  i did not know it was our cownot at the time  i didnt know we had a cow  i looked at my watch it was halfpast two  i thought maybe she would go to sleep again but her idea was that the day had begun  i went to the window the moon was at the full  she was standing by the gate her head inside the garden i took it her anxiety was lest we might miss any of it  her neck was stretched out straight her eyes towards the sky which gave to her the appearance of a longeared alligator  i have never had much to do with cows  i dont know how you talk to them  i told her to be quiet and to lie down and made pretence to throw a boot at her  it seemed to cheer her having an audience she added half a dozen extra notes  i never knew before a cow had so much in her  there is a thing one sometimes meets with in the suburbsor one used to i do not know whether it is still extant but when i was a boy it was quite common  it has a hurdygurdy fixed to its waist and a drum strapped on behind a row of pipes hanging from its face and bells and clappers from most of its other joints it plays them all at once and smiles  this cow reminded me of it with organ effects added  she didnt smile there was that to be said in her favour  i hoped that if i made believe to be asleep she would get discouraged  so i closed the window ostentatiously and went back to bed  but it only had the effect of putting her on her mettle  he did not care for that last i imagined her saying to herself i wasnt at my best  there wasnt feeling enough in it  she kept it up for about half an hour and then the gate against which i suppose she had been leaning gave way with a crash  that frightened her and i heard her gallop off across the field  i was on the point of dozing off again when a pair of pigeons settled on the windowsill and began to coo  it is a pretty sound when you are in the mood for it  i wrote a poem oncea simple thing but instinct with longingwhile sitting under a tree and listening to the cooing of a pigeon  but that was in the afternoon  my only longing now was for a gun  three times i got out of bed and shood them away  the third time i remained by the window till i had got it firmly into their heads that i really did not want them  my behaviour on the former two occasions they had evidently judged to be mere playfulness  i had just got back to bed again when an owl began to screech  that is another sound i used to think attractiveso weird so mysterious  it is swinburne i think who says that you never get the desired one and the time and the place all right together  if the beloved one is with you it is the wrong place or at the wrong time and if the time and the place happen to be right then it is the party that is wrong  the owl was all right  i like owls  the place was all right  he had struck the wrong time that was all  eleven oclock at night when you cant see him and naturally feel that you want to is the proper time for an owl perched on the roof of a cowshed in the early dawn he looks silly he clung there flapping his wings and screeching at the top of his voice  what it was he wanted i am sure i dont know and anyhow it didnt seem the way to get it  he came to this conclusion himself at the end of twenty minutes and shut himself up and went home  i thought i was going to have at last some peace when a corncrakea creature upon whom nature has bestowed a song like to the tearing of calicosheets mingled with the sharpening of sawssettled somewhere in the garden and set to work to praise its maker according to its lights  i have a friend a poet who lives just off the strand and spends his evenings at the garrick club  he writes occasional verse for the evening papers and talks about the silent country drowsy with the weight of languors  one of these times ill lure him down for a saturday to monday and let him find out what the country really islet him hear it  he is becoming too much of a dreamer  it will do him good wake him up a bit  the corncrake after awhile stopped quite suddenly with a jerk and for quite five minutes there was silence  if this continues for another five i said to myself ill be asleep  i felt it coming over me  i had hardly murmured the words when the cow turned up again  i should say she had been somewhere and had had a drink  she was in better voice than ever  it occurred to me that this would be an opportunity to make a few notes on the sunrise  the literary man is looked to for occasional description of the sunrise  the earnest reader who has heard about this sunrise thirsts for full particulars  myself for purposes of observation i have generally chosen december or the early part of january  but one never knows  maybe one of these days ill want a summer sunrise with birds and dewbesprinkled flowers  it goes well with the rustic heroine the millers daughter or the girl who brings up chickens and has dreams  i met a brother author once at seven oclock in the morning in kensington gardens  he looked half asleep and so disagreeable that i hesitated for awhile to speak to him  he is a man that as a rule breakfasts at eleven  but i summoned my courage and accosted him  this is early for you i said  its early for anyone but a born fool he answered  whats the matter i asked  cant you sleep  cant i sleep he retorted indignantly  why i darent sit down upon a seat i darent lean up against a tree  if i did id be asleep in half a second  whats the idea i persisted  been reading smiless self help and the secret of success  dont be absurd i advised him youll be going to sunday school next and keeping a diary  you have left it too late  we dont reform at forty  go home and go to bed i could see he was doing himself no good  im going to bed he answered im going to bed for a month when ive finished this confounded novel that im on  take my advice he saidhe laid his hand upon my shouldernever choose a colonial girl for your heroine  at our age it is simple madness  shes a fine girl he continued and good  has a heart of gold shes wearing me to a shadow  i wanted something fresh and unconventional  i didnt grasp what it was going to do  shes the girl that gets up early in the morning and rides barebackthe horse i mean of course dont be so silly  over in new south wales it didnt matter  i threw in the usual local colourthe eucalyptus tree and the kangarooand let her ride  it is now that she is over here in london that i wish i had never thought of her  she gets up at five and wanders about the silent city  that means of course that i have to get up at five in order to record her impressions  i have walked six miles this morning  first to st pauls cathedral she likes it when theres nobody about  youd think it wasnt big enough for her to see if anybody else was in the street  she thinks of it as of a mother watching over her sleeping children shes full of all that sort of thing  and from there to westminster bridge she sits on the parapet and reads wordsworth till the policeman turns her off  this is another of her favourite spots  he indicated with a look of concentrated disgust the avenue where we were standing  this is where she likes to finish up  she comes here to listen to a blackbird  well you are through with it now i said to console him  youve done it and its over  through with it he laughed bitterly  im just beginning it theres the entire east end to be done yet  shes got to meet a fellow there as big a crank as herself  and walking isnt the worst shes going to have a horse you can guess what that meanshyde park will be no good to her  shell find out richmond and ham common  ive got to describe the scenery and the mad joy of the thing  cant you imagine it i suggested  im going to imagine all the enjoyable part of it he answered  i must have a groundwork to go upon  shes got to have feelings come to her upon this horse  you cant enter into a riders feelings when youve almost forgotten which side of the horse you get up  i walked with him to the serpentine  i had been wondering how it was he had grown stout so suddenly  he had a bath towel round him underneath his coat  itll give me my death of cold i know it will he chattered while unlacing his boots  cant you leave it till the summertime i suggested and take her to ostend  it wouldnt be unconventional he growled  she wouldnt take an interest in it  but do they allow ladies to bathe in the serpentine i persisted  it wont be the serpentine he explained  its going to be the thames at greenwich  but it must be the same sort of feeling  shes got to tell them all about it during a lunch in queens gate and shock them all  thats all she does it for in my opinion  he emerged a mottled blue  i helped him into his clothes and he was fortunate enough to find an early cab  the book appeared at christmas  the critics agreed that the heroine was a delightful creation  some of them said they would like to have known her  remembering my poor friend it occurred to me that by going out now and making a few notes about the morning i might be saving myself trouble later on  i slipped on a few thingsnothing elaborateput a notebook in my pocket opened the door and went down  perhaps it would be more correct to say opened the door and was down  it was my own fault i admit  we had talked this thing over before going to bed and i myself had impressed upon veronica the need for caution  the architect of the country cottage does not waste space  he dispenses with landings the bedroom door opens on to the top stair  it does not do to walk out of your bedroom for the reason there is nothing outside to walk on  i had said to veronica pointing out this fact to her  now dont in the morning come bursting out of the room in your usual volcanic style because if you do there will be trouble  as you perceive there is no landing  the stairs commence at once they are steep and they lead down to a brick floor  open the door quietly look where you are going and step carefully  dick had added his advice to mine  i did that myself the first morning dick had said  i stepped straight out of the bedroom into the kitchen and i can tell you it hurts  you be careful young un  this cottage doesnt lend itself to dash  robina had fallen down with a tray in her hand  she said that never should she forget the horror of that moment when sitting on the kitchen floor she had cried to dickher own voice sounding to her as if it came from somewhere quite far off  is it broken  tell me the truth  is it broken anywhere and dick had replied  broken why its smashed to atoms  what did you expect  robina had asked the question with reference to her head while dick had thought she was alluding to the teapot  in that moment had said robina her whole life had passed before her  she let veronica feel the bump  veronica was disappointed with the bump having expected something bigger but had promised to be careful  we had all agreed that if in spite of our warnings she forgot and came blundering down in the morning it would serve her right  it was thinking of all this that as i lay upon the floor made me feel angry with everybody  i hate people who can sleep through noises that wake me up  why was i the only person in the house to be disturbed  dicks room was round the corner there was some excuse for him  but robina and veronicas window looked straight down upon the cow  if robina and veronica were not a couple of logs the cow would have aroused them  we should have discussed the matter with the door ajar  robina would have said whatever you do be careful of the stairs pa and i should have remembered  the modern child appears to me to have no feeling for its parent  i picked myself up and started for the door  the cow continued bellowing steadily  my whole anxiety was to get to her quickly and to hit her  but the door took more finding than i could have believed possible  the shutters were closed and the whole place was in pitch darkness  the idea had been to furnish this cottage only with things that were absolutely necessary but the room appeared to me to be overcrowded  there was a milkingstool which is a thing made purposely heavy so that it may not be easily upset  if i tumbled over it once i tumbled over it a dozen times  i got hold of it at last and carried it about with me  i thought i would use it to hit the cowthat is when i had found the frontdoor  i knew it led out of the parlour but could not recollect its exact position  i argued that if i kept along the wall i should be bound to come to it i found the wall and set off full of hope  i suppose the explanation was that without knowing it i must have started with the door not the frontdoor the other door leading into the kitchen  i crept along carefully feeling my way and struck quite new things altogetherthings i had no recollection of and that hit me in fresh places  i climbed over what i presumed to be a beer barrel and landed among bottles there were dozens upon dozens of them  to get away from these bottles i had to leave the wall but i found it again as i thought and i felt along it for another half a dozen yards or so and then came again upon bottles  the room appeared to be paved with bottles  a little farther on i rolled over another beerbarrel  as a matter of fact it was the same beer barrel but i did not know this  at the time it seemed to me that robina had made up her mind to run a publichouse  i found the milkingstool again and started afresh and before i had gone a dozen steps was in among bottles again  later on in the broad daylight it was easy enough to understand what had happened  i had been carefully feeling my way round and round a screen  i got so sick of these bottles and so tired of rolling over these everlasting beer barrels that i abandoned the wall and plunged boldly into space  i had barely started when looking up i saw the sky above me  a star was twinkling just above my head  had i been wide awake and had the cow stopped bellowing for just one minute i should have guessed that somehow or another i had got into a chimney  but as things were the wonder and the mystery of it all appalled me alices adventures in wonderland would have appeared to me at that moment in the nature of a guide to travellers  had a rockinghorse or a lobster suddenly appeared to me i should have sat and talked to it and if it had not answered me i should have thought it sulky and been hurt  i took a step forward and the star disappeared just as if somebody had blown it out  i was not surprised in the least  i was expecting anything to happen  i found a door and it opened quite easily  a wood was in front of me  i couldnt see any cow anywhere but i still heard her  it all seemed quite natural  i would wander into the wood most likely i should meet her there and she would be smoking a pipe  in all probability she would know some poetry  with the fresh air my senses gradually came back to me and i began to understand why it was i could not see the cow  the reason was that the house was between us  by some mysterious process i had been discharged into the back garden  i still had the milkingstool in my hand but the cow no longer troubled me  let her see if she could wake veronica by merely bellowing outside the door it was more than i had ever been able to do  i sat down on the stool and opened my notebook  i headed the page sunrise in july  observations and emotions and i wrote down at once lest i should forget it that towards three oclock a faint light is discernible and added that this light gets stronger as the time goes on  it sounded footling even to myself but i had been reading a novel of the realistic school that had been greatly praised for its actuality there is a demand in some quarters for this class of observation  i likewise made a note that the pigeon and the corncrake appear to be among the earliest of natures children to welcome the coming day and added that the screechowl may be heard perhaps at its best by anyone caring to rise for the purpose some quarter of an hour before the dawn  that was all i could think of just then  as regards emotions i did not seem to have any  i lit a pipe and waited for the sun  the sky in front of me was tinged with a faint pink  every moment it flushed a deeper red  i maintain that anyone not an expert would have said that was the portion of the horizon on which to keep ones eye  i kept my eye upon it but no sun appeared  i lit another pipe  the sky in front of me was now a blaze of glory  i scribbled a few lines likening the scattered clouds to brides blushing at the approach of the bridegroom  that would have been all right if later on they hadnt begun to turn green  it seemed the wrong colour for a bride  later on still they went yellow and that spoilt the simile past hope  one cannot wax poetical about a bride who at the approach of the bridegroom turns first green and then yellow  you can only feel sorry for her  i waited some more  the sky in front of me grew paler every moment  i began to fear that something had happened to that sun  if i hadnt known so much astronomy i should have said that he had changed his mind and had gone back again  i rose with the idea of seeing into things  he had been up apparently for hours he had got up at the back of me  it seemed to be nobodys fault  i put my pipe into my pocket and strolled round to the front  the cow was still there she was pleased to see me and started bellowing again  i heard a sound of whistling  it proceeded from a farmers boy  i hailed him and he climbed a gate and came to me across the field he was a cheerful youth  he nodded to the cow and hoped she had had a good night  he pronounced it nihet  you know the cow i said  well he explained we dont precisely move in the sime set  sort o business relytionship more likeif you understand me  something about this boy was worrying me  he did not seem like a real farmers boy  but then nothing seemed quite real this morning my feeling was to let things go  whose cow is it i asked  he stared at me  i want to know to whom it belongs i said  i want to restore it to him  excuse me said the boy but where do you live  he was making me cross  where do i live i retorted  why in this cottage  you dont think ive got up early and come from a distance to listen to this cow  dont talk so much  do you know whose cow it is or dont you  its your cow said the boy  it was my turn to stare  but i havent got a cow i told him  yus you have he persisted youve got that cow  she had stopped bellowing for a moment  she was not the cow i felt i could ever take a pride in  at some time or another quite recently she must have sat down in some mud  how did i get her i demanded  the young lydy explained the boy she came rahnd to our plice on tuesday  i began to see light  an excitable young ladytalks very fast never waits for the answer  with jolly fine eyes added the boy approvingly  and she ordered a cow  didnt seem to ave strength enough to live another dy withaht it  any stipulation made concerning the price of the cow  any what  the young lady with the eyesdid she think to ask the price of the cow  no sordid details was entered into so far as i could ear replied the boy  they would not have beenby robina  any hint let fall as to what the cow was wanted for  the lydy gives us to understand said the boy that fresh milk was er idea  that surprised me  that was thoughtful of robina  and this is the cow  i towed her rahnd last night  i didnt knock at the door and tell yer abaht er cos to be quite frank with yer there wasnt anybody in  what is she bellowing for i asked  well said the boy its only a theory o course but i should sy from the look of er that she wanted to be milked  but it started bellowing at halfpast two i argued  it doesnt expect to be milked at halfpast two does it  meself said the boy ive given up looking for sense in cows  in some unaccountable way this boy was hypnotising me  everything had suddenly become out of place  the cow had suddenly become absurd  she ought to have been a milk can  the wood struck me as neglected  there ought to have been noticeboards about keep off the grass smoking strictly prohibited  there wasnt a seat to be seen  the cottage had surely got itself there by accident  where was the street  the birds were all out of their cages everything was upside down  are you a real farmers boy i asked him  o course i am he answered  what do yer tike me fora hartist in disguise  it came to me  what is your name  eneryenery opkins  where were you born  camden tahn  here was a nice beginning to a rural life  what place could be the country while this boy hopkins was about  he would have given to the garden of eden the atmosphere of an outlying suburb  do you want to earn an occasional shilling i put it to him  id rather it come reggler said hopkins  better for me kerrickter  you drop that cockney accent and learn berkshire and ill give you half a sovereign when you can talk it i promised him  dont for instance say aint i explained to him  say baint  dont say the young lydy she came rahnd to our plice say the missy er coomed down er coomed and er ses to the maister er ses      thats the sort of thing i want to surround myself with here when you informed me that the cow was mine you should have said whoi er be your cow surelie er be  sure its berkshire demanded hopkins  youre confident about it  there is a type that is by nature suspicious  it may not be berkshire pure and undefiled i admitted  it is what in literature we term dialect  it does for most places outside the twelvemile radius  the object is to convey a feeling of rustic simplicity  anyhow it isnt camden town  i started him with a shilling then and there to encourage him  he promised to come round in the evening for one or two books written by friends of mine that i reckoned would be of help to him and i returned to the cottage and set to work to rouse robina  her tone was apologetic  she had got the notion into her head that i had been calling her for quite a long time  i explained that this was not the case  how funny she answered  i said to veronica more than an hour ago  im sure thats pa calling us  i suppose i must have been dreaming  well dont dream any more i suggested  come down and see to this confounded cow of yours  oh said veronica has it come  it has come i told her  as a matter of fact it has been here some time  it ought to have been milked four hours ago according to its own idea  robina said she would be down in a minute  she was down in twentyfive which was sooner than i had expected she brought veronica with her  she said she would have been down sooner if she had not waited for veronica  it appeared that this was just precisely what veronica had been telling her  i was feeling irritable  i had been up half a day and hadnt had my breakfast  dont stand there arguing i told them  for goodness sake lets get to work and milk this cow  we shall have the poor creature dying on our hands if were not careful  robina was wandering round the room  you havent come across a milkingstool anywhere have you pa asked robina  i have come across your milkingstool i estimate some thirteen times i told her  i fetched it from where i had left it and gave it to her and we filed out in procession veronica with a galvanised iron bucket bringing up the rear  the problem that was forcing itself upon my mind was  did robina know how to milk a cow  robina i argued the idea once in her mind would immediately have ordered a cow clamouring for itas hopkins had picturesquely expressed itas though she had not strength to live another day without a cow  her next proceeding would have been to buy a milkingstool  it was a tasteful milkingstool this one she had selected ornamented with the rough drawing of a cow in poker work  a little too solid for my taste but one that i should say would wear well  the pail she had not as yet had time to see about this galvanised bucket we were using was i took it a temporary makeshift  when robina had leisure she would go into the town and purchase something at an art stores  that to complete the scheme she would have done well to have taken a few practical lessons in milking would come to her as an inspiration with the arrival of the cow  i noticed that robinas steps as we approached the cow were less elastic  just outside the cow robina halted  i suppose said robina theres only one way of milking a cow  there may be fancy ways i answered necessary to you if later on you think of entering a competition  this morning seeing we are late i shouldnt worry too much about style  if i were you this morning i should adopt the ordinary unimaginative method and aim only at results  robina sat down and placed her bucket underneath the cow  i suppose said robina it doesnt matter whichwhich one i begin with  it was perfectly plain she hadnt the least notion how to milk a cow i told her so adding comments  now and then a little fatherly talk does good  as a rule i have to work myself up for these occasions this morning i was feeling fairly fit  things had conspired to this end  i put before robina the aims and privileges of the household fairy as they appeared not to her but to me  i also confided to veronica the result of many weeks reflections concerning her and her behaviour  i also told them both what i thought about dick  i do this sort of thing once every six months  it has an excellent effect for about three days  robina wiped away her tears and seized the first one that came to her hand  the cow without saying a word kicked over the empty bucket and walked away disgust expressed in every hair of her body robina crying quietly followed her  by patting her on her neck and letting her wipe her nose upon my coatwhich seemed to comfort heri persuaded her to keep still while robina worked for ten minutes at high pressure  the result was about a glassful and a half the cows capacity to all appearance being by this time some five or six gallons  robina broke down and acknowledged she had been a wicked girl  if the cow died so she said she should never forgive herself veronica at this burst into tears also and the cow whether moved afresh by her own troubles or by theirs commenced again to bellow i was fortunately able to find an elderly labourer smoking a pipe and eating bacon underneath a tree and with him i bargained that for a shilling a day he should milk the cow till further notice  we left him busy and returned to the cottage  dick met us at the door with a cheery good morning  he wanted to know if we had heard the storm  he also wanted to know when breakfast would be ready robina thought that happy event would be shortly after he had boiled the kettle and made the tea and fried the bacon while veronica was laying the table  but i thought  robina said that if he dared to mention the word householdfairy she would box his ears and go straight up to bed and leave everybody to do everything  she said she meant it  dick has one virtue  it is philosophy  come on young un said dick to veronica  trouble is good for us all  some of us said veronica it makes bitter  we sat down to breakfast at eightthirty    chapter iv    our architect arrived on friday afternoon or rather his assistant  i felt from the first i was going to like him  he is shy and that of course makes him appear awkward  but as i explained to robina it is the shy young men who generally speaking turn out best  few men could have been more painfully shy up to twentyfive than myself  robina said that was different  in the case of an author it did not matter  robinas attitude towards the literary profession would not annoy me so much were it not typical  to be a literary man is in robinas opinion to be a licensed idiot  it was only a week or two ago that i overheard from my study window a conversation between veronica and robina upon this very point  veronicas eye had caught something lying on the grass  i could not myself see what it was in consequence of an intervening laurel bush  veronica stooped down and examined it with care  the next instant uttering a piercing whoop she leapt into the air then clapping her hands began to dance her face was radiant with a holy joy  robina passing near stopped and demanded explanation  pas tennis racket shouted veronicaveronica never sees the use of talking in an ordinary tone of voice when shouting will do just as well  she continued clapping her hands and taking little bounds into the air  well what are you going on like that for asked robina  it hasnt bit you has it  its been out all night in the wet shouted veronica  he forgot to bring it in  you wicked child said robina severely  its nothing to be pleased about  yes it is explained veronica  i thought at first it was mine oh wouldnt there have been a talk about it if it had been  oh my wouldnt there have been a row  she settled down to a steady rhythmic dance suggestive of a greek chorus expressing satisfaction with the gods  robina seized her by the shoulders and shook her back into herself if it had been yours said robina you would deserve to have been sent to bed  well then why dont he go to bed argued veronica  robina took her by the arm and walked her up and down just underneath my window  i listened because the conversation interested me  pa as i am always explaining to you said robina is a literary man  he cannot help forgetting things  well i cant help forgetting things insisted veronica  you find it hard explained robina kindly but if you keep on trying you will succeed  you will get more thoughtful  i used to be forgetful and do foolish things once when i was a little girl  good thing for us if we was all literary suggested veronica  if we were all literary robina corrected her  but you see we are not  you and i and dick we are just ordinary mortals  we must try and think and be sensible  in the same way when pa gets excited and ravesi mean seems to raveits the literary temperament  he cant help it  cant you help doing anything when you are literary asked veronica  theres a good deal you cant help answered robina  it isnt fair to judge them by the ordinary standard  they drifted towards the kitchen gardenit was the time of strawberriesand the remainder of the talk i lost  i noticed that for some days afterwards veronica displayed a tendency to shutting herself up in the schoolroom with a copybook and that lead pencils had a way of disappearing from my desk  one in particular that had suited me i determined if possible to recover  a subtle instinct guided me to veronicas sanctum  i found her thoughtfully sucking it  she explained to me that she was writing a little play  you get things from your father dont you she enquired of me  you do i admitted but you ought not to take them without asking i am always telling you of it  that pencil is the only one i can write with  i didnt mean the pencil explained veronica  i was wondering if i had got your literary temper  it is puzzling when you come to think of it this estimate accorded by the general public to the litterateur  it stands to reason that the man who writes books explaining everything and putting everybody right must be himself an exceptionally clever man else how could he do it  the thing is pure logic  yet to listen to robina and her like you might think we had not sense enough to run ourselves as the saying islet alone running the universe  if i would let her robina would sit and give me information by the hour  the ordinary girl     robina will begin with the air of a university extension lecturer  it is so exasperating  as if i did not know all there is to be known about girls  why it is my business  i point this out to robina  yes i know robina will answer sweetly  but i was meaning the real girl  it would make not the slightest difference were i even quite a high class literary manrobina thinks i am  she is a dear child  were i shakespeare himself and could i in consequence say to her methinks child the creator of ophelia and juliet and rosamund and beatrice must surely know something about girls robina would still make answer  of course pa dear  everybody knows how clever you are  but i was thinking for the moment of real girls  i wonder to myself sometimes is literature to the general reader ever anything more than a fairytale  we write with our hearts blood as we put it  we ask our conscience is it right thus to lay bare the secrets of our souls  the general reader does not grasp that we are writing with our hearts blood  to him it is just ink he does not believe we are laying bare the secrets of our souls  he takes it we are just pretending  once upon a time there lived a girl named angelina who loved a party by the name of edwin  he imagineshe the general readerwhen we tell him all the wonderful thoughts that were inside angelina that it was we who put them there  he does not know he will not try to understand that angelina is in reality more real than is miss jones who rides up every morning in the bus with him and has a pretty knack of rendering conversation about the weather novel and suggestive  as a boy i won some popularity among my schoolmates as a teller of stories  one afternoon to a small collection with whom i was homing across regents park i told the story of a beautiful princess  but she was not the ordinary princess  she would not behave as a princess should  i could not help it  the others heard only my voice but i was listening to the wind  she thought she loved the princeuntil he had wounded the dragon unto death and had carried her away into the wood  then while the prince lay sleeping she heard the dragon calling to her in its pain and crept back to where it lay bleeding and put her arms about its scaly neck and kissed it and that healed it  i was hoping myself that at this point it would turn into a prince itself but it didnt it just remained a dragon so the wind said  yet the princess loved it  it wasnt half a bad dragon when you knew it  i could not tell them what became of the prince  the wind didnt seem to care a hang about the prince  myself i liked the story but hocker who was a fifth form boy voicing our little public said it was rot so far and that i had got to hurry up and finish things rightly  but that is all i told them  no it isnt said hocker  shes got to marry the prince in the end  hell have to kill the dragon again and mind he does it properly this time  whoever heard of a princess leaving a prince for a dragon  but she wasnt the ordinary sort of princess i argued  then shes got to be criticised hocker  dont you give yourself so many airs  you make her marry the prince and be slippy about it ive got to catch the fourfifteen from chalk farm station  but she didnt i persisted obstinately  she married the dragon and lived happy ever afterwards  hocker adopted sterner measures  he seized my arm and twisted it behind me  she married who demanded hocker  grammar was not hockers strong point  the dragon i growled  she married who repeated hocker  the dragon i whined  she married who for the third time urged hocker  hocker was strong and the tears were forcing themselves into my eyes in spite of me  so the princess in return for healing the dragon made it promise to reform  it went back with her to the prince and made itself generally useful to both of them for the rest of the tour  and the prince took the princess home with him and married her and the dragon died and was buried  the others liked the story better but i hated it and the wind sighed and died away  the little crowd becomes the reading public and hocker grows into an editor he twists my arm in other ways  some are brave so the crowd kicks them and scurries off to catch the fourfifteen  but most of us i fear are slaves to hocker  then after awhile the wind grows sulky and will not tell us stories any more and we have to make them up out of our own heads  perhaps it is just as well  what were doors and windows made for but to keep out the wind  he is a dangerous fellow this wandering wind he leads me astray  i was talking about our architect  he made a bad start so far as robina was concerned by coming in at the backdoor  robina in a big apron was washing up  he apologised for having blundered into the kitchen and offered to go out again and work round to the front  robina replied with unnecessary severity as i thought that an architect if anyone might have known the difference between the right side of a house and the wrong but presumed that youth and inexperience could always be pleaded as excuse for stupidity  i cannot myself see why robina should have been so much annoyed  labour as robina had been explaining to veronica only a few hours before exalts a woman  in olden days ladiesthe highest in the landwere proud not ashamed of their ability to perform domestic duties  this later on i pointed out to robina  her answer was that in olden days you didnt have chits of boys going about calling themselves architects and opening backdoors without knocking or if they did knock knocking so that nobody on earth could hear them  robina wiped her hands on the towel behind the door and brought him into the frontroom where she announced him coldly as the young man from the architects office  he explainedbut quite modestly that he was not exactly messrs spreights young man but an architect himself a junior member of the firm  to make it clear he produced his card which was that of mr archibald t bute friba  practically speaking all this was unnecessary  through the open door i had of course heard every word and old spreight had told me of his intention to send me one of his most promising assistants who would be able to devote himself entirely to my work i put matters right by introducing him formally to robina  they bowed to one another rather stiffly  robina said that if he would excuse her she would return to her work and he answered charmed and also that he didnt mean it  as i have tried to get it into robinas head the young fellow was confused  he had meantit was selfevidentthat he was charmed at being introduced to her not at her desire to return to the kitchen  but robina appears to have taken a dislike to him  i gave him a cigar and we started for the house  it lies just a mile from this cottage the other side of the wood  one excellent trait in him i soon discoveredhe is intelligent without knowing everything  i confess it to my shame but the young man who knows everything has come to pall upon me  according to emerson this is a proof of my own intellectual feebleness  the strong man intellectually cultivates the society of his superiors  he wants to get on he wants to learn things  if i loved knowledge as one should i would have no one but young men about me  there was a friend of dicks a gentleman from rugby  at one time he had hopes of me i felt he had but he was too impatient  he tried to bring me on too quickly  you must take into consideration natural capacity  after listening to him for an hour or two my mind would wander  i could not help it the careless laughter of uninformed middleaged gentlemen and ladies would creep to me from the croquet lawn or from the billiardroom  i longed to be among them  sometimes i would battle with my lower nature  what did they know  what could they tell me  more often i would succumb  there were occasions when i used to get up and go away from him quite suddenly  i talked with young bute during our walk about domestic architecture in general  he said he should describe the present tendency in domestic architecture as towards corners  the desire of the british public was to go into a corner and live  a lady for whose husband his firm had lately built a house in surrey had propounded to him a problem in connection with this point  she agreed it was a charming house no house in surrey had more corners and that was saying much but she could not see how for the future she was going to bring up her children  she was a humanely minded lady  hitherto she had punished them when needful by putting them in the corner the shame of it had always exercised upon them a salutary effect  but in the new house corners are reckoned the prime parts of every room  it is the honoured guest who is sent into the corner  the father has a corner sacred to himself with high up above his head a complicated cupboard wherein with the help of a stepladder he may keep his pipes and his tobacco and thus by slow degrees cure himself of the habit of smoking  the mother likewise has her corner where stands her spinningwheel in case the idea comes to her to weave sheets and underclothing  it also has a bookshelf supporting thirteen volumes arranged in a sloping position to look natural the last one maintained at its angle of fortyfive degrees by a gingerjar in old blue nankin  you are not supposed to touch them because that would disarrange them  besides which fooling about you might upset the gingerjar  the consequence of all this is the corner is no longer disgraceful  the parent can no more say to the erring child  you wicked boy  go into the cosy corner this very minute  in the house of the future the place of punishment will have to be the middle of the room  the angry mother will exclaim  dont you answer me you saucy minx  you go straight into the middle of the room and dont you dare to come out of it till i tell you  the difficulty with the artistic house is finding the right people to put into it  in the picture the artistic room never has anybody in it  there is a strip of art embroidery upon the table together with a bowl of roses  upon the ancient highbacked settee lies an item of fancy work unfinishedjust as she left it  in the study an open book face downwards has been left on a chair  it is the last book he was readingit has never been disturbed  a pipe of quaint design is cold upon the lintel of the lattice window  no one will ever smoke that pipe again  it must have been difficult to smoke at any time  the sight of the artistic room as depicted in the furniture catalogue always brings tears to my eyes  people once inhabited these rooms read there those old volumes bound in vellum smokedor tried to smokethese impracticable pipes white hands that someone maybe had loved to kiss once fluttered among the folds of these unfinished antimacassars or berlin woolwork slippers and went away leaving the things about  one takes it that the people who once occupied these artistic rooms are now all dead  this was their diningroom  they sat on those artistic chairs  they could hardly have used the dinner service set out upon the elizabethan dresser because that would have left the dresser bare  one assumes they had an extra service for use or else that they took their meals in the kitchen  the entrance hall is a singularly chaste apartment  there is no necessity for a doormat people with muddy boots it is to be presumed were sent round to the back  a ridingcloak the relic apparently of a highwayman hangs behind the door  it is the sort of cloak you would expect to find therea decorative cloak  an umbrella or a waterproof cape would be fatal to the whole effect  now and again the illustrator of the artistic room will permit a young girl to come and sit there  but she has to be a very carefully selected girl  to begin with she has got to look and dress as though she had been born at least three hundred years ago  she has got to have that sort of clothes and she has got to have her hair done just that way  she has got to look sad a cheerful girl in the artistic room would jar ones artistic sense  one imagines the artist consulting with the proud possessor of the house  you havent got such a thing as a miserable daughter have you some fairly goodlooking girl who has been crossed in love or is misunderstood  because if so you might dress her up in something out of the local museum and send her along  a little thing like that gives verisimilitude to a design  she must not touch anything  all she may do is to read a booknot really read it that would suggest too much life and movement  she sits with the book in her lap and gazes into the fire if it happens to be the diningroom  or out of the window if it happens to be a morningroom and the architect wishes to call attention to the windowseat  nothing of the male species as far as i have been able to ascertain has ever entered these rooms  i once thought i had found a man who had been allowed into his own smokingden but on closer examination it turned out he was only a portrait  sometimes one is given vistas  doors stand open and you can see right away through the nook into the garden  there is never a living soul about the place  the whole family has been sent out for a walk or locked up in the cellars  this strikes you as odd until you come to think the matter out  the modern man and woman is not artistic  i am not artisticnot what i call really artistic  i dont go well with gobelin tapestry and warmingpans  i feel i dont  robina is not artistic not in that sense  i tried her once with a harpsichord i picked up cheap in wardour street and a reproduction of a roman stool  the thing was an utter failure  a cottage piano with a photoframe and a fern upon it is what the soul cries out for in connection with robina  dick is not artistic dick does not go with peacocks feathers and guitars  i can see dick with a single peacocks feather at st giless fair when the bulldogs are not looking but the decorative panel of peacocks feathers is too much for him  i can imagine him with a banjobut a guitar decorated with pink ribbons  to begin with he is not dressed for it  unless a family be prepared to make themselves up as troubadours or cavaliers and to talk blank verse i dont see how they can expect to be happy living in these fifteenthcentury houses the modern familythe old man in baggy trousers and a frockcoat he could not button if he tried to the mother of figure distinctly victorian the boys in flannel suits and collars up to their ears the girls in motor capsare as incongruous in these mediaeval dwellings as a party of cooks tourists drinking bottled beer in the streets of pompeii  the designer of the artistic home is right in keeping to still life  in the artistic hometo paraphrase dr wattsevery prospect pleases and only man is inartistic  in the picture the artistic bedroom in apple green the bedstead of cherrywood with a touch of turkeyred throughout the draperies is charming  it need hardly be said the bed is empty  put a man or woman in that cherrywood bedi dont care how artistic they may think themselvesthe charm would be gone  the really artistic party one supposes has a little room behind where he sleeps and dresses himself  he peeps in at the door of this artistic bedroom maybe occasionally enters to change the roses  imagine the artistic nursery five minutes after the real child had been let loose in it  i know a lady who once spent hundreds of pounds on an artistic nursery  she showed it to her friends with pride  the children were allowed in there on sunday afternoons  i did an equally silly thing myself not long ago  lured by a furniture catalogue i started robina in a boudoir  i gave it to her as a birthdaypresent  we have both regretted it ever since  robina reckons she could have had a bicycle a diamond bracelet and a mandoline and i should have saved money  i did the thing well  i told the furniture people i wanted it just as it stood in the picture  design for bedroom and boudoir combined suitable for young girl in teak with sparrow blue hangings  we had everything the antique fire arrangements that a vestal virgin might possibly have understood the candlesticks that were pictures in themselves until we tried to put candles in them the bookcase and writingdesk combined that wasnt big enough to write on and out of which it was impossible to get a book until you had abandoned the idea of writing and had closed the cover the enclosed washstand that shut down and looked like an old bureau with the inevitable bowl of flowers upon it that had to be taken off and put on the floor whenever you wanted to use the thing as a washstand the toilettable with its cunning little glass just big enough to see your nose in the bedstead hidden away behind the thinking corner where the girl couldnt get at it to make it  a prettier room you could not have imagined till robina started sleeping in it  i think she tried  girl friends of hers to whom she had bragged about it would drop in and ask to be allowed to see it  robina would say wait a minute and would run up and slam the door and we would hear her for the next halfhour or so rushing round opening and shutting drawers and dragging things about  by the time it was a boudoir again she was exhausted and irritable  she wants now to give it up to veronica but veronica objects to the position which is between the bathroom and my study her idea is a room more removed where she would be able to shut herself in and do her work as she explains without fear of interruption  young bute told me that a friend of his a welltodo young fellow who lived in piccadilly had had the whim to make his flat the reproduction of a roman villa  there were of course no fires the rooms were warmed by hot air from the kitchen  they had a cheerless aspect on a november afternoon and nobody knew exactly where to sit light was obtained in the evening from grecian lamps which made it easy to understand why the ancient athenians as a rule went to bed early  you dined sprawling on a couch  this was no doubt practicable when you took your plate into your hand and fed yourself with your fingers but with a knife and fork the meal had all the advantages of a hot picnic  you did not feel luxurious or even wicked  you only felt nervous about your clothes  the thing lacked completeness  he could not expect his friends to come to him in roman togas and even his own man declined firmly to wear the costume of a roman slave  the compromise was unsatisfactory even from the purely pictorial point of view  you cannot be a roman patrician of the time of antoninus when you happen to live in piccadilly at the opening of the twentieth century  all you can do is to make your friends uncomfortable and spoil their dinner for them  young bute said that so far as he was concerned he would always rather have spent the evening with his little nephews and nieces playing at horses it seemed to him a more sensible game  young bute said that speaking as an architect he of course admired the ancient masterpieces of his art  he admired the erechtheum at athens but spurgeons tabernacle in the old kent road built upon the same model would have irritated him  for a grecian temple you wanted grecian skies and grecian girls  he said that even as it was westminster abbey in the season was an eyesore to him  the dean and choir in their white surplices passed muster but the congregation in its black frockcoats and paris hats gave him the same sense of incongruity as would a banquet of barefooted friars in the dining hall of the cannon street hotel  it struck me there was sense in what he said  i decided not to mention my idea of carving 1553 above the frontdoor  he said he could not understand this passion of the modern house builder for playing at being a crusader or a canterbury pilgrim  a retired berlin bootmaker of his acquaintance had built himself a miniature roman castle near heidelberg  they played billiards in the dungeon and let off fireworks on the kaisers birthday from the roof of the watchtower  another acquaintance of his a draper at holloway had built himself a moated grange  the moat was supplied from the waterworks under special arrangement and all the electric lights were imitation candles  he had done the thing thoroughly  he had even designed a haunted chamber in blue and a miniature chapel which he used as a telephone closet  young bute had been invited down there for the shooting in the autumn  he said he could not be sure whether he was doing right or wrong but his intention was to provide himself with a bow and arrows  a change was coming over this young man  we had talked on other subjects and he had been shy and deferential  on this matter of bricks and mortar he spoke as one explaining things  i ventured to say a few words in favour of the tudor house  the tudor house he argued was a fit and proper residence for the tudor citizenfor the man whose wife rode behind him on a packsaddle who conducted his correspondence by the help of a mosstrooper  the tudor fireplace was designed for folks to whom coal was unknown and who left their smoking to their chimneys  a house that looked ridiculous with a motorcar before the door where the electric bell jarred upon ones sense of fitness every time one heard it was out of date he maintained  for you sir he continued a twentiethcentury writer to build yourself a tudor house would be as absurd as for ben jonson to have planned himself a norman castle with a torturechamber underneath the winecellar and the fireplace in the middle of the dininghall  his fellow cronies of the mermaid would have thought him stark staring mad  there was reason in what he was saying  i decided not to mention my idea of altering the chimneys and fixing up imitation gables especially as young bute seemed pleased with the house which by this time we had reached  now that is a good house said young bute  that is a house where a man in a frockcoat and trousers can sit down and not feel himself a stranger from another age  it was built for a man who wore a frockcoat and trouserson weekdays maybe gaiters and a shooting coat  you can enjoy a game of billiards in that house without the feeling that comes to you when playing tennis in the shadow of the pyramids  we entered and i put before him my notionssuch of them as i felt he would approve  we were some time about the business and when we looked at our watches young butes last train to town had gone there still remained much to talk about and i suggested he should return with me to the cottage and take his luck  i could sleep with dick and he could have my room  i told him about the cow but he said he was a practised sleeper and would be delighted if i could lend him a nightshirt and if i thought miss robina would not be put out  i assured him that it would be a good thing for robina the unexpected guest would be a useful lesson to her in housekeeping besides as i pointed out to him it didnt really matter even if robina were put out  not to you sir perhaps he answered with a smile  it is not with you that she will be indignant  that will be all right my boy i told him i take all responsibility  and i shall get all the blame he laughed  but as i pointed out to him it really didnt matter whom robina blamed  we talked about women generally on our way back  i told himimpressing upon him there was no need for it to go fartherthat i personally had come to the conclusion that the best way to deal with women was to treat them all as children  he agreed it might be a good method but wanted to know what you did when they treated you as a child  i know a most delightful couple  they have been married nearly twenty years and both will assure you that an angry word has never passed between them  he calls her his little one although she must be quite six inches taller than himself and is never tired of patting her hand or pinching her ear  they asked her once in the drawingroomso the little mother tells meher recipe for domestic bliss  she said the mistake most women made was taking men too seriously  they are just overgrown children thats all they are poor dears she laughed  there are two kinds of love  there is the love that kneels and looks upward and the love that looks down and pats  for durability i am prepared to back the latter  the architect had died out of young bute he was again a shy young man during our walk back to the cottage  my hand was on the latch when he stayed me  isnt this the backdoor again sir he enquired  it was the backdoor i had not noticed it  hadnt we better go round to the front sir dont you think he said  it doesnt matter i began  but he had disappeared  so i followed him and we entered by the front  robina was standing by the table peeling potatoes  i have brought mr bute back with me i explained  he is going to stop the night  robina said  if ever i go to live in a cottage again it will have one door  she took her potatoes with her and went upstairs  i do hope she isnt put out said young bute  dont worry yourself i comforted him  of course she isnt put out  besides i dont care if she is  shes got to get used to being put out its part of the lesson of life  i took him upstairs meaning to show him his bedroom and take my own things out of it  the doors of the two bedrooms were opposite one another  i made a mistake and opened the wrong door  robina still peeling potatoes was sitting on the bed  i explained we had made a mistake  robina said it was of no consequence whatever and taking the potatoes with her went downstairs again  looking out of the window i saw her making towards the wood  she was taking the potatoes with her  i do wish we hadnt opened the door of the wrong room groaned young bute  what a worrying chap you are i said to him  look at the thing from the humorous point of view  its funny when you come to think of it  wherever the poor girl goes trying to peel her potatoes in peace and quietness we burst in upon her  what we ought to do now is to take a walk in the wood  it is a pretty wood  we might say we had come to pick wild flowers  but i could not persuade him  he said he had letters to write and if i would allow him would remain in his room till dinner was ready  dick and veronica came in a little later  dick had been to see mr st leonard to arrange about lessons in farming  he said he thought i should like the old man who wasnt a bit like a farmer  he had brought veronica back in one of her good moods she having met there and fallen in love with a donkey  dick confided to me that without committing himself he had hinted to veronica that if she would remain good for quite a long while i might be induced to buy it for her  it was a sturdy little animal and could be made useful anyhow it would give veronica an object in lifesomething to strive forwhich was just what she wanted  he is a thoughtful lad at times is dick  the dinner was more successful than i had hoped for  robina gave us melon as a hors doeuvre followed by sardines and a fowl with potatoes and vegetable marrow  her cooking surprised me  i had warned young bute that it might be necessary to regard this dinner rather as a joke than as an evening meal and was prepared myself to extract amusement from it rather than nourishment  my disappointment was agreeable  one can always imagine a comic dinner  i dined once with a newly married couple who had just returned from their honeymoon  we ought to have sat down at eight oclock we sat down instead at halfpast ten  the cook had started drinking in the morning by seven oclock she was speechless  the wife giving up hope at a quarter to eight had cooked the dinner herself  the other guests were sympathised with but all i got was congratulation  hell write something so funny about this dinner they said  you might have thought the cook had got drunk on purpose to oblige me  i have never been able to write anything funny about that dinner it depresses me to this day merely thinking of it  we finished up with a cold trifle and some excellent coffee that robina brewed over a lamp on the table while dick and veronica cleared away  it was one of the jolliest little dinners i have ever eaten and if robinas figures are to be trusted cost exactly six andfourpence for the five of us  there being no servants about we talked freely and enjoyed ourselves  i began once at a dinner to tell a good story about a scotchman when my host silenced me with a look  he is a kindly man and had heard the story before  he explained to me afterwards over the walnuts that his parlourmaid was scotch and rather touchy  the talk fell into the discussion of home rule and again our host silenced us  it seemed his butler was an irishman and a violent parnellite  some people can talk as though servants were mere machines but to me they are human beings and their presence hampers me  i know my guests have not heard the story before and from ones own flesh and blood one expects a certain amount of sacrifice  but i feel so sorry for the housemaid who is waiting she must have heard it a dozen times  i really cannot inflict it upon her again  after dinner we pushed the table into a corner and dick extracted a sort of waltz from robinas mandoline  it is years since i danced but veronica said she would rather dance with me any day than with some of the lumps you were given to drag round by the dancing mistress  i have half a mind to take it up again  after all a man is only as old as he feels  young bute it turned out was a capital dancer and could even reverse which in a room fourteen feet square is of advantage robina confided to me after he was gone that while he was dancing she could just tolerate him  i cannot myself see rhyme or reason in robinas objection to him  he is not handsome but he is good looking as boys go and has a pleasant smile  robina says it is his smile that maddens her  dick agrees with me that there is sense in him and veronica not given to loose praise considers his performance of a red indian both dead and alive the finest piece of acting she has ever encountered  we wound up the evening with a little singing  the extent of dicks repertoire surprised me evidently he has not been so idle at cambridge as it seemed  young bute has a baritone voice of some richness  we remembered at quarterpast eleven that veronica ought to have gone to bed at eight we were all of us surprised at the lateness of the hour  why cant we always live in a cottage and do just as we like  im sure its much jollier veronica put it to me as i kissed her good night  because we are idiots most of us veronica i answered    chapter v    i started the next morning to call upon st leonard  near to the house i encountered young hopkins on a horse  he was waving a pitchfork over his head and reciting the charge of the light brigade  the horse looked amused  he told me i should find the govnor up by the stables  st leonard is not an old man  dick must have seen him in a bad light  i should describe him as about the prime of life a little older than myself but nothing to speak of  dick was right however in saying he was not like a farmer  to begin with hubert st leonard does not sound like a farmer  one can imagine a man with a name like that writing a book about farming having theories on this subject  but in the ordinary course of nature things would not grow for him  he does not look like a farmer  one cannot say precisely what it is but there is that about a farmer that tells you he is a farmer  the farmer has a way of leaning over a gate  there are not many ways of leaning over a gate i have tried all i could think of but it was never quite the right way  it has to be in the blood  a farmer has a way of standing on one leg and looking at a thing that isnt there  it sounds simple but there is knack in it  the farmer is not surprised it is not there  he never expected it to be there  it is one of those things that ought to be and is not  the farmers life is full of such suffering reduced to a science is what the farmer stands for  all his life he is the good man struggling against adversity  nothing his way comes right  this does not seem to be his planet providence means well but she does not understand farming  she is doing her best he supposes that she is a born muddler is not her fault  if providence could only step down for a month or two and take a few lessons in practical farming things might be better but this being out of the question there is nothing more to be said from conversation with farmers one conjures up a picture of providence as a wellintentioned amateur put into a position for which she is utterly unsuited  rain says providence they are wanting rain  what did i do with that rain  she finds the rain and starts it and is pleased with herself until some wandering spirit pauses on his way and asks her sarcastically what she thinks shes doing  raining explains providence  they wanted rainfarmers you know that sort of people  they wont want anything for long retorts the spirit  theyll be drowned in their beds before youve done with them  dont say that says providence  well have a look for yourself if you wont believe me says the spirit  youve spoilt that harvest again youve ruined all the fruit and you are rotting even the turnips  dont you ever learn by experience  it is so difficult says providence to regulate these things just right  so it seemsfor you retorts the spirit  anyhow i should not rain any more if i were you  if you must at least give them time to build another ark  and the wandering spirit continues on his way  the place does look a bit wet now i come to notice it says providence peeping down over the edge of her star  better turn on the fine weather i suppose  she starts with she calls set fair and feeling now that she is something like a providence composes herself for a doze  she is startled out of her sleep by the return of the wandering spirit  been down there again she asks him pleasantly  just come back explains the wandering spirit  pretty spot isnt it says providence  things nice and dry down there now arent they  youve hit it he answers  dry is the word  the rivers are dried up the wells are dried up the cattle are dying the grass is all withered  as for the harvest there wont be any harvest for the next two years  oh yes things are dry enough  one imagines providence bursting into tears  but you suggested yourself a little fine weather  i know i did answers the spirit  i didnt suggest a six months drought with the thermometer at a hundred and twenty in the shade doesnt seem to me that youve got any sense at all  i do wish this job had been given to someone else says providence  yes and you are not the only one to wish it retorts the spirit unfeelingly  i do my best urges providence wiping her eyes with her wings  i am not fitted for it  a truer word you never uttered retorts the spirit  i trynobody could try harder wails providence  everything i do seems to be wrong  what you want says the spirit is less enthusiasm and a little commonsense in place of it  you get excited and then you lose your head  when you do send rain ten to one you send it when it isnt wanted  you keep back your sunshinejust as a duffer at whist keeps back his trumpsuntil it is no good and then you deal it out all at once  ill try again said providence  ill try quite hard this time  youve been trying again retorts the spirit unsympathetically ever since i have known you  it is not that you do not try  it is that you have not got the hang of things  why dont you get yourself an almanack  the wandering spirit takes his leave  providence tells herself she really must get that almanack  she ties a knot in her handkerchief it is not her fault  she was made like it  she forgets altogether for what reason she tied that knot  thinks it was to remind her to send frosts in may or scotch mists in august  she is not sure which so sends both  the farmer has ceased even to be angry with herrecognises that affliction and sorrow are good for his immortal soul and pursues his way in calmness to the bankruptcy court  hubert st leonard of windrush bottom farm i found to be a worried looking gentleman  he taps his weatherglass and hopes and fears not knowing as yet that all things have been ordered for his ill  it will be years before his spirit is attuned to that attitude of tranquil despair essential to the farmer  one feels it  he is tall and thin with a sensitive mobile face and a curious trick of taking his head every now and again between his hands as if to be sure it is still there  when i met him he was on the point of starting for his round so i walked with him  he told me that he had not always been a farmer  till a few years ago he had been a stockbroker  but he had always hated his office and having saved a little had determined when he came to forty to enjoy the rare luxury of living his own life  i asked him if he found that farming paid he said  as in everything else it depends upon the price you put upon yourself  now as a casual observer what wage per annum would you say i was worth  it was an awkward question  you are afraid that if you spoke candidly you would offend me he suggested  very well  for the purpose of explaining my theory let us take instead your own case  i have read all your books and i like them  speaking as an admirer i should estimate you at five hundred a year  you perhaps make two thousand and consider yourself worth five  the whimsical smile with which he accompanied the speech disarmed me  what we most of us do he continued is to overcapitalise ourselves  john smith honestly worth a hundred a year claims to be worth two  result  difficulty of earning dividend overwork over worry constant fear of being wound up  now there is that about your work that suggests to me you would be happier earning five hundred a year than you ever will be earning two thousand  to pay your dividendto earn your two thousandyou have to do work that brings you no pleasure in the doing  content with five hundred you could afford to do only that work that does give you pleasure  this is not a perfect world we must remember  in the perfect world the thinker would be worth more than the mere jester  in the perfect world the farmer would be worth more than the stockbroker  in making the exchange i had to write myself down  i earn less money but get more enjoyment out of life  i used to be able to afford champagne but my liver was always wrong and i dared not drink it  now i cannot afford champagne but i enjoy my beer  that is my theory that we are all of us entitled to payment according to our market value neither more nor less  you can take it all in cash  i used to  or you can take less cash and more fun  that is what i am getting now  it is delightful i said to meet with a philosopher  one hears about them of course but i had got it into my mind they were all dead  people laugh at philosophy he said  i never could understand why  it is the science of living a free peaceful happy existence i would give half my remaining years to be a philosopher  i am not laughing at philosophy i said  i honestly thought you were a philosopher  i judged so from the way you talked  talked he retorted  anybody can talk  as you have just said i talk like a philosopher  but you not only talk i insisted you behave like a philosopher sacrificing your income to the joy of living your own life  it is the act of a philosopher  i wanted to keep him in good humour  i had three things to talk to him about  the cow the donkey and dick  no it wasnt he answered  a philosopher would have remained a stockbroker and been just as happy  philosophy does not depend upon environment  you put the philosopher down anywhere  it is all the same to him he takes his philosophy with him  you can suddenly tell him he is an emperor or give him penal servitude for life  he goes on being a philosopher just as if nothing had happened  we have an old tomcat  the children lead it an awful life  it does not seem to matter to the cat  they shut it up in the piano  their idea is that it will make a noise and frighten someone  it doesnt make a noise it goes to sleep  when an hour later someone opens the piano the poor thing is lying there stretched out upon the keyboard purring to itself  they dress it up in the babys clothes and take it out in the perambulator  it lies there perfectly contented looking round at the scenerytakes in the fresh air  they haul it about by its tail you would think to watch it swinging gently to and fro head downwards that it was grateful to them for giving it a new sensation  apparently it looks on everything that comes its way as helpful experience  it lost a leg last winter in a trap  it goes about quite cheerfully on three  seems to be rather pleased if anything at having lost the fourthsaves washing  now he is your true philosopher that cat never minds what happens to him and is equally contented if it doesnt  i found myself becoming fretful  i know a man with whom it is impossible to disagree  men at the clubnewcomershave been lured into taking bets that they could on any topic under the sun find themselves out of sympathy with him  they have denounced mr lloyd george as a traitor to his country  this man has risen and shaken them by the hand words being too weak to express his admiration of their outspoken fearlessness  you might have thought them nihilists denouncing the russian government from the steps of the kremlin at moscow  they have in the next breath abused mr balfour in terms transgressing the law of slander  he has almost fallen on their necks  it has transpired that the one dream of his life was to hear mr balfour abused  i have talked to him myself for a quarter of an hour and gathered that at heart he was a peaceatanyprice man strongly in favour of conscription a vehement republican with a deeprooted contempt for the working classes  it is not bad sport to collect half a dozen and talk round him  at such times he suggests the family dog that six people from different parts of the house are calling to at the same time  he wants to go to them all at once  i felt i had got to understand this man or he would worry me  we are going to be neighbours i said and i am inclined to think i shall like you  that is if i can get to know you  you commence by enthusing on philosophy  i hasten to agree with you  it is a noble science  when my youngest daughter has grown up when the other one has learnt a little sense when dick is off my hands and the british public has come to appreciate good literature i am hoping to be a bit of a philosopher myself  but before i can explain to you my views you have already changed your own and are likening the philosopher to an old tomcat that seems to be weak in his head soberly now what are you  a fool he answered promptly a most unfortunate fool  i have the mind of a philosopher coupled to an intensely irritable temperament my philosophy teaches me to be ashamed of my irritability and my irritability makes my philosophy appear to be arrant nonsense to myself  the philosopher in me tells me it does not matter when the twins fall down the wishingwell  it is not a deep well  it is not the first time they have fallen into it  it will not be the last such things pass  the philosopher only smiles  the man in me calls the philosopher a blithering idiot for saying it does not matter when it does matter  men have to be called away from their work to haul them out  we all of us get wet  i get wet and excited and that always starts my liver  the childrens clothes are utterly spoilt confound themthe blood was mounting to his headthey never care to go near the well except they are dressed in their best clothes on other days they will stop indoors and read foxes book of martyrs  there is something uncanny about twins  what is it  why should twins be worse than other children  the ordinary child is not an angel heaven knows  take these boots of mine  look at them i have had them for over two years  i tramp ten miles a day in them they have been soaked through a hundred times  you buy a boy a pair of boots  why dont you cover over the well i suggested  there you are again he replied  the philosopher in methe sensible mansays what is the good of the well  it is nothing but mud and rubbish  something is always falling into itif it isnt the children its the pigs  why not do away with it  seems to be sound advice i commented  it is he agreed  no man alive has more sound commonsense than i have if only i were capable of listening to myself  do you know why i dont brick in that well  because my wife told me i would have to it was the first thing she said when she saw it  she says it again every time anything does fall into it  if only you would take my adviceyou know the sort of thing  nobody irritates me more than the person who says i told you so  its a picturesque old ruin it used to be haunted  thats all been knocked on the head since we came  what selfrespecting nymph can haunt a well into which children and pigs are for ever flopping  he laughed but before i could join him he was angry again  why should i block up an historic well that is an ornament to the garden because a pack of fools cant keep a gate shut  as for the children what they want is a thorough good whipping and one of these days  a voice crying to us to stop interrupted him  am on my round  cant come he shouted  but you must explained the voice  he turned so quickly that he almost knocked me over  bother and confound them all he said  why dont they keep to the timetable theres no system in this place  that is what ruins farmingwant of system  he went on grumbling as he walked  i followed him  halfway across the field we met the owner of the voice  she was a pleasantlooking lass not exactly prettynot the sort of girl one turns to look at in a crowdyet having seen her it was agreeable to continue looking at her  st leonard introduced me to her as his eldest daughter janie and explained to her that behind the study door if only she would take the trouble to look she would find a timetable   according to which replied miss janie with a smile you ought at the present moment to be in the rickyard which is just where i want you  what time is it he asked feeling his waistcoat for a watch that appeared not to be there  quarter to eleven i told him  he took his head between his hands  good god he cried you dont say that  the new binder miss janie told us had just arrived  she was anxious her father should see it was in working order before the men went back  otherwise so she argued old wilkins will persist it was all right when he delivered it and we shall have no remedy  we turned towards the house  speaking of the practical i said there were three things i came to talk to you about  first and foremost that cow  ah yes the cow said st leonard  he turned to his daughter it was maud was it not  no she answered it was susie  it is the one i said that bellows most all night and three parts of the day  your boy hopkins thinks maybe shes fretting  poor soul said st leonard  we only took her calf away from her when did we take her calf away from her he asked of janie  on thursday morning returned janie the day we sent her over  they feel it so at first said st leonard sympathetically  it sounds a brutal sentiment i said but i was wondering if by any chance you happened to have by you one that didnt feel it quite so much  i suppose among cows there is no class that corresponds to what we term our smart setcows that dont really care for their calves that are glad to get away from them  miss janie smiled  when she smiled you felt you would do much to see her smile again  but why not keep it up at your house in the paddock she suggested and have the milk brought down  there is an excellent cowshed and it is only a mile away  it struck me there was sense in this idea  i had not thought of that  i asked st leonard what i owed him for the cow  he asked miss janie and she said sixteen pounds  i had been warned that in doing business with farmers it would be necessary always to bargain but there was that about miss janies tone telling me that when she said sixteen pounds she meant sixteen pounds  i began to see a brighter side to hubert st leonards career as a farmer  very well i said we will regard the cow as settled  i made a note  cow sixteen pounds  have the cowshed got ready and buy one of those big cans on wheels  you dont happen to want milk i put it to miss janie  susie seems to be good for about five gallons a day  im afraid if we drink it all ourselves well get too fat  at twopence halfpenny a quart delivered at the house as much as you like replied miss janie  i made a note of that also  happen to know a useful boy i asked miss janie  what about young hopkins suggested her father  the only male thing on this farmwith the exception of yourself of course father dearthat has got any sense said miss janie  he cant have hopkins  the only fault i have to find with hopkins said st leonard is that he talks too much  personally i said i should prefer a country lad  i have come down here to be in the country  with hopkins around i dont somehow feel it is the country  i might imagine it a garden city  that is as near as hopkins would allow me to get  i should like myself something more suggestive of rural simplicity  i think i know the sort of thing you mean smiled miss janie  are you fairly goodtempered  i can generally i answered confine myself to sarcasm  it pleases me and as far as i have been able to notice does neither harm nor good to anyone else  ill send you up a boy promised miss janie  i thanked her  and now we come to the donkey  nathaniel explained miss janie in answer to her fathers look of enquiry  we dont really want it  janie said mr st leonard in a tone of authority i insist upon being honest  i was going to be honest retorted miss janie offended  my daughter veronica has given me to understand i said that if i buy her this donkey it will be for her the commencement of a new and better life  i do not attach undue importance to the bargain but one never knows  the influences that make for reformation in human character are subtle and unexpected  anyhow it doesnt seem right to throw a chance away  added to which it has occurred to me that a donkey might be useful in the garden  he has lived at my expense for upwards of two years replied st leonard  i cannot myself see any moral improvement he has brought into my family  what effect he may have upon your children i cannot say  but when you talk about his being useful in a garden  he draws a cart interrupted miss janie  so long as someone walks beside him feeding him with carrots  we tried fixing the carrot on a pole six inches beyond his reach  that works all right in the picture  it starts this donkey kicking  you know yourself he continued with growing indignation the very last time your mother took him out she used up all her carrots getting there with the result that he and the cart had to be hauled home behind a trolley  we had reached the yard  nathaniel was standing with his head stretched out above the closed half of his stable door  i noticed points of resemblance between him and veronica herself  there was about him a like suggestion of resignation of suffering virtue misunderstood his eye had the same wistful yearning expression with which veronica will stand before the window gazing out upon the purple sunset while people are calling to her from distant parts of the house to come and put her things away  miss janie bending over him asked him to kiss her  he complied but with a gentle reproachful look that seemed to say why call me back again to earth  it made me mad with him  i was wrong in thinking miss janie not a pretty girl  hers is that type of beauty that escapes attention by its own perfection  it is the eccentric the discordant that arrests the roving eye  to harmony one has to attune oneself  i believe said miss janie as she drew away wiping her cheek one could teach that donkey anything  apparently she regarded willingness to kiss her as indication of exceptional amiability  except to work commented her father  ill tell you what ill do he said  if you take that donkey off my hands and promise not to send it back again why you can have it  for nothing demanded janie woefully  for nothing insisted her father  and if i have any argument ill throw in the cart  miss janie sighed and shrugged her shoulders  it was arranged that hopkins should deliver nathaniel into my keeping some time the next day  hopkins it appeared was the only person on the farm who could make the donkey go  i dont know what it is said st leonard but he has a way with him  and now i said there remains but dick  the lad i saw yesterday suggested st leonard  goodlooking young fellow  he is a nice boy i said  i dont really think i know a nicer boy than dick and clever when you come to understand him  there is only one fault i have to find with dick  i dont seem able to get him to work  miss janie was smiling  i asked her why  i was thinking she answered how close the resemblance appears to be between him and nathaniel  it was true  i had not thought of it  the mistake said st leonard is with ourselves  we assume every boy to have the soul of a professor and every girl a genius for music  we pack off our sons to cram themselves with greek and latin and put our daughters down to strum at the piano  nine times out of ten it is sheer waste of time  they sent me to cambridge and said i was lazy  i was not lazy  i was not intended by nature for a senior wrangler  i did not see the good of being a senior wrangler  who wants a world of senior wranglers  then why start every young man trying  i wanted to be a farmer  if intelligent lads were taught farming as a business farming would pay  in the name of common sense  i am inclined to agree with you i interrupted him  i would rather see dick a good farmer than a thirdrate barrister anyhow he thinks he could take an interest in farming  there are ten weeks before he need go back to cambridge sufficient time for the experiment  will you take him as a pupil  st leonard grasped his head between his hands and held it firmly if i consent he said i must insist on being honest  i saw the woefulness again in janies eyes  i think i said it is my turn to be honest  i have got the donkey for nothing i insist on paying for dick  they are waiting for you in the rickyard  i will settle the terms with miss janie  he regarded us both suspiciously  i will promise to be honest laughed miss janie  if its more than im worth he said ill send him home again my theory is  he stumbled over a pig which according to the timetable ought not to have been there  they went off hurriedly together the pig leading both screaming  miss janie said she would show me the short cut across the fields we could talk as we went  we walked in silence for awhile  you must not think she said i like being the one to do all the haggling  i feel a little sore about it very often  but somebody of course must do it and as for father poor dear  i looked at her  hers is the beauty to which a touch of sadness adds a charm  how old are you i asked her  twenty she answered next birthday  i judged you to be older i said  most people do she answered  my daughter robina i said is just the same ageaccording to years and dick is twentyone  i hope you will be friends with them they have got sense both of them  it comes out every now and again and surprises you  veronica i think is nine  i am not sure how veronica is going to turn out  sometimes things happen that make us think she has a beautiful character and then for quite long periods she seems to lose it altogether  the little motheri dont know why we always call her little motherwill not join us till things are more shipshape  she does not like to be thought an invalid and if we have her about anywhere near work that has to be done and are not always watching her she gets at it and tires herself  i am glad we are going to be neighbours said miss janie  there are ten of us altogether  father i am sure you will like clever men always like father  mothers day is friday  as a rule it is the only day no one ever calls  she laughed  the cloud had vanished they come on other days and find us all in our old clothes  on friday afternoon we sit in state and nobody comes near us and we have to eat the cakes ourselves  it makes her so cross  you will try and remember fridays wont you  i made a note of it then and there  i am the eldest she continued as i think father told you  harry and jack came next but jack is in canada and harry died so there is somewhat of a gap between me and the rest  bertie is twelve and ted eleven they are home just now for the holidays  sally is eight and then there come the twins  people dont half believe the tales that are told about twins but i am sure there is no need to exaggerate they are only six but they have a sense of humour you would hardly credit  one is a boy and the other a girl  they are always changing clothes and we are never quite sure which is which wilfrid gets sent to bed because winnie has not practised her scales and winnie is given syrup of squills because wilfried has been eating green gooseberries  last spring winnie had the measles  when the doctor came on the fifth day he was as pleased as punch he said it was the quickest cure he had ever known and that really there was no reason why she might not get up  we had our suspicions and they were right  winnie was hiding in the cupboard wrapped up in a blanket  they dont seem to mind what trouble they get into provided it isnt their own  the only safe plan unless you happen to catch them redhanded is to divide the punishment between them and leave them to settle accounts between themselves afterwards algy is four till last year he was always called the baby  now of course there is no excuse but the name still clings to him in spite of his indignant protestations  father called upstairs to him the other day  baby bring me down my gaiters  he walked straight up to the cradle and woke up the baby  get up i heard him sayi was just outside the doorand take your father down his gaiters  dont you hear him calling you  he is a droll little fellow  father took him to oxford last saturday  he is small for his age  the ticket collector quite contented threw him a glance and merely as a matter of form asked if he was under three  no he shouted before father could reply i sists on being honest  ise four  it is fathers pet phrase  what view do you take of the exchange i asked her from stockbroking with its larger income to farming with its smaller  perhaps it was selfish she answered but i am afraid i rather encouraged father  it seems to me mean making your living out of work that does no good to anyone  i hate the bargaining but the farming itself i love  of course it means having only one evening dress a year and making that myself  but even when i had a lot i always preferred wearing the one that i thought suited me the best as for the children they are as healthy as young savages and everything they want to make them happy is just outside the door the boys wont go to college but seeing they will have to earn their own living that perhaps is just as well  it is mother poor dear that worries so  she laughed again  her favourite walk is to the workhouse  she came back quite excited the other day because she had heard the guardians intend to try the experiment of building separate houses for old married couples  she is convinced she and father are going to end their days there  you as the business partner i asked her are hopeful that the farm will pay  oh yes she answered it will pay all rightit does pay for the matter of that  we live on it and live comfortably  but of course i can see mothers point of view with seven young children to bring up  and it is not only that  she stopped herself abruptly  oh well she continued with a laugh you have got to know us  father is trying  he loves experiments and a woman hates experiments last year it was bare feet  i daresay it is healthier  but children who have been about in bare feet all the morningwell it isnt pleasant when they sit down to lunch i dont care what you say  you cant be always washing  he is so unpractical  he was quite angry with mother and myself because we wouldnt  and a man in bare feet looks so ridiculous  this summer it is short hair and no hats and sally had such pretty hair  next year it will be sabots or turbans something or other suggesting the idea that weve lately escaped from a fair  on mondays and thursdays we talk french  we have got a french nurse and those are the only days in the week on which she doesnt understand a word thats said to her  we can none of us understand father and that makes him furious  he wont say it in english he makes a note of it meaning to tell us on tuesday or friday and then of course he forgets and wonders why we havent done it  hes the dearest fellow alive  when i think of him as a big boy then he is charming and if he really were only a big boy there are times when i would shake him and feel better for it  she laughed again  i wanted her to go on talking because her laugh was so delightful  but we had reached the road and she said she must go back  there were so many things she had to do  we have not settled about dick i reminded her  mother took rather a liking to him she murmured  if dick could make a living i said by getting people to like him i should not be so anxious about his futurelazy young devil  he has promised to work hard if you let him take up farming said miss janie  he has been talking to you i said  she admitted it  he will begin well i said  i know him  in a month he will have tired of it and be clamouring to do something else  i shall be very disappointed in him if he does she said  i will tell him that i said it may help  people dont like other people to be disappointed in them  i would rather you didnt she said  you could say that father will be disappointed in him  father formed rather a good opinion of him i know  i will tell him i suggested that we shall all be disappointed in him  she agreed to that and we parted  i remembered when she was gone that after all we had not settled terms  dick overtook me a little way from home  i have settled your business i told him  its awfully good of you said dick  mind i continued its on the understanding that you throw yourself into the thing and work hard  if you dont i shall be disappointed in you i tell you so frankly  thats all right governor he answered cheerfully  dont you worry  mr st leonard will also be disappointed in you dick i informed him  he has formed a very high opinion of you  dont give him cause to change it  ill get on all right with him answered dick  jolly old duffer aint he  miss janie will also be disappointed in you i added  did she say that he asked  she mentioned it casually i explained  though now i come to think of it she asked me not to say so  what she wanted me to impress upon you was that her father would be disappointed in you  dick walked beside me in silence for awhile  sorry ive been a worry to you dad he said at last  glad to hear you say so i replied  im going to turn over a new leaf dad he said  im going to work hard  about time i said    chapter vi    we had cold bacon for lunch that day  there was not much of it  i took it to be the bacon we had not eaten for breakfast  but on a clean dish with parsley it looked rather neat  it did not suggest however a lunch for four people two of whom had been out all the morning in the open air  there was some excuse for dick  i never heard before said dick of cold fried bacon as a hors doeuvre  it is not a hors doeuvre explained robina  it is all there is for lunch  she spoke in the quiet passionless voice of one who has done with all human emotion  she added that she should not be requiring any herself she having lunched already  veronica conveying by her tone and bearing the impression of something midway between a perfect lady and a christian martyr observed that she also had lunched  wish i had growled dick  i gave him a warning kick  i could see he was on the way to getting himself into trouble  as i explained to him afterwards a woman is most dangerous when at her meekest  a man when he feels his temper rising takes every opportunity of letting it escape  trouble at such times he welcomes  a broken bootlace or a shirt without a button is to him then as water in the desert  an only collarstud that will disappear as if by magic from between his thumb and finger and vanish apparently into thin air is a piece of good fortune sent on these occasions only to those whom the gods love  by the time he has waddled on his hands and knees twice round the room broken the bootjack raking with it underneath the wardrobe been bumped and slapped and kicked by every piece of furniture that the room contains and ended up by stepping on that stud and treading it flat he has not a bitter or an angry thought left in him  all that remains of him is sweet and peaceful  he fastens his collar with a safetypin humming an old song the while  failing the gifts of providence the childrenif in healthcan generally be depended upon to afford him an opening  sooner or later one or another of them will do something that no child when he was a boy would have daredor dreamed of daringto even so much as think of doing  the child conveying by expression that the world it is glad to say is slowly but steadily growing in sense and pity it is that oldfashioned folks cant bustle up and keep abreast of it points out that firstly it has not done this thing that for various reasonsa few only of which need be dwelt uponit is impossible it could have done this thing that secondly it has been expressly requested to do this thing that wishful always to give satisfaction it hasat sacrifice of all its own ideasgone out of its way to do this thing that thirdly it cant help doing this thing strive against fate as it will  he says he does not want to hear what the child has got to say on the subjectnor on any other subject neither then nor at any other time  he says theres going to be a new departure in this house and that things all round are going to be very different  he suddenly remembers every rule and regulation he has made during the past ten years for the guidance of everybody and that everybody himself included has forgotten  he tries to talk about them all at once in haste lest he should forget them again  by the time he has succeeded in getting himself if nobody else to understand himself the children are swarming round his knees extracting from him promises that in his sober moments he will be sorry that he made  i knew a womana wise and good woman she waswho when she noticed that her husbands temper was causing him annoyance took pains to help him to get rid of it  to relieve his sufferings i have known her search the house for a last months morning paper and ironing it smooth lay it warm and neatly folded on his breakfast plate  one thing in this world to be thankful for at all events and that is that we dont live in ditchleyinthemarsh he would growl ten minutes later from the other side of it  sounds a bit damp the good woman would reply  damp he would grunt who minds a bit of damp  good for you makes us englishmen what we are  being murdered in ones bed about once a week is what i should object to  do they do much of that sort of thing down there the good woman would enquire  seems to be the chief industry of the place  do you mean to say you dont remember that old maiden lady being murdered by her own gardener and buried in the fowlrun  you women you take no interest in public affairs  i do remember something about it now you mention it dear the good woman would confess  always seems such an innocent type of man a gardener  seems to be a special breed of them at ditchleyinthemarsh he answers  here again last monday he continues reading with growing interest  almost the same caseeven to the pruning knife yes hanged if he doesntburies her in the fowlrun  this is most extraordinary  it must be the imitative instinct asserting itself suggests the good woman  as you dear have so often pointed out one crime makes another  i have always said so he agrees it has always been a theory of mine  he folds the paper over  dull dogs these political chaps he says  heres the duke of devonshire speaking last night at hackney begins by telling a funny story he says he has just heard about a parrot  why its the same story somebody told a month ago i remember reading it  yesupon my soulword for word id swear to it  shows you the sort of men were governed by  you cant expect everyone dear to possess your repertoire the good woman remarks  neednt say hes just heard it that afternoon anyhow responds the good man  he turns to another column  what the devil  am i going off my head  he pounces on the eldest boy  when was the oxford and cambridge boatrace he fiercely demands  the oxford and cambridge boatrace repeats the astonished youth why its over  you took us all to see it last month  the saturday before  the conversation for the next ten minutes he conducts himself unaided  at the end he is tired maybe a trifle hoarse  but all his bad temper is gone  his sorrow is there was not sufficient of it he could have done with more  woman knows nothing of simple mechanics  a woman thinks you can get rid of steam by boxing it up and sitting on the safetyvalve  feeling as i do this morning that id like to wring everybodys neck for them the average woman argues to herself my proper coursei see it clearlyis to creep about the house asking of everyone that has the time to spare to trample on me  she coaxes you to tell her of her faults  when you have finished she asks for morereminds you of one or two you had missed out  she wonders why it is that she is always wrong  there must be a reason for it if only she could discover it  she wonders how it is that people can put up with herthinks it so good of them  at last of course the explosion happens  the awkward thing is that neither she herself nor anyone else knows when it is coming  a husband cornered me one evening in the club  it evidently did him good to talk  he told me that finding his wife that morning in one of her rare listening moods he had seized the opportunity to mention one or two matters in connection with the house he would like to have altered that was if she had no objection  she hadquite pleasantlyreminded him the house was his that he was master there she added that any wish of his of course was law to her  he was a young and inexperienced husband it seemed to him a hopeful opening  he spoke of quite a lot of thingsthings about which he felt that he was right and she was wrong  she went and fetched a quire of paper and borrowed his pencil and wrote them down  later on going through his letters in the study he found an unexpected cheque and ran upstairs and asked her if she would not like to come out with him and get herself a new hat  i could have understood it he moaned if she had dropped on me while i waswell i suppose you might say lecturing her  she had listened to it like a lambhadnt opened her mouth except to say yes dear or no dear  then when i only asked her if shed like a new hat she goes suddenly raving mad  i never saw a woman go so mad  i doubt if there be anything in nature quite as unexpected as a womans temper unless it be tumbling into a hole  i told all this to dick  i have told it him before  one of these days he will know it  you are right to be angry with me robina replied meekly there is no excuse for me  the whole thing is the result of my own folly  her pathetic humility should have appealed to him  he can be sympathetic when he isnt hungry  just then he happened to be hungry  i left you making a pie he said  it looked to me a fairsized pie  there was a duck on the table with a cauliflower and potatoes veronica was up to her elbows in peas  it made me hungry merely passing through the kitchen  i wouldnt have anything to eat in the town for fear of spoiling my appetite  where is it all  you dont mean to say that you and veronica have eaten the whole blessed lot  there is one thingshe admits it herselfthat exhausts veronicas patience  it is unjust suspicion  do i look as if id eaten anything for hours and hours veronica demanded  you can feel my waistband if you dont believe me  you said just now you had had your lunch dick argued  i know i did veronica admitted  one minute you are told that it is wicked to tell lies the next  veronica robina interrupted threateningly  its easy for you retorted veronica  you are not a growing child  you dont feel it  the least you can do said robina is to keep silence  whats the good said veronicanot without reason  youll tell them when ive gone to bed and cant put in a word for myself everything is always my fault  i wish sometimes that i was dead  that i were dead i corrected her  the verb to wish implying uncertainty should always be followed by the conditional mood  you ought said robina to be thankful to providence that youre not dead  people are sorry when youre dead said veronica  i suppose theres some breadandcheese in the house suggested dick  the baker for some reason or another has not called this morning robina answered sweetly  neither unfortunately has the grocer everything there is to eat in the house you see upon the table  accidents will happen i said  the philosopheras our friend st leonard would tell usonly smiles  i could smile said dick if it were his lunch  cultivate i said a sense of humour  from a humorous point of view this lunch is rather good  did you have anything to eat at the st leonards he asked  just a glass or so of beer and a sandwich or two i admitted they brought it out to us while we were talking in the yard  to tell the truth i was feeling rather peckish  dick made no answer but continued to chew baconrind  nothing i could say seemed to cheer him  i thought i would try religion  a dinner of herbsthe sentiment applies equally to lunchand contentment therewith is better i said than a stalled ox  dont talk about oxen he interrupted fretfully  i feel i could just eat onea plump one  there is a man i know  i confess he irritates me  his argument is that you should always rise from a meal feeling hungry  as i once explained to him you cannot rise from a meal feeling hungry without sitting down to a meal feeling hungry which means of course that you are always hungry  he agreed with me  he said that was the ideaalways ready  most people he said rise from a meal feeling no more interest in their food  that was a mental attitude injurious to digestion  keep it always interested that was the proper way to treat it  by it you mean     i said  of course he answered im talking about it  now i myself he explainedi rise from breakfast feeling eager for my lunch  i get up from my lunch looking forward to my dinner i go to bed just ready for my breakfast  cheerful expectancy he said was a wonderful aid to digestion  i call myself he said a cheerful feeder  you dont seem to me i said to be anything else  you talk like a tadpole  havent you any other interest in life  what about home and patriotism and shakespeareall those sort of things  why not give it a square meal and silence it for an hour or two leave yourself free to think of something else  how can you think of anything he argued when your stomachs out of order  how can you think of anything i argued when it takes you all your time to keep it in order  you are not a man you are a nurse to your own stomach  we were growing excited both of us forgetting our natural refinement  you dont get even your one afternoon a week  you are healthy enough i admit it  so are the convicts at portland  they never suffer from indigestion  i knew a doctor once who prescribed for a patient two years penal servitude as the only thing likely to do him permanent good  your stomach wont let you smoke  it wont let you drinknot when you are thirsty  it allows you a glass of apenta water at times when you dont want it assuming there could ever be a time when you did want it  you are deprived of your natural victuals and made to live upon prepared food as though you were some sort of a prize chicken  you are sent to bed at eleven and dressed in hygienic clothing that makes no pretence to fit you  talk of being henpecked  why the mildest husband living would run away or drown himself rather than remain tied for the rest of his existence to your stomach  it is easy to sneer he said  i am not sneering i said i am sympathising with you  he said he did not want any sympathy  he said if only i would give up overeating and drinking myself it would surprise me how bright and intelligent i should become  i thought this man might be of use to us on the present occasion accordingly i spoke of him and of his theory  dick seemed impressed  nice sort of man he asked  an earnest man i replied  he practises what he preaches and whether because or in spite of it the fact remains that a chirpier soul i am sure does not exist  married demanded dick  a single man i answered  in all things an idealist  he has told me he will never marry until he can find his ideal woman  what about robina here suggested dick  seem to have been made for one another  robina smiled  it was a wan pathetic smile  even he thought robina would want his beans cooked to time and to feel that a reasonable supply of nuts was always in the house  we incompetent women never ought to marry  we had finished the bacon  dick said he would take a stroll into the town  robina suggested he might take veronica with him that perhaps a bun and a glass of milk would do the child no harm  veronica for a wonder seemed to know where all her things were before dick had filled his pipe she was ready dressed and waiting for him  robina said she would give them a list of things they might bring back with them  she also asked dick to get together a plumber a carpenter a bricklayer a glazier and a civil engineer and to see to it that they started off at once  she thought that among them they might be able to do all that was temporarily necessary but the great thing was that the work should be commenced without delay  why what on earths the matter old girl asked dick  have you had an accident  then it was that robina exploded  i had been wondering when it would happen  to dicks astonishment it happened then  yes she answered there had been an accident  did he suppose that seven scrimpy scraps of bacon was her notion of a lunch between four hungry persons  did he judging from himself imagine that our family yielded only lunatics  was it kindwas it courteous to his parents to the mother he pretended to love to the father whose grey hairs he was by his general behaviour bringing down in sorrow to the graveto assume without further enquiry that their eldest daughter was an imbecile  my hair bythebye is not grey  there may be a suggestion of greyness here and there the natural result of deep thinking  to describe it in the lump as grey is to show lack of observation  and at fortyeightor a trifle overone is not going down into the grave not straight down  robina when excited uses exaggerated language  i did not however interrupt her she meant well  added to which interrupting robina whento use her own expressionshe is tired of being a worm is like trying to stop a cyclone with an umbrella  had his attention been less concentrated on the guzzling of cold bacon he had only had four mouthfuls poor fellowhad he noticed the sweet patient child starving before his very eyes this referred to veronicahis poor elder sister worn out with work and worry pining for nourishment herself it might have occurred to even his intelligence that there had been an accident  the selfishness the egotism of men it was that staggered overwhelmed robina when she came to think of it  robina paused  not for want of material i judged so much as want of breath  veronica performed a useful service by seizing the moment to express a hope that it was not earlyclosing day  robina felt a conviction that it was  it would be just like dick to stand there dawdling in a corner till it was too late to do anything  i have been trying to get out of this corner for the last five minutes explained dick with that angelic smile of his that i confess is irritating  if you have done talking and will give me an opening i will go  robina told him that she had done talking  she gave him her reasons for having done talking  if talking to him would be of any use she would often have felt it her duty to talk to him not only with regard to his stupidity and selfishness and general aggravatingness but with reference to his character as a whole  her excuse for not talking to him was the crushing conviction of the hopelessness of ever effecting any improvement in him  were it otherwise   seriously speaking said dick now escaped from his corner something i take it has gone wrong with the stove and you want a sort of general smith  he opened the kitchen door and looked in  great scott he said  what was itan earthquake  i looked in over his shoulder  but it could not have been an earthquake i said  we should have felt it  it is not an earthquake explained robina  it is your youngest daughters notion of making herself useful  robina spoke severely  i felt for the moment as if i had done it all myself  i had an uncle who used to talk like that  your aunt he would say regarding me with a reproachful eye your aunt can be when she likes the most trying woman to live with i have ever known  it would depress me for days  i would wonder whether i ought to speak to her about it or whether i should be doing only harm  but how did she do it i demanded  it is impossible that a mere childwhere is the child  the parlour contained but robina  i hurried to the door dick was already half across the field  veronica i could not see  we are making haste dick shouted back in case it is early closing day  i want veronica i shouted  what shouted dick  veronica i shouted with my hands to my mouth  yes shouted dick  shes on ahead  it was useless screaming any more  he was now climbing the stile  they always take each others part those two sighed robina  yes and you are just as bad i told her if he doesnt you do and then if its you they take your part  and you take his part and he takes both your parts  and between you all i am just getting tired of bringing any of you up  which is the truth  how did this thing happen  i had got everything finished answered robina  the duck was in the oven with the pie the peas and potatoes were boiling nicely  i was feeling hot and i thought i could trust veronica to watch the things for awhile  she promised not to play king alfred  whats that i asked  you know said robinaking alfred and the cakes  i left her one afternoon last year when we were on the houseboat to watch some buns when i came back she was sitting in front of the fire wrapped up in the tablecloth with dicks banjo on her knees and a cardboard crown upon her head  the buns were all burnt to a cinder  as i told her if i had known what she wanted to be up to i could have given her some extra bits of dough to make believe with  but oh no if you please that would not have suited her at all  it was their being real buns and my being real mad that was the best part of the game she is an uncanny child  what was the game this time i asked  i dont think it was intended for a gamenot at first answered robina  i went into the wood to pick some flowers for the table  i was on my way back still at some distance from the house when i heard quite a loud report  i took it for a gun and wondered what anyone would be shooting in july  it must be rabbits i thought rabbits never seem to have any time at all to themselves poor things  and in consequence i did not hurry myself  it must have been about twenty minutes later when i came in sight of the house veronica was in the garden deep in confabulation with an awful looking boy dressed in nothing but rags  his face and hands were almost black  you never saw such an object  they both seemed very excited  veronica came to meet me and with a face as serious as mine is now stood there and told me the most barefaced pack of lies you ever heard  she said that a few minutes after i had gone robbers had come out of the woodshe talked about them as though there had been hundredsand had with the most awful threats demanded to be admitted into the house  why they had not lifted the latch and walked in she did not explain  it appeared this cottage was their secret rendezvous where all their treasure lies hidden  veronica would not let them in but shouted for help  and immediately this awfullooking boy to whom she introduced me as sir robert something or another had appeared upon the scene and then there had followedwell i have not the patience to tell you the whole of the rigmarole they had concocted  the upshot of it was that the robbers defeated in their attempt to get into the house had fired a secret mine which had exploded in the kitchen  if i did not believe them i could go into the kitchen and see for myself  say what i would that is the story they both stuck to  it was not till i had talked to veronica for a quarter of an hour and had told her that you would most certainly communicate with the police and that she would have to convince a judge and jury of the truth of her story that i got any sense at all out of her  what was the sense you did get out of her i asked  well i am not sure even now that it is the truth said robina the child does not seem to possess a proper conscience  what she will grow up like if something does not happen to change her it is awful to think  i dont want to appear a hustler i said and maybe i am mistaken in the actual time but it feels to me like hours since i asked you how the catastrophe really occurred  i am telling you explained robina hurt  she was in the kitchen yesterday when i mentioned to harrys mother who had looked in to help me wash up that the kitchen chimney smoked  and then she said   who said i asked  why she did answered robina harrys mother  she said that very often a pennyworth of gunpowder  now at last we have begun i said  from this point i may be able to help you and we will get on  at the word gunpowder veronica pricked up her ears  the thing by its very nature would appeal to veronicas sympathies  she went to bed dreaming of gunpowder  left in solitude before the kitchen fire other maidens might have seen pictured in the glowing coals princes carriages and balls veronica saw visions of gunpowder  who knowsperhaps even she one day will have gunpowder of her own  she looks up from her reverie a fairy godmamma in the disguise of a small boyit was a small boy was it not  rather a nice little boy he gave me the idea of having been originally answered robina the child i should say of welltodo parents  he was dressed in a little lord fauntleroy suitor rather he had been  did veronica know how he wasanything about him i asked  nothing that i could get out of her replied robina you know her wayhow she chums on with anybody and everybody  as i told her if she had been attending to her duties instead of staring out of the window she would not have seen him  he happened to be crossing the field just at the time  a boy born to illluck evidently i observed  to veronica of course he seemed like the answer to a prayer  a boy would surely know where gunpowder could be culled  they must have got a pound of it from somewhere said robina judging from the result  any notion where they got it from i asked  no explained robina  all veronica can say is that he told her he knew where he could get some and was gone about ten minutes  of course they must have stolen iteven that did not seem to trouble her  it came to her as a gift from the gods robina i explained  i remember how i myself used to feel about these things at ten  to have enquired further would have seemed to her impious  how was it they were not both killed  providence was robinas suggestion  it seemed to be the only one possible  they lifted off one of the saucepans and just dropped the thing infortunately wrapped up in a brown paper parcel which gave them both time to get out of the house  at least veronica got clear off  for a change it was not she who fell over the mat it was the boy  i looked again into the kitchen then i returned and put my hands on robinas shoulders  it is a most amusing incidentas it has turned out i said  it might have turned out rather seriously thought robina  it might i agreed  she might be lying upstairs  she is a wicked heartless child said robina she ought to be punished  i lent robina my handkerchief she never has one of her own  she is going to be punished i said i will think of something  and so ought i said robina it was my fault leaving her knowing what shes like  i might have murdered her  she doesnt care shes stuffing herself with cakes at this very moment  they will probably give her indigestion i said  i hope they do  why didnt you have better children sobbed robina we are none of us any good to you  you are not the children i wanted i confess i answered  thats a nice kind thing to say retorted robina indignantly  i wanted such charming children i explainedmy idea of charming children  the children i had imagined for myself  even as babies you disappointed me  robina looked astonished  you robina were the most disappointing i complained  dick was a boy  one does not calculate upon boy angels and by the time veronica arrived i had got more used to things  but i was so excited when you came  the little mother and i would steal at night into the nursery  isnt it wonderful the little mother would whisper to think it all lies hidden there  the little tiresome child the sweetheart they will one day take away from us the wife the mother  i am glad it is a girl i would whisper i shall be able to watch her grow into womanhood  most of the girls one comes across in books strike one as not perhaps quite true to life  it will give me such an advantage having a girl of my own  i shall keep a note book with a lock and key devoted to her  did you asked robina  i put it away i answered there were but a few pages written on it came to me quite early in your life that you were not going to be the model heroine  i was looking for the picture baby the clean thoughtful baby with its magical mystical smile  i wrote poetry about you robina but you would slobber and howl  your little nose was always having to be wiped and somehow the poetry did not seem to fit you  you were at your best when you were asleep but you would not even sleep when it was expected of you  i think robina that the fellows who draw the pictures for the comic journals of the man in his nightshirt with the squalling baby in his arms must all be single men  the married man sees only sadness in the design  it is not the mere discomfort  if the little creature were ill or in pain we should not think of that  it is the reflection that we who meant so well have brought into the world just an ordinary fretful human creature with a nasty temper of its own  that is the tragedy robina  and then you grew into a little girl  i wanted the soulful little girl with the fathomless eyes who would steal to me at twilight and question me concerning lifes conundrums  but i used to ask you questions grumbled robina and you would tell me not to be silly  dont you understand robina i answered  i am not blaming you i am blaming myself  we are like children who plant seeds in a garden and then are angry with the flowers because they are not what we expected  you were a dear little girl i see that now looking back but not the little girl i had in my mind  so i missed you thinking of the little girl you were not  we do that all our lives robina we are always looking for the flowers that do not grow passing by trampling underfoot the blossoms round about us  it was the same with dick  i wanted a naughty boy  well dick was naughty no one can say that he was not  but it was not my naughtiness  i was prepared for his robbing orchards  i rather hoped he would rob orchards  all the highspirited boys in books rob orchards and become great men  but there were not any orchards handy  we happened to be living in chelsea at the time he ought to have been robbing orchards  that of course was my fault  i did not think of that  he stole a bicycle that a lady had left outside the tearoom in battersea park he and another boy the son of a common barber who shaved people for threehalfpence  i am a republican in theory but it grieved me that a son of mine could be drawn to such companionship  they contrived to keep it for a weektill the police found it one night artfully hidden behind bushes  logically i do not see why stealing apples should be noble and stealing bicycles should be mean but it struck me that way at the time  it was not the particular steal i had been hoping for  i wanted him wild the hero of the book was ever in his college days a wild young man  well he was wild  it cost me three hundred pounds to keep that breach of promise case out of court i had never imagined a breach of promise case  then he got drunk and bonneted a bishop in mistake for a bulldog  i didnt mind the bishop  that by itself would have been wholesome fun  but to think that a son of mine should have been drunk  he has never been drunk since pleaded robina  he had only three glasses of champagne and a liqueur  it was the liqueurhe was not used to it  he got into the wrong set  you cannot in college belong to the wild set without getting drunk occasionally  perhaps not i admitted  in the book the wild young man drinks without ever getting drunk  maybe there is a difference between life and the book  in the book you enjoy your fun but contrive somehow to escape the licking  in life the licking is the only thing sure it was the wild young man of fiction i was looking for who a fortnight before the exam ties a wet towel round his head drinks strong tea and passes easily with honours  he tried the wet towel he tells me  it never would keep in its place  added to which it gave him neuralgia while the strong tea gave him indigestion  i used to picture myself the proud indulgent father lecturing him for his wildnessturning away at some point in the middle of my tirade to hide a smile  there was never any smile to hide  i feel that he has behaved disgracefully wasting his time and my money  he is going to turn over a new leaf said robina  i am sure he will make an excellent farmer  i did not want a farmer i explained i wanted a prime minister children robina are very disappointing  veronica is all wrong  i like a mischievous child  i like reading stories of mischievous children  they amuse me  but not the child who puts a pound of gunpowder into a redhot fire and escapes with her life by a miracle  and yet i daresay suggested robina that if one put it into a booki mean that if you put it into a book it would read amusingly  likely enough i agreed  other peoples troubles can always be amusing  as it is i shall be in a state of anxiety for the next six months wondering every moment that she is out of my sight what new devilment she is up to  the little mother will be worried out of her life unless we can keep it from her  children will be children murmured robina meaning to be comforting  that is what i am complaining of robina  we are always hoping that ours wont be  she is full of faults veronica and they are not always nice faults  she is lazylazy is not the word for it  she is lazy robina was compelled to admit  there are other faults she might have had and welcome i pointed out faults i could have taken an interest in and liked her all the better for  you children are so obstinate  you will choose your own faults  veronica is not truthful always  i wanted a family of little george washingtons who could not tell a lie  veronica can to get herself out of troubleand provided there is any hope of anybody believing hershe does  we all of us used to when we were young robina maintained dick used to i used to  it is a common fault with children  i know it is i answered  i did not want a child with common faults  i wanted something all my own  i wanted you robina to be my ideal daughter  i had a girl in my mind that i am sure would have been charming  you are not a bit like her  i dont say she was perfect she had her failings but they were such delightful failingsmuch better than yours robina  she had a tempera woman without a temper is insipid but it was that kind of temper that made you love her all the more  yours doesnt robina  i wish you had not been in such a hurry and had left me to arrange your temper for you  we should all of us have preferred mine  it had all the attractions of temper without the drawbacks of the ordinary temper  couldnt use it up i suppose for yourself pa suggested robina  it was a ladys temper i explained  besides as i asked her what is wrong with the one i have  nothing answered robina  yet her tone conveyed doubt  it seems to me sometimes that an older temper would suit you better that was all  you have hinted as much before robina i remarked not only with reference to my temper but with reference to things generally  one would think that you were dissatisfied with me because i am too young  not in years perhaps replied robina butwell you know what i mean  one wants ones father to be always great and dignified  we cannot change our ego i explained to her  some daughters would appreciate a father youthful enough in temperament to sympathise with and to indulge them  the solemn old fogey you have in your mind would have brought you up very differently  let me tell you that my girl  you would not have liked him if you had had him  perhaps not robina agreed  you are awfully good in some ways  what we have got to do in this world robina i said is to take people as they are and make the best of them  we cannot expect everybody to be just as we would have them and maybe we should not like them any better if they were  dont bother yourself about how much nicer they might be think how nice they are  robina said she would try  i have hopes of making robina a sensible woman    chapter vii    dick and veronica returned laden with parcels  they explained that daddy slee as it appeared he was generally called a local builder of renown was following in his ponycart and was kindly bringing the bulkier things with him  i tried to hustle him said dick but coming up after he had washed himself and had his tea seemed to be his idea of hustling  he has got the reputation of being an honest old johnny slow but sure the others they tell me are slower  i thought you might care later on to talk to him about the house  veronica took off her things and put them away each one in its proper place  she said if no one wanted her she would read a chapter of the vicar of wakefield and retired upstairs  robina and i had an egg with our tea mr slee arrived as we had finished and i took him straight into the kitchen  he was a large man with a dreamy expression and a habit of sighing  he sighed when he saw our kitchen  theres four days work for three men here he said and youll want a new stove  lord what trouble children can be  robina agreed with him  meanwhile she demanded how am i to cook  myself missie sighed mr slee i dont see how you are going to cook  well all have to tramp home again thought dick  and tell little mother the reason and frighten her out of her life retorted robina indignantly  robina had other ideas  mr slee departed promising that work should be commenced at seven oclock on monday morning  robina the door closed began to talk  let pa have a sandwich said robina and catch the sixfifteen  we might all have a sandwich suggested dick i could do with one myself  pa can explain said robina that he has been called back to town on business  that will account for everything and little mother will not be alarmed  she wont believe that business has brought him back at nine oclock on a saturday night argued dick you think that little mother hasnt any sense  shell see theres something up and ask a hundred questions  you know what she is  pa said robina will have time while in the train to think out something plausible thats where pa is clever  with pa off my hands i shant mind  we three can live on cold ham and things like that by thursday we will be all right and then he can come down again  i pointed out to robina kindly but firmly the utter absurdity of her idea  how could i leave them three helpless children with no one to look after them  what would the little mother say  what might not veronica be up to in my absence  there were other things to be considered  the donkey might arrive at any momentno responsible person there to receive himto see to it that his simple wants would be provided for  i should have to interview mr st leonard again to fix up final details as regarded dick  who was going to look after the cow about to be separated from us  young bute would be down again with plans  who was going to take him over the house explain things to him intelligibly  the new boy might turn upthis simple son of the soil miss janie had promised to dig out and send along  he would talk berkshire  who would there be to understand himto reply to him in dialect  what was the use of her being impetuous and talking nonsense  she went on cutting sandwiches  she said they were not helpless children  she said if she and dick at fortytwo hadnt grit enough to run a sixroomed cottage it was time they learned  whos fortytwo i demanded  we are explained robina dick and ibetween us  we shall be fortytwo next birthday  nearly your own age  veronica she continued for the next few days wont be a child at all  she knows nothing of the happy medium  she is either herself or she goes to the opposite extreme and tries to be an angel  till about the end of the week it will be like living with a vision  as for the donkey well try and make him feel as much at home as if you were here  i dont mean to be rude pa robina explained but from the way you put it you evidently regard yourself as the only one among us capable of interesting him  i take it he wont mind for a night or two sharing the shed with the cow  if he looks shocked at the suggestion dick can knock up a partition  id rather for the present till you come down again the cow stopped where she was she helps to wake me in the morning  you may reckon you have settled everything as far as dick is concerned  if you talk to st leonard again for an hour it will be about the future of the yellow races or the possibility of life in jupiter  if you mention terms he will be insulted and if he wont let you then you will be insulted and the whole thing will be off  let me talk to janie  weve both of us got sense  as for mr bute i know all your ideas about the house and i shant listen to any of his silly arguments  what that young man wants is someone to tell him what hes got to do and then let there be an end of it  and the sooner that handy boy turns up the better i dont mind what he talks  all i want him to do is to clean knives and fetch water and chop wood  at the worst ill get that home to him by pantomime  for conversation he can wait till you come down  that is the gist of what she said  it didnt run exactly as i have put it down  there were points at which i interrupted but robina never listens she just talks on and at the end she assumes that as a matter of course you have come round to her point of view and persuading her that you havent means beginning the whole thing over again  she said i hadnt time to talk and that she would write and tell me everything  dick also said he would write and tell me everything and that if i felt moved to send them down a hamperthe sort of thing that left to themselves fortnum  mason would put together for a goodclass picnic say for six personsi might rely upon it that nothing would be wasted  veronica by my desire walked with me to the end of the lane  i talked to her very seriously  her difficulty was that she had not been blown up  had she been blown up then she would have known herself she had done wrong  in the book it is the disobedient child that is tossed by the bull  the child that has been sent with the little basket to visit the sick aunt may be right in the bulls way that is a bit of bad luck for the bull  the poor bull is compelled to waste valuable time working round carefully so as not to upset the basket  if the wicked child had sense which in the book does not happen it would while the bull was dodging to get past the good child seize the opportunity to move itself quickly  the wicked child never looks round but pegs along steadily and when the bull arrives it is sure to be in the most convenient position for receiving moral lessons  the good child whatever its weight crosses the ice in safety  the bad child may turn the scale at two stone lighter the ice will have none of him  dont you talk to me about relative pressure to the square inch says the indignant ice you were unkind to your little baby brother the week before last in you go  veronicas argument temperately and courteously expressed i admit came practically to this  i may have acted without sufficient knowledge to guide me  my education has not perhaps on the whole been ordered wisely subjects that i feel will never be of the slightest interest or consequence to me have been insisted upon with almost tiresome reiteration  matters that should be useful and helpful to me gunpowder to take but one examplei have been left in ignorance concerning  about all that i say nothing people have done their best according to their lights no doubt  when however we come to purity of motives singleness of intention then i maintain i am above reproach  the proof of this is that providence has bestowed upon me the seal of its approval  i was not blown up  had my conduct been open to censureas in certain quarters has been suggestedshould i be walking besides you now undamagednot a hair turned as the saying is  no  discriminating fatethat is if any reliance at all is to be placed on literature for the youngwould have made it her business that at least i was included in the debris instead what do we noticea shattered chimney a ruined stove broken windows a wreckage of household utensils i alone of all things miraculously preserved  i do not wish to press the point offensively but really it would almost seem that it must be you threeyou my dear parent upon whom will fall the bill for repairs dick apt to attach too much importance maybe to his victuals and who for the next few days will be compelled to exist chiefly upon tinned goods robina by nature of a worrying disposition certain till things get straight again to be next door to off her headwho must by reason of conduct into which i do not enquire have merited chastisement at the hands of providence  the moral lesson would certainly appear to be between you three  iit grows clear to me have been throughout but the innocent instrument  admit the premise that to be virtuous is to escape whipping the argument is logical  i felt that left uncombated it might lead us into yet further trouble  veronica i said the time has come to reveal to you a secret literature is not always a safe guide to life  you mean said veronica  i mean i said that the writer of books is generally speaking an exceptionally moral man  that is what leads him astray  he is too good  this world does not come up to his ideas  it is not the world as he would have made it himself  to satisfy his craving for morality he sets to work to make a world of his own  it is not this world  it is not a bit like this world  in a world as it should be veronica you would undoubtedly have been blown upif not altogether at all events partially  what you have to do veronica is with a full heart to praise heaven that this is not a perfect world  if it were i doubt very much veronica your being here that you are here happy and thriving proves that all is not as it should be  the bull of this world feeling he wants to toss somebody does not sit upon himself so to speak till the wicked child comes by  he takes the first child that turns up and thanks god for it  a hundred to one it is the best child for miles around the bull does not care  he spoils that pattern child  hed spoil a bishop feeling as he does that morning  your little friend in the velvet suit who did get himself blown up at all events as regards the suit which of you was it that thought of that gunpowder you or he  veronica claimed that the inspiration had been hers  i can easily believe it  and was he anxious to steal the gunpowder and put it on the fire or did he have to be persuaded  veronica admitted that in the qualities of a firstclass hero he was wanting  not till it had been suggested to him that he must at heart be a cowardy cowardy custard had he been moved to take a hand in the enterprise  a lad clearly i continued that left to himself would be a comfort to his friends  and the story of the robbersyour invention or his  veronica was generously of opinion that he might have thought of it had he not been chiefly concerned at the moment with the idea of getting home to his mother  as it was the clothing with romance of incidents otherwise bald and uninteresting had fallen upon her  the good child of the story  the fact stands out at every point his one failing an amiable weakness  do you not see it for yourself veronica  in the book you not he would have tumbled over the mat in this wicked world it is the wicked who prosper  he the innocent the virtuous is torn into rags  you the villain of the story escape  i see said veronica then whenever nothing happens to you that means that youre a wrong un  i dont go so far as to say that veronica  and i wish you wouldnt use slang  dick is a man and a manwell never mind about a man you veronica must never forget that youre a lady  justice must not be looked for in this world  sometimes the wicked get what they deserve  more often they dont  there seems to be no rule  follow the dictates of your conscience veronica and blowi mean be indifferent to the consequences  sometimes youll come out all right and sometimes you wont  but the beautiful sensation will always be with you  i did right  things have turned out unfortunately  but thats not my fault  nobody can blame me  but they do said veronica they blame you just as if youd meant to go and do it  it does not matter veronica i pointed out the opinion of the world  the good man disregards it  but they send you to bed persisted veronica  let them i said  what is bed so long as the voice of the inward monitor consoles us with the reflection  but it dont interrupted veronica it makes you feel all the madder  it does really  it oughtnt to i told her  then why does it argued veronica  why dont it do what it ought to  the trouble about arguing with children is that they will argue too  lifes a difficult problem veronica i allowed  things are not as they ought to be i admit it  but one must not despair somethings got to be done  its jolly hard on some of us said veronica  strive as you may you cant please everyone  and if you just as much as stand up for yourself oh crikey  the duty of the grownup person veronica i said is to bring up the child in the way that it should go  it isnt easy work and occasionally irritability may creep in  theres such a lot of em at it grumbled veronica  there are times between em all when you dont know whether youre standing on your head or your heels  they mean well veronica i said  when i was a little boy i used to think just as you do  but now  did you ever get into rows interrupted veronica  did i everwas never out of them so far as i can recollect  if it wasnt one thing then it was another  and didnt it make you wild enquired veronica when first of all theyd ask what youd got to say and why youd done it and then when you tried to explain things to them wouldnt listen to you  what used to irritate me most veronica i repliedi can remember it so wellwas when they talked steadily for half an hour themselves and then when i would attempt with one sentence to put them right about the thing turn round and bullyrag me for being argumentative  if they would only listen agreed veronica you might get them to grasp things  but no they talk and talk till at the end they dont know what they are talking about themselves and then they pretend its your fault for having made them tired  i know i said they always end up like that  i am tired of talking to you they sayas if we were not tired of listening to them  and then when you think said veronica they say you oughtnt to think  and if you dont think and let it out by accident then they say why dont you think  it dont seem as though we could do right  it makes one almost despair  and it isnt even as if they were always right themselves i pointed out to her  when they knock over a glass it is who put that glass there  youd think that somebody had put it there on purpose and made it invisible  they are not expected to see a glass six inches in front of their nose in the place where the glass ought to be  the way they talk youd suppose that a glass had no business on a table  if i broke it then it was always clumsy little devil ought to have his dinner in the nursery  if they mislay their things and cant find them its whos been interfering with my things  whos been in here rummaging about  then when they find it they want to know indignantly who put it there  if i could not find a thing for the simple reason that somebody had taken it away and put it somewhere else then wherever they had put it was the right place for it and i was a little idiot for not knowing it  and of course you mustnt say anything commented veronica  oh no  if they do something silly and you just point it out to them then there is always a reason for it that you wouldnt understand oh yes  and if you make just the slightest mistake like what is natural to all of us that is because you are wicked and unfeeling and dont want to be anything else  i will tell you what we will do veronica i said we will write a book  you shall help me  and in it the children shall be the wise and good people who never make mistakes and they shall boss the showyou know what i meanlook after the grownup people and bring them up properly  and everything the grownup people do or dont do will be wrong  veronica clapped her hands  no will you really she said  oh do  i will really i answered  we will call it a moral tale for parents and all the children will buy it and give it to their fathers and mothers and suchlike folk for their birthdays with writing on the titlepage from johnny or jenny to dear papa or to dear aunty with every good wish for his or her improvement  do you think they will read it doubted veronica  we will put in it something shocking i suggested and get some paper to denounce it as a disgrace to english literature  and if that wont do it we will say it is a translation from the russian the children shall stop at home and arrange what to have for dinner and the grownup people shall be sent to school  we will start them off each morning with a little satchel  they shall be made to read grimms fairy tales in the original german with notes and learn old mother hubbard by heart and explain the grammar  and go to bed early suggested veronica  we will have them all in bed by eight oclock veronica and they will go cheerfully as if they liked it or we will know the reason why  we will make them say their prayers  between ourselves veronica i dont believe they always do  and no reading in bed and no final glass of whisky toddy or any nonsense of that sort  an abernethy biscuit and perhaps if they are good a jujube and then good night and down with their head on the pillow  and no calling out and no pretending they have got a pain in their tummy and creeping downstairs in their nightshirts and clamouring for brandy we will be up to all their tricks  and theyll have to take their medicine veronica remembered  the slightest suggestion of sulkiness the first intimation that they are not enjoying themselves will mean cod liver oil in a tablespoon veronica  and we will ask them why they never use their commonsense chirped veronica  that will be our trouble veronica that they wont have any sense of any sortnot what we shall deem sense  but nevertheless we will be just  we will always give them a reason why they have got to do everything they dont want to do and nothing that they want to do  they wont understand it and they wont agree that it is a reason but they will keep that to themselves if they are wise  and of course they must not argue veronica insisted  if they answer back veronica that will show they are cursed with an argumentative temperament which must be rooted out at any cost i agreed and if they dont say anything that will prove them possessed of a surly disposition which must be checked at once before it develops into a vice  and whatever we do to them we will tell them its for their own good veronica chortled  of course it will be for their own good i answered  that will be our chief pleasuremaking them good and happy  it wont be their pleasure but that will be owing to their ignorance  they will be grateful to us later on gurgled veronica  with that assurance we will comfort them from time to time i answered  we will be good to them in all ways  we will let them play gamesnot stupid games golf and croquet that do you no good and lead only to language and disputebut bears and wolves and whales educational sort of games that will aid them in acquiring knowledge of natural history  we will show them how to play pirates and red indians and ogressensible play that will help them to develop their imaginative faculties  that is why grownup people are so dull they are never made to think  but now and then i continued we will let them play their own games say on wednesday and saturday afternoons  we will invite other grownups to come to tea with them and let them flirt in the garden or if wet make love in the diningroom till nurse comes for them  but we of course must choose their friends for themnice wellbehaved ladies and gentlemen the parents of respectable children because left to themselveswell you know what they are  they would just as likely fall in love with quite undesirable peoplemen and women we could not think of having about the house  we will select for them companions we feel sure will be the most suitable for them and if they dont like themif uncle william says he cant bear the girl we have invited up to love himthat he positively hates her we till tell him that it is only his wilful temper and that hes got to like her because shes good for him and dont let us have any of his fretfulness  and if grandmamma pouts and says she wont love old man jones merely because hes got a red nose or a glass eye or some silly reason of that sort we will say to her  all right my lady you will play with mr jones and be nice to him or you will spend the afternoon putting your room tidy make up your mind  we will let them marry on wednesday and saturday afternoons and play at keeping house  and if they quarrel we will shake them and take the babies away from them and lock them up in drawers and tell them they shant have them again till they are good  and the more they try to be good the more it will turn out that they aint been good veronica reflected  their goodness and their badness will depend upon us in more senses than one veronica i explained  when consols are down when the east wind has touched up our liver they will be surprised how bad they are  and they mustnt ever forget what theyve ever been once told crowed veronica  we mustnt have to tell em the same thing over and over again like we was talking to brick walls  and if we meant to tell them and forgot to tell them i added we will tell them that they ought not to want us to tell them a simple thing like that as if they were mere babies  we must remember all these points  and if they grumble well tell them thats cos they dont know how happy they are  and well tell them how good we used to be wheni say dont you miss your train or i shall get into a row  great scott  id forgotten all about that train veronica i admitted  better run suggested veronica  it sounded good advice  keep on thinking about that book shouted veronica  make a note of things as they occur to you i shouted back  what shall we call it veronica screamed  why the man in the moon looks sat upon i shrieked  when i turned again she was sitting on the top rail of the stile conducting an imaginary orchestra with one of her own shoes  the sixfifteen was fortunately twenty minutes late   i thought it best to tell ethelbertha the truth that things had gone wrong with the kitchen stove  let me know the worst she said  is veronica hurt  the worst i said is that i shall have to pay for a new range why when anything goes amiss poor veronica should be assumed as a matter of course to be in it appears to me unjust  you are sure shes all right persisted ethelbertha  honest injunconfound those children and their slangi mean positively i answered  the little mother looked relieved  i told her all the trouble we had had in connection with the cow her sympathies were chiefly with the cow  i told her i had hopes of robinas developing into a sensible woman  we talked quite a deal about robina  we agreed that between us we had accomplished something rather clever  i must get back as soon as i can i said  i dont want young bute getting wrong ideas into his head  who is young bute she asked  the architect i explained  i thought he was an old man said ethelbertha  old spreight is old enough i said  young bute is one of his young men but he understands his work and seems intelligent  whats he like she asked  personally an exceedingly nice young fellow  theres a good deal of sense in him  i like a boy who listens  goodlooking she asked  not objectionably so i replied  a pleasant faceparticularly when he smiles  is he married she asked  really it did not occur to me to ask him i admitted  how curious you women are  no i dont think so  i should say not  why dont you think so she demanded  oh i dont know  he doesnt give you the idea of a married man youll like him  seems so fond of his sister  shall we be seeing much of him she asked  a goodish deal i answered  i expect he will be going down on monday  very annoying this stove business  what is the use of his being there without you ethelbertha wanted to know  oh hell potter round i suggested and take measurements  dick will be about to explain things to him  or if he isnt theres robinaawkward thing is robina seems to have taken a dislike to him  why has she taken a dislike to him asked ethelbertha  oh because he mistook the back of the house for the front or the front of the house for the back i explained i forget which now says its his smile that irritates her  she owns herself theres no real reason  when will you be going down again ethelbertha asked  on thursday next i told her stove or no stove  she said she would come with me  she felt the change would do her good and promised not to do anything when she got there  and then i told her all that i had done for dick  the ordinary farmer i pointed out to her is so often a haphazard type of man with no ideas  if successful it is by reason of a natural instinct which cannot be taught  st leonard has studied the theory of the thing  from him dick will learn all that can be learnt about farming  the selection i felt demanded careful judgment  but will dick stick to it ethelbertha wondered  there again i pointed out to her the choice was one calling for exceptional foresight  the old manas a matter of fact he isnt old at all cant be very much older than myself i dont know why they all call him the old manhas formed a high opinion of dick his daughter told me so and i have taken care to let dick know it the boy will not care to disappoint him  her mother  whose mother interrupted ethelbertha  janies mother mrs st leonard i explained  she also has formed a good opinion of him  the children like him  janie told me so  she seems to do a goodish deal of talking this miss janie remarked ethelbertha  you will like her i said  she is a charming girlso sensible and good and unselfish and  who told you all this about her interrupted ethelbertha  you can see it for yourself i answered  the mother appears to be a nonentity and st leonard himselfwell he is not a business man it is janie who manages everythingkeeps everything going  what is she like asked ethelbertha  i am telling you i said  she is so practical and yet at the same time  in appearance i mean explained ethelbertha  how you women i said do worry about mere looks  what does it matter  if you want to know it is that sort of face that grows upon you  at first you do not notice how beautiful it is but when you come to look into it  and has she also formed a high opinion of dick interrupted ethelbertha  she will be disappointed in him i said if he does not work hard and stick to it  they will all be disappointed in him  whats it got to do with them demanded ethelbertha  im not thinking about them i said  what i look at is  i dont like her said ethelbertha  i dont like any of them  but  she didnt seem to be listening  i know that class of man she said and the wife appears if anything to be worse  as for the girl  when you come to know them i said  she said she didnt want to know them  she wanted to go down on monday early  i got her to seeit took some little timethe disadvantages of this  we should only be adding to robinas troubles and change of plan now would unsettle dicks mind  he has promised to write me i said and tell me the result of his first days experience  let us wait and hear what he says  she said that whatever could have possessed her to let me take those poor unfortunate children away from her and muddle up everything without her was a mystery to herself  she hoped that at least i had done nothing irrevocable in the case of veronica  veronica i said is really wishful i think to improve  i have bought her a donkey  a what exclaimed ethelbertha  a donkey i repeated  the child took a fancy to it and we all agreed it might help to steady hergive her a sense of responsibility  i somehow felt you hadnt overlooked veronica said ethelbertha  i thought it best to change the conversation  she seemed in a fretful mood    chapter viii    robinas letter was dated monday evening and reached us tuesday morning  i hope you caught your train she wrote  veronica did not get back till halfpast six  she informed me that you and she had found a good deal to talk about and that one thing had led to another she is a quaint young imp but i think your lecture must have done her good  her present attitude is that of gentle forbearance to all around hernot without its dignity  she has not snorted once and at times is really helpful  i have given her an empty scribbling diary we found in your desk and most of her spare time she remains shut up with it in the bedroom  she tells me you and she are writing a book together  i asked her what about  she waved me aside with the assurance that i would know all in good time and that it was going to do good  i caught sight of just the titlepage last night it was lying open on the dressingtable  why the man in the moon looks sat upon  it sounds like a title of yours  but i would not look further though tempted  she has drawn a picture underneath it is really not bad  the old gentleman really does look sat upon and intensely disgusted  sir roberthis name being theodore which doesnt seem to suit himturns out to be the only son of a widow a mrs foy our next door neighbour to the south  we met her coming out of church on sunday morning  she was still crying  dick took veronica on ahead and i walked part of the way home with them  her grandfather it appears was killed many years ago by the bursting of a boiler and she is haunted poor lady by the conviction that theodore is the inheritor of an hereditary tendency to getting himself blown up  she attaches no blame to us seeing in saturdays catastrophe only the hand of the family curse  i tried to comfort her with the idea that the curse having spent itself upon a futile effort nothing further need now be feared from it but she persists in taking the gloomier view that in wrecking our kitchen theodores doom as she calls it was merely indulging in a sort of dress rehearsal the finishing performance may be relied upon to follow  it sounds ridiculous but the poor woman was so desperately in earnest that when an unlucky urchin coming out of a cottage we were passing tripped on the doorstep and let fall a jug we both screamed at the same time and were equally surprised to find sir robert still between us and all in one piece  i thought it foolish to discuss all this before the child himself but did not like to stop her  as a result he regards himself evidently as the chosen foe of heaven and is not unnaturally proud of himself  she called here this monday afternoon to leave cards and at her request i showed her the kitchen and the mat over which he had stumbled  she seemed surprised that the doom had let slip so favourable a chance of accomplishing its business and gathered from the fact added cause for anxiety evidently something much more thorough is in store for master theodore  it was only half a pound of gunpowder she told me doctor smallboys gardener had bought it for the purpose of raising the stump of an old elmtree and had left it for a moment on the grass while he had returned to the house for more brown paper  she seemed pleased with the gardener who as she said might if dishonestly inclined have charged her for a pound  i wanted to pay forat all eventsour share but she would not take a penny  her late lamented grandfather she regards as the person responsible for the entire incident and perhaps it may be as well not to disturb her view  had i suggested it i feel sure she would have seen the justice of her providing us with a new kitchen range  wildly exaggerated accounts of the affair are flying round the neighbourhood and my chief fear is that veronica may discover she is a local celebrity  your sudden disappearance is supposed to have been heavenward  an old farm labourer who saw you pass on your way to the station speaks of you as the ghost of the poor gentleman himself and fragments of clothing found anywhere within a radius of two miles are being preserved i am told as specimens of your remains  boots would appear to have been your chief apparel  seven pairs have already been collected from the surrounding ditches among the more publicspirited there is talk of using you to start a local museum   these first three paragraphs i did not read to ethelbertha fortunately they just filled the first sheet which i took an opportunity of slipping into my pocket unobserved   the new boy arrived on sunday morning she continued  his name if i have got it rightis william  anyhow that is the nearest i can get to it  his other name if any i must leave you to extract from him yourself  it may be berkshire that he talks but it sounds more like barking  please excuse the pun but i have just been talking to him for half an hour trying to make him understand that i want him to go home and maybe as a result i am feeling a little hysterical  anything more rural i cannot imagine  but he is anxious to learn and a fairly wide field is in front of him  i caught him after our breakfast on sunday calmly throwing everything left over onto the dustheap  i pointed out to him the wickedness of wasting nourishing food and impressed upon him that the proper place for victuals was inside us  he never answers  he stands stock still with his mouth as wide open as it will gowhich is saying a good dealand one trusts that ones words are entering into him  all sunday afternoon he was struggling valiantly against an almost supernatural sleepiness  after tea he got worse and i began to think he would be no use to me  we none of us ate much supper and dick who appears able to understand him helped him to carry the things out  i heard them talking and then dick came back and closed the door behind him  he wants to know said dick if he can leave the corned beef over till tomorrow  because if he eats it all to night he doesnt think he will be able to walk home  veronica takes great interest in him  she has evidently a motherly side to her character for which we none of us have given her credit she says she is sure there is good in him  she sits beside him while he chops wood and tells him carefully selected stories calculated she argues to develop his intelligence  she is careful moreover not to hurt his feelings by any display of superiority  of course anyone leading a useful life such as yours i overheard her saying to him this morning dont naturally get much time for reading ive nothing else to do you see cept to improve myself  the donkey arrived this afternoon while i was outgalloping i am given to understand with opkins on his back  there seems to be some secret between those two  we have tried him with hay and we have tried him with thistles but he seems to prefer breadand butter  i have not been able as yet to find out whether he takes tea or coffee in the morning  but he is an animal that evidently knows his own mind and fortunately both are in the house  we are putting him up for tonight with the cow who greeted him at first with enthusiasm and wanted to adopt him but has grown cold to him since on discovering that he is not a calf  i have been trying to make friends with her but she is so very unresponsive  she doesnt seem to want anything but grass and prefers to get that for herself  she doesnt seem to want to be happy ever again  a funny thing happened in church  i was forgetting to tell you the st leonards occupy two pews at the opposite end from the door they were all there when we arrived with the exception of the old gentleman himself  he came in just before the dearly beloved when everybody was standing up  a running fire of suppressed titters followed him up the aisle and some of the people laughed outright i could see no reason why  he looked a dignified old gentleman in his grey hair and tightly buttoned frock coat which gives him a somewhat military appearance  but when he came level with our pew i understood  hurrying back from his morning round and with no one there to superintend him the dear old absentminded thing had forgotten to change his breeches  from a little above the knee upward he was a perfect christian but his legs were just those of a disreputable sinner  whats the joke he whispered to me as he passedi was in the corner seat  have i missed it  we called round on them after lunch and at once i was appealed to for my decision  now heres a plain sensible girl exclaimed the old gentleman the moment i entered the room  you will notice i put no comma after plain  i am taking it he did not intend one  you can employ one adjective to qualify another cant you  and i will put it to her what difference can it make to the almighty whether i go to church in trousers or in breeches  i do not see retorted mrs st leonard somewhat coldly that miss robina is in any better position than myself to speak with authority on the views of the almightywhich i felt was true  if it makes no difference to the almighty then why not for my sake trousers  the essential thing he persisted is a contrite heart  he was getting very cross  it may just as well be dressed respectably was his wifes opinion  he left the room slamming the door  i do like janie the more and more i see of her  i do hope she will let me get real chums with her  she does me so much good  i read that bit twice over to ethelbertha pretending i had lost the place i suppose it is having rather a silly mother and an unpractical father that has made her so capable  if you and little mother had been proper sort of parents i might have been quite a decent sort of girl  but its too late finding fault with you now  i suppose i must put up with you  she works so hard and is so unselfish  but she is not like some good people who make you feel it is hopeless your trying to be good  she gets cross and impatient and then she laughs at herself and gets right again that way  poor mrs st leonard  i cannot help feeling sorry for her  she would have been so happy as the wife of a really respectable city man who would have gone off every morning with a flower in his buttonhole and have worn a white waistcoat on sundays  i dont believe what they say  that husbands and wives should be the opposite of one another  mr st leonard ought to have married a brainy woman who would have discussed philosophy with him and have been just as happy drinking beer out of a teacup  you know the sort i mean  if ever i marry it will be a shorttempered man who loves music and is a good dancer and if i find out too late that hes clever ill run away from him  dick has not yet come homenearly eight oclock  veronica is supposed to be in bed but i can hear things falling  poor boy  i expect hell be tired but today is an exception  three hundred sheep have had to be brought all the way from ilsley and must be herdedi fancy it is calledbefore anybody can think of supper i saw to it that he had a good dinner  and now to come to business  young bute has been here all day and has only just left  he is coming down again on fridaywhich by the way dont forget is mrs st leonards at home day  she hopes she may then have the pleasure of making your acquaintance and thinks that possibly there may be present one or two people we may like to know  from which i gather that half the neighbourhood has been specially invited to meet you  so mind you bring a frockcoat and if little mother can put her hand easily on my pink muslin with the spotsit is either in my wardrobe or else in the bottom drawer in veronicas room if it isnt in the cardboard box underneath mothers bedyou might slip it into your bag  but whatever you do dont crush it  the sash i feel sure mother put away somewhere herself he sees no reasonim talking now about young buteif you approve his plans why work should not be commenced immediately  shall i write old slee to meet you at the house on friday  from all accounts i dont think youll do better  he is on the spot and they say he is most reasonable  but you have to get estimates dont you  he suggestsmr bute i meanthrowing what used to be the dairy into the passage which will make a hall big enough for anything  we might even give a dance in it he thinks  but all this you will be able to discuss with him on friday  he has evidently taken a great deal of pains and some of his suggestions sound sensible  but of course he must fully understand that it is what we want not what he thinks that is important  i told him you said i could have my room exactly as i liked it myself and i have explained to him my ideas he seemed at first to be under the impression that i didnt know what i was talking about so i made it quite clear to him that i did with the result that he has consented to carry out my instructions on condition that i put them down in black and whitewhich i think just as well as then there can be no excuse afterwards for argument  i like him better than i did the first time  about everything else he can be fairly amiable  it is when he talks about frontal elevations and ground plans that he irritates me  tell little mother that ill write her tomorrow  couldnt she come down with you on friday  everything will be shipshape by then and  the remainder was of a nature more private  she concluded with a postscript which also i did not read to ethelbertha  thought i had finished telling you everything when quite a stylish rattat sounded on the door  i placed an old straw hat of dicks in a prominent position called loudly to an imaginary john not to go without the letters and then opened it  he turned out to be the local reporter  i need not have been alarmed  he was much the more nervous of the two and was so full of excuses that had i not come to his rescue i believe he would have gone away forgetting what hed come for  nothing save an overwhelming sense of duty to the public with a capital p could have induced him to inflict himself upon me could i give him a few details which would enable him to set rumour right  i immediately saw visions of headlines  domestic tragedy eminent author blown up by his own daughter  once happy home now a mere wreck  it seemed to me our only plan was to enlist this amiable young man upon our side i hope i did not overdo it  my idea was to convey the impression that one glance at him had convinced me he was the best and noblest of mankind that i felt i could rely upon his wit and courage to save us from a notoriety that so far as i was concerned would sadden my whole life and that if he did so eternal gratitude and admiration would be the least i could lay at his feet i can be nice when i try  people have said so  we parted with only a pressure of the hand and i hope he wont get into trouble but i see the berkshire courier is going to be deprived of its prey  dick has just come in  he promises to talk when he has finished eating   dicks letter for which ethelbertha seemed to be strangely impatient reached us on wednesday morning  if ever you want to find out dad what hard work really means you try farming wrote dick and yet i believe you would like it hasnt some old johnny somewhere described it as the poetry of the ploughshare  why did we ever take to bothering about anything else shutting ourselves up in stuffy offices worrying ourselves to death about a lot of rubbish that isnt any good to anybody  i wish i could put it properly dad you would see just what i mean  why dont we live in simplybuilt houses and get most everything we want out of the land  which we easily could  you take a dozen poor devils away from walking behind the plough and put them down into coalmines and set them running about halfnaked among a lot of roaring furnaces and between them they turn out a machine that does the ploughing for them  what is the sense of it  of course some things are useful  i would like a motorcar and railways and steamboats are all right but it seems to me that half the fiddle faddles we fancy we want wed be just as well if not better without and there would be all that time and energy to spare for the sort of things that everybody ought to have  its everywhere just like it was at school  they kept us so hard at it studying greek roots we hadnt time to learn english grammar  look at young dennis yewbury  hes got two thousand acres up in scotland  he could lead a jolly life turning the place into some real use  instead of which he lets it all run to waste for nothing but to breed a few hundred birds that wouldnt keep a single family alive while he works from morning till night at humbugging people in a beastly hole in the city just to fill his house with a host of silly gimcracks and dress up himself and his womenfolk like peacocks  of course we would always want clever chaps like you to tell us stories and doctors we couldnt do without though i guess if we were leading sensible lives wed be able to get along with about half of them  it seems to me that what we want is a comfortable home enough to eat and drink and a few fallal sort of things to make the girls look pretty and that all the rest is rot  we would all of us have time then to think and play a bit and if we were all working fairly at something really useful and were contented with our own share thered be enough for everybody  i suppose this is all nonsense but i wish it wasnt  anyway its what i mean to do myself and im awfully much obliged to you dad for giving me this chance  youve hit the right nail on the head this time  farming was what i was meant for i feel it  i would have hated being a barrister setting people by the ears and making my living out of other peoples troubles  being a farmer you feel that in doing good to yourself you are doing good all round  miss janie agrees with all i say  i think she is one of the most sensible girls i have ever come across and robin likes her awfully  so is the old man  hes a brick  i think he has taken a liking to me and i know i have to him  hes the dearest old fellow imaginable  the very turnips he seems to think of as though they were so many rows of little children  and he makes you see the inside of things  take fields now for instance  i used to think a field was just a field you scraped it about and planted it with seeds and everything else depended on the weather  why dad its alive  there are good fields that want to get onthat are grateful for everything you do for them and take a pride in themselves  and there are brutes of fields that you feel you want to kick  you can waste a hundred pounds worth of manure on them and it only makes them more stupid than they were before  one of our fieldsa wizenedlooking eleven acre strip bordering the fyfield roadhe has christened mrs gummidge  it seems to feel everything more than any other field from whatever point of the compass the wind blows that field gets the most harm from it  you would think to look at it after a storm that there hadnt been any rain in any other fieldthat that particular field must have got it all while two days sunshine has the effect upon it that a six weeks drought would on any other field  his theory he must have a theory to account for everything it comforts him  he has just hit upon a theory that explains why twins are born with twice as much original sin as other children and doesnt seem to mind now what they do is that each odd corner of the earth has gained a character of its own from the spirits of the countless dead men buried in its bosom  robbers and thieves he will say kicking the sod of some field all stones and thistles silly fighting men who thought god built the world merely to give them the fun of knocking it about  look at them the fools stones and thistles thistles and stones  that is their notion of a field  or leaning over the gate of some field of richsmelling soil he will stretch out his arms as though to caress it  brave lads he will say kindly honest fellows who loved the poor peasant folk  i fancy he has not got much sense of humour or if he has it is a humour he leaves you to find out for yourself  one does not feel one wants to laugh listening even to his most whimsical ideas and anyhow it is a fact that of two fields quite close to one another one will be worth ten pounds an acre and the other dear at half a crown and there seems to be nothing to explain it  we have a sevenacre patch just halfway up the hill  he says he never passes it without taking off his hat to it  whatever you put in it does well while other fields try them with what you will it is always the very thing they did not want  you might fancy them fractious children always crying for the other childs bun  there is really no reason for its being such a good field except its own pluck  it faces the east and the wood for half the day hides it from the sun but it makes the best of everything and even on the greyest day it seems to be smiling at you  some happyhearted mother thinga singer of love songs the while she toiled he will have it must lie sleeping there  bythe bye what a jolly field janie would make  dont you think so dad  what the dickens dad have you done to veronica  she wanders about everywhere with an exercise book in her hand and when you say anything to her instead of answering you back she sits plump down wherever she is and writes for all shes worth  she wont say what shes up to  she says its a private matter between you and her and that later on things are going to be seen in their true light  i told her this morning what i thought of her for forgetting to feed the donkey  i was prepared of course for a hundred explanations first that she had meant to feed the donkey secondly that it wasnt her place to feed the donkey thirdly that the donkey would have been fed if circumstances over which she had no control had not arisen rendering it impossible for her to feed the donkey fourthly that the morning wasnt the proper time to feed the donkey and so on  instead of which out she whips this ridiculous book and asks me if i would mind saying it over again  i keep forgetting to ask janie what it is he has been accustomed to we have tried him with thistles and weve tried him with hay  the thistles he scratches himself against but for the hay he appears to have no use whatever  robin thinks his idea is to save us trouble we are not to get in anything especially for himwhatever we may happen to be having ourselves he will put up with  breadandbutter cut thick or a slice of cake with an apple seems to be his notion of a light lunch and for drink he fancies tea out of a slopbasin with two knobs of sugar and plenty of milk  robin says its waste of time taking his meals out to him  she says she is going to train him to come in when he hears the gong  we use the alarm clock at present for a gong  i dont know what i shall do when the cow goes away she wakes me every morning punctually at halfpast four but im in a blue funk that one of these days she will oversleep herself  it is one of those clocks you read about  you wrote something rather funny about one once yourself but i always thought you had invented it  i bought it because they said it was an extra loud one and so it is the thing thats wrong about it is that do what you will you cant get it to go off before six oclock in the morning  i set it on sunday evening for halfpast fourwe farmers do have to work i can tell you  but its worth it  i had no idea that the world was so beautiful  there is a light you never see at any other time and the whole air seems to be full of fluttering song  you feelbut you must get up and come out with me dad  i cant describe it  if it hadnt been for the good old cow lord knows what time id have been up  the clock went off at halfpast four in the afternoon just as they were sitting down to tea and frightened them all out of their skins  we have fiddled about with it all we know but theres no getting it to do anything between six pm and six am  anything you want of it in the daytime it is quite agreeable to  but it seems to have fixed its own working hours and isnt going to be bustled out of its proper rest  i got so mad with it myself i wanted to pitch it out of the window but robin thought we ought to keep it till you came that perhaps you might be able to do something with itwriting something about it she means  i said i thought alarm clocks were pretty well played out by this time but as she says there is always a new generation coming along to whom almost everything must be fresh  anyhow the confounded thing cost seven and six and seems to be no good for anything else  whatever was it that you really did say to robin about her room young bute came round to me on monday quite upset about it  he says it is going to be all windows and will look when finished like an incorrect copy of the eddystone lighthouse  he says there will be no place for the bed and if there is to be a fireplace at all it will have to be in the cupboard and that the only way so far as he can see of her getting in and out of it will be by a door through the bathroom  she said that you said she could have it entirely to her own idea and that he was just to carry out her instructions but as he points out you cant have a room in a house as if the rest of the house wasnt there even if it is your own room  nobody it seems will be able to have a bath without first talking it over with her and arranging a time mutually convenient  i told him i was sure you never meant him to do anything absurd and that his best plan would be to go straight back to her explain to her that shed been talking like a silly goathe could have put it politely of courseand that he wasnt going to pay any attention to her  you might have thought i had suggested his walking into a den of lions and pulling all their tails  i dont know what robin has done to him but he seems quite frightened of her  i had to promise that i would talk to her  hed better have done it himself  i only told her just what he said and off she went in one of her tantrums  you know her style  if she liked to live in a room where she could see to do her hair that was no business of his and if he couldnt design a plain simple bedroom that wasnt going to look ridiculous and make her the laughingstock of all the neighbourhood then the royal institute of british architects must have strange notions of the sort of person entitled to go about the country building houses that if he thought the proper place for a fire was in a cupboard she didnt that his duty was to carry out the instructions of his employers and if he imagined for a moment she was going to consent to remain shut up in her room till everybody in the house had finished bathing it would be better for us to secure the services of somebody possessed of a little commonsense that next time she met him she would certainly tell him what she thought of him also that she should certainly decline to hold any further communication with him again that she doesnt want a bedroom now of any sortperhaps she may be permitted a shakedown in the pantry or perhaps veronica will allow her an occasional nights rest with her and if not it doesnt matter youll have to talk to her yourself  im not going to say any more  dont forget that friday is the st leonards at home day  ive promised janie that you shall be there in all your best clothes dont tell her im calling her janie  it might offend her  but nobody calls her miss st leonard  everybody is coming and all the children are having their hair washed  you will have it all your own way down here  theres no other celebrity till you get to boss croker the tammany man the other side of ilsley downs  artists they dont count  the rumour was all round the place last week that you were here incognito in the person of a dismallooking johnny staying at the fishermans retreat who used to sit all day in a punt up the backwater drinking whisky  it made me rather mad when i saw him  i suppose it was the whisky that suggested the idea to them  they have got the notion in these parts that a literary man is a sort of inspired tramp  a mrs jaggerswadeor some such name whom i met here on sunday and who is coming on friday took me aside and asked me what sort of things you said when you talked  she said she felt sure it would be so clever and herself she was looking forward to it but would iquite between ourselvesadvise her to bring the children  i say you will have to talk seriously to veronica  country life seems to agree with her  shes taken to poaching alreadyshe and the twins  it was the one sin that hitherto they had never committed and i fancy the old man was feeling proud of this luckily i caught them coming homewith ten dead rabbits strung on a pole the twins carrying it between them on their shoulders suggesting the picture of the spies returning from the promised land with that bunch of grapesveronica scouting on ahead with every ten yards her ear to the ground listening for hostile footsteps  the thing that troubled her most was that she hadnt heard me coming she seemed to fear that something had gone wrong with the laws of nature they had found the whole collection hanging from a tree and had persuaded themselves that providence must have been expecting them i insisted on their going back with me and showing me the tree much to their disgust  and fortunately the keeper wasnt aboutthey are men that love making a row  i talked some fine moral sentiment to her  but she says you have told her that it doesnt matter whether you are good or bad things happen to you just the same and this being so she feels she may as well enjoy herself  i asked her why she never seemed able to enjoy herself being goodi believe if  id always had a kid to bring up id have been a model chap myself by this time  her answer was that she supposed she was born bad  i pointed out to her that was a reflection on you and little mother and she answered she guessed she must be a throwback  old slees got a dog that ought to have been a foxterrier but isnt and he seems to have been explaining things to her  a thing that will trouble you down here dad is the cruelty of the country  they catch these poor little wretches in traps leaving them sometimes for days suffering what must be to them nothing short of agonyto say nothing of the terror and the hunger  i tried putting my finger in one of the beastly things and keeping it there for just two minutes by my watch  it seemed like twenty  the pain grows more intense with every second and im not a soft as you know  ive lain half an hour with a broken leg and that wasnt as bad  one hears the little creatures screaming but cannot find them of course when one draws near they keep silent  it makes one quite dislike country people  they are so callous  when you speak to them about it they only grin  janie goes nearly mad about it  mr st leonard tried to get the clergyman to say something on the subject but he answered that he thought it better for the church to confine herself to the accomplishment of her own great mission  ass  bring little mother down we want to show her off on friday  and make her put on something pretty  ask her if shes got that lilac thing with lace she wore at cambridge for the may week the year before last  tell her not to be silly it wasnt a bit too young nash said she looked like something out of an old picture and hes going to be an artist  dont let her dress herself  she doesnt understand it  and will you get me a gun  the remainder of the letter was taken up with instructions concerning the gun  it seemed a complicated sort of gun  i wished i hadnt read about the gun to ethelbertha  it made her nervous for the rest of the day   veronicas letter followed on thursday morning  i read it going down in the train  in transcribing i have thought it better as regards the spelling to adopt the more conventional forms   you will be pleased to hear veronica wrote that we are all quite well  robin works very hard  but i think it does her good  and of course i help her  all i can  i am glad she has got a boy  to do the washingup  i think that was too much for her  it used to make her cross  one cannot blame her  it is trying work  and it makes you mucky  he is a good boy  but has been neglected  so doesnt know much  i am teaching him grammar  he says you was and her be  but is getting better  he says he went to school  but they couldnt have taken any trouble with him  could they  the system i suppose was rotten  robina says i mustnt overdo it  because you want him to talk berkshire  so i propose confining our attention to the elementary rules  he had never heard of robinson crusoe  what a life  we went to church on sunday  i could not find my gloves  and robina was waxy  but mr st leonard came without his trousers which was worse  we found them in the evening  the little boy that blew up our stove was there with his mother  but i didnt speak to her  hes got a doom  thats what made him blow it up  he couldnt help it  so you see it wasnt my fault  after all  his grandfather was blown up  and hes going to be blown up again  later on  but he is very brave  and is going to make a will  i like all the st leonards very much  we went there to tea on sunday  and mr st leonard said i was bright  i think miss janie very beautiful  and so does dick  she makes me think of angels  so she does dick  and he says she is so kind to her little brothers and sisters  it is a good sign  i think she ought to marry dick  it would steady him he works very hard  but i think it does him good  we have breakfast at seven  and i lay the table  it is very beautiful in the morning when you are once up  mrs st leonard has twins  they are a great anxiety to her  but she would not part from them  she has had much trouble  and is sometimes very sad  i like the girl best  her name is winnie  she is more like a boy  his name is wilfrid  but sometimes they change clothes  then youre done  they are only nearly seven  but they know a lot  they are going to teach me swimming  is it not kind of them  the two older boys are at home for their holidays  but they give themselves a lot of airs  and they called me a flapper  i told him hed be sorry  when he was a man  because perhaps id grow up beautiful  and then hed fall in love with me  but he said he wouldnt  so i let him see what i thought of him  the little girl is very nice  she is about my own age  her name is sally  we are going to write a play  but we shant let bertie act in it  unless he turns over a new leaf  im going to be a princess that doesnt know it  but only feels it  and shes going to be a wicked witch  what wants me to marry her son whats a sight  but i wont because id rather die first  and am in love with a swineherd  that is a genius  only nobody suspects it  i wear a crown in the last act  and everybody rejoices  except her  i think it will be good  we have nearly finished the first act  she writes very well  and has a sense of atmosphere  and i tell her what to say  miss janie is going to make me a dress with a train  and gold spangles  and robina is going to lend me her blue necklace  anything will do of course for the old witch  so it wont be much trouble to anyone  mr bute is going to paint us some scenery  and we are going to invite everybody  he is very nice robina says he thinks too much of himself  by a long chalk  but she is very critical where men are concerned  she admits it  she says she cant help it  i find him very affable  and so does dick  we think robina will get over it  and he has promised not to be angry with her  because i have told him that she does not mean it  it is only her way  she says she feels it is unjust of her  because really he is rather charming  i told him that  and he said i was a dear little girl  he is going to get me a real crown  robina says he has nice eyes  i told him that  and he laughed  there is a gentleman comes here that i think is in love with robina  but i shouldnt say anything to her about it  if i was you  she is very snappy about it  he is not handsome  but he looks good  he writes for the papers  but i dont think he is rich  and robina is very nice to him  until hes gone  then she gets mad  it all began with the explosion  so perhaps it was fate  he is going to keep it out of the papers  as much as he can  but of course he owes a duty to the public  i am going to decline to see him  i think it better mr slee says everything will be in applepie order tomorrow  so you can come down  and we are going to have irish stew  and roly poly pudding  it will be a change  he is very nice  and says he was always in trouble himself when he was a little boy  its all experience  we are all going on friday to a party at mr st leonards  and you have got to come too  robina says i can wear my new frock  but we cant find the sash  it is very strange  because i remember having seen it  you didnt take it for anything did you we shall have to get a new one i suppose  it is very annoying  my new shoes have also not worn well  and they ought to have  because robina says they were expensive  the donkey has come  and he is sweet  he eats out of my hand  and lets me kiss him  but he wont go  he goes a little when you shout at him  very loud  me and robina went for a drive yesterday after tea  and dick ran beside and shouted  but he got hoarse  and then he wouldnt go no more and robina did not like it  because dick shouted swear words  he says they come naturally to you when you shout  and robina said it was horrible  and that people would hear him  so we got out  and pushed him home  but he is very strong  and we were all very tired and robina says she hates him  dick is going to give mr opkins half a crown  to tell him how he makes him go  because mr opkins makes him gallop  robina says it must be hypnotism  but dick thinks it might be something simpler  i think mr opkins very nice  he says you promised to lend him a book  what would help him to talk like a real country boy  so i have lent him a book about a window by mr bane  what came to see us last year  it has a lot of funny words in it  and he is going to learn them up  but he dont know what they mean  no more do i  i have written a lot of the book  it promises to be very interesting  it is all a dream  he is just the ordinary grownup father  neither better nor worse  and he goes up and up  it is a pleasant sensation  till he reaches the moon  and there everything is different  it is the children that know everything  and are always right  and the grownups have to do all what they tell them  they are kind but firm  it is very good for him  and when he wakes up he is a better man  i put down everything that occurs to me  like you suggested  there is quite a lot of it and it makes you see how unjustly children are treated  they said i was to feed the donkey  because it was my donkey  and i fed him and there wasnt enough supper for dick  and dick said i was an idiot  and robina said i wasnt to feed him  and in the morning there wasnt anything to feed him on  because he wont eat anything but breadandbutter  and the baker hadnt come  and he wasnt there  because the man that comes to milk the cow had left the door open  and i was distracted  and dick asked had i fed him  and of course i hadnt fed him  and lord how dick talked  never waited to hear anything mind you  i let him talk  but it just shows you  we are all very happy  but shall be pleased to see you  once again the peppermint creams down here are not good  and are very dear compared with london prices  isnt this a good letter  you said i was to always write just as i thought  so im doing it  i think thats all  i read selections from this letter aloud to ethelbertha  she said she was glad she had decided to come down with me    chapter ix    had all things gone as ordered our arrival at the st leonards on friday afternoon would have been imposing  it was our entrance so to speak upon the local stage and robina had decided it was a case where small economies ought not to be considered  the livery stable proprietor had suggested a brougham but that would have necessitated one of us riding outside  i explained to robina that in the country this was usual and robina had replied that much depended upon first impressions  dick would in all probability claim the place for himself and the moment we were started stick a pipe in his mouth  she selected an open landau of quite an extraordinary size painted yellow  it looked to me an object more appropriate to a lord mayors show than to the requirements of a christian family but robina seemed touchy on the subject and i said no more  it certainly was roomy  old glossop had turned it out well with a pair of greysseventeen hands i judged them  the only thing that seemed wrong was the coachman  i cant explain why but he struck me as the class of youth one associates with a milkcart  we set out at a gentle trot  veronica who had been in trouble most of the morning sat stiffly on the extreme edge of her seat clothed in the attitude of one dead to the world dick in lavender gloves that robina had thoughtfully bought for him next to her ethelbertha robina and myself sat perched on the back seat to have leaned back would have been to lie down  ethelbertha having made up her mind she was going to dislike the whole family of the st leonards seemed disinclined for conversation  myself i had forgotten my cigarcase  i have tried the st leonard cigar  he does not smoke himself but keeps a box for his friends  he tells me he fancies men are smoking cigars less than formerly  i did not see how i was going to get a smoke for the next three hours  nothing annoys me more than being bustled and made to forget things  robina who has recently changed her views on the subject of freckles shared a parasol with her mother  they had to hold it almost horizontally in front of them and this obscured their view  i could not myself understand why people smiled as we went by  apart from the carriage which they must have seen before we were not i should have said an exhilarating spectacle  a party of cyclists laughed outright robina said there was one thing we should have to be careful about living in the country and that was that the strong air and the loneliness combined didnt sap our intellect  she said she had noticed itthe tendency of country people to become prematurely silly  i did not share her fears as i had by this time divined what it was that was amusing folks  dick had discovered behind the cushionsremnant of some recent wedding one supposesa large and tastefully bound book of common prayer  he and veronica sat holding it between them  looking at their faces one could almost hear the organ pealing  dick kept one eye on the parasol and when on passing into shade it was lowered he and veronica were watching with rapt ecstasy the flight of swallows  robina said she should tell mr glossop of the insults to which respectable people were subject when riding in his carriage  she thought he ought to take steps to prevent it  she likewise suggested that the four of us leaving the little mother in the carriage should walk up the hill  ethelbertha said that she herself would like a walk  she had been balancing herself on the edge of a cushion with her feet dangling for two miles and was tired  she herself would have preferred a carriage made for ordinarysized people  our coachman called attention to the heat of the afternoon and the length of the hill and recommended our remaining where we were but his advice was dismissed as exhibiting want of feeling  robina is perhaps a trifle oversympathetic where animals are concerned  i remember when they were children her banging dick over the head with the nursery bellows because he would not agree to talk in a whisper for fear of waking the cat  you can of course overdo kindness to animals but it is a fault on the right side and as a rule i do not discourage her  veronica was allowed to remain owing to her bad knee  it is a most unfortunate affliction  it comes on quite suddenly  there is nothing to be seen but the childs face while she is suffering from it would move a heart of stone  it had been troubling her so it appeared all the morning but she had said nothing not wishing to alarm her mother ethelbertha who thinks it may be hereditaryshe herself having had an aunt who had suffered from contracted ligamentfixed her up as comfortably as the pain would permit with cushions in the centre of the back seat and the rest of us toiled after the carriage  i should not like to say for certain that horses have a sense of humour but i sometimes think they must  i had a horse years ago who used to take delight in teasing girls  i can describe it no other way  he would pick out a girl a quarter of a mile off always some haughty welldressed girl who was feeling pleased with herself  as we approached he would eye her with horror and astonishment  it was too marked to escape notice  a hundred yards off he would be walking sideways backing away from her i would see the poor lady growing scarlet with the insult and annoyance of it  opposite to her he would shy the entire width of the road and make pretence to bolt looking back i would see her vainly appealing to surrounding nature for a lookingglass to see what it was that had gone wrong with her  what is the matter with me she would be crying to herself that the very beasts of the field should shun me  do they take me for a gollywog  halfway up the hill the offside grey turned his head and looked at us  we were about a couple of hundred yards behind it was a hot and dusty day  he whispered to the nearside grey and the nearside grey turned and looked at us also  i knew what was coming  ive been played the same trick before  i shouted to the boy but it was too late  they took the rest of the hill at a gallop and disappeared over the brow  had there been an experienced coachman behind them i should not have worried  dick told his mother not to be alarmed and started off at fifteen miles an hour  i calculated i was doing about ten which for a gentleman past his first youth in a frock suit designed to disguise rather than give play to the figure i consider creditable  robina undecided whether to go on ahead with dick or remain to assist her mother wasted vigour by running from one to the other  ethelberthas one hope was that she might reach the wreckage in time to receive veronicas last wishes  it was in this order that we arrived at the st leonards  veronica under an awning sipping iced sherbet appeared to be the centre of the party  she was recounting her experiences with a modesty that had already won all hearts  the rest of us she had explained had preferred walking and would arrive later  she was evidently pleased to see me and volunteered the information that the greys to all seeming had enjoyed their gallop  i sent dick back to break the good news to his mother  young bute said he would go too  he said he was fresher than dick and would get there first  as a matter of history he did and was immediately sorry that he had  this is not a wellordered world or it would not be our good deeds that would so often get us into trouble  robinas insistence on our walking up the hill had been prompted by tender feeling for dumb animals  a virtuous emotion that surely the angels should have blessed  the result had been to bring down upon her suffering and reproach  it is not often that ethelbertha loses her temper  when she does she makes use of the occasion to perform what one might describe as a mental springcleaning  all loose odds and ends of temper that may be lying about in her mindany scrap of indignation that has been reposing peacefully half forgotten in a corner of her brain she ferrets out and brushes into the general heap  small annoyances of the year before lastlittle things she hadnt noticed at the timeincidents in your past life that so far as you are concerned present themselves as dim visions connected maybe with some previous existence she whisks triumphantly into her pan  the method has its advantages  it leaves her swept and garnished without a scrap of illfeeling towards any living soul  for quite a long period after one of these explosions it is impossible to get a cross word out of her  one has to wait sometimes for months  but while the clearing up is in progress the atmosphere round about is disturbing  the element of the whole thing is its comprehensive swiftness  before they had reached the summit of the hill robina had acquired a tolerably complete idea of all she had done wrong since christmas twelvemonth  the present afternoons proceedings including as they did the almost certain sacrificing of a sister to a violent death together with the probable destruction of a father no longer of an age to trifle with apoplexybeing but a fit and proper complement to what had gone before  it would be long as robina herself that evening bitterly declared before she would again give ear to the promptings of her better nature  to take next the sad case of archibald bute  his sole desire had been to relieve at the earliest moment possible the anxieties of a sister and a mother  robinas new hat not intended for sport had broken away from its fastenings  with it it had brought down her hair  there is a harmless contrivance for building up the female hair called i am told a pad  it can be made of combings and then of course is literally the girls own hair  he came upon robina at the moment when retracing her steps and with her back towards him she was looking for it  with his usual luck he was the first to find it  ethelbertha thanked him for his information concerning veronica but seemed chiefly anxious to push on and convince herself that it was true  she took dicks arm and left robina to follow on with bute  as i explained to him afterwards had he stopped to ask my advice i should have counselled his leaving the job to dick who after all was only thirty seconds behind him  as regarded himself i should have suggested his taking a walk in the opposite direction returning say in half an hour and pretending to have just arrived by that time robina with the assistance of janies brush and comb and possibly her powderpuff would have been feeling herself again he could have listened sympathetically to an account of the affair from robina herselfher version in which she would have appeared to advantage  give her time and she has a sense of humour  she would have made it bright and whimsical  without asserting it in so many words she would have conveyed the impressioni know her waythat she alone throughout the whole commotion had remained calm and helpful  dear old dick and poor dear papai can hear her saying itwould have supplied the low comedy and veronica alluded to with affection free from sentimentality would have furnished the dramatic interest  it is not that robina intends to mislead but she has the artistic instinct  it would have made quite a charming story robina always the central figure  she would have enjoyed telling it and would have been pleased with the person listening  all thiswhich would have been the reward of subterfugehe had missed  virtuous intention had gained for him nothing but a few scattered observations from robina concerning himself the probable object of his creator in fashioning himhis relation to the scheme of things in general observations all of which he had felt to be unjust  we compared experiences over a pipe that same evening and he told me of a friend of his a law student who had shared diggings with him in edinburgh  a kinderhearted young man bute felt sure could never have breathed nor one with a tenderer more chivalrous regard for women and the misery this brought him to say nothing of the irritation caused to quite a number of respectable people could hardly be imagined so young bute assured me by anyone not personally acquainted with the parties  it was the plain and snappy girl and the less attractive type of old maid for whom he felt the most sorrow  he could not help thinking of all they had missed and were likely to go on missing the rapturesurely the womans birthrightof feeling herself adored anyhow once in her life the delight of seeing the lovers eye light up at her coming  had he been a mormon he would have married them all  they toothe neglected that none had invited to the feast of lovethey also should know the joys of home feel the sweet comfort of a husbands arm  being a christian his power for good was limited  but at least he could lift from them the despairing conviction that they were outside the pale of masculine affection  not one of them so far as he could help it but should be able to say  ieven i had a lover once  no dear we never married  it was one of those spiritual loves a formal engagement with a ring would have spoiled itcoarsened it  no it was just a beautiful thing that came into my life and passed away again leaving behind it a fragrance that has sweetened all my days  that is how he imagined they would talk about it years afterwards to the little niece or nephew asking artless questionshow they would feel about it themselves  whether law circles are peculiarly rich in unattractive spinsters or whether it merely happened to be an exceptional season for them bute could not say but certain it was that the number of sourfaced girls and fretful old maids in excess of the demand seemed to be greater than usual that winter in edinburgh with the result that young hapgood had a busy time of it he made love to them not obtrusively which might have laid them open to ridiculemany of them were old enough to have been his motherbut more by insinuation by subtle suggestion  his feelings so they gathered were too deep for words but the adoring eyes with which he would follow their every movement the rapt ecstasy with which he would drink in their lightest remark about the weather the tone of almost reverential awe with which he would enquire of them concerning their lesser ailmentsall conveyed to their sympathetic observation the message that he dared not tell  he had no favourites  sufficient it was that a woman should be unpleasant for him to pour out at her feet the simulated passion of a lifetime  he sent them presentsnothing expensivewrapped in pleasing pretence of anonymity valentines carefully selected for their compromising character  one carrotyheaded old maid with warts he had kissed upon the brow  all this he did out of his great pity for them  it was a beautiful idea but it worked badly  they did not understandnever got the hang of the thing  not one of them  they thought he was really gone on them  for a time his elusiveness his backwardness in coming to the point they attributed to a fit and proper fear of his fate but as the months went by the feeling of each one was that he was carrying the apprehension of his own unworthiness too far  they gave him encouragement provided for him openings till the wonder grew upon them how any woman ever did get married  at the end of their resources they consulted bosom friends  in several instances the bosom friend turned out to be the bosom friend of more than one of them  the bosom friends began to take a hand in it  some of them came to him with quite a little list insistingplayfully at first on his making up his mind what he was going to take and what he was going to leave offering as reward for prompt decision to make things as easy for him as possible with the remainder of the column  it was then he saw that his good intentions were likely to end in catastrophe  he would not tell the truth  that the whole scheme had been conceived out of charity towards all illconstructed or dilapidated ladies that personally he didnt care a hang for any of them had only taken them on vulgarly speaking to give them a treat and because nobody else would  that wasnt going to be a golden memory colouring their otherwise drab existence  he explained that it was not lovenot the love that alone would justify a mans asking of a woman that she should give herself to him for lifethat he felt and always should feel for them but merely admiration and deep esteem and seventeen of them thought that would be sufficient to start with and offered to chance the rest  the truth had to come out  friends who knew his noble nature could not sit by and hear him denounced as a heartless and eccentric profligate  ladies whose beauty and popularity were beyond dispute thought it a touching and tender thing for him to have done but every woman to whom he had ever addressed a kind word wanted to wring his neck  he did the most sensible thing he could under all the circumstances changed his address to aberdeen where he had an aunt living  but the story followed him  no woman would be seen speaking to him  one admiring glance from hapgood would send the prettiest girls home weeping to their mothers  later on he fell in lovehopelessly madly in love  but he dared not tell herdared not let a living soul guess it  that was the only way he could show it  it is not sufficient in this world to want to do good theres got to be a knack about it  there was a man i met in colorado one christmastime  i was on a lecturing tour  his idea was to send a loving greeting to his wife in new york  he had been married nineteen years and this was the first time he had been separated from his family on christmas day he pictured them round the table in the little faraway new england parlour his wife his sisterinlaw uncle silas cousin jane jack and willy and goldenhaired lena  they would be just sitting down to dinner talking about him most likely wishing he were among them  they were a nice family and all fond of him  what joy it would give them to know that he was safe and sound to hear the very tones of his loved voice speaking to them  modern science has made possible these miracles  true the longdistance telephone would cost him five dollars but what is five dollars weighed against the privilege of wafting happiness to an entire family on christmas day we had just come back from a walk  he slammed the money down and laughed aloud at the thought of the surprise he was about to give them all  the telephone bell rang out clear and distinct at the precise moment when his wife with knife and fork in hand was preparing to carve the turkey  she was a nervous lady and twice that week had dreamed that she had seen her husband without being able to get to him  on the first occasion she had seen him enter a drygoods store in broadway and hastening across the road had followed him in  he was hardly a dozen yards in front of her but before she could overtake him all the young lady assistants had rushed from behind their counters and forming a circle round her had refused to let her pass which in her dream had irritated her considerably  on the next occasion he had boarded a brooklyn car in which she was returning home  she had tried to attract his attention with her umbrella but he did not seem to see her and every time she rose to go across to him the car gave a jerk and bumped her back into her seat  when she did get over to him it was not her husband at all but the gentleman out of the quaker oats advertisement  she went to the telephone feelingas she said herself afterwardsall of a tremble  that you could speak from colorado to new york she would not then have believed had you told her  the thing was in its early stages which may also have accounted for the voice reaching her strange and broken  i was standing beside him while he spoke  we were in the vestibule of the savoy hotel at colorado springs  it was five oclock in the afternoon which would be about seven in new york  he told her he was safe and well and that she was not to fret about him  he told her he had been that morning for a walk in the garden of the gods which is the name given to the local park they do that sort of thing in colorado  also that he had drunk from the silicial springs abounding in that favoured land  i am not sure that silicial was the correct word  he was not sure himself  added to which he pronounced it badly  whatever they were he assured her they had done him good  he sent a special message to his cousin janea maiden lady of meansto the effect that she could rely upon seeing him soon  she was a touchy old lady and liked to be singled out for special attention  he made the usual kind enquiries about everybody sent them all his blessing and only wished they could be with him in this delectable land where it seemed to be always sunshine and balmy breezes  he could have said more but his time being up the telephone people switched him off and feeling he had done a good and thoughtful deed he suggested a game of billiards  could he have been a witness of events at the other end of the wire his condition would have been one of less selfcomplacence  long before the end of the first sentence his wife had come to the conclusion that this was a message from the dead  why through a telephone did not greatly worry her  it seemed as reasonable a medium as any other she had ever heard ofindeed a trifle more so later when she was able to review the matter calmly it afforded her some consolation to reflect that things might have been worse  that garden together with the silicial springswhich she took to be celestial there was not much difference the way he pronounced it was distinctly reassuring  the eternal sunshine and the balmy breezes likewise agreed with her knowledge of heavenly topography as derived from the congregational hymnbook  that he should have needed to enquire concerning the health of herself and the children had puzzled her  the only explanation was that they didnt know everything not even up  theremay be not the newcomers  she had answered as coherently as her state of distraction would permit and had then dropped limply to the floor  it was the sound of her falling against the umbrellastand and upsetting it that brought them all trooping out from the diningroom  it took her some time to get the thing home to them and when she had finished her brother silas acting on the impulse of the moment rang up the exchange with some vague idea of getting into communication with st peter and obtaining further particulars but recollected himself in time to explain to the hulloa girl that he had made a mistake  the eldest boy a practical youth pointed out very sensibly that nothing could be gained by their not going on with their dinner but was bitterly reproached for being able to think of any form of enjoyment at a moment when his poor dear father was in heaven  it reminded his mother of the special message to cousin jane who up to that moment had been playing the part of comforter  with the collapse of cousin jane dramatic in its suddenness conversation disappeared  at nine oclock the entire family went dinnerless to bed  the eldest boyas i have said a practical youthhad the sense to get up early the next morning and send a wire which brought the glad news back to them that their beloved one was not in heaven but was still in colorado  but the only reward my friend got for all his tender thoughtfulness was the vehement injunction never for the remainder of his life to play such a fools trick again  there were other cases i could have recited showing the ill recompense that so often overtakes the virtuous action but as i explained to bute it would have saddened me to dwell upon the theme  it was quite a large party assembled at the st leonards including one or two county people and i should have liked myself to have made a better entrance  a large lady with a very small voice seemed to be under the impression that i had arranged the whole business on purpose  she said it was so dramatic  one good thing came out of it  janie in her quiet quick way saw to it that ethelbertha and robina slipped into the house unnoticed by way of the dairy  when they joined the other guests half an hour later they had had a cup of tea and a rest and were feeling calm and cool with their hair nicely done and ethelbertha remarked to robina on the way home what a comfort it must be to mrs st leonard to have a daughter so capable one who knew just the right thing to do and did it without making a fuss and a disturbance  everyone was very nice  of course we made the usual mistake  they talked to me about books and plays and i gave them my views on agriculture and cubhunting  im not quite sure what fool it was who described a bore as a man who talked about himself  as a matter of fact it is the only subject the average man knows sufficiently well to make interesting  theres a man i know he makes a fortune out of a patent food for infants  he began life as a dairy farmer and hit upon it quite by accident  when he talks about the humours of company promoting and the tricks of the advertising agent he is amusing  i have sat at his table when he was a bachelor and listened to him by the hour with enjoyment  the mistake he made was marrying a broadminded cultured woman who ruined him conversationally i mean  he is now wellinformed and tiresome on most topics  that is why actors and actresses are always such delightful company  they are not ashamed to talk about themselves i remember a dinnerparty once  our host was one of the bestknown barristers in london  a famous lady novelist sat on his right and a scientist of worldwide reputation had the place of honour next our hostess who herself had written a history of the struggle for nationality in south america that serves as an authority to all the foreign offices in europe  among the remaining guests were a bishop the editorinchief of a london daily newspaper a man who knew the interior of china as well as most men know their own club a russian revolutionist just escaped from siberia a leading dramatist a cabinet minister and a poet whose name is a household word wherever the english tongue is spoken  and for two hours we sat and listened to a wickedlooking little woman who from the boards of a bowery musichall had worked her way up to the position of a star in musical comedy  education as she observed herself without regret had not been compulsory throughout the waterside district of chicago in her young days and compelled to earn her own living from the age of thirteen opportunity for supplying the original deficiency had been wanting  but she knew her subject which was herselfher experiences her reminiscences  and bad sense enough to stick to it until the moment when she took the liberty of chipping in to use her own expression the amount of twaddle talked had been appalling the bishop had told us all he had learnt about china during a visit to san francisco while the man who had spent the last twenty years of his life in the country was busy explaining his views on the subject of the english drama  our hostess had been endeavouring to make the scientist feel at home by talking to him about radium  the dramatist had explained at some length his views of the crisis in russia  the poet had quite spoilt his dinner trying to suggest to the cabinet minister new sources of taxation  the russian revolutionist had told us what ought to have been a funny story about a duck and the lady novelist and the cabinet minister had discussed christian science for a quarter of an hour each under the mistaken impression that the other one was a believer in it  the editor had been explaining the attitude of the church towards the new theology and our host one of the wittiest men at the bar had been talking chiefly to the butler  the relief of listening to anybody talking about something they knew was like finding a matchbox to a man who has been barking his shins in the dark  for the rest of the dinner we clung to her  i could have made myself quite interesting to these good squires and farmers talking to them about theatres and the literary celebrities i have met and they could have told me dog stories and given me useful information as to the working of the small holdings act  they said some very charming things about my booksmostly to the effect that they read and enjoyed them when feeling ill or suffering from mental collapse  i gathered that had they always continued in a healthy state of mind and body it would not have occurred to them to read me one man assured me i had saved his life  it was his brain he told me  he had been so upset by something that had happened to him that he had almost lost his reason  there were times when he could not even remember his own name his mind seemed an absolute blank  and then one day by chanceor providence or whatever you choose to call ithe had taken up a book of mine  it was the only thing he had been able to read for months and months  and now whenever he felt himself run downhis brain like a squeezed orange that was his similehe would put everything else aside and read a book of mine any one  it didnt matter which  i suppose one ought to be glad that one has saved somebodys life but i should like to have the choosing of them myself  i am not sure that ethelbertha is going to like mrs st leonard and i dont think mrs st leonard will much like ethelbertha  i have gathered that mrs st leonard doesnt like anybody muchexcept of course when it is her duty  she does not seem to have the time man is born to trouble and it is not bad philosophy to get oneself accustomed to the feeling  but mrs st leonard has given herself up to the pursuit of trouble to the exclusion of all other interests in life  she appears to regard it as the only calling worthy a christian woman  i found her alone one afternoon  her manner was preoccupied i asked if i could be of any assistance  no she answered i am merely trying to think what it can be that has been worrying me all the morning  it has clean gone out of my head  she remembered it a little later with a glad sigh  st leonard himself ethelbertha thinks charming  we are to go again on sunday for her to see the children  three or four people we met i fancy we shall be able to fit in with  we left at halfpast six and took bute back with us to supper    chapter x    shes a good woman said robina  whos a good woman i asked  hes trying i expect although he is an old dear  to live with i mean continued robina addressing apparently the rising moon  and then there are all those children  you are thinking of mrs st leonard i suggested  there seems no way of making her happy explained robina  on thursday i went round early in the morning to help janie pack the baskets for the picnic  it was her own idea the picnic  speaking of picnics i said  you might have thought went on robina that she was dressing for her own funeral  she said she knew she was going to catch her death of cold sitting on the wet grass  something told her  i reminded her it hadnt rained for three weeks and that everything was as dry as a bone but she said that made no difference to grass  there is always a moisture in grass and that cushions and all that only helped to draw it out  not that it mattered  the end had to come and so long as the others were happyyou know her style  nobody ever thought of her  she was to be dragged here dragged there  she talked about herself as if she were some sacred image  it got upon my nerves at last so that i persuaded janie to let me offer to stop at home with her  i wasnt too keen about going myself not by that time  when our desires leave us says rochefoucauld i remarked we pride ourselves upon our virtue in having overcome them  well it was her fault anyhow retorted robina and i didnt make a virtue of it  i told her id just as soon not go and that i felt sure the others would be all right without her so that there was no need for her to be dragged anywhere  and then she burst into tears  she said i suggested that it was hard on her to have children who could wish to go to a picnic and leave their mother at home that it was little enough enjoyment she had in her life heaven knows that if there was one thing she had been looking forward to it was this days outing but still of course if everybody would be happier without her  something of the sort admitted robina only there was a lot of it  we had to all fuss round her and swear that without her it wouldnt be worth calling a picnic  she brightened up on the way home  the screechowl in the yewtree emitted a bloodcurdling scream  he perches there each evening on the extreme end of the longest bough dimly outlined against the night he has the appearance of a friendly hobgoblin  but i wish he didnt fancy himself as a vocalist  it is against his own interests i am sure if he only knew it  that american college yell of his must have the effect of sending every living thing within half a mile back into its hole  maybe it is a provision of nature for clearing off the very old mice who have become stone deaf and would otherwise be a burden on their relatives the others unless out for suicide must one thinks be tolerably safe  ethelbertha is persuaded he is a sign of death but seeing there isnt a square quarter of a mile in this county without its screechowl there can hardly by this time be a resident that an assurance society would look at  veronica likes him  she even likes his screech  i found her under the tree the other night wrapped up in a shawl trying to learn it  as if one of them were not enough it made me quite cross with her  besides it wasnt a bit like it as i told her  she said it was better than i could do anyhow and i was idiot enough to take up the challenge  it makes me angry now when i think of it  a respectable middleaged literary man standing under a yewtree trying to screech like an owl  and the bird was silly enough to encourage us  she was a charming girl i said sevenandtwenty years ago when st leonard fell in love with her  she had those dark dreamy eyes so suggestive of veiled mysteries and her lips must have looked bewitching when they pouted  i expect they often did  they do so still but the pout of a woman of fortysix no longer fascinates  to a pretty girl of nineteen a spice of temper an illogical unreasonableness are added attractions  the scratch of a blueeyed kitten only tempts us to tease her the more  young hubert st leonardhe had curly brown hair with a pretty trick of blushing and was going to conquer the worldfound her fretfulness her very selfishness adorable  and told her so kneeling before her gazing into her bewildering eyesonly he called it her waywardness her imperiousness begged her for his sake to be more capricious  told her how beautiful she looked when displeased  so no doubt she did at nineteen  he didnt tell you all that did he demanded robina  not a word i reassured her except that she was acknowledged by all authorities to have been the most beautiful girl in tunbridge wells and that her father had been ruined by a rascally solicitor no i was merely to use the phrase of the french police courts reconstructing the crime  it may be all wrong grumbled robina  it may be i agreed  but why  does it strike you as improbable  we were sitting in the porch waiting for dick to come by the white path across the field  no answered robina  it all sounds very probable  i wish it didnt  you must remember i continued that i am an old playgoer  i have sat out so many of this worlds dramas  it is as easy to reconstruct them backwards as forwards  we are witnessing the last act of the st leonard drama  that unsatisfactory last act that merely fills out time after the play is ended  the intermediate acts were probably more exciting containing passionate scenes played with much earnestness chiefly for the amusement of the servants  but the first act with the kentish lanes and woods for a backcloth must have been charming  here was the devout lover she had heard of dreamed of  it is delightful to be regarded as perfectionnot absolute perfection for that might put a strain upon us to live up to but as so near perfection that to be more perfect would just spoil it  the spots upon us that unappreciative friends and relations would magnify into blemishes seen in their true light artistic shading relieving a faultlessness that might otherwise prove too glaring  dear hubert found her excellent just as she was in every detail  it would have been a crime against love for her to seek to change herself  well then it was his fault argued robina  if he was silly enough to like her faults and encourage her in them  what could he have done i asked even if he had seen them  a lover does not point out his mistresss shortcomings to her  much the more sensible plan if he did insisted robina  then if she cared for him she could set to work to cure herself  you would like it i said you would appreciate it in your own case  can you imagine young bute  why young bute demanded robina whats he got to do with it  nothing i answered except that he happens to be the first male creature you have ever come across since you were six that you havent flirted with  i dont flirt with them said robina i merely try to be nice to them  with the exception of young bute i persisted  he irritates me robina explained  i was reading i said the other day an account of the marriage customs prevailing among the lower caucasians  the lover takes his stand beneath his ladys window and having attracted her attention proceeds to sing  and if she seems to like itif she listens to it without getting mad that means she doesnt want him  but if she gets upset about itslams down the window and walks away then its all right  i think its the lower caucasians  must be a very silly people said robina i suppose a pail of water would be the highest proof of her affection he could hope for  a complex being man i agreed  we will call him x  can you imagine young x coming to you and saying  my dear robina you have many excellent qualities  you can be amiableso long as you are having your own way in everything but thwarted you can be just horrid  you are very kindto those who are willing for you to be kind to them in your own way which is not always their way  you can be quite unselfishwhen you happen to be in an unselfish mood which is far from frequent  you are capable and clever but like most capable and clever people impatient and domineering highly energetic when not feeling lazy ready to forgive the moment your temper is exhausted  you are generous and frank but if your object could only be gained through meanness or deceit you would not hesitate a moment longer than was necessary to convince yourself that the circumstances justified the means  you are sympathetic tender hearted and have a fine sense of justice but i can see that tongue of yours if not carefully watched wearing decidedly shrewish  you have any amount of grit  a man might go tigerhunting with youwith no one better but you are obstinate conceited and exacting  in short to sum you up you have all the makings in you of an ideal wife combined with faults sufficient to make a socrates regret hed ever married you  yes i would said robina springing to her feet  i could not see her face but i knew there was the look upon it that made primgate want to paint her as joan of arc only it would never stop long enough  id love him for talking like that  and id respect him if he was that sort of man id pray god to help me to be the sort of woman he wanted me to be  id try  id try all day long  i would  i wonder i said  robina had surprised me  i admit it  i thought i knew the sex better  any girl would said robina  hed be worth it  it would be a new idea i mused  gott im himmel what a new world might it not create  the fancy began to take hold of me  love no longer blind  love refusing any more to be the poor blind fool sport of gods and men  love no longer passions slave  his bonds broken the senseless bandage flung aside  love helping life instead of muddling it  marriage the foundation of civilisation no longer reared upon the sands of lies and illusions but grappled to the rock of truthreality  have you ever read tom jones i said  no answered robina ive always heard it wasnt a nice book  it isnt i said  man isnt a nice animal not all of him  nor woman either  theres a deal of the beast in man  what can you expect  till a few paltry thousands of years ago he was a beast fighting with other beasts his fellow denizens of the woods and caves watching for his prey crouched in the long grass of the rivers bank tearing it with claws and teeth growling as he ate so he lived and died through the dim unnamed ages transmitting his beasts blood his bestial instincts to his offspring growing ever stronger fiercer from generation to generation while the rocks piled up their strata and the oceans shaped their beds  moses  why lord rothschilds greatgrandfather a few score times removed must have known moses talked with him  babylon  it is a modern city fallen into disuse for the moment owing to alteration of traffic routes  history it is a tale of today  man was crawling about the world on all fours learning to be an animal for millions of years before the secret of his birth was whispered to him  it is only during the last few centuries that he has been trying to be a man our modern morality  why compared with the teachings of nature it is but a few days old  what do you expect  that he shall forget the lessons of the aeons at the bidding of the hours  then you advise me to read tom jones said robina  yes i said i do  i should not if i thought you were still a child knowing only blind trust or blind terror  the sun is not extinguished because occasionally obscured by mist the scent of the rose is not dead because of the worm in the leaf  a healthy rose can afford a few wormshas got to anyhow  all men are not tom joneses the standard of masculine behaviour continues to go up  many of us make fine efforts to conform to it and some of us succeed  but the tom jones is there in all of us who are not anaemic or consumptive and theres no sense at all in getting cross with us about it because we cannot help it  we are doing our best  in another hundred thousand years or so provided all goes well we shall be the perfect man  and seeing our early training i flatter myself that up to the present we have done remarkably well  nothing like being satisfied with oneself said robina  im not satisfied i said im only hopeful  but it irritates me when i hear people talk as though man had been born a whitesouled angel and was making supernatural efforts to become a sinner  that seems to me the way to discourage him  what he wants is bucking up somebody to say to him bravo why this is splendid  just think my boy what you were and that not so very long agoan unwashed hairy savage your law that of the jungle your morals those of the rabbitwarren  now look at yourselfdressed in your little shiny hat your trousers neatly creased walking with your wife to church on sunday  keep onthats all youve got to do  in a few more centuries your own mother nature wont know you  you women i continued why a handful of years ago we bought and sold you kept you in cages took the stick to you when you were not spry in doing what you were told  did you ever read the history of patient griselda  yes said robina i have  i gathered from her tone that the joan of arc expression had departed  had primgate wanted to paint her at that particular moment i should have suggested katherineduring the earlier stageslistening to a curtain lecture from petruchio  are you suggesting that all women should take her for a model  no i said im not  though were we living in chaucers time i might and you would not think it even silly  what im impressing upon you is that the human race has yet a little way to travel before the average man can be regarded as an uptodate edition of king arthurthe king arthur of the poetical legend i mean  dont be too impatient with him  thinking what a beast he has been ought to make him impatient himself with himself considered robina  he ought to be feeling so ashamed of himself as to be willing to do anything  the owl in the old yew screamed whether with indignation or amusement i cannot tell  and woman i said had the power been hers would she have used it to sweeter purpose  where is your evidence  your cleopatras pompadours jezebels your catherines of russia late empresses of china your faustines of all ages and all climes your mother brownriggs your lucretia borgias salomesi could weary you with names  your roman taskmistresses your drivers of lodginghouse slaveys your ladies who whipped their pages to death in the middle ages your modern dames of fashion decked with the plumage of the tortured grove  there have been other women alsonoble women their names like beaconlights studding the dark waste of history  so there have been noble mensaints martyrs heroes  the sexline divides us physically not morally  woman has been mans accomplice in too many crimes to claim to be his judge  male and female created he themlike and like for good and evil  by good fortune i found a loose match  i lighted a fresh cigar  dick i suppose is the average man said robina  most of us are i said when we are at home  carlyle was the average man in the little front parlour in cheyne row though to hear fools talk you might think no married couple outside literary circles had ever been known to exchange a cross look  so was oliver cromwell in his own palace with the door shut  mrs cromwell must have thought him monstrous silly placing sticky sweetmeats for his guests to sit ontold him so most likely  a cheery kindly man notwithstanding though given to moods  he and mrs cromwell seem to have rubbed along on the whole pretty well together  old sam johnsongreat godfearing lovable cantankerous old brute  life with him in a small house on a limited income must have had its ups and downs  milton and frederick the great were one hopes a little below the average  did their best no doubt lacked understanding not so easy as it looks living up to the standard of the average man  very clever people in particular find it tiring  i shall never marry said robina  at least i hope i shant  why hope i asked  because i hope i shall never be idiot enough she answered  i see it all so clearly  i wish i didnt  love its only an ugly thing with a pretty name  it will not be me that he will fall in love with  he will not know me until it is too late  how can he  it will be merely with the outside of memy pinkandwhite skin my rounded arms  i feel it sometimes when i see men looking at me and it makes me mad  and at other times the admiration in their eyes pleases me  and that makes me madder still  the moon had slipped behind the wood  she had risen and leaning against the porch was standing with her hands clasped  i fancy she had forgotten me  she seemed to be talking to the night  its only a trick of nature to make fools of us she said  he will tell me i am all the world to him that his love will outlive the starswill believe it himself at the time poor fellow  he will call me a hundred pretty names will kiss my feet and hands  and if im fool enough to listen to him it may lastshe laughed it was rather an ugly laughsix months with luck perhaps a year if im careful not to go out in the east wind and come home with a red nose and never let him catch me in curl papers  it will not be me that he will want  only my youth and the novelty of me and the mystery and when that is gone  she turned to me  it was a strange face i saw then in the pale light quite a fierce little face  she laid her hands upon my shoulders and i felt them cold  what comes when it is dead she said  what follows  you must know  tell me  i want the truth  her vehemence had arisen so suddenly  the little girl i had set out to talk with was no longer there  to my bewilderment it was a woman that was questioning me  i drew her down beside me  but the childish face was still stern  i want the truth she said so that i answered very gravely  when the passion is passed when the glory and the wonder of desire natures eternal ritual of marriage solemnising sanctifying it to her commandsis ended when sooner or later some grey dawn finds you wandering bewildered in once familiar places seeking vainly the lost palace of youths dreams when loves frenzy is faded like the fragrance of the blossom like the splendour of the dawn there will remain to you just what was there beforeno more no less  if passion was all you had to give to one another god help you  you have had your hour of madness  it is finished  if greed of praise and worship was your pricewell you have had your payment  the bargain is complete  if mere hope to be made happy was your lure one pities you  we do not make each other happy  happiness is the gift of the gods not of man  the secret lies within you not without  what remains to you will depend not upon what you thought but upon what you are  if behind the lover there was the manbehind the impossible goddess of his lovesick brain some honest human woman then life lies not behind you but before you  life is giving not getting  that is the mistake we most of us set out with  it is the work that is the joy not the wages the game not the score  the lovers delight is to yield not to claim  the crown of motherhood is pain  to serve the state at cost of ease and leisure to spend his thought and labour upon a hundred schemes is the mans ambition  life is doing not having  it is to gain the peak the climber strives not to possess it  fools marry thinking what they are going to get out of it  good store of joys and pleasure opportunities for selfindulgence eternal soft caresses the wages of the wanton  the rewards of marriage are toil duty responsibilitymanhood womanhood  loves baby talk you will have outgrown  you will no longer be his goddess angel popsy wopsy queen of his heart  there are finer names than these wife mother priestess in the temple of humanity  marriage is renunciation the sacrifice of self upon the altar of the race  a trick of nature you call it  perhaps  but a trick of nature compelling you to surrender yourself to the purposes of god  i fancy we must have sat in silence for quite a long while for the moon creeping upward past the wood had flooded the fields again with light before robina spoke  then all love is needless she said we could do better without it choose with more discretion  if it is only something that worries us for a little while and then passes what is the sense of it  you could ask the same question of life itself i said something that worries us for a little while then passes  perhaps the worry as you call it has its uses  volcanic upheavals are necessary to the making of a world  without them the ground would remain rockbound unfitted for its purposes  that explosion of youths pentup forces that we term love serves to the making of man and woman  it does not die it takes new shape  the blossom fades as the fruit forms  the passion passes to give place to peace  the trembling lover has become the helper the comforter the husband  but the failures robina persisted i do not mean the silly or the wicked people but the people who begin by really loving one another only to end in dislikingalmost hating one another  how do they get there  sit down i said and i will tell you a story  once upon a time there was a girl and a boy who loved her  she was a clever brilliant girl and she had the face of an angel  they lived near to one another seeing each other almost daily  but the boy awed by the difference of their social position kept his secret as he thought to himself dreaming as youth will of the day when fame and wealth would bridge the gulf between them  the kind look in her eyes the occasional seeming pressure of her hand he allowed to feed his hopes and on the morning of his departure for london an incident occurred that changed his vague imaginings to set resolve  he had sent on his scanty baggage by the carrier intending to walk the three miles to the station  it was early in the morning and he had not expected to meet a soul  but a mile from the village he overtook her  she was reading a book but she made no pretence that the meeting was accidental leaving him to form what conclusions he would  she walked with him some distance and he told her of his plans and hopes and she answered him quite simply that she should always remember him always be more glad than she could tell to hear of his success  near the end of the lane they parted she wishing him in that low sweet womans voice of hers all things good  he turned a little farther on and found that she had also turned  she waved her hand to him smiling  and through the long days journey and through many days to come there remained with him that picture of her bringing with it the scent of the pinewoods  her white hand waving to him her sweet eyes smiling wistfully  but fame and fortune are not won so quickly as boys dream nor is life as easy to live bravely as it looks in visions  it was nearly twenty years before they met again  neither had married  her people were dead and she was living alone and to him the world at last had opened her doors  she was still beautiful  a gracious gentle lady she had grown clothed with that soft sweet dignity that time bestows upon rare women rendering them fairer with the years  to the man it seemed a miracle  the dream of those early days came back to him  surely there was nothing now to separate them  nothing had changed but the years bringing to them both wider sympathies calmer more enduring emotions  she welcomed him again with the old kind smile a warmer pressure of the hand and allowing a little time to pass for courtesys sake he told her what was the truth that he had never ceased to love her never ceased to keep the vision of her fair pure face before him his ideal of all that man could find of help in womanhood  and her answer until years later he read the explanation remained a mystery to him  she told him that she loved him that she had never loved any other man and never should that his love for so long as he chose to give it to her she should always prize as the greatest gift of her life  but with that she prayed him to remain content  he thought perhaps it was a touch of womans pride of hurt dignity that he had kept silent so long not trusting her that perhaps as time went by she would change her mind  but she never did and after awhile finding that his persistence only pained her he accepted the situation  she was not the type of woman about whom people talk scandal nor would it have troubled her much had they done so  able now to work where he would he took a house in a neighbouring village where for the best part of the year he lived near to her and to the end they remained lovers  i think i understand said robina  i will tell you afterwards if i am wrong  i told the story to a woman many years ago i said and she also thought she understood  but she was only half right  we will see said robina  go on  she left a letter to be given to him after her death in case he survived her if not to be burned unopened  in it she told him her reason or rather her reasons for having refused him  it was an odd letter  the reasons sounded so pitiably insufficient  until one took the pains to examine them in the cold light of experience  and then her letter struck one not as foolish but as one of the grimmest commentaries upon marriage that perhaps had ever been penned  it was because she had wished always to remain his ideal to keep their love for one another to the end untarnished to be his true helpmeet in all things that she had refused to marry him  had he spoken that morning she had waited for him in the laneshe had half hoped half feared itshe might have given her promise for youth so she wrote always dreams it can find a new way she thanked god that he had not  sooner or later so ran the letter you would have learned dear that i was neither saint nor angel but just a womansuch a tiresome inconsistent creature she would have exasperated youfull of a thousand follies and irritabilities that would have marred for you all that was good in her  i wanted you to have of me only what was worthy and this seemed the only way  counting the hours to your coming hating the pain of your going i could always give to you my best  the ugly words the whims and frets that poison speechthey could wait it was my lovers hour  and you dear were always so tender so gay  you brought me joy with both your hands  would it have been the same had you been my husband  how could it  there were times even as it was when you vexed me  forgive me dear i mean it was my faultways of thought and action that did not fit in with my ways that i was not large minded enough to pass over  as my lover they were but as spots upon the sun  it was easy to control the momentary irritation that they caused me  time was too precious for even a moment of estrangement as my husband the jarring note would have been continuous would have widened into discord  you see dear i was not great enough to love all of you  i remember as a child how indignant i always felt with god when my nurse told me he would not love me because i was naughty that he only loved good children  it seemed such a poor sort of love that  yet that is precisely how we men and women do love taking only what gives us pleasure repaying the rest with anger  there would have arisen the unkind words that can never be recalled the ugly silences the gradual withdrawing from one another  i dared not face it  it was not all selfishness  truthfully i can say i thought more of you than of myself  i wanted to keep the shadows of life away from you  we men and women are like the flowers  it is in sunshine that we come to our best  you were my hero  i wanted you to be great  i wanted you to be surrounded by lovely dreams  i wanted your love to be a thing holy helpful to you  it was a long letter  i have given you the gist of it  again there was a silence between us  you think she did right asked robina  i cannot say i answered there are no rules for life only for the individual  i have read it somewhere said robinawhere was itlove suffers all things and rejoices  maybe in old thomas kempis  i am not sure i said  it seems to me said robina that the explanation lies in that one sentence of hers  i was not great enough to love all of you  it seems to me i said that the whole art of marriage is the art of getting on with the other fellow  it means patience self control forbearance  it means the laying aside of our selfconceit and admitting to ourselves that judged by eyes less partial than our own there may be much in us that is objectionable that calls for alteration  it means toleration for views and opinions diametrically opposed to our most cherished convictions  it means of necessity the abandonment of many habits and indulgences that however trivial have grown to be important to us  it means the shaping of our own desires to the needs of others the acceptance often of surroundings and conditions personally distasteful to us  it means affection deep and strong enough to bear away the ugly things of lifeits quarrels wrongs misunderstandingsswiftly and silently into the sea of forgetfulness  it means courage good humour commonsense  that is what i am saying explained robina  it means loving him even when hes naughty  dick came across the fields  robina rose and slipped into the house  you are looking mighty solemn dad said dick  thinking of life dick i confessed  of the meaning and the explanation of it  yes its a problem life admitted dick  a bit of a teaser i agreed  we smoked in silence for awhile  loving a good woman must be a tremendous help to a man said dick  he looked very handsome very gallant his boyish face flashing challenge to the fates  tremendous dick i agreed  robina called to him that his supper was ready  he knocked the ashes from his pipe and followed her into the house  their laughing voices came to me broken through the halfclosed doors  from the night around me rose a strange low murmur  it seemed to me as though above the silence i heard the faroff music of the mills of god    chapter xi    i fancy veronica is going to be an authoress  her mother thinks this may account for many things about her that have been troubling us the story never got far  it was laid aside for the more alluring work of playwriting and apparently forgotten  i came across the copybook containing her rough notes the other day  there is decided flavour about them  i transcribe selections the spelling as before being my own  the scene is laid in the moon  but everything is just the same as down here  with one exception  the children rule  the grownups do not like it  but they cannot help it  something has happened to them  they dont know what  and the world is as it used to be  in the sweet old storybooks  before sin came  there are fairies that dance o nights  and witches  that lure you  and then turn you into things  and a dragon who lives in a cave  and springs out at people  and eats them  so that you have to be careful  and all the animals talk  and there are giants  and lots of magic  and it is the children who know everything  and what to do for it  and they have to teach the grownups  and the grownups dont believe half of it  and are far too fond of arguing  which is a sore trial to the children  but they have patience and are just  of course the grownups have to go to school  they have much to learn  poor things  and they hate it  they take no interest in fairy lore  and what would happen to them if they got wrecked on a desert island they dont seem to care  and then there are languages what they will need when they come to be children  and have to talk to all the animals  and magic  which is deep  and they hate it and say it is rot  they are full of tricks  one catches them reading trashy novels  under the desk  all about love  which is wasting their childrens money  and god knows it is hard enough to earn  but the children are not angry with them  remembering how they felt themselves  when they were grown up  only firm  the children give them plenty of holidays  because holidays are good for everyone  they freshen you up  but the grownups are very stupid  and do not care for sensible games  such as indians  and pirates  what would sharpen their faculties  and so fit them for the future  they only care to play with a ball  which is of no help  to the stern realities of life  or talk  lord how they talk  there is one grownup  who is very clever  he can talk about everything  but it leads to nothing  and spoils the party  so they send him to bed  and there are two grownups  a male and a female and they talk love  all the time  even on fine days  which is maudlin  but the children are patient with them  knowing it takes all sorts  to make a world  and trusting they will grow out of it and of course there are grownups who are good  and a comfort to their children  and everything the children like is good  and wholesome  and everything the grownups like is bad for them  and they mustnt have it  they clamour for tea and coffee  what undermines their nervous system  and waste their money in the tuck shop  upon chops  and turtle soup  and the children have to put them to bed  and give them pills  till they feel better  there is a little girl named prue  who lives with a little boy named simon  they mean well  but havent much sense  they have two grownups  a male and a female  named peter and martha respectively  they are just the ordinary grownups  neither better nor worse  and much might be done with them  by kindness  but prue and simon go the wrong way to work  it is blame blame all day long but as for praise  oh never  one summers day prue and simon take peter for a walk  in the country  and they meet a cow  and they think this a good opportunity  to test peters knowledge  of languages  so they tell him to talk to the cow  and he talks to the cow  and the cow dont understand him  and he dont understand the cow  and they are mad with him  what is the use they say  of our paying expensive fees  to have you taught the language  by a firstclass cow  and when you come out into the country  you cant talk it  and he says he did talk it  but they will not listen to him  but go on raving and in the end it turns out  it was a jersey cow  what talked a dialect  so of course he couldnt understand it  but did they apologise  oh dear no  another time  one morning at breakfast  martha didnt like her raspberry vinegar  so she didnt drink it  and simon came into the nursery  and he saw that martha hadnt drunk her raspberry vinegar and he asked her why  and she said she didnt like it  because it was nasty  and he said it wasnt nasty  and that she ought to like it  and how it was shocking  the way grownups nowadays grumbled at good wholesome food  provided for them by their tooindulgent children  and how when he was a grownup  he would never have dared  and so on  all in the usual style  and to prove it wasnt nasty  he poured himself out a cupful  and drank it off  in a gulp  and he said it was delicious  and turned pale  and left the room  and prue came into the nursery  and she saw that martha hadnt drunk her raspberry vinegar  and she asked her why  and martha told her how she didnt like it  because it was nasty  and prue told her she ought to be ashamed of herself  for not liking it  because it was good for her  and really very nice  and anyhow shed got to like it  and not get stuffing herself up with messy tea and coffee because she wouldnt have it  and there was an end of it  and so on  and to prove it was all right  she poured herself out a cupful and drank it off  in a gulp  and she said there was nothing wrong with it  nothing whatever  and turned pale  and left the room  and it wasnt raspberry vinegar  but just red ink  what had got put into the raspberry vinegar decanter  by an oversight  and they neednt have been ill at all  if only they had listened  to poor old martha  but no  that was their fixed idea  that grownups hadnt any sense  at all  what is a mistake  as one perceives  other characters had been sketched some of them to be abandoned after a few bold touches  the difficulty of avoiding too close a portraiture to the living original having apparently proved irksome against one such evidently an attempt to help dick see himself in his true colours i find this marginal note in pencil  better not might make him ratty  opposite to anotherobviously of mrs st leonard and with instinct for alliterationis scribbled too terribly true  shed twig it  another character is that of a gent  with a certain gift  for telling stories  some of them not bad  a promising party on the whole  indeed one might say judging from description a quite rational person  when not on the rantan  but inconsistent  he is the grownup of a little girl  not beautiful  but strangely attractive  whom we will call enid one gathers that if all the children had been enids then surely the last word in worlds had been said  she has only this one grownup of her very own but she makes it her business to adopt and reform all the incorrigible old folk the other children have despaired of  it is all done by kindness  she is ever patient  and just  prominent among her numerous protegees is a military man an elderly colonel until she took him in hand the awful example of what a grownup might easily become left to the care of incompetent infants  he defies his own child a virtuous youth but lacking in sympathy is rude to his little nephews and nieces a holy terror to his governess  he uses wicked words picked up from retired pirates  of course without understanding  their terrible significance  he steals the indians firewater  what few can partake of  with impunity  certainly not the colonel can this be he  this gibbering wreck  he hides cigars in a hollow tree and smokes on the sly  he plays truant  lures other old gentlemen away from their lessons to join him  they are discovered in the woods in a cave playing whist for sixpenny points  does enid storm and bullyrag threaten that if ever she catches him so much as looking at a card again she will go straight out and tell the dragon who will in his turn be so shocked that in all probability he will decide on coming back with her to kill and eat the colonel on the spot  no  such are not her methods  instead she smiles  indulgently  she says it is only natural for grown ups to like playing cards  she is not angry with him  and there is no need for him to run away and hide in a nasty damp cave  she herself will play whist with him  the effect upon the colonel is immediate  he bursts into tears  she plays whist with him in the garden  after school hours  when he has been good  double dummy one presumes  one leaves the colonel in the end cured of his passion for whist  whether as the consequence of her play or her influence the rough notes give no indication  in the play i am inclined to think veronica received assistance the house had got itself finished early in september  young bute has certainly done wonders  we performed it in the empty billiardroom followed by a oneact piece of my own  the occasion did duty as a housewarming  we had quite a crowd and ended up with a dance everybody seemed to enjoy themselves except young bertie st leonard who played the prince and could not get out of his helmet in time for supper  it was a good helmet but had been fastened clumsily and inexperienced people trying to help had only succeeded in jambing all the screws  not only wouldnt it come off it would not even open for a drink  all thought it an excellent joke with the exception of young herbert st leonard  our mayor a cheerful little man and very popular said that it ought to be sent to punch the local reporter reminded him that the late john leech had already made use of precisely the same incident for a comic illustration afterwards remembering that it was not leech but the late phil may he seemed to think this ended the matter  st leonard and the vicar who are rival authorities upon the subject fell into an argument upon armour in general with special reference to the fourteenth century  each used the boys head to confirm his own theory passing it triumphantly from one to the other  we had to send off young hopkins in the donkeycart for the blacksmith  i have found out by the way how it is young hopkins makes our donkey go  young hopkins argues it is far less brutal than whacking him especially after experience has proved that he evidently does not know why you are whacking him  i am not at all sure the boy is not right  janie played the fairy godmamma in a white wig and panniers  she will make a beautiful old lady  the white hair gives her the one thing that she lacks  distinction  i found myself glancing apprehensively round the room wishing we had not invited so many eligible bachelors  dick is making me anxious  the sense of his own unworthiness which has come to him quite suddenly and apparently with all the shock of a new discovery has completely unnerved him it is a healthy sentiment and does him good  but i do not want it carried to the length of losing her  the thought of what he might one day bring home has been a nightmare to me ever since he left school  i suppose it is to most fathers  especially if one thinks of the women one loved oneself when in the early twenties  a large palefaced girl who served in a bunshop in the strand is the first i can recollect  how i trembled when by chance her hand touched mine  i cannot recall a single attraction about her except her size yet for nearly six months i lunched off pastry and mineral waters merely to be near her  to this very day an attack of indigestion will always recreate her image in my mind  another was a thin sallow girl but with magnificent eyes i met one afternoon in the south kensington museum  she was a brainless vixenish girl but the memory of her eyes would always draw me back to her  more than two thirds of our time together we spent in violent quarrels and all my hopes of eternity i would have given to make her my companion for life  but for luck in the shape of a welltodo cab proprietor as great an idiot as myself i might have done it  the third was a chorus girl  on the whole the best of the bunch  her father was a coachman and she had ten brothers and sisters most of them doing well in service  and she was succeededif i have the order correct by the exwife of a solicitor a sprightly lady according to her own account the victim of complicated injustice  i daresay there were others if i took the time to think but not one of them can i remember without returning thanks to providence for having lost her what is one to do  there are days in springtime when a young man ought not to be allowed outside the house  thank heaven and convention it is not the girls who propose  few women who would choose the right moment to put their hands upon a young mans shoulders and looking into his eyes ask him to marry them next week would receive no for an answer  it is only our shyness that saves us  a wise friend of mine who has observed much would have all those marrying under fiveandtwenty divorced by automatic effluxion of time at forty leaving the few who had chosen satisfactorily to be reunited if they wished  his argument being that to condemn grown men and women to abide by the choice of inexperienced boys and girls is unjust and absurd  there were nice girls i could have fallen in love with  they never occurred to me it would seem as if a man had to learn taste in women as in all other things namely by education  here and there may exist the born connoisseur  but with most of us our first instincts are towards vulgarity  it is barrie i think who says that if only there were silly women enough to go round good women would never get a look in it is certainly remarkable the number of sweet old maids one meets almost as remarkable as the number of stupid crossgrained wives as i tell dick i have no desire for a daughterinlaw of whom he feels himself worthy  if he cant do better than that he had best remain single  janie and he if i know anything of life are just suited for one another  helpful people take their happiness in helping  i knew just such another once  a sweet industrious sensible girl  she made the mistake of marrying a thoroughly good man  there was nothing for her to do  she ended by losing all interest in him devoting herself to a home in the east end for the reformation of newsboys  it was a pitiful waste  so many women would have been glad of him while to the ordinary sinful man she would have been a lifelong comfort  i must have a serious talk to dick  i shall point out what a good thing it will be for her  i can see dick keeping her busy and contented for the rest of her days  veronica played the princesswith little boy foysir robert of the curseas her page  anything more dignified has i should say rarely been seen upon the english stage  among her wedding presents were  two votes for women presented by the local fire brigade a flying machine of proved stability  might be used as a bathing tent a national theatre with cold water douche in basement for reception of english dramatists recipe for building a navy without paying for it gift of that great financial expert sir hocus pocus one conscientious income taxpayer has been driven by a lady two socialists in agreement as to what it means smaller one slightly damaged one contented farmer babylonian period and one extrasized bottle solution of the servant problem  dick played the dragon without a tail  we had to make him without a tail owing to the smallness of the stage  he had once had a tail but that was a long story  added to which there was not time to tell it  little sally st leonard played his wife and robina was his motherinlaw  so much depends upon ones mood  what an ocean of boredom might be saved if science could but give us a barometer foretelling us our changes of temperament  how much more to our comfort we could plan our lives knowing that on monday say we should be feeling frivolous on saturday dull to badtempered  i took a man once to see the private secretary  i began by enjoying myself and ended by feeling ashamed of myself and vexed with the scheme of creation  that authors should write such plays that actors should be willing to degrade our common nature by appearing in them was explainable he supposed by the law of supply and demand what he could not understand was how the public could contrive to extract amusement from them  what was there funny in seeing a poor gentleman shut up in a box  why should everybody roar with laughter when he asked for a bun  people asked for buns every daypeople in railway refreshment rooms in aerated bread shops  where was the joke  a month later i found myself by chance occupying the seat just behind him at the pantomime  the low comedian was bathing a baby and tears of merriment were rolling down his cheeks  to me the whole business seemed painful and revolting  we were being asked to find delight in the spectacle of a fatherscouring down an infant of tender years with a scrubbingbrush  how womenmany of them motherscould remain through such an exhibition without rising in protest appeared to me an argument against female suffrage  a lady entered the wife so the programme informed me of a baron  all i can say is that a more vulgar less prepossessing female i never wish to meet  i even doubted her sobriety  she sat down plump upon the baby  she must have been a woman rising sixteen stone and for one minute fifteen seconds by my watch the whole house rocked with laughter  that the thing was only a stage property i felt was no excuse  the humourheaven save the marklay in the supposition that what we were witnessing was the agony and deathfor no child could have survived that womans weightof a real baby  had i been able to tap myself beforehand i should have learned that on that particular saturday i was going to be setserious  instead of booking a seat for the pantomime i should have gone to a lecture on egyptian pottery which was being given by a friend of mine at the london library and have had a good time  children could tap their parents warn each other that father was going down that mother next week was likely to be gusty children themselves might hang out their little barometers  i remember a rainy day in a country house during the christmas holidays  we had among us a member of parliament  a man of sunny disposition extremely fond of children  he said it was awfully hard lines on the little beggars cooped up in a nursery and borrowing his hosts motorcoat pretended he was a bear  he plodded round on his hands and knees and growled a good deal and the children sat on the sofa and watched him  but they didnt seem to be enjoying it not much and after a quarter of an hour or so he noticed this himself he thought it was maybe that they were tired of bears and fancied that a whale might rouse them  he turned the table upside down and placed the children in it on three chairs explaining to them that they were shipwrecked sailors on a raft and that they must be careful the whale did not get underneath it and upset them  he draped a sheet over the towelhorse to represent an iceberg and rolled himself up in a mackintosh and flopped about the floor on his stomach butting his head occasionally against the table in order to suggest to them their danger  the attitude of the children still remained that of polite spectators  true the youngest boy did make the suggestion of borrowing the kitchen toastingfork and employing it as a harpoon but even this appeared to be the outcome rather of a desire to please than of any warmer interest and the whale objecting the idea fell through  after that he climbed up on the dresser and announced to them that he was an ourangoutang  they watched him break a souptureen and then the eldest boy stepping out into the middle of the room held up his arm and the member of parliament somewhat surprised sat down on the dresser and listened  please sir said the eldest boy were awfully sorry  its awfully good of you sir  but somehow were not feeling in the mood for wild beasts this afternoon  the member of parliament brought them down into the drawingroom where we had music and the children at their own request were allowed to sing hymns  the next day they came of their own accord and asked the member of parliament to play at beasts with them but it seemed he had letters to write  there are times when jokes about mothersinlaw strike me as lacking both in taste and freshness  on this particular evening they came to me bringing with them all the fragrance of the days that are no more the first play i ever saw dealt with the subject of the motherin lawthe problem i think it was called in those days  the occasion was an amateur performance given in aid of the local ragged school a cousin of mine lately married played the wife and my aunt i remember got up and walked out in the middle of the second act robina in spectacles and an early victorian bonnet reminded me of her  young bute played a comic cabman  it was at the old haymarket in buckstones time that i first met the cabman of art and literature  dear bibulous becoated creature with everwrathful outstretched palm and husky ere  wots this  how good it was to see him once again  i felt i wanted to climb over the footlights and shake him by the hand  the twins played a couple of young turks much concerned about their constitutions and made quite a hit with a topical duet to the refrain  and so you see the reason he is not the boss for us  we all agreed it was a pun worthy of tom hood himself  the vicar thought he had heard it before but this seemed improbable  there was a unanimous call for author giving rise to sounds of discussion behind the curtain  eventually the whole company appeared with veronica in the centre  i had noticed throughout that the centre of the stage appeared to be veronicas favourite spot  i can see the makings of a leading actress in veronica  in my own piece which followed robina and bute played a young married couple who do not know how to quarrel  it has always struck me how much more satisfactorily people quarrel on the stage than in real life  on the stage the man having made up his mindto have it out enters and closes the door  he lights a cigarette if not a teetotaller mixes himself a brandyandsoda  his wife all this time is careful to remain silent  quite evident it is that he is preparing for her benefit something unpleasant and chatter might disturb him  to fill up the time she toys with a novel or touches softly the keys of the piano until he is quite comfortable and ready to begin  he glides into his subject with the studied calm of one with all the afternoon before him  she listens to him in rapt attention  she does not dream of interrupting him would scorn the suggestion of chipping in with any little notion of her own likely to disarrange his train of thought  all she does when he pauses as occasionally he has to for the purpose of taking breath is to come to his assistance with short encouraging remarks such for instance as  well  you think that  and if i did  her object seems to be to help him on  go on she says from time to time bitterly and he goes on  towards the end when he shows signs of easing up she puts it to him as one sportsman to another  is he quite finished  is that all  sometimes it isnt  as often as not he has been saving the pick of the basket for the last  no he says that is not all  there is something else  that is quite enough for her  that is all she wanted to know  she merely asked in case there might be  as it appears there is she re settles herself in her chair and is again all ears  when it does comewhen he is quite sure there is nothing he has forgotten no little point that he has overlooked she rises  i have listened patiently she begins to all that you have said the devil himself could not deny this  patience hardly seems the word  enthusiastically she might almost have said  nowwith rising inflectionyou listen to me  the stage husbandalways the gentlemanbowsstiffly maybe but quite politely and prepares in his turn to occupy the role of dumb but dignified defendant  to emphasise the coming change in their positions the lady most probably crosses over to what has hitherto been his side of the stage while he starting at the same moment and passing her about the centre settles himself down in what must be regarded as the listeners end of the room  we then have the whole story over again from her point of view and this time it is the gentleman who would bite off his tongue rather than make a retort calculated to put the lady off  in the end it is the party who is in the right that conquers  off the stage this is more or less of a tossup on the stage never  if justice be with the husband then it is his voice that gradually growing louder and louder rings at last triumphant through the house  the lady sees herself that she has been to blame and wonders why it did not occur to her beforeis grateful for the revelation and asks to be forgiven  if on the other hand it was the husband who was at fault then it is the lady who will be found eventually occupying the centre of the stage the miserable husband who morally speaking will be trying to get under the table  now in real life things dont happen quite like this  what the quarrel in real life suffers from is want of system  there is no order no settled plan  there is much too much goasyouplease about the quarrel in real life and the result is naturally pure muddle  the man turning things over in the morning while shaving makes up his mind to have this matter out and have done with it  he knows exactly what he is going to say  he repeats it to himself at intervals during the day  he will first say this and then he will go on to that while he is about it he will perhaps mention the other  he reckons it will take him a quarter of an hour  which will just give him time to dress for dinner  after it is over and he looks at his watch he finds it has taken him longer than that  added to which he has said next to nothing next to nothing that is of what he meant to say  it went wrong from the very start  as a matter of fact there wasnt any start  he entered the room and closed the door  that is as far as he got  the cigarette he never even lighted  there ought to have been a box of matches on the mantelpiece behind the photoframe  and of course there were none there  for her to fly into a temper merely because he reminded her that he had spoken about this very matter at least a hundred times before and accuse him of going about his own house stealing his own matches was positively laughable  they had quarrelled for about five minutes over those wretched matches and then for another ten because he said that women had no sense of humour and she wanted to know how he knew  after that there had cropped up the last quarters gasbill and that by a process still mysterious to him had led them into the subject of his behaviour on the night of the hockey club dance  by an effort of almost supernatural selfcontrol he had contrived at length to introduce the subject he had come home half an hour earlier than usual on purpose to discuss  it didnt interest her in the least  what she was full of by this time was a girl named arabella jones  she got in quite a lot while he was vainly trying to remember where he had last seen the damned girl  he had just succeeded in getting back to his own topic when the cuddiford girl from next door dashed in without a hat to borrow a tuningfork  it had been quite a business finding the tuningfork and when she was gone they had to begin all over again they had quarrelled about the drawingroom carpet about her sister florries birthday present and the way he drove the motorcar  it had taken them over an hour and a half and rather than waste the tickets for the theatre they had gone without their dinner  the matter of the cold chisel still remained to be thrashed out  it had occurred to me that through the medium of the drama i might show how the domestic quarrel could so easily be improved  adolphus goodbody a worthy young man deeply attached to his wife feels nevertheless that the dinners she is inflicting upon him are threatening with permanent damage his digestive system  he determines come what may to insist upon a change  elvira goodbody a charming girl admiring and devoted to her husband is notwithstanding a trifle en tete especially when her domestic arrangements happen to be the theme of discussion  adolphus his courage screwed to the stickingpoint broaches the difficult subject and for the first half of the act my aim was to picture the progress of the human quarrel not as it should be but as it is they never reach the cook  the first mention of the word dinner reminds elvira quick to perceive that argument is brewing and alive to the advantage of getting in first that twice the month before he had dined out not returning till the small hours of the morning what she wants to know is where this sort of thing is going to end if the purpose of freemasonry is the ruin of the home and the desertion of women then all she has to sayit turns out to be quite a good deal  adolphus when able to get in a word suggests that eleven oclock at the latest can hardly be described as the small hours of the morning  the fault with women is that they never will confine themselves to the simple truth  from that point onwards as can be imagined the scene almost wrote itself  they have passed through all the customary stages and are planning with exaggerated calm arrangements for the separation which each now feels to be inevitable when a knock comes to the frontdoor and there enters a mutual friend  their hasty attempts to cover up the traces of mental disorder with which the atmosphere is strewed do not deceive him  there has been let us say a ripple on the waters of perfect agreement  come  what was it all about  about  they look from one to the other  surely it would be simpler to tell him what it had not been about  it had been about the parrot about her want of punctuality about his using the butterknife for the marmalade about a pair of slippers he had lost at christmas about the education question and her dressmakers bill and his friend george and the nextdoor dog   the mutual friend cuts short the catalogue  clearly there is nothing for it but to begin the quarrel all over again and this time if they will put themselves into his hands he feels sure he can promise victory to whichever one is in the right  elvirashe has a sweet impulsive naturethrows her arms around him  that is all she wants  if only adolphus could be brought to see  adolphus grips him by the hand  if only elvira would listen to sense  the mutual friendhe is an old stagemanagerarranges the scene elvira in easychair by fire with crochet  enter adolphus  he lights a cigarette flings the match on the floor with his hands in his pockets paces up and down the room kicks a footstool out of his way  tell me when i am to begin says elvira  the mutual friend promises to give her the right cue  adolphus comes to a halt in the centre of the room  i am sorry my dear he says but there is something i must say to yousomething that may not be altogether pleasant for you to hear  to which elvira still crocheting replies oh indeed  and pray what may that be  this was not elviras own idea  springing from her chair she had got as far as  look here  if you have come home early merely for the purpose of making a row before the mutual friend could stop her  the mutual friend was firm  only by exacting strict obedience could he guarantee a successful issue  what she had got to say was oh indeed  etcetera  the mutual friend had need of all his tact to prevent its becoming a quarrel of three  adolphus allowed to proceed explained that the subject about which he wished to speak was the subject of dinner  the mutual friend this time was beforehand  elviras retort to that was  dinner  you complain of the dinners i provide for you enabling him to reply yes madam i do complain and to give reasons  it seemed to elvira that the mutual friend had lost his senses  to tell her to wait that her time would come of what use was that  half of what she wanted to say would be gone out of her head  adolphus brought to a conclusion his criticism of elviras kitchen and then elvira incapable of restraining herself further rose majestically  the mutual friend was saved the trouble of suppressing adolphus until elvira had finished adolphus never got an opening  he grumbled at their dinners  he who can dine night after night with his precious freemasons  does he think she likes them any better  she doomed to stay at home and eat them  what does he take her for  an ostrich  whose fault is it that they keep an incompetent cook too old to learn and too obstinate to want to  whose old family servant was she  not elviras  it has been to please adolphus that she has suffered the woman  and this is her reward  this  she breaks down adolphus is astonished and troubled  personally he never liked the woman  faithful she may have been but a cook never  his own idea had he been consulted would have been a small pension  elvira falls upon his neck  why did he not say so before  adolphus presses her to his bosom  if only he had known  they promise the mutual friend never to quarrel again without his assistance  the acting all round was quite good  our curate who is a bachelor said it taught a lesson  veronica had tears in her eyes  she whispered to me that she thought it beautiful  there is more in veronica than people think    chapter xii    i am sorry the house is finished  there is a proverb  fools build houses for wise men to live in  it depends upon what you are after the fool gets the fun and the wise men the bricks and mortar  i remember a whimsical story i picked up at the bookstall of the gare de lyon  i read it between paris and fontainebleau many years ago three friends youthful bohemians smoking their pipes after the meagre dinner of a cheap restaurant in the latin quarter fell to thinking of their poverty of the long and bitter struggle that lay before them  my themes are so original sighed the musician  it will take me a year of fete days to teach the public to understand them even if ever i do succeed  and meanwhile i shall live unknown neglected watching the men without ideals passing me by in the race splashed with the mud from their carriagewheels as i beat the pavements with worn shoes  it is really a most unjust world  an abominable world agreed the poet  but think of me  my case is far harder than yours  your gift lies within you  mine is to translate what lies around me and that for so far ahead as i can see will always be the shadow side of life  to develop my genius to its fullest i need the sunshine of existence  my soul is being starved for lack of the beautiful things of life  a little of the wealth that vulgar people waste would make a great poet for france it is not only of myself that i am thinking  the painter laughed  i cannot soar to your heights he said frankly speaking it is myself that chiefly appeals to me  why not i give the world beauty and in return what does it give me  this dingy restaurant where i eat illflavoured food off hideous platters a foul garret giving on to chimneypots  after long years of illrequited labour i mayas others have before mecome into my kingdom  possess my studio in the champs elysees my fine house at neuilly but the prospect of the intervening period i confess appals me  absorbed in themselves they had not noticed that a stranger seated at a neighbouring table had been listening with attention  he rose and apologising with easy grace for intrusion into a conversation he could hardly have avoided overhearing requested permission to be of service  the restaurant was dimly lighted the three friends on entering had chosen its obscurest corner  the stranger appeared to be welldressed his voice and bearing suggested the man of affairs his facewhat feeble light there was being behind himremained in shadow  the three friends eyed him furtively  possibly some rich but eccentric patron of the arts not beyond the bounds of speculation that he was acquainted with their work had read the poets verses in one of the minor magazines had stumbled upon some sketch of the painters while bargainhunting among the dealers of the quartier st antoine been struck by the beauty of the composers nocturne in f heard at some students concert having made enquiries concerning their haunts had chosen this method of introducing himself  the young men made room for him with feelings of hope mingled with curiosity  the affable stranger called for liqueurs and handed round his cigarcase  and almost his first words brought them joy  before we go further said the smiling stranger it is my pleasure to inform you that all three of you are destined to become great  the liqueurs to their unaccustomed palates were proving potent  the strangers cigars were singularly aromatic  it seemed the most reasonable thing in the world that the stranger should be thus able to foretell to them their future  fame fortune will be yours continued the agreeable stranger all things delightful will be to your hand  the adoration of women the honour of men the incense of society joys spiritual and material beauteous surroundings choice foods all luxury and ease the world your pleasureground  the stained walls of the dingy restaurant were fading into space before the young mens eyes  they saw themselves as gods walking in the garden of their hearts desires  but alas went on the strangerand with the first note of his changed voice the visions vanished the dingy walls came backthese things take time  you will all three be well past middleage before you will reap the just reward of your toil and talents meanwhile the sympathetic stranger shrugged his shouldersit is the old story  genius spending its youth battling for recognition against indifference ridicule envy the spirit crushed by its sordid environment the drab monotony of narrow days  there will be winter nights when you will tramp the streets cold hungry forlorn summer days when you will hide in your attics ashamed of the sunlight on your ragged garments chill dawns when you will watch wildeyed the suffering of those you love helpless by reason of your poverty to alleviate their pain  the stranger paused while the ancient waiter replenished the empty glasses  the three friends drank in silence  i propose said the stranger with a pleasant laugh that we pass over this customary period of probationthat we skip the intervening yearsarrive at once at our true destination  the stranger leaning back in his chair regarded the three friends with a smile they felt rather than saw  and something about the strangerthey could not have told themselves whatmade all things possible  a quite simple matter the stranger assured them  a little sleep and a forgetting and the years lie behind us  come gentlemen have i your consent  it seemed a question hardly needing answer  to escape at one stride the long weary struggle to enter without fighting into victory the young men looked at one another  and each one thinking of his gain bartered the battle for the spoil  it seemed to them that suddenly the lights went out and a darkness like a rushing wind swept past them filled with many sounds  and then forgetfulness  and then the coming back of light  they were seated at a table glittering with silver and dainty chinaware to which the red wine in venetian goblets the varied fruit and flowers gave colour  the room furnished too gorgeously for taste they judged to be a private cabinet in one of the great restaurants  of such interiors they had occasionally caught glimpses through open windows on summer nights  it was softly illuminated by shaded lamps  the strangers face was still in shadow  but what surprised each of the three most was to observe opposite him two more or less baldheaded gentlemen of somewhat flabby appearance whose features however in some mysterious way appeared familiar  the stranger had his wineglass raised in his hand  our dear paul the stranger was saying has declined with his customary modesty any public recognition of his triumph  he will not refuse three old friends the privilege of offering him their heartiest congratulations  gentlemen i drink not only to our dear paul but to the french academy which in honouring him has honoured france  the stranger rising from his chair turned his piercing eyesthe only part of him that could be clearly seenupon the astonished poet  the two elderly gentlemen opposite evidently as bewildered as paul himself taking their cue from the stranger drained their glasses  still following the strangers lead leant each across the table and shook him warmly by the hand  i beg pardon said the poet but really i am afraid i must have been asleep  would it sound rude to youhe addressed himself to the stranger  the faces of the elderly gentlemen opposite did not suggest their being of much assistance to himif i asked you where i was  again there flickered across the strangers face the smile that was felt rather than seen  you are in a private room of the cafe pretali he answered  we are met this evening to celebrate your recent elevation into the company of the immortals  oh said the poet thank you  the academy continued the stranger is always a little late in these affairs  myself i could have wished your election had taken place ten years ago when all franceall france that counts that iswas talking of you  at fiftythreethe stranger touched lightly with his fingers the poets fat handone does not write as when the sap was running up instead of down  slowly memory of the dingy cafe in the rue st louis of the strange happening that took place there that night when he was young crept back into the poets brain  would you mind said the poet would it be troubling you too much to tell me something of what has occurred to me  not in the least responded the agreeable stranger  your career has been most interestingfor the first few years chiefly to yourself  you married marguerite  you remember marguerite  the poet remembered her  a mad thing to do so most people would have said continued the stranger  you had not a sou between you  but myself i think you were justified  youth comes to us but once  and at twentyfive our business is to live  undoubtedly the marriage helped you  you lived an idyllic existence for a time in a tumbledown cottage at suresnes with a garden that went down to the river  poor of course you were poor as church mice  but who fears poverty when hope and love are singing on the bough  i really think quite your best work was done during those years at suresnes  ah the sweetness the tenderness of it  there has been nothing like it in french poetry it made no mark at the time but ten years later the public went mad about it  she was dead then  poor child it had been a hard struggle  and as you may remember she was always fragile  yet even in her death i think she helped you  there entered a new note into your poetry a depth that had hitherto been wanting  it was the best thing that ever came to you your love for marguerite  the stranger refilled his glass and passed the decanter  but the poet left the wine unheeded  and then ah yes then followed that excursion into politics those scathing articles you wrote for la liberte  it is hardly an exaggeration to say that they altered the whole aspect of french political thought  those wonderful speeches you made during your election campaign at angers  how the people worshipped you  you might have carried your portfolio had you persisted  but you poets are such restless fellows  and after all i daresay you have really accomplished more by your plays  you rememberno of course how could youthe first night of la conquette  shall i ever forget it i have always reckoned that the crown of your career  your marriage with madame deschenellei do not think it was for the public good poor deschenelles millionsis it not so  poetry and millions interfere with one another  but a thousand pardons my dear paul you have done so much  it is only right you should now be taking your ease  your work is finished  the poet does not answer  sits staring before him with eyes turned inward  the painter the musician  what did the years bring to them  the stranger tells them also of all that they have lost  of the griefs and sorrows of the hopes and fears they have never tasted of their tears that ended in laughter of the pain that gave sweetness to joy of the triumphs that came to them in the days before triumph had lost its savour of the loves and the longings and fervours they would never know  all was ended  the stranger had given them what he had promised what they had desired  the gain without the getting  then they break out  what is it to me cries the painter that i wake to find myself wearing the gold medal of the salon robbed of the memory of all by which it was earned  the stranger points out to him that he is illogical such memories would have included long vistas of meagre dinners in dingy restaurants of attic studios of a life the chief part of which had been passed amid ugly surroundings  it was to escape from all such that he had clamoured  the poet is silent  i asked but for recognition cries the musician that men might listen to me not for my music to be taken from me in exchange for the recompense of a successful tradesman  my inspiration is burnt out i feel it  the music that once filled my soul is mute  it was born of the strife and anguish the stranger tells him of the loves that died of the hopes that faded of the beating of youths wings against the bars of sorrow of the glory and madness and torment called life of the struggle you shrank from facing  the poet takes up the tale  you have robbed us of life he cries  you tell us of dead lips whose kisses we have never felt of songs of victory sung to our deaf ears  you have taken our fires you have left us but the ashes  the fires that scorch and sear the stranger adds the lips that cried in their pain the victory bought of wounds  it is not yet too late the stranger tells them  all this can be but a troubled dream growing fainter with each waking moment  will you buy back your youth at the cost of ease  will you buy back life at the price of tears  they cry with one voice give us back our youth with its burdens and a heart to bear them  give us back life with its mingled bitter and sweet  then suddenly the stranger stands revealed before them  they see that he is lifelife born of battle life made strong by endeavour life learning song from suffering  there follows more talk which struck me when i read the story as a mistake for all that he tells them they have now learnt  that life to be enjoyed must be lived that victory to be sweet must be won  they awake in the dingy cafe in the rue st louis  the ancient waiter is piling up the chairs preparatory to closing the shutters the poet draws forth his small handful of coins asks what is to pay nothing the waiter answers  a stranger who sat with them and talked awhile before they fell asleep has paid the bill  they look at one another but no one speaks  the streets are empty  a thin rain is falling  they turn up the collars of their coats strike out into the night  and as their footsteps echo on the glistening pavement it comes to each of them that they are walking with a new brave step  i feel so sorry for dickfor the tens of thousands of happy healthy caredfor lads of whom dick is the type  there must be millions of youngsters in the world who have never known hunger except as an appetiser to their dinner who have never felt what it was to be tired without the knowledge that a comfortable bed was awaiting them  to the welltodo man or woman life is one perpetual nursery  they are wakened in the morningnot too early not till the nursery has been swept out and made ready and the fire lightedawakened gently with a cup of tea to give them strength and courage for this great business of getting upawakened with whispered words lest any sudden start should make their little heads achethe blinds carefully arranged to exclude the naughty sun which otherwise might shine into their little eyes and make them fretful  the water with the nasty chill off is put ready for them they wash their little hands and faces all by themselves  then they are shaved and have their hair done their little hands are manicured their little corns cut for them  when they are neat and clean they toddle into breakfast they are shown into their little chairs their little napkins handed to them the nice food that is so good for them is put upon their little plates the drink is poured out for them into their cups  if they want to play there is the day nursery  they have only to tell kind nurse what game it is they fancy  the toys are at once brought out  the little gun is put into their hand the little horse is dragged forth from its corner their little feet carefully placed in the stirrups  the little ball and bat is taken from its box  or they will take the air as the wise doctor has ordered  the little carriage will be ready in five minutes the nice warm cloak is buttoned round them the footstool placed beneath their feet the cushion at their back  the day is done  the games have been played the toys have been taken from their tired hands put back into the cupboard  the food that is so good for them that makes them strong little men and women has all been eaten  they have been dressed for going out into the pretty park undressed and dressed again for going out to tea with the little boys and girls next door undressed and dressed again for the party  they have read their little book have seen a little play have looked at pretty pictures  the kind

one eats it never quite sure of the week after next  terrible things take place out there  strain and contest and fierce endeavour the ways are full of dangers and surprises folk go up folk go down you have to set your teeth and fight  welltodo little men and women shudder  draw down the nursery blinds  robina had a little dog  it led the usual dogs life  slept in a basket on an eiderdown cushion sheltered from any chance draught by silk curtains its milk warmed and sweetened its cosy chair reserved for it in winter near the fire in summer where the sun might reach it its three meals a day that a gourmet might have eaten gladly its very fleas taken off its hands  and twice a year still extra care was needed lest it should wantonly fling aside its days and nights of luxurious ease claim its small share of the passion and pain that go to the making of dogs and men for twice a year there came a wind salt with the brine of earths ceaseless tides whispering to it of a wondrous land whose sharpest stones are sweeter than the silken cushions of all the world without  one winters night there was great commotion  babette was nowhere to be found  we were living in the country miles away from everywhere babette babette cried poor frenzied robina and for answer came only the laughter of the wind pausing in his game of romps with the snowflakes  next morning an old woman from the town four miles away brought back babette at the end of a string  oh such a soaked bedraggled babette  the old woman had found her crouching in a doorway a bewildered little heap of palpitating femininity and reading the address upon her collar and may be scenting a not impossible reward had thought she might as well earn it for herself  robina was shocked disgusted  to think that babettedainty petted spoilt babetteshould have chosen of her own accord to go down into the mud and darkness of the vulgar town to leave her curtained eiderdown to tramp the streets like any drab  robina to whom babette had hitherto been the ideal dog moved away to hide her tears of vexation  the old dame smiled  she had borne her good man eleven so she told us  it had been a hard struggle and some had gone down and some were dead but some thank god were doing well  the old dame wished us good day but as she turned to go an impulse seized her  she crossed to where babette ashamed yet half defiant sat a wet woeful little image on the hearthrug stooped and lifted the little creature in her thin worn arms  its trouble youve brought yourself said the old dame  you couldnt help it could you  babettes little pink tongue stole out  we understand we knowwe mothers they seemed to be saying to one another  and so the two kissed   i think the terrace will be my favourite spot  ethelbertha thinks too that on sunny days she will like to sit there  from it through an opening i have made in the trees i can see the cottage just a mile away at the edge of the wood  young bute tells me it is the very place he has been looking for  most of his time of course he has to pass in town but his fridays to mondays he likes to spend in the country  maybe i shall hand it over to him  st leonards chimneys we can also see above the trees  dick tells me he has quite made up his mind to become a farmer  he thinks it would be a good plan for a beginning to go into partnership with st leonard  it is not unlikely that st leonards restless temperament may prompt him eventually to tire of farming  he has a brother in canada doing well in the lumber business and st leonard often talks of the advantages of the colonies to a man who is bringing up a large family  i shall be sorry to lose him as a neighbour though i see the advantages under certain possibilities of mrs st leonards address being manitoba  veronica also thinks the terrace may come to be her favourite restingplace  i suppose said veronica that if anything was to happen to robina everything would fall on me  it would be a change veronica i suggested  hitherto it is you who have done most of the falling  suppose ive got to see about growing up said veronica
