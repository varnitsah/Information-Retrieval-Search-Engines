this slightlybuilt romance was the outcome of a wish to set the emotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the stupendous background of the stellar universe and to impart to readers the sentiment that of these contrasting magnitudes the smaller might be the greater to them as men  but on the publication of the book people seemed to be less struck with these high aims of the author than with their own opinion first that the novel was an improper one in its morals and secondly that it was intended to be a satire on the established church of this country  i was made to suffer in consequence from several eminent pens  that however was thirteen years ago and in respect of the first opinion i venture to think that those who care to read the story now will be quite astonished at the scrupulous propriety observed therein on the relations of the sexes for though there may be frivolous and even grotesque touches on occasion there is hardly a single caress in the book outside legal matrimony or what was intended so to be  as for the second opinion it is sufficient to draw attention as i did at the time to the fact that the bishop is every inch a gentleman and that the parish priest who figures in the narrative is one of its most estimable characters  however the pages must speak for themselves  some few readers i trustto take a serious viewwill be reminded by this imperfect story in a manner not unprofitable to the growth of the social sympathies of the pathos misery longsuffering and divine tenderness which in real life frequently accompany the passion of such a woman as viviette for a lover several years her junior  the scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the part of the country specified each of which has a column standing upon it certain surrounding peculiarities have been imported into the narrative from both sites  t h  july 1895     two on a tower   i   on an early winter afternoon clear but not cold when the vegetable world was a weird multitude of skeletons through whose ribs the sun shone freely a gleaming landau came to a pause on the crest of a hill in wessex  the spot was where the old melchester road which the carriage had hitherto followed was joined by a drive that led round into a park at no great distance off  the footman alighted and went to the occupant of the carriage a lady about eight or nineandtwenty  she was looking through the opening afforded by a fieldgate at the undulating stretch of country beyond  in pursuance of some remark from her the servant looked in the same direction  the central feature of the middle distance as they beheld it was a circular isolated hill of no great elevation which placed itself in strong chromatic contrast with a wide acreage of surrounding arable by being covered with firtrees  the trees were all of one size and age so that their tips assumed the precise curve of the hill they grew upon this pineclad protuberance was yet further marked out from the general landscape by having on its summit a tower in the form of a classical column which though partly immersed in the plantation rose above the treetops to a considerable height  upon this object the eyes of lady and servant were bent  then there is no road leading near it she asked  nothing nearer than where we are now my lady  then drive home she said after a moment  and the carriage rolled on its way  a few days later the same lady in the same carriage passed that spot again  her eyes as before turned to the distant tower  nobbs she said to the coachman could you find your way home through that field so as to get near the outskirts of the plantation where the column is  the coachman regarded the field  well my lady he observed in dry weather we might drive in there by inching and pinching and so get across by fiveandtwenty acres all being well  but the ground is so heavy after these rains that perhaps it would hardly be safe to try it now  perhaps not she assented indifferently  remember it will you at a drier time  and again the carriage sped along the road the ladys eyes resting on the segmental hill the blue trees that muffled it and the column that formed its apex till they were out of sight  a long time elapsed before that lady drove over the hill again  it was february the soil was now unquestionably dry the weather and scene being in other respects much as they had been before  the familiar shape of the column seemed to remind her that at last an opportunity for a close inspection had arrived  giving her directions she saw the gate opened and after a little manoeuvring the carriage swayed slowly into the uneven field  although the pillar stood upon the hereditary estate of her husband the lady had never visited it owing to its insulation by this wellnigh impracticable ground  the drive to the base of the hill was tedious and jerky and on reaching it she alighted directing that the carriage should be driven back empty over the clods to wait for her on the nearest edge of the field  she then ascended beneath the trees on foot  the column now showed itself as a much more important erection than it had appeared from the road or the park or the windows of welland house her residence hard by whence she had surveyed it hundreds of times without ever feeling a sufficient interest in its details to investigate them  the column had been erected in the last century as a substantial memorial of her husbands greatgrandfather a respectable officer who had fallen in the american war and the reason of her lack of interest was partly owing to her relations with this husband of which more anon it was little beyond the sheer desire for something to dothe chronic desire of her curiously lonely lifethat had brought her here now  she was in a mood to welcome anything that would in some measure disperse an almost killing ennui  she would have welcomed even a misfortune  she had heard that from the summit of the pillar four counties could be seen whatever pleasurable effect was to be derived from looking into four counties she resolved to enjoy today  the firshrouded hilltop was according to some antiquaries an old roman campif it were not as others insisted an old british castle or as the rest swore an old saxon field of witenagemotewith remains of an outer and an inner vallum a winding path leading up between their overlapping ends by an easy ascent  the spikelets from the trees formed a soft carpet over the route and occasionally a brake of brambles barred the interspaces of the trunks  soon she stood immediately at the foot of the column  it had been built in the tuscan order of classic architecture and was really a tower being hollow with steps inside  the gloom and solitude which prevailed round the base were remarkable  the sob of the environing trees was here expressively manifest and moved by the light breeze their thin straight stems rocked in seconds like inverted pendulums while some boughs and twigs rubbed the pillars sides or occasionally clicked in catching each other  below the level of their summits the masonry was lichenstained and mildewed for the sun never pierced that moaning cloud of blueblack vegetation  pads of moss grew in the joints of the stonework and here and there shadeloving insects had engraved on the mortar patterns of no human style or meaning but curious and suggestive  above the trees the case was different the pillar rose into the sky a bright and cheerful thing unimpeded clean and flushed with the sunlight  the spot was seldom visited by a pedestrian except perhaps in the shooting season  the rarity of human intrusion was evidenced by the mazes of rabbitruns the feathers of shy birds the exuvi√¶ of reptiles as also by the wellworn paths of squirrels down the sides of trunks and thence horizontally away  the fact of the plantation being an island in the midst of an arable plain sufficiently accounted for this lack of visitors  few unaccustomed to such places can be aware of the insulating effect of ploughed ground when no necessity compels people to traverse it  this rotund hill of trees and brambles standing in the centre of a ploughed field of some ninety or a hundred acres was probably visited less frequently than a rock would have been visited in a lake of equal extent  she walked round the column to the other side where she found the door through which the interior was reached  the paint if it had ever had any was all washed from the wood and down the decaying surface of the boards liquid rust from the nails and hinges had run in red stains  over the door was a stone tablet bearing apparently letters or words but the inscription whatever it was had been smoothed over with a plaster of lichen  here stood this aspiring piece of masonry erected as the most conspicuous and ineffaceable reminder of a man that could be thought of and yet the whole aspect of the memorial betokened forgetfulness probably not a dozen people within the district knew the name of the person commemorated while perhaps not a soul remembered whether the column were hollow or solid whether with or without a tablet explaining its date and purpose  she herself had lived within a mile of it for the last five years and had never come near it till now  she hesitated to ascend alone but finding that the door was not fastened she pushed it open with her foot and entered  a scrap of writingpaper lay within and arrested her attention by its freshness  some human being then knew the spot despite her surmises  but as the paper had nothing on it no clue was afforded yet feeling herself the proprietor of the column and of all around it her selfassertiveness was sufficient to lead her on  the staircase was lighted by slits in the wall and there was no difficulty in reaching the top the steps being quite unworn  the trapdoor leading on to the roof was open and on looking through it an interesting spectacle met her eye  a youth was sitting on a stool in the centre of the lead flat which formed the summit of the column his eye being applied to the end of a large telescope that stood before him on a tripod  this sort of presence was unexpected and the lady started back into the shade of the opening the only effect produced upon him by her footfall was an impatient wave of the hand which he did without removing his eye from the instrument as if to forbid her to interrupt him  pausing where she stood the lady examined the aspect of the individual who thus made himself so completely at home on a building which she deemed her unquestioned property  he was a youth who might properly have been characterized by a word the judicious chronicler would not readily use in such a connexion preferring to reserve it for raising images of the opposite sex  whether because no deep felicity is likely to arise from the condition or from any other reason to say in these days that a youth is beautiful is not to award him that amount of credit which the expression would have carried with it if he had lived in the times of the classical dictionary  so much indeed is the reverse the case that the assertion creates an awkwardness in saying anything more about him  the beautiful youth usually verges so perilously on the incipient coxcomb who is about to become the lothario or juan among the neighbouring maidens that for the due understanding of our present young man his sublime innocence of any thought concerning his own material aspect or that of others is most fervently asserted and must be as fervently believed  such as he was there the lad sat  the sun shone full in his face and on his head he wore a black velvet skullcap leaving to view below it a curly margin of very light shining hair which accorded well with the flush upon his cheek  he had such a complexion as that with which raffaelle enriches the countenance of the youthful son of zachariasa complexion which though clear is far enough removed from virgin delicacy and suggests plenty of sun and wind as its accompaniment  his features were sufficiently straight in the contours to correct the beholders first impression that the head was the head of a girl  beside him stood a little oak table and in front was the telescope  his visitor had ample time to make these observations and she may have done so all the more keenly through being herself of a totally opposite type  her hair was black as midnight her eyes had no less deep a shade and her complexion showed the richness demanded as a support to these decided features  as she continued to look at the pretty fellow before her apparently so far abstracted into some speculative world as scarcely to know a real one a warmer wave of her warm temperament glowed visibly through her and a qualified observer might from this have hazarded a guess that there was romance blood in her veins  but even the interest attaching to the youth could not arrest her attention for ever and as he made no further signs of moving his eye from the instrument she broke the silence with  what do you seesomething happening somewhere  yes quite a catastrophe he automatically murmured without moving round  what  a cyclone in the sun  the lady paused as if to consider the weight of that event in the scale of terrene life  will it make any difference to us here she asked  the young man by this time seemed to be awakened to the consciousness that somebody unusual was talking to him he turned and started  i beg your pardon he said  i thought it was my relative come to look after me  she often comes about this time  he continued to look at her and forget the sun just such a reciprocity of influence as might have been expected between a dark lady and a flaxen haired youth making itself apparent in the faces of each  dont let me interrupt your observations said she  ah no said he again applying his eye whereupon his face lost the animation which her presence had lent it and became immutable as that of a bust though superadding to the serenity of repose the sensitiveness of life  the expression that settled on him was one of awe  not unaptly might it have been said that he was worshipping the sun  among the various intensities of that worship which have prevailed since the first intelligent being saw the luminary decline westward as the young man now beheld it doing his was not the weakest  he was engaged in what may be called a very chastened or schooled form of that first and most natural of adorations  but would you like to see it he recommenced  it is an event that is witnessed only about once in two or three years though it may occur often enough  she assented and looked through the shaded eyepiece and saw a whirling mass in the centre of which the blazing globe seemed to be laid bare to its core  it was a peep into a maelstrom of fire taking place where nobody had ever been or ever would be  it is the strangest thing i ever beheld she said  then he looked again till wondering who her companion could be she asked are you often here  every night when it is not cloudy and often in the day  ah night of course  the heavens must be beautiful from this point  they are rather more than that  indeed  have you entirely taken possession of this column  entirely  but it is my column she said with smiling asperity  then are you lady constantine wife of the absent sir blount constantine  i am lady constantine  ah then i agree that it is your ladyships  but will you allow me to rent it of you for a time lady constantine  you have taken it whether i allow it or not  however in the interests of science it is advisable that you continue your tenancy  nobody knows you are here i suppose  hardly anybody  he then took her down a few steps into the interior and showed her some ingenious contrivances for stowing articles away  nobody ever comes near the columnor as its called here ringshill speer he continued and when i first came up it nobody had been here for thirty or forty years  the staircase was choked with daws nests and feathers but i cleared them out  i understood the column was always kept locked  yes it has been so  when it was built in 1782 the key was given to my greatgrandfather to keep by him in case visitors should happen to want it  he lived just down there where i live now  he denoted by a nod a little dell lying immediately beyond the ploughed land which environed them  he kept it in his bureau and as the bureau descended to my grandfather my mother and myself the key descended with it  after the first thirty or forty years nobody ever asked for it  one day i saw it lying rusty in its niche and finding that it belonged to this column i took it and came up  i stayed here till it was dark and the stars came out and that night i resolved to be an astronomer  i came back here from school several months ago and i mean to be an astronomer still  he lowered his voice and added  i aim at nothing less than the dignity and office of astronomer royal if i live  perhaps i shall not live  i dont see why you should suppose that said she  how long are you going to make this your observatory  about a year longertill i have obtained a practical familiarity with the heavens  ah if i only had a good equatorial  what is that  a proper instrument for my pursuit  but time is short and science is infinitehow infinite only those who study astronomy fully realizeand perhaps i shall be worn out before i make my mark  she seemed to be greatly struck by the odd mixture in him of scientific earnestness and melancholy mistrust of all things human  perhaps it was owing to the nature of his studies  you are often on this tower alone at night she said  yes at this time of the year particularly and while there is no moon i observe from seven or eight till about two in the morning with a view to my great work on variable stars  but with such a telescope as thiswell i must put up with it  can you see saturns ring and jupiters moons  he said drily that he could manage to do that not without some contempt for the state of her knowledge  i have never seen any planet or star through a telescope  if you will come the first clear night lady constantine i will show you any number  i mean at your express wish not otherwise  i should like to come and possibly may at some time  these stars that vary so muchsometimes evening stars sometimes morning stars sometimes in the east and sometimes in the westhave always interested me  ahnow there is a reason for your not coming  your ignorance of the realities of astronomy is so satisfactory that i will not disturb it except at your serious request  but i wish to be enlightened  let me caution you against it  is enlightenment on the subject then so terrible  yes indeed  she laughingly declared that nothing could have so piqued her curiosity as his statement and turned to descend  he helped her down the stairs and through the briers  he would have gone further and crossed the open cornland with her but she preferred to go alone  he then retraced his way to the top of the column but instead of looking longer at the sun watched her diminishing towards the distant fence behind which waited the carriage  when in the midst of the field a dark spot on an area of brown there crossed her path a moving figure whom it was as difficult to distinguish from the earth he trod as the caterpillar from its leaf by reason of the excellent match between his clothes and the clods  he was one of a dyingout generation who retained the principle nearly unlearnt now that a mans habiliments should be in harmony with his environment  lady constantine and this figure halted beside each other for some minutes then they went on their several ways  the brown person was a labouring man known to the world of welland as haymoss the encrusted form of the word amos to adopt the phrase of philologists  the reason of the halt had been some inquiries addressed to him by lady constantine  who is thatamos fry i think she had asked  yes my lady said haymoss a homely barley driller born under the eaves of your ladyships outbuildings in a manner of speakingthough your ladyship was neither born nor tempted at that time  who lives in the old house behind the plantation  old gammer martin my lady and her grandson  he has neither father nor mother then  not a single one my lady  where was he educated  at warbornea place where they draw up young gamsters brains like rhubarb under a ninepenny pan my lady excusing my common way  they hit so much larning into en that a could talk like the day of pentecost which is a wonderful thing for a simple boy and his mother only the plainest ciphering woman in the world  warborne grammar schoolthats where twas a went to  his father the reverent pason st cleeve made a terrible bruckle hit in s marrying in the sight of the high  he were the curate here my lady for a length o time  oh curate said lady constantine  it was before i knew the village  ay long and merry ago  and he married farmer martins daughtergiles martin a limberish man who used to go rather bad upon his lags if you can mind  i knowed the man well enough who should know en better  the maid was a poor windling thing and though a playward piece o flesh when he married her a socked and sighed and went out like a snoff yes my lady  well when pason st cleeve married this homespun woman the toppermost folk wouldnt speak to his wife  then he dropped a cuss or two and said hed no longer get his living by curing their twopenny souls o such d nonsense as that excusing my common way and he took to farming straightway and then a dropped down dead in a norwest thunderstorm it being saidheeheethat master god was in tantrums wien for leaving his serviceheehee  i give the story as i heard it my lady but be dazed if i believe in such trumpery about folks in the sky nor anything else thats said on em good or bad  well swithin the boy was sent to the grammar school as i say for but what with having two stations of life in his blood hes good for nothing my lady he mopes aboutsometimes here and sometimes there nobody troubles about en  lady constantine thanked her informant and proceeded onward  to her as a woman the most curious feature in the afternoons incident was that this lad of striking beauty scientific attainments and cultivated bearing should be linked on the maternal side with a local agricultural family through his fathers matrimonial eccentricity  a more attractive feature in the case was that the same youth so capable of being ruined by flattery blandishment pleasure even gross prosperity should be at present living on in a primitive eden of unconsciousness with aims towards whose accomplishment a caliban shape would have been as effective as his own    ii   swithin st cleeve lingered on at his post until the more sanguine birds of the plantation already recovering from their midwinter anxieties piped a short evening hymn to the vanishing sun  the landscape was gently concave with the exception of tower and hill there were no points on which late rays might linger and hence the dish shaped ninety acres of tilled land assumed a uniform hue of shade quite suddenly  the one or two stars that appeared were quickly clouded over and it was soon obvious that there would be no sweeping the heavens that night  after tying a piece of tarpaulin which had once seen service on his maternal grandfathers farm over all the apparatus around him he went down the stairs in the dark and locked the door  with the key in his pocket he descended through the underwood on the side of the slope opposite to that trodden by lady constantine and crossed the field in a line mathematically straight and in a manner that left no traces by keeping in the same furrow all the way on tiptoe  in a few minutes he reached a little dell which occurred quite unexpectedly on the other side of the fieldfence and descended to a venerable thatched house whose enormous roof broken up by dormers as big as haycocks could be seen even in the twilight  over the white walls built of chalk in the lump outlines of creepers formed dark patterns as if drawn in charcoal  inside the house his maternal grandmother was sitting by a wood fire before it stood a pipkin in which something was evidently kept warm  an eightlegged oak table in the middle of the room was laid for a meal this woman of eighty in a large mob cap under which she wore a little cap to keep the other clean retained faculties but little blunted  she was gazing into the flames with her hands upon her knees quietly re enacting in her brain certain of the long chain of episodes pathetic tragical and humorous which had constituted the parish history for the last sixty years  on swithins entry she looked up at him in a sideway direction  you should not have waited for me granny he said  tis of no account my child  ive had a nap while sitting here  yes ive had a nap and went straight up into my old country again as usual the place was as natural as when i left iteen just threescore years ago  all the folks and my old aunt were there as when i was a childyet i suppose if i were really to set out and go there hardly a soul would be left alive to say to me dog how art  but tell hannah to stir her stumps and serve supperthough id fain do it myself the poor old soul is getting so unhandy  hannah revealed herself to be much nimbler and several years younger than granny though of this the latter seemed to be oblivious  when the meal was nearly over mrs martin produced the contents of the mysterious vessel by the fire saying that she had caused it to be brought in from the back kitchen because hannah was hardly to be trusted with such things she was becoming so childish  what is it then said swithin  oh one of your special puddings  at sight of it however he added reproachfully now granny  instead of being round it was in shape an irregular boulder that had been exposed to the weather for centuriesa little scrap pared off here and a little piece broken away there the general aim being nevertheless to avoid destroying the symmetry of the pudding while taking as much as possible of its substance  the fact is added swithin the pudding is half gone  ive only sliced off the merest paring once or twice to taste if it was well done pleaded granny martin with wounded feelings  i said to hannah when she took it up put it here to keep it warm as theres a better fire than in the back kitchen  well i am not going to eat any of it said swithin decisively as he rose from the table pushed away his chair and went upstairs the other station of life that was in his blood and which had been brought out by the grammar school probably stimulating him  ah the world is an ungrateful place  twas a pity i didnt take my poor name off this earthly calendar and creep under ground sixty long years ago instead of leaving my own county to come here mourned old mrs martin  but i told his mother how twould bemarrying so many notches above her  the child was sure to chaw high like his father  when swithin had been upstairs a minute or two however he altered his mind and coming down again ate all the pudding with the aspect of a person undertaking a deed of great magnanimity  the relish with which he did so restored the unison that knew no more serious interruptions than such as this  mr torkingham has been here this afternoon said his grandmother and he wants me to let him meet some of the choir here tonight for practice they who live at this end of the parish wont go to his house to try over the tunes because tis so far they say and so tis poor men  so hes going to see what coming to them will do  he asks if you would like to join  i would if i had not so much to do  but it is cloudy tonight  yes but i have calculations without end granny  now dont you tell him im in the house will you and then hell not ask for me  but if he should must i then tell a lie lord forgive me  no you can say im upstairs he must think what he likes  not a word about the astronomy to any of them whatever you do  i should be called a visionary and all sorts  so thou beest child  why cant ye do something thats of use  at the sound of footsteps swithin beat a hasty retreat upstairs where he struck a light and revealed a table covered with books and papers while round the walls hung starmaps and other diagrams illustrative of celestial phenomena  in a corner stood a huge pasteboard tube which a close inspection would have shown to be intended for a telescope  swithin hung a thick cloth over the window in addition to the curtains and sat down to his papers  on the ceiling was a black stain of smoke and under this he placed his lamp evidencing that the midnight oil was consumed on that precise spot very often  meanwhile there had entered to the room below a personage who to judge from her voice and the quick pitpat of her feet was a maiden young and blithe  mrs martin welcomed her by the title of miss tabitha lark and inquired what wind had brought her that way to which the visitor replied that she had come for the singing  sit ye down then said granny  and do you still go to the house to read to my lady  yes i go and read mrs martin but as to getting my lady to hearken thats more than a team of six horses could force her to do  the girl had a remarkably smart and fluent utterance which was probably a cause or a consequence of her vocation  tis the same story then said grandmother martin  yes  eaten out with listlessness  shes neither sick nor sorry but how dull and dreary she is only herself can tell  when i get there in the morning there she is sitting up in bed for my lady dont care to get up and then she makes me bring this book and that book till the bed is heaped up with immense volumes that half bury her making her look as she leans upon her elbow like the stoning of stephen  she yawns then she looks towards the tall glass then she looks out at the weather mooning her great black eyes and fixing them on the sky as if they stuck there while my tongue goes flickflack along a hundred and fifty words a minute then she looks at the clock then she asks me what ive been reading  ah poor soul said granny  no doubt she says in the morning would god it were evening and in the evening would god it were morning like the disobedient woman in deuteronomy  swithin in the room overhead had suspended his calculations for the duologue interested him  there now crunched heavier steps outside the door and his grandmother could be heard greeting sundry local representatives of the bass and tenor voice who lent a cheerful and well known personality to the names sammy blore nat chapman hezekiah biles and haymoss fry the latter being one with whom the reader has already a distant acquaintance besides these came small producers of treble who had not yet developed into such distinctive units of society as to require particularizing  is the good man come asked nat chapman  noi see we be here afore him  and how is it with aged women tonight mrs martin  tedious traipsing enough with this one nat  sit ye down  well little freddy you dont wish in the morning that twere evening and at evening that twere morning again do you freddy trust ye for it  now who might wish such a thing as that mrs martinnobody in this parish asked sammy blore curiously  my lady is always wishing it spoke up miss tabitha lark  oh she  nobody can be answerable for the wishes of that onnatural tribe of mankind  not but that the womans heartstrings is tried in many aggravating ways  ah poor woman said granny  the state she finds herself inneither maid wife nor widow as you may sayis not the primest form of life for keeping in good spirits  how long is it since she has heard from sir blount tabitha  two years and more said the young woman  he went into one side of africa as it might be three st martins days back  i can mind it because twas my birthday  and he meant to come out the other side  but he didnt  he has never come out at all  for all the world like losing a rat in a barleymow said hezekiah hes lost though you know where he is  his comrades nodded  ay my lady is a walking weariness  i seed her yawn just at the very moment when the fox was halloaed away by lornton copse and the hounds runned en all but past her carriage wheels  if i were she id see a little life though theres no fair clubwalking nor feast to speak of till easter weekthats true  she dares not  shes under solemn oath to do no such thing  be cust if i would keep any such oath  but heres the pason if my ears dont deceive me  there was a noise of horses hoofs without a stumbling against the door scraper a tethering to the windowshutter a creaking of the door on its hinges and a voice which swithin recognized as mr torkinghams  he greeted each of the previous arrivals by name and stated that he was glad to see them all so punctually assembled  ay sir said haymoss fry  tis only my jints that have kept me from assembling myself long ago  id assemble upon the top of welland steeple if twerent for my jints  i assure ye pason tarkenham that in the clitch o my knees where the rain used to come through when i was cutting clots for the new lawn in old my ladys time tis as if rats wez gnawing every now and then  when a fellers young hes too small in the brain to see how soon a constitution can be squandered worse luck  true said biles to fill the time while the parson was engaged in finding the psalms  a mans a fool till hes forty  often have i thought when haypitching and the small of my back seeming no stouter than a harnets the devil send that i had but the making of labouring men for a twelvemonth  id gie every man jack two good backbones even if the alteration was as wrong as forgery  fourfour backbones said haymoss decisively  yes four threw in sammy blore with additional weight of experience for you want one in front for breastploughing and such like one at the right side for grounddressing and one at the left side for turning mixens  well then next id move every mans wyndpipe a good span away from his glutchpipe so that at harvest time he could fetch breath in s drinking without being choked and strangled as he is now  thinks i when i feel the victuals going  now well begin interrupted mr torkingham his mind returning to this world again on concluding his search for a hymn  thereupon the racket of chairlegs on the floor signified that they were settling into their seatsa disturbance which swithin took advantage of by going on tiptoe across the floor above and putting sheets of paper over knotholes in the boarding at points where carpet was lacking that his lamplight might not shine down  the absence of a ceiling beneath rendered his position virtually that of one suspended in the same apartment  the parson announced the tune and his voice burst forth with onward christian soldiers in notes of rigid cheerfulness  in this start however he was joined only by the girls and boys the men furnishing but an accompaniment of ahas and hems  mr torkingham stopped and sammy blore spoke  beg your pardon sirif youll deal mild with us a moment  what with the wind and walking my throats as rough as a grater and not knowing you were going to hit up that minute i hadnt hawked and i dont think hezzy and nat had eitherhad ye souls  i hadnt got thorough ready thats true said hezekiah  quite right of you then to speak said mr torkingham  dont mind explaining we are here for practice  now clear your throats then and at it again  there was a noise as of atmospheric hoes and scrapers and the bass contingent at last got under way with a time of its own  honwerd christen sojers  ah thats where we are so defectivethe pronunciation interrupted the parson  now repeat after me onward christian soldiers  the choir repeated like an exaggerative echo onwed christing sol jaws  better said the parson in the strenuously sanguine tones of a man who got his living by discovering a bright side in things where it was not very perceptible to other people  but it should not be given with quite so extreme an accent or we may be called affected by other parishes and nathaniel chapman theres a jauntiness in your manner of singing which is not quite becoming  why dont you sing more earnestly  my conscience wont let me sir  they say every man for himself but thank god im not so mean as to lessen old fokes chances by being earnest at my time o life and they so much nearer the need ot  its bad reasoning nat i fear  now perhaps we had better solfa the tune  eyes on your books please  solsol fafa mi  i cant sing like that not i said sammy blore with condemnatory astonishment  i can sing genuine music like f and g but not anything so much out of the order of nater as that  perhaps youve brought the wrong book sir chimed in haymoss kindly ive knowed music early in life and latein short ever since luke sneap broke his new fiddlebow in the wedding psalm when pason wilton brought home his bride you can mind the time sammywhen we sung his wife like a fair fertile vine her lovely fruit shall bring when the young woman turned as red as a rose not knowing twas coming  ive knowed music ever since then i say sir and never heard the like o that  every martel note had his name of a b c at that time  yes yes men but this is a more recent system  still you cant alter a oldestablished note thats a or b by nater rejoined haymoss with yet deeper conviction that mr torkingham was getting off his head  now sound a neighbour sammy and lets have a slap at christen sojers again and show the pason the true way  sammy produced a private tuningfork black and grimy which being about seventy years of age and wrought before pianoforte builders had sent up the pitch to make their instruments brilliant was nearly a note flatter than the parsons  while an argument as to the true pitch was in progress there came a knocking without  somebodys at the door said a little treble girl  thought i heard a knock before said the relieved choir  the latch was lifted and a man asked from the darkness is mr torkingham here  yes mills  what do you want  it was the parsons man  oh if you please said mills showing an advanced margin of himself round the door lady constantine wants to see you very particular sir and could you call on her after dinner if you bent engaged with poor fokes  shes just had a letterso they sayand its about that i believe  finding on looking at his watch that it was necessary to start at once if he meant to see her that night the parson cut short the practising and naming another night for meeting he withdrew  all the singers assisted him on to his cob and watched him till he disappeared over the edge of the bottom    iii   mr torkingham trotted briskly onward to his house a distance of about a mile each cottage as it revealed its halfburied position by its single light appearing like a oneeyed night creature watching him from an ambush  leaving his horse at the parsonage he performed the remainder of the journey on foot crossing the park towards welland house by a stile and path till he struck into the drive near the north door of the mansion  this drive it may be remarked was also the common highway to the lower village and hence lady constantines residence and park as is occasionally the case with oldfashioned manors possessed none of the exclusiveness found in some aristocratic settlements  the parishioners looked upon the park avenue as their natural thoroughfare particularly for christenings weddings and funerals which passed the squires mansion with due considerations as to the scenic effect of the same from the manor windows  hence the house of constantine when going out from its breakfast had been continually crossed on the doorstep for the last two hundred years by the houses of hodge and giles in full cry to dinner at present these collisions were but too infrequent for though the villagers passed the north front door as regularly as ever they seldom met a constantine  only one was there to be met and she had no zest for outings before noon  the long low front of the great house as it was called by the parish stretching from end to end of the terrace was in darkness as the vicar slackened his pace before it and only the distant fall of water disturbed the stillness of the manorial precincts  on gaining admittance he found lady constantine waiting to receive him she wore a heavy dress of velvet and lace and being the only person in the spacious apartment she looked small and isolated  in her left hand she held a letter and a couple of athome cards  the soft dark eyes which she raised to him as he enteredlarge and melancholy by circumstance far more than by qualitywere the natural indices of a warm and affectionate perhaps slightly voluptuous temperament languishing for want of something to do cherish or suffer for  mr torkingham seated himself  his boots which had seemed elegant in the farmhouse appeared rather clumsy here and his coat that was a model of tailoring when he stood amid the choir now exhibited decidedly strained relations with his limbs  three years had passed since his induction to the living of welland but he had never as yet found means to establish that reciprocity with lady constantine which usually grows up in the course of time between parsonage and manorhouseunless indeed either side should surprise the other by showing respectively a weakness for awkward modern ideas on landownership or on church formulas which had not been the case here  the present meeting however seemed likely to initiate such a reciprocity  there was an appearance of confidence on lady constantines face she said she was so very glad that he had come and looking down at the letter in her hand was on the point of pulling it from its envelope but she did not  after a moment she went on more quickly i wanted your advice or rather your opinion on a serious matteron a point of conscience  saying which she laid down the letter and looked at the cards  it might have been apparent to a more penetrating eye than the vicars that lady constantine either from timidity misgiving or reconviction had swerved from her intended communication or perhaps decided to begin at the other end  the parson who had been expecting a question on some local business or intelligence at the tenor of her words altered his face to the higher branch of his profession  i hope i may find myself of service on that or any other question he said gently  i hope so  you may possibly be aware mr torkingham that my husband sir blount constantine was not to mince matters a mistakensomewhat jealous man  yet you may hardly have discerned it in the short time you knew him  i had some little knowledge of sir blounts character in that respect  well on this account my married life with him was not of the most comfortable kind  lady constantines voice dropped to a more pathetic note  i am sure i gave him no cause for suspicion though had i known his disposition sooner i should hardly have dared to marry him  but his jealousy and doubt of me were not so strong as to divert him from a purpose of hisa mania for african lionhunting which he dignified by calling it a scheme of geographical discovery for he was inordinately anxious to make a name for himself in that field  it was the one passion that was stronger than his mistrust of me  before going away he sat down with me in this room and read me a lecture which resulted in a very rash offer on my part  when i tell it to you you will find that it provides a key to all that is unusual in my life here  he bade me consider what my position would be when he was gone hoped that i should remember what was due to himthat i would not so behave towards other men as to bring the name of constantine into suspicion and charged me to avoid levity of conduct in attending any ball rout or dinner to which i might be invited  i in some contempt for his low opinion of me volunteered there and then to live like a cloistered nun during his absence to go into no society whateverscarce even to a neighbours dinnerparty and demanded bitterly if that would satisfy him  he said yes held me to my word and gave me no loophole for retracting it  the inevitable fruits of precipitancy have resulted to me my life has become a burden  i get such invitations as these holding up the cards but i so invariably refuse them that they are getting very rare     i ask you can i honestly break that promise to my husband  mr torkingham seemed embarrassed  if you promised sir blount constantine to live in solitude till he comes back you are it seems to me bound by that promise  i fear that the wish to be released from your engagement is to some extent a reason why it should be kept  but your own conscience would surely be the best guide lady constantine  my conscience is quite bewildered with its responsibilities she continued with a sigh  yet it certainly does sometimes say to me thatthat i ought to keep my word  very well i must go on as i am going i suppose  if you respect a vow i think you must respect your own said the parson acquiring some further firmness  had it been wrung from you by compulsion moral or physical it would have been open to you to break it  but as you proposed a vow when your husband only required a good intention i think you ought to adhere to it or what is the pride worth that led you to offer it  very well she said with resignation  but it was quite a work of supererogation on my part  that you proposed it in a supererogatory spirit does not lessen your obligation having once put yourself under that obligation  st paul in his epistle to the hebrews says an oath for confirmation is an end of all strife  and you will readily recall the words of ecclesiastes pay that which thou hast vowed  better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay  why not write to sir blount tell him the inconvenience of such a bond and ask him to release you  no never will i  the expression of such a desire would in his mind be a sufficient reason for disallowing it  ill keep my word  mr torkingham rose to leave  after she had held out her hand to him when he had crossed the room and was within two steps of the door she said mr torkingham  he stopped  what i have told you is only the least part of what i sent for you to tell you  mr torkingham walked back to her side  what is the rest of it then he asked with grave surprise  it is a true revelation as far as it goes but there is something more i have received this letter and i wanted to saysomething  then say it now my dear lady  no she answered with a look of utter inability  i cannot speak of it now  some other time  dont stay  please consider this conversation as private  goodnight    iv   it was a bright starlight night a week or ten days later  there had been several such nights since the occasion of lady constantines promise to swithin st cleeve to come and study astronomical phenomena on the ringshill column but she had not gone there  this evening she sat at a window the blind of which had not been drawn down  her elbow rested on a little table and her cheek on her hand  her eyes were attracted by the brightness of the planet jupiter as he rode in the ecliptic opposite beaming down upon her as if desirous of notice  beneath the planet could be still discerned the dark edges of the park landscape against the sky  as one of its features though nearly screened by the trees which had been planted to shut out the fallow tracts of the estate rose the upper part of the column  it was hardly visible now even if visible at all yet lady constantine knew from daytime experience its exact bearing from the window at which she leaned the knowledge that there it still was despite its rapid envelopment by the shades led her lonely mind to her late meeting on its summit with the young astronomer and to her promise to honour him with a visit for learning some secrets about the scintillating bodies overhead  the curious juxtaposition of youthful ardour and old despair that she had found in the lad would have made him interesting to a woman of perception apart from his fair hair and earlychristian face  but such is the heightening touch of memory that his beauty was probably richer in her imagination than in the real  it was a moot point to consider whether the temptations that would be brought to bear upon him in his course would exceed the staying power of his nature  had he been a wealthy youth he would have seemed one to tremble for  in spite of his attractive ambitions and gentlemanly bearing she thought it would possibly be better for him if he never became known outside his lonely towerforgetting that he had received such intellectual enlargement as would probably make his continuance in welland seem in his own eye a slight upon his fathers branch of his family whose social standing had been only a few years earlier but little removed from her own  suddenly she flung a cloak about her and went out on the terrace  she passed down the steps to the lower lawn through the door to the open park and there stood still  the tower was now discernible  as the words in which a thought is expressed develop a further thought so did the fact of her having got so far influence her to go further  a person who had casually observed her gait would have thought it irregular and the lessenings and increasings of speed with which she proceeded in the direction of the pillar could be accounted for only by a motive much more disturbing than an intention to look through a telescope  thus she went on till leaving the park she crossed the turnpikeroad and entered the large field in the middle of which the firclad hill stood like mont st michel in its bay  the stars were so bright as distinctly to show her the place and now she could see a faint light at the top of the column which rose like a shadowy finger pointing to the upper constellations  there was no wind in a human sense but a steady stertorous breathing from the firtrees showed that now as always there was movement in apparent stagnation nothing but an absolute vacuum could paralyze their utterance  the door of the tower was shut  it was something more than the freakishness which is engendered by a sickening monotony that had led lady constantine thus far and hence she made no ado about admitting herself  three years ago when her every action was a thing of propriety she had known of no possible purpose which could have led her abroad in a manner such as this  she ascended the tower noiselessly  on raising her head above the hatchway she beheld swithin bending over a scroll of paper which lay on the little table beside him  the small lantern that illuminated it showed also that he was warmly wrapped up in a coat and thick cap behind him standing the telescope on its frame  what was he doing  she looked over his shoulder upon the paper and saw figures and signs  when he had jotted down something he went to the telescope again  what are you doing tonight she said in a low voice  swithin started and turned  the faint lamplight was sufficient to reveal her face to him  tedious work lady constantine he answered without betraying much surprise  doing my best to watch phenomenal stars as i may call them  you said you would show me the heavens if i could come on a starlight night  i have come  swithin as a preliminary swept round the telescope to jupiter and exhibited to her the glory of that orb  then he directed the instrument to the less bright shape of saturn  here he said warming up to the subject we see a world which is to my mind by far the most wonderful in the solar system  think of streams of satellites or meteors racing round and round the planet like a fly wheel so close together as to seem solid matter  he entered further and further into the subject his ideas gathering momentum as he went on like his pet heavenly bodies  when he paused for breath she said in tones very different from his own i ought now to tell you that though i am interested in the stars they were not what i came to see you about     i first thought of disclosing the matter to mr torkingham but i altered my mind and decided on you  she spoke in so low a voice that he might not have heard her  at all events abstracted by his grand theme he did not heed her  he continued  well we will get outside the solar system altogetherleave the whole group of sun primary and secondary planets quite behind us in our flight as a bird might leave its bush and sweep into the whole forest now what do you see lady constantine  he levelled the achromatic at sirius  she said that she saw a bright star though it only seemed a point of light now as before  thats because it is so distant that no magnifying will bring its size up to zero  though called a fixed star it is like all fixed stars moving with inconceivable velocity but no magnifying will show that velocity as anything but rest  and thus they talked on about sirius and then about other stars           in the scrowl    of all those beasts and fish and fowl    with which like indian plantations    the learned stock the constellations  till he asked her how many stars she thought were visible to them at that moment  she looked around over the magnificent stretch of sky that their high position unfolded  oh thousands hundreds of thousands she said absently  no  there are only about three thousand  now how many do you think are brought within sight by the help of a powerful telescope  i wont guess  twenty millions  so that whatever the stars were made for they were not made to please our eyes  it is just the same in everything nothing is made for man  is it that notion which makes you so sad for your age she asked with almost maternal solicitude  i think astronomy is a bad study for you it makes you feel human insignificance too plainly  perhaps it does  however he added more cheerfully though i feel the study to be one almost tragic in its quality i hope to be the new copernicus  what he was to the solar system i aim to be to the systems beyond  then by means of the instrument at hand they travelled together from the earth to uranus and the mysterious outskirts of the solar system from the solar system to a star in the swan the nearest fixed star in the northern sky from the star in the swan to remoter stars thence to the remotest visible till the ghastly chasm which they had bridged by a fragile line of sight was realized by lady constantine  we are now traversing distances beside which the immense line stretching from the earth to the sun is but an invisible point said the youth when just now we had reached a planet whose remoteness is a hundred times the remoteness of the sun from the earth we were only a two thousandth part of the journey to the spot at which we have optically arrived now  oh pray dont it overpowers me she replied not without seriousness it makes me feel that it is not worth while to live it quite annihilates me  if it annihilates your ladyship to roam over these yawning spaces just once think how it must annihilate me to be as it were in constant suspension amid them night after night  yes     it was not really this subject that i came to see you upon mr st cleeve she began a second time  it was a personal matter  i am listening lady constantine  i will tell it you  yet nonot this moment  let us finish this grand subject first it dwarfs mine  it would have been difficult to judge from her accents whether she were afraid to broach her own matter or really interested in his  or a certain youthful pride that he evidenced at being the elucidator of such a large theme and at having drawn her there to hear and observe it may have inclined her to indulge him for kindness sake  thereupon he took exception to her use of the word grand as descriptive of the actual universe  the imaginary picture of the sky as the concavity of a dome whose base extends from horizon to horizon of our earth is grand simply grand and i wish i had never got beyond looking at it in that way  but the actual sky is a horror  a new view of our old friends the stars she said smiling up at them  but such an obviously true one said the young man  you would hardly think at first that horrid monsters lie up there waiting to be discovered by any moderately penetrating mindmonsters to which those of the oceans bear no sort of comparison  what monsters may they be  impersonal monsters namely immensities  until a person has thought out the stars and their interspaces he has hardly learnt that there are things much more terrible than monsters of shape namely monsters of magnitude without known shape  such monsters are the voids and waste places of the sky  look for instance at those pieces of darkness in the milky way he went on pointing with his finger to where the galaxy stretched across over their heads with the luminousness of a frosted web you see that dark opening in it near the swan  there is a still more remarkable one south of the equator called the coal sack as a sort of nickname that has a farcical force from its very inadequacy  in these our sight plunges quite beyond any twinkler we have yet visited  those are deep wells for the human mind to let itself down into leave alone the human body and think of the side caverns and secondary abysses to right and left as you pass on  lady constantine was heedful and silent  he tried to give her yet another idea of the size of the universe never was there a more ardent endeavour to bring down the immeasurable to human comprehension  by figures of speech and apt comparisons he took her mind into leadingstrings compelling her to follow him into wildernesses of which she had never in her life even realized the existence  there is a size at which dignity begins he exclaimed further on there is a size at which grandeur begins further on there is a size at which solemnity begins further on a size at which awfulness begins further on a size at which ghastliness begins  that size faintly approaches the size of the stellar universe  so am i not right in saying that those minds who exert their imaginative powers to bury themselves in the depths of that universe merely strain their faculties to gain a new horror  standing as she stood in the presence of the stellar universe under the very eyes of the constellations lady constantine apprehended something of the earnest youths argument  and to add a new weirdness to what the sky possesses in its size and formlessness there is involved the quality of decay  for all the wonder of these everlasting stars eternal spheres and what not they are not everlasting they are not eternal they burn out like candles  you see that dying one in the body of the greater bear  two centuries ago it was as bright as the others  the senses may become terrified by plunging among them as they are but there is a pitifulness even in their glory imagine them all extinguished and your mind feeling its way through a heaven of total darkness occasionally striking against the black invisible cinders of those stars     if you are cheerful and wish to remain so leave the study of astronomy alone  of all the sciences it alone deserves the character of the terrible  i am not altogether cheerful  then if on the other hand you are restless and anxious about the future study astronomy at once  your troubles will be reduced amazingly  but your study will reduce them in a singular way by reducing the importance of everything  so that the science is still terrible even as a panacea  it is quite impossible to think at all adequately of the skyof what the sky substantially is without feeling it as a juxtaposed nightmare  it is betterfar betterfor men to forget the universe than to bear it clearly in mind     but you say the universe was not really what you came to see me about  what was it may i ask lady constantine  she mused and sighed and turned to him with something pathetic in her  the immensity of the subject you have engaged me on has completely crushed my subject out of me  yours is celestial mine lamentably human and the less must give way to the greater  but is it in a human sense and apart from macrocosmic magnitudes important he inquired at last attracted by her manner for he began to perceive in spite of his prepossession that she had really something on her mind  it is as important as personal troubles usually are  notwithstanding her preconceived notion of coming to swithin as employer to dependant as chatelaine to page she was falling into confidential intercourse with him  his vast and romantic endeavours lent him a personal force and charm which she could not but apprehend  in the presence of the immensities that his young mind had as it were brought down from above to hers they became unconsciously equal  there was moreover an inborn liking in lady constantine to dwell less on her permanent position as a county lady than on her passing emotions as a woman  i will postpone the matter i came to charge you with she resumed smiling  i must reconsider it  now i will return  allow me to show you out through the trees and across the fields  she said neither a distinct yes nor no and descending the tower they threaded the firs and crossed the ploughed field  by an odd coincidence he remarked when they drew near the great house  you may possibly be interested in knowing lady constantine that that mediumsized star you see over there low down in the south is precisely over sir blount constantines head in the middle of africa  how very strange that you should have said so she answered  you have broached for me the very subject i had come to speak of  on a domestic matter he said with surprise  yes  what a small matter it seems now after our astronomical stupendousness and yet on my way to you it so far transcended the ordinary matters of my life as the subject you have led me up to transcends this  but with a little laugh i will endeavour to sink down to such ephemeral trivialities as human tragedy and explain since i have come  the point is i want a helper no woman ever wanted one more  for days i have wanted a trusty friend who could go on a secret errand for me  it is necessary that my messenger should be educated should be intelligent should be silent as the grave  do you give me your solemn promise as to the last point if i confide in you  most emphatically lady constantine  your right hand upon the compact  he gave his hand and raised hers to his lips  in addition to his respect for her as the lady of the manor there was the admiration of twenty years for twentyeight or nine in such relations  i trust you she said  now beyond the above conditions it was specially necessary that my agent should have known sir blount constantine well by sight when he was at home  for the errand is concerning my husband i am much disturbed at what i have heard about him  i am indeed sorry to know it  there are only two people in the parish who fulfil all the conditionsmr torkingham and yourself  i sent for mr torkingham and he came  i could not tell him  i felt at the last moment that he wouldnt do  i have come to you because i think you will do  this is it my husband has led me and all the world to believe that he is in africa hunting lions  i have had a mysterious letter informing me that he has been seen in london in very peculiar circumstances  the truth of this i want ascertained  will you go on the journey  personally i would go to the end of the world for you lady constantine but  no buts  how can i leave  why not  i am preparing a work on variable stars  there is one of these which i have exceptionally observed for several months and on this my great theory is mainly based  it has been hitherto called irregular but i have detected a periodicity in its socalled irregularities which if proved would add some very valuable facts to those known on this subject one of the most interesting perplexing and suggestive in the whole field of astronomy  now to clinch my theory there should be a sudden variation this weekor at latest next weekand i have to watch every night not to let it pass  you see my reason for declining lady constantine  young men are always so selfish she said  it might ruin the whole of my years labour if i leave now returned the youth greatly hurt  could you not wait a fortnight longer  nono  dont think that i have asked you pray  i have no wish to inconvenience you  lady constantine dont be angry with me  will you do thiswatch the star for me while i am gone  if you are prepared to do it effectually i will go  will it be much trouble  it will be some trouble  you would have to come here every clear evening about nine  if the sky were not clear then you would have to come at four in the morning should the clouds have dispersed  could not the telescope be brought to my house  swithin shook his head  perhaps you did not observe its real sizethat it was fixed to a frame work  i could not afford to buy an equatorial and i have been obliged to rig up an apparatus of my own devising so as to make it in some measure answer the purpose of an equatorial  it could be moved but i would rather not touch it  well ill go to the telescope she went on with an emphasis that was not wholly playful  you are the most ungallant youth i ever met with but i suppose i must set that down to science  yes ill go to the tower at nine every night  and alone  i should prefer to keep my pursuits there unknown  and alone she answered quite overborne by his inflexibility  you will not miss the morning observation if it should be necessary  i have given my word  and i give mine  i suppose i ought not to have been so exacting  he spoke with that sudden emotional sense of his own insignificance which made these alternations of mood possible  i will go anywheredo anything for youthis momenttomorrow or at any time  but you must return with me to the tower and let me show you the observing process  they retraced their steps the tender hoarfrost taking the imprint of their feet while two stars in the twins looked down upon their two persons through the trees as if those two persons could bear some sort of comparison with them  on the tower the instructions were given  when all was over and he was again conducting her to the great house she said  when can you start  now said swithin  so much the better  you shall go up by the night mail    v   on the third morning after the young mans departure lady constantine opened the postbag anxiously  though she had risen before four oclock and crossed to the tower through the gray halflight when every blade and twig were furred with rime she felt no languor  expectation could banish at cockcrow the eyeheaviness which apathy had been unable to disperse all the day long  there was as she had hoped a letter from swithin st cleeve     dear lady constantinei have quite succeeded in my mission and    shall return tomorrow at 10 pm  i hope you have not failed in the    observations  watching the star through an operaglass sunday night    i fancied some change had taken place but i could not make myself    sure  your memoranda for that night i await with impatience  please    dont neglect to write down at the moment all remarkable    appearances both as to colour and intensity and be very exact as to    time which correct in the way i showed youi am dear lady    constantine yours most faithfully     swithin st cleeve  not another word in the letter about his errand his mind ran on nothing but this astronomical subject  he had succeeded in his mission and yet he did not even say yes or no to the great questionwhether or not her husband was masquerading in london at the address she had given  was ever anything so provoking she cried  however the time was not long to wait  his way homeward would lie within a stonesthrow of the manorhouse and though for certain reasons she had forbidden him to call at the late hour of his arrival she could easily intercept him in the avenue  at twenty minutes past ten she went out into the drive and stood in the dark  seven minutes later she heard his footstep and saw his outline in the slit of light between the avenue trees  he had a valise in one hand a greatcoat on his arm and under his arm a parcel which seemed to be very precious from the manner in which he held it  lady constantine he asked softly  yes she said in her excitement holding out both her hands though he had plainly not expected her to offer one  did you watch the star  ill tell you everything in detail but pray your errand first  yes its all right  did you watch every night not missing one  i forgot to gotwice she murmured contritely  oh lady constantine he cried in dismay  how could you serve me so what shall i do  please forgive me  indeed i could not help it  i had watched and watched and nothing happened and somehow my vigilance relaxed when i found nothing was likely to take place in the star  but the very circumstance of it not having happened made it all the more likely every day  have youseen she began imploringly  swithin sighed lowered his thoughts to sublunary things and told briefly the story of his journey  sir blount constantine was not in london at the address which had been anonymously sent her  it was a mistake of identity  the person who had been seen there swithin had sought out  he resembled sir blount strongly but he was a stranger  how can i reward you she exclaimed when he had done  in no way but by giving me your good wishes in what i am going to tell you on my own account  he spoke in tones of mysterious exultation this parcel is going to make my fame  what is it  a huge objectglass for the great telescope i am so busy about  such a magnificent aid to science has never entered this county before you may depend  he produced from under his arm the carefully cuddledup package which was in shape a round flat disk like a dinnerplate tied in paper  proceeding to explain his plans to her more fully he walked with her towards the door by which she had emerged  it was a little side wicket through a wall dividing the open park from the garden terraces  here for a moment he placed his valise and parcel on the coping of the stone balustrade till he had bidden her farewell  then he turned and in laying hold of his bag by the dim light pushed the parcel over the parapet  it fell smash upon the paved walk ten or a dozen feet beneath  oh good heavens he cried in anguish  what  my objectglass broken  is it of much value  it cost all i possess  he ran round by the steps to the lower lawn lady constantine following as he continued it is a magnificent eightinch first quality object lens  i took advantage of my journey to london to get it  i have been six weeks making the tube of milled board and as i had not enough money by twelve pounds for the lens i borrowed it of my grandmother out of her last annuity payment  what can be can be done  perhaps it is not broken  he felt on the ground found the parcel and shook it  a clicking noise issued from inside  swithin smote his forehead with his hand and walked up and down like a mad fellow  my telescope  i have waited nine months for this lens  now the possibility of setting up a really powerful instrument is over  it is too cruelhow could it happen     lady constantine i am ashamed of myselfbefore you  oh but lady constantine if you only knew what it is to a person engaged in science to have the means of clinching a theory snatched away at the last moment  it is i against the world and when the world has accidents on its side in addition to its natural strength what chance for me  the young astronomer leant against the wall and was silent  his misery was of an intensity and kind with that of palissy in these struggles with an adverse fate  dont mind itpray dont said lady constantine  it is dreadfully unfortunate  you have my whole sympathy  can it be mended  mendedno no  cannot you do with your present one a little longer  it is altogether inferior cheap and bad  ill get you anotheryes indeed i will  allow me to get you another as soon as possible  ill do anything to assist you out of your trouble for i am most anxious to see you famous  i know you will be a great astronomer in spite of this mishap  come say i may get a new one  swithin took her hand  he could not trust himself to speak        some days later a little box of peculiar kind came to the great house  it was addressed to lady constantine with great care  she had it partly opened and taken to her own little writingroom and after lunch when she had dressed for walking she took from the box a paper parcel like the one which had met with the accident  this she hid under her mantle as if she had stolen it and going out slowly across the lawn passed through the little door before spoken of and was soon hastening in the direction of the ringshill column  there was a bright sun overhead on that afternoon of early spring and its rays shed an unusual warmth on southwest aspects though shady places still retained the look and feel of winter  rooks were already beginning to build new nests or to mend up old ones and clamorously called in neighbours to give opinions on difficulties in their architecture  lady constantine swerved once from her path as if she had decided to go to the homestead where swithin lived but on second thoughts she bent her steps to the column  drawing near it she looked up but by reason of the height of the parapet nobody could be seen thereon who did not stand on tiptoe  she thought however that her young friend might possibly see her if he were there and come down and that he was there she soon ascertained by finding the door unlocked and the key inside  no movement however reached her ears from above and she began to ascend  meanwhile affairs at the top of the column had progressed as follows  the afternoon being exceptionally fine swithin had ascended about two oclock and seating himself at the little table which he had constructed on the spot he began reading over his notes and examining some astronomical journals that had reached him in the morning  the sun blazed into the hollow roofspace as into a tub and the sides kept out every breeze  though the month was february below it was may in the abacus of the column  this state of the atmosphere and the fact that on the previous night he had pursued his observations till past two oclock produced in him at the end of half an hour an overpowering inclination to sleep  spreading on the leadwork a thick rug which he kept up there he flung himself down against the parapet and was soon in a state of unconsciousness  it was about ten minutes afterwards that a soft rustle of silken clothes came up the spiral staircase and hesitating onwards reached the orifice where appeared the form of lady constantine  she did not at first perceive that he was present and stood still to reconnoitre  her eye glanced over his telescope now wrapped up his table and papers his observingchair and his contrivances for making the best of a deficiency of instruments  all was warm sunny and silent except that a solitary bee which had somehow got within the hollow of the abacus was singing round inquiringly unable to discern that ascent was the only mode of escape  in another moment she beheld the astronomer lying in the sun like a sailor in the maintop  lady constantine coughed slightly he did not awake  she then entered and drawing the parcel from beneath her cloak placed it on the table after this she waited looking for a long time at his sleeping face which had a very interesting appearance  she seemed reluctant to leave yet wanted resolution to wake him and pencilling his name on the parcel she withdrew to the staircase where the brushing of her dress decreased to silence as she receded round and round on her way to the base  swithin still slept on and presently the rustle began again in the far down interior of the column  the door could be heard closing and the rustle came nearer showing that she had shut herself inno doubt to lessen the risk of an accidental surprise by any roaming villager  when lady constantine reappeared at the top and saw the parcel still untouched and swithin asleep as before she exhibited some disappointment but she did not retreat  looking again at him her eyes became so sentimentally fixed on his face that it seemed as if she could not withdraw them  there lay in the shape of an antinous no amoroso no gallant but a guileless philosopher  his parted lips were lips which spoke not of love but of millions of miles those were eyes which habitually gazed not into the depths of other eyes but into other worlds  within his temples dwelt thoughts not of womans looks but of stellar aspects and the configuration of constellations  thus to his physical attractiveness was added the attractiveness of mental inaccessibility  the ennobling influence of scientific pursuits was demonstrated by the speculative purity which expressed itself in his eyes whenever he looked at her in speaking and in the childlike faults of manner which arose from his obtuseness to their difference of sex  he had never since becoming a man looked even so low as to the level of a lady constantine  his heaven at present was truly in the skies and not in that only other place where they say it can be found in the eyes of some daughter of eve  would any circe or calypsoand if so what oneever check this palehaired scientists nocturnal sailings into the interminable spaces overhead and hurl all his mighty calculations on cosmic force and stellar fire into limbo  oh the pity of it if such should be the case  she became much absorbed in these very womanly reflections and at last lady constantine sighed perhaps she herself did not exactly know why then a very soft expression lighted on her lips and eyes and she looked at one jump ten years more youthful than beforequite a girl in aspect younger than he  on the table lay his implements among them a pair of scissors which to judge from the shreds around had been used in cutting curves in thick paper for some calculating process  what whim agitation or attraction prompted the impulse nobody knows but she took the scissors and bending over the sleeping youth cut off one of the curls or rather crooksfor they hardly reached a curlinto which each lock of his hair chose to twist itself in the last inch of its length  the hair fell upon the rug  she picked it up quickly returned the scissors to the table and as if her dignity had suddenly become ashamed of her fantasies hastened through the door and descended the staircase    vi   when his nap had naturally exhausted itself swithin awoke  he awoke without any surprise for he not unfrequently gave to sleep in the day time what he had stolen from it in the night watches  the first object that met his eyes was the parcel on the table and seeing his name inscribed thereon he made no scruple to open it  the sun flashed upon a lens of surprising magnitude polished to such a smoothness that the eye could scarcely meet its reflections  here was a crystal in whose depths were to be seen more wonders than had been revealed by the crystals of all the cagliostros  swithin hot with joyousness took this treasure to his telescope manufactory at the homestead then he started off for the great house  on gaining its precincts he felt shy of calling never having received any hint or permission to do so while lady constantines mysterious manner of leaving the parcel seemed to demand a like mysteriousness in his approaches to her  all the afternoon he lingered about uncertainly in the hope of intercepting her on her return from a drive occasionally walking with an indifferent lounge across glades commanded by the windows that if she were indoors she might know he was near  but she did not show herself during the daylight  still impressed by her playful secrecy he carried on the same idea after dark by returning to the house and passing through the garden door on to the lawn front where he sat on the parapet that breasted the terrace  now she frequently came out here for a melancholy saunter after dinner and tonight was such an occasion  swithin went forward and met her at nearly the spot where he had dropped the lens some nights earlier  i have come to see you lady constantine  how did the glass get on my table  she laughed as lightly as a girl that he had come to her in this way was plainly no offence thus far  perhaps it was dropped from the clouds by a bird she said  why should you be so good to me he cried  one good turn deserves another answered she  dear lady constantine  whatever discoveries result from this shall be ascribed to you as much as to me  where should i have been without your gift  you would possibly have accomplished your purpose just the same and have been so much the nobler for your struggle against illluck  i hope that now you will be able to proceed with your large telescope as if nothing had happened  o yes i will certainly  i am afraid i showed too much feeling the reverse of stoical when the accident occurred  that was not very noble of me  there is nothing unnatural in such feeling at your age  when you are older you will smile at such moods and at the mishaps that gave rise to them  ah i perceive you think me weak in the extreme he said with just a shade of pique  but you will never realize that an incident which filled but a degree in the circle of your thoughts covered the whole circumference of mine  no person can see exactly what and where anothers horizon is  they soon parted and she reentered the house where she sat reflecting for some time till she seemed to fear that she had wounded his feelings she awoke in the night and thought and thought on the same thing till she had worked herself into a feverish fret about it  when it was morning she looked across at the tower and sitting down impulsively wrote the following note     dear mr st cleevei cannot allow you to remain under the    impression that i despised your scientific endeavours in speaking as i    did last night  i think you were too sensitive to my remark  but    perhaps you were agitated with the labours of the day and i fear that    watching so late at night must make you very weary  if i can help you    again please let me know  i never realized the grandeur of astronomy    till you showed me how to do so  also let me know about the new    telescope  come and see me at any time  after your great kindness in    being my messenger i can never do enough for you  i wish you had a    mother or sister and pity your loneliness  i am lonely tooyours    truly     viviette constantine  she was so anxious that he should get this letter the same day that she ran across to the column with it during the morning preferring to be her own emissary in so curious a case  the door as she had expected was locked and slipping the letter under it she went home again  during lunch her ardour in the cause of swithins hurt feelings cooled down till she exclaimed to herself as she sat at her lonely table what could have possessed me to write in that way  after lunch she went faster to the tower than she had gone in the early morning and peeped eagerly into the chink under the door  she could discern no letter and on trying the latch found that the door would open  the letter was gone swithin having obviously arrived in the interval  she blushed a blush which seemed to say i am getting foolishly interested in this young man  she had in short in her own opinion somewhat overstepped the bounds of dignity  her instincts did not square well with the formalities of her existence and she walked home despondently  had a concert bazaar lecture or dorcas meeting required the patronage and support of lady constantine at this juncture the circumstance would probably have been sufficient to divert her mind from swithin st cleeve and astronomy for some little time  but as none of these incidents were within the range of expectationwelland house and parish lying far from large towns and wateringplacesthe void in her outer life continued and with it the void in her life within  the youth had not answered her letter neither had he called upon her in response to the invitation she had regretted with the rest of the epistle as being somewhat too warmly informal for black and white  to speak tenderly to him was one thing to write anotherthat was her feeling immediately after the event but his countermove of silence and avoidance though probably the result of pure unconsciousness on his part completely dispersed such selfconsiderations now  her eyes never fell upon the ringshill column without a solicitous wonder arising as to what he was doing  a true woman she would assume the remotest possibility to be the most likely contingency if the possibility had the recommendation of being tragical and she now feared that something was wrong with swithin st cleeve  yet there was not the least doubt that he had become so immersed in the business of the new telescope as to forget everything else  on sunday between the services she walked to little welland chiefly for the sake of giving a run to a housedog a large st bernard of whom she was fond  the distance was but short and she returned along a narrow lane divided from the river by a hedge through whose leafless twigs the ripples flashed silver lights into her eyes  here she discovered swithin leaning over a gate his eyes bent upon the stream  the dog first attracted his attention then he heard her and turned round  she had never seen him looking so despondent  you have never called though i invited you said lady constantine  my great telescope wont work he replied lugubriously  i am sorry for that  so it has made you quite forget me  ah yes you wrote me a very kind letter which i ought to have answered  well i did forget lady constantine  my new telescope wont work and i dont know what to do about it at all  can i assist you any further  no i fear not  besides you have assisted me already  what would really help you out of all your difficulties  something would surely  he shook his head  there must be some solution to them  o yes he replied with a hypothetical gaze into the stream some solution of coursean equatorial for instance  whats that  briefly an impossibility  it is a splendid instrument with an object lens of say eight or nine inches aperture mounted with its axis parallel to the earths axis and fitted up with graduated circles for denoting right ascensions and declinations besides having special eye pieces a finder and all sorts of appliancesclockwork to make the telescope follow the motion in right ascensioni cannot tell you half the conveniences  ah an equatorial is a thing indeed  an equatorial is the one instrument required to make you quite happy  well yes  ill see what i can do  but lady constantine cried the amazed astronomer an equatorial such as i describe costs as much as two grand pianos  she was rather staggered at this news but she rallied gallantly and said never mind  ill make inquiries  but it could not be put on the tower without people seeing it  it would have to be fixed to the masonry  and there must be a dome of some kind to keep off the rain  a tarpaulin might do  lady constantine reflected  it would be a great business i see she said  though as far as the fixing and roofing go i would of course consent to your doing what you liked with the old column  my workmen could fix it could they not  o yes  but what would sir blount say if he came home and saw the goings on  lady constantine turned aside to hide a sudden displacement of blood from her cheek  ahmy husband she whispered     i am just now going to church she added in a repressed and hurried tone  i will think of this matter  in church it was with lady constantine as with the lord angelo of vienna in a similar situationheaven had her empty words only and her invention heard not her tongue  she soon recovered from the momentary consternation into which she had fallen at swithins abrupt query  the possibility of that young astronomer becoming a renowned scientist by her aid was a thought which gave her secret pleasure  the course of rendering him instant material help began to have a great fascination for her it was a new and unexpected channel for her cribbed and confined emotions  with experiences so much wider than his lady constantine saw that the chances were perhaps a million to one against swithin st cleeve ever being astronomer royal or astronomer extraordinary of any sort yet the remaining chance in his favour was one of those possibilities which to a woman of bounding intellect and venturesome fancy are pleasanter to dwell on than likely issues that have no savour of high speculation in them  the equatorial question was a great one and she had caught such a large spark from his enthusiasm that she could think of nothing so piquant as how to obtain the important instrument  when tabitha lark arrived at the great house next day instead of finding lady constantine in bed as formerly she discovered her in the library poring over what astronomical works she had been able to unearth from the wormeaten shelves  as these publications were for a science of such rapid development somewhat venerable there was not much help of a practical kind to be gained from them  nevertheless the equatorial retained a hold upon her fancy till she became as eager to see one on the ringshill column as swithin himself  the upshot of it was that lady constantine sent a messenger that evening to welland bottom where the homestead of swithins grandmother was situated requesting the young mans presence at the house at twelve oclock next day  he hurriedly returned an obedient reply and the promise was enough to lend great freshness to her manner next morning instead of the leaden air which was too frequent with her before the sun reached the meridian and sometimes after  swithin had in fact arisen as an attractive little intervention between herself and despair    vii   a fog defaced all the trees of the park that morning the white atmosphere adhered to the ground like a fungoid growth from it and made the turfed undulations look slimy and raw  but lady constantine settled down in her chair to await the coming of the late curates son with a serenity which the vast blanks outside could neither baffle nor destroy  at two minutes to twelve the doorbell rang and a look overspread the ladys face that was neither maternal sisterly nor amorous but partook in an indescribable manner of all three kinds  the door was flung open and the young man was ushered in the fog still clinging to his hair in which she could discern a little notch where she had nipped off the curl  a speechlessness that socially was a defect in him was to her view a piquant attribute just now  he looked somewhat alarmed  lady constantine have i done anything that you have sent he began breathlessly as he gazed in her face with parted lips  o no of course not  i have decided to do somethingnothing more she smilingly said holding out her hand which he rather gingerly touched  dont look so concerned  who makes equatorials  this remark was like the drawing of a weirhatch and she was speedily inundated with all she wished to know concerning astronomical opticians when he had imparted the particulars he waited manifestly burning to know whither these inquiries tended  i am not going to buy you one she said gently  he looked as if he would faint  certainly not  i do not wish it  icould not have accepted it faltered the young man  but i am going to buy one for myself  i lack a hobby and i shall choose astronomy  i shall fix my equatorial on the column  swithin brightened up  and i shall let you have the use of it whenever you choose  in brief swithin st cleeve shall be lady constantines astronomer royal and sheand she  shall be his queen  the words came not much the worse for being uttered only in the tone of one anxious to complete a tardy sentence  well thats what i have decided to do resumed lady constantine  i will write to these opticians at once  there seemed to be no more for him to do than to thank her for the privilege whenever it should be available which he promptly did and then made as if to go  but lady constantine detained him with have you ever seen my library  no never  you dont say you would like to see it  but i should  it is the third door on the right  you can find your way in and you can stay there as long as you like  swithin then left the morningroom for the apartment designated and amused himself in that soul of the house as cicero defined it till he heard the lunch bell sounding from the turret when he came down from the library steps and thought it time to go home  but at that moment a servant entered to inquire whether he would or would not prefer to have his lunch brought in to him there upon his replying in the affirmative a large tray arrived on the stomach of a footman and swithin was greatly surprised to see a whole pheasant placed at his disposal  having breakfasted at eight that morning and having been much in the open air afterwards the adonisastronomers appetite assumed grand proportions  how much of that pheasant he might consistently eat without hurting his dear patroness lady constantines feelings when he could readily eat it all was a problem in which the reasonableness of a larger and larger quantity argued itself inversely as a smaller and smaller quantity remained  when at length he had finally decided on a terminal point in the body of the bird the door was gently opened  oh you have not finished came to him over his shoulder in a considerate voice  o yes thank you lady constantine he said jumping up  why did you prefer to lunch in this awkward dusty place  i thoughtit would be better said swithin simply  there is fruit in the other room if you like to come  but perhaps you would rather not  o yes i should much like to said swithin walking over his napkin and following her as she led the way to the adjoining apartment  here while she asked him what he had been reading he modestly ventured on an apple in whose flavour he recognized the familiar taste of old friends robbed from her husbands orchards in his childhood long before lady constantines advent on the scene  she supposed he had confined his search to his own sublime subject astronomy  swithin suddenly became older to the eye as his thoughts reverted to the topic thus reintroduced  yes he informed her  i seldom read any other subject  in these days the secret of productive study is to avoid well  did you find any good treatises  none  the theories in your books are almost as obsolete as the ptolemaic system  only fancy that magnificent cyclop√¶dia leatherbound and stamped and gilt and wide margined and bearing the blazon of your house in magnificent colours says that the twinkling of the stars is probably caused by heavenly bodies passing in front of them in their revolutions  and is it not so  that was what i learned when i was a girl  the modern eudoxus now rose above the embarrassing horizon of lady constantines great house magnificent furniture and aweinspiring footman  he became quite natural all his selfconsciousness fled and his eye spoke into hers no less than his lips to her ears as he said how such a theory can have lingered on to this day beats conjecture francois arago as long as forty or fifty years ago conclusively established the fact that scintillation is the simplest thing in the worldmerely a matter of atmosphere  but i wont speak of this to you now  the comparative absence of scintillation in warm countries was noticed by humboldt  then again the scintillations vary  no star flaps his wings like sirius when he lies low  he flashes out emeralds and rubies amethystine flames and sapphirine colours in a manner quite marvellous to behold and this is only one star  so too do arcturus and capella and lesser luminaries     but i tire you with this subject  on the contrary you speak so beautifully that i could listen all day  the astronomer threw a searching glance upon her for a moment but there was no satire in the warm soft eyes which met his own with a luxurious contemplative interest  say some more of it to me she continued in a voice not far removed from coaxing  after some hesitation the subject returned again to his lips and he said some moreindeed much more lady constantine often throwing in an appreciative remark or question often meditatively regarding him in pursuance of ideas not exactly based on his words and letting him go on as he would  before he left the house the new astronomical project was set in train the top of the column was to be roofed in to form a proper observatory and on the ground that he knew better than any one else how this was to be carried out she requested him to give precise directions on the point and to superintend the whole  a wooden cabin was to be erected at the foot of the tower to provide better accommodation for casual visitors to the observatory than the spiral staircase and leadflat afforded  as this cabin would be completely buried in the dense fir foliage which enveloped the lower part of the column and its pedestal it would be no disfigurement to the general appearance  finally a path was to be made across the surrounding fallow by which she might easily approach the scene of her new study  when he was gone she wrote to the firm of opticians concerning the equatorial for whose reception all this was designed  the undertaking was soon in full progress and by degrees it became the talk of the hamlets round that lady constantine had given up melancholy for astronomy to the great advantage of all who came in contact with her  one morning when tabitha lark had come as usual to read lady constantine chanced to be in a quarter of the house to which she seldom wandered and while here she heard her maid talking confidentially to tabitha in the adjoining room on the curious and sudden interest which lady constantine had acquired in the moon and stars  they do say all sorts of trumpery observed the handmaid  they saythough tis little better than mischief to be surethat it isnt the moon and it isnt the stars and it isnt the plannards that my lady cares for but for the pretty lad who draws em down from the sky to please her and being a married example and what with sin and shame knocking at every poor maids door afore you can say hands off my dear to the civilest young man she ought to set a better pattern  lady constantines face flamed up vividly  if sir blount were to come back all of a suddenoh my  lady constantine grew cold as ice  theres nothing in it said tabitha scornfully  i could prove it any day  well i wish i had half her chance sighed the ladys maid  and no more was said on the subject then  tabithas remark showed that the suspicion was quite in embryo as yet nevertheless saying nothing to reveal what she had overheard immediately after the reading lady constantine flew like a bird to where she knew that swithin might be found  he was in the plantation setting up little sticks to mark where the wooden cabin was to stand  she called him to a remote place under the funereal trees  i have altered my mind she said  i can have nothing to do with this matter  indeed said swithin surprised  astronomy is not my hobby any longer  and you are not my astronomer royal  o lady constantine cried the youth aghast  why the work is begun i thought the equatorial was ordered  she dropped her voice though a jericho shout would not have been overheard of course astronomy is my hobby privately and you are to be my astronomer royal and i still furnish the observatory but not to the outer world  there is a reason against my indulgence in such scientific fancies openly and the project must be arranged in this wise  the whole enterprise is yours you rent the tower of me you build the cabin you get the equatorial  i simply give permission since you desire it  the path that was to be made from the hill to the park is not to be thought of  there is to be no communication between the house and the column the equatorial will arrive addressed to you and its cost i will pay through you  my name must not appear and i vanish entirely from the undertaking     this blind is necessary she added sighing  good bye  but you do take as much interest as before and it will be yours just the same he said walking after her  he scarcely comprehended the subterfuge and was absolutely blind as to its reason  can you doubt it  but i dare not do it openly  with this she went away and in due time there circulated through the parish an assertion that it was a mistake to suppose lady constantine had anything to do with swithin st cleeve or his stargazing schemes  she had merely allowed him to rent the tower of her for use as his observatory and to put some temporary fixtures on it for that purpose  after this lady constantine lapsed into her former life of loneliness and by these prompt measures the ghost of a rumour which had barely started into existence was speedily laid to rest  it had probably originated in her own dwelling and had gone but little further  yet despite her selfcontrol a certain north window of the great house that commanded an uninterrupted view of the upper ten feet of the column revealed her to be somewhat frequently gazing from it at a rotundity which had begun to appear on the summit  to those with whom she came in contact she sometimes addressed such remarks as is young mr st cleeve getting on with his observatory  i hope he will fix his instruments without damaging the column which is so interesting to us as being in memory of my dear husbands greatgrandfathera truly brave man  on one occasion her buildingsteward ventured to suggest to her that sir blount having deputed to her the power to grant short leases in his absence she should have a distinctive agreement with swithin as between landlord and tenant with a stringent clause against his driving nails into the stonework of such an historical memorial  she replied that she did not wish to be severe on the last representative of such old and respected parishioners as st cleeves mothers family had been and of such a welldescended family as his fathers so that it would only be necessary for the steward to keep an eye on mr st cleeves doings  further when a letter arrived at the great house from hilton and pimms the opticians with information that the equatorial was ready and packed and that a man would be sent with it to fix it she replied to that firm to the effect that their letter should have been addressed to mr st cleeve the local astronomer on whose behalf she had made the inquiries that she had nothing more to do with the matter that he would receive the instrument and pay the billher guarantee being given for the latter performance    viii   lady constantine then had the pleasure of beholding a waggon laden with packingcases moving across the field towards the pillar and not many days later swithin who had never come to the great house since the luncheon met her in a path which he knew to be one of her promenades  the equatorial is fixed and the man gone he said half in doubt as to his speech for her commands to him not to recognize her agency or patronage still puzzled him  i respectfully wishyou could come and see it lady constantine  i would rather not i cannot  saturn is lovely jupiter is simply sublime i can see double stars in the lion and in the virgin where i had seen only a single one before  it is all i required to set me going  ill come  butyou need say nothing about my visit  i cannot come to night but i will some time this week  yet only this once to try the instrument  afterwards you must be content to pursue your studies alone  swithin seemed but little affected at this announcement  hilton and pimms man handed me the bill he continued  how much is it  he told her  and the man who has built the hut and dome and done the other fixing has sent in his  he named this amount also  very well  they shall be settled with  my debts must be paid with my money which you shall have at oncein cash since a cheque would hardly do  come to the house for it this evening  but no noyou must not come openly such is the world  come to the windowthe window that is exactly in a line with the long snowdrop bed in the south frontat eight tonight and i will give you what is necessary  certainly lady constantine said the young man  at eight that evening accordingly swithin entered like a spectre upon the terrace to seek out the spot she had designated  the equatorial had so entirely absorbed his thoughts that he did not trouble himself seriously to conjecture the why and wherefore of her secrecy  if he casually thought of it he set it down in a general way to an intensely generous wish on her part not to lessen his influence among the poorer inhabitants by making him appear the object of patronage  while he stood by the long snowdrop bed which looked up at him like a nether milky way the french casement of the window opposite softly opened and a hand bordered by a glimmer of lace was stretched forth from which he received a crisp little parcelbanknotes apparently  he knew the hand and held it long enough to press it to his lips the only form which had ever occurred to him of expressing his gratitude to her without the incumbrance of clumsy words a vehicle at the best of times but rudely suited to such delicate merchandise  the hand was hastily withdrawn as if the treatment had been unexpected  then seemingly moved by second thoughts she bent forward and said is the night good for observations  perfect  she paused  then ill come tonight she at last said  it makes no difference to me after all  wait just one moment  he waited and she presently emerged muffled up like a nun whereupon they left the terrace and struck across the park together  very little was said by either till they were crossing the fallow when he asked if his arm would help her  she did not take the offered support just then but when they were ascending the prehistoric earthwork under the heavy gloom of the firtrees she seized it as if rather influenced by the oppressive solitude than by fatigue  thus they reached the foot of the column ten thousand spirits in prison seeming to gasp their griefs from the funereal boughs overhead and a few twigs scratching the pillar with the drag of impish claws as tenacious as those figuring in st anthonys temptation  how intensely dark it is just here she whispered  i wonder you can keep in the path  many ancient britons lie buried there doubtless  he led her round to the other side where feeling his way with his hands he suddenly left her appearing a moment after with a light  what place is this she exclaimed  this is the new wood cabin said he  she could just discern the outline of a little house not unlike a bathingmachine without wheels  i have kept lights ready here he went on as i thought you might come any evening and possibly bring company  dont criticize me for coming alone she exclaimed with sensitive promptness  there are social reasons for what i do of which you know nothing  perhaps it is much to my discredit that i dont know  not at all  you are all the better for it  heaven forbid that i should enlighten you  well i see this is the hut  but i am more curious to go to the top of the tower and make discoveries  he brought a little lantern from the cabin and lighted her up the winding staircase to the temple of that sublime mystery on whose threshold he stood as priest  the top of the column was quite changed  the tubshaped space within the parapet formerly open to the air and sun was now arched over by a light dome of lathwork covered with felt  but this dome was not fixed  at the line where its base descended to the parapet there were half a dozen iron balls precisely like cannonshot standing loosely in a groove and on these the dome rested its whole weight  in the side of the dome was a slit through which the wind blew and the north star beamed and towards it the end of the great telescope was directed  this latter magnificent object with its circles axes and handles complete was securely fixed in the middle of the floor  but you can only see one part of the sky through that slit said she  the astronomer stretched out his arm and the whole dome turned horizontally round running on the balls with a rumble like thunder instead of the star polaris which had first been peeping in through the slit there now appeared the countenances of castor and pollux  swithin then manipulated the equatorial and put it through its capabilities in like manner  she was enchanted being rather excitable she even clapped her hands just once  she turned to him now are you happy  but it is all yours lady constantine  at this moment  but thats a defect which can soon be remedied  when is your birthday  next monththe seventh  then it shall all be yoursa birthday present  the young man protested it was too much  no you must accept it allequatorial dome stand hut and everything that has been put here for this astronomical purpose  the possession of these apparatus would only compromise me  already they are reputed to be yours and they must be made yours  there is no help for it  if ever here her voice lost some firmnessif ever you go away from mefrom this place i meanand marry and settle in a new home elsewhere for good and forget me you must take these things equatorial and all and never tell your wife or anybody how they came to be yours  i wish i could do something more for you exclaimed the muchmoved astronomer  if you could but share my famesupposing i get any which i may die before doingit would be a little compensation  as to my going away and marrying i certainly shall not  i may go away but i shall never marry  why not  a beloved science is enough wife for mecombined perhaps with a little warm friendship with one of kindred pursuits  who is the friend of kindred pursuits  yourself i should like it to be  you would have to become a woman before i could be that publicly or i a man she replied with dry melancholy  why i a woman or you a man dear lady constantine  i cannot explain  no you must keep your fame and your science all to yourself and i must keep mytroubles  swithin to divert her from melancholynot knowing that in the expression of her melancholy thus and now she found much pleasurechanged the subject by asking if they should take some observations  yes the scenery is well hung tonight she said looking out upon the heavens  then they proceeded to scan the sky roving from planet to star from single stars to double stars from double to coloured stars in the cursory manner of the merely curious  they plunged down to that at other times invisible multitude in the back rows of the celestial theatre remote layers of constellations whose shapes were new and singular pretty twinklers which for infinite ages had spent their beams without calling forth from a single earthly poet a single line or being able to bestow a ray of comfort on a single benighted traveller  and to think said lady constantine that the whole race of shepherds since the beginning of the worldeven those immortal shepherds who watched near bethlehemshould have gone into their graves without knowing that for one star that lighted them in their labours there were a hundred as good behind trying to do so     i have a feeling for this instrument not unlike the awe i should feel in the presence of a great magician in whom i really believed  its powers are so enormous and weird and fantastical that i should have a personal fear in being with it alone  music drew an angel down said the poet but what is that to drawing down worlds  i often experience a kind of fear of the sky after sitting in the observingchair a long time he answered  and when i walk home afterwards i also fear it for what i know is there but cannot see as one naturally fears the presence of a vast formless something that only reveals a very little of itself  thats partly what i meant by saying that magnitude which up to a certain point has grandeur has beyond it ghastliness  thus the interest of their sidereal observations led them on till the knowledge that scarce any other human vision was travelling within a hundred million miles of their own gave them such a sense of the isolation of that faculty as almost to be a sense of isolation in respect of their whole personality causing a shudder at its absoluteness  at night when human discords and harmonies are hushed in a general sense for the greater part of twelve hours there is nothing to moderate the blow with which the infinitely great the stellar universe strikes down upon the infinitely little the mind of the beholder and this was the case now  having got closer to immensity than their fellowcreatures they saw at once its beauty and its frightfulness  they more and more felt the contrast between their own tiny magnitudes and those among which they had recklessly plunged till they were oppressed with the presence of a vastness they could not cope with even as an idea and which hung about them like a nightmare  he stood by her while she observed she by him when they changed places once that swithins emancipation from a trammelling body had been effected by the telescope and he was well away in space she felt her influence over him diminishing to nothing  he was quite unconscious of his terrestrial neighbourings and of herself as one of them  it still further reduced her towards unvarnished simplicity in her manner to him  the silence was broken only by the ticking of the clockwork which gave diurnal motion to the instrument  the stars moved on the end of the telescope followed but their tongues stood still  to expect that he was ever voluntarily going to end the pause by speech was apparently futile she laid her hand upon his arm  he started withdrew his eye from the telescope and brought himself back to the earth by a visiblealmost painfuleffort  do come out of it she coaxed with a softness in her voice which any man but unpractised swithin would have felt to be exquisite  i feel that i have been so foolish as to put in your hands an instrument to effect my own annihilation  not a word have you spoken for the last ten minutes  i have been mentally getting on with my great theory  i hope soon to be able to publish it to the world  what are you going  i will walk with you lady constantine  when will you come again  when your great theory is published to the world    ix   lady constantine if narrowly observed at this time would have seemed to be deeply troubled in conscience and particularly after the interview above described  ash wednesday occurred in the calendar a few days later and she went to morning service with a look of genuine contrition on her emotional and yearning countenance  besides herself the congregation consisted only of the parson clerk schoolchildren and three old people living on alms who sat under the readingdesk and thus when mr torkingham blazed forth the denunciatory sentences of the commination nearly the whole force of them seemed to descend upon her own shoulders  looking across the empty pews she saw through the one or two clear panes of the window opposite a youthful figure in the churchyard and the very feeling against which she had tried to pray returned again irresistibly  when she came out and had crossed into the private walk swithin came forward to speak to her  this was a most unusual circumstance and argued a matter of importance  i have made an amazing discovery in connexion with the variable stars he exclaimed  it will excite the whole astronomical world and the world outside but little less  i had long suspected the true secret of their variability but it was by the merest chance on earth that i hit upon a proof of my guess  your equatorial has done it my good kind lady constantine and our fame is established for ever  he sprang into the air and waved his hat in his triumph  oh i am so gladso rejoiced she cried  what is it  but dont stop to tell me  publish it at once in some paper nail your name to it or somebody will seize the idea and appropriate itforestall you in some way  it will be adams and leverrier over again  if i may walk with you i will explain the nature of the discovery  it accounts for the occasional green tint of castor and every difficulty  i said i would be the copernicus of the stellar system and i have begun to be  yet who knows  now dont be so up and down  i shall not understand your explanation and i would rather not know it  i shall reveal it if it is very grand women you know are not safe depositaries of such valuable secrets  you may walk with me a little way with great pleasure  then go and write your account so as to insure your ownership of the discovery     but how you have watched she cried in a sudden accession of anxiety as she turned to look more closely at him  the orbits of your eyes are leaden and your eyelids are red and heavy  dont do itpray dont  you will be ill and break down  i have it is true been up a little late this last week he said cheerfully  in fact i couldnt tear myself away from the equatorial it is such a wonderful possession that it keeps me there till daylight but what does that matter now i have made the discovery  ah it does matter  now promise mei insistthat you will not commit such imprudences again for what should i do if my astronomer royal were to die  she laughed but far too apprehensively to be effective as a display of levity  they parted and he went home to write out his paper  he promised to call as soon as his discovery was in print  then they waited for the result  it is impossible to describe the tremulous state of lady constantine during the interval  the warm interest she took in swithin st cleevemany would have said dangerously warm interestmade his hopes her hopes and though she sometimes admitted to herself that great allowance was requisite for the overweening confidence of youth in the future she permitted herself to be blinded to probabilities for the pleasure of sharing his dreams  it seemed not unreasonable to suppose the present hour to be the beginning of realization to her darling wish that this young man should become famous  he had worked hard and why should he not be famous early  his very simplicity in mundane affairs afforded a strong presumption that in things celestial he might be wise to obtain support for this hypothesis she had only to think over the lives of many eminent astronomers  she waited feverishly for the flourish of trumpets from afar by which she expected the announcement of his discovery to be greeted  knowing that immediate intelligence of the outburst would be brought to her by himself she watched from the windows of the great house each morning for a sight of his figure hastening down the glade  but he did not come  a long array of wet days passed their dreary shapes before her and made the waiting still more tedious  on one of these occasions she ran across to the tower at the risk of a severe cold  the door was locked  two days after she went again  the door was locked still  but this was only to be expected in such weather  yet she would have gone on to his house had there not been one reason too many against such precipitancy as astronomer and astronomer there was no harm in their meetings but as woman and man she feared them  ten days passed without a sight of him ten blurred and dreary days during which the whole landscape dripped like a mop the park trees swabbed the gravel from the drive while the sky was a zinccoloured archivault of immovable cloud  it seemed as if the whole science of astronomy had never been real and that the heavenly bodies with their motions were as theoretical as the lines and circles of a bygone mathematical problem  she could content herself no longer with fruitless visits to the column and when the rain had a little abated she walked to the nearest hamlet and in a conversation with the first old woman she met contrived to lead up to the subject of swithin st cleeve by talking about his grandmother  ah poor old heart tis a bad time for her my lady exclaimed the dame  what  her grandson is dying and such a gentleman through and through  what     oh it has something to do with that dreadful discovery  discovery my lady  she left the old woman with an evasive answer and with a breaking heart crept along the road  tears brimmed into her eyes as she walked and by the time that she was out of sight sobs burst forth tumultuously  i am too fond of him she moaned but i cant help it and i dont care if its wrongi dont care  without further considerations as to who beheld her doings she instinctively went straight towards mrs martins  seeing a man coming she calmed herself sufficiently to ask him through her dropped veil how poor mr st cleeve was that day  but she only got the same reply they say he is dying my lady  when swithin had parted from lady constantine on the previous ashwednesday he had gone straight to the homestead and prepared his account of a new astronomical discovery  it was written perhaps in too glowing a rhetoric for the true scientific tone of mind but there was no doubt that his assertion met with a most startling aptness all the difficulties which had accompanied the received theories on the phenomena attending those changeable suns of marvellous systems so far away  it accounted for the nebulous mist that surrounds some of them at their weakest time in short took up a position of probability which has never yet been successfully assailed  the papers were written in triplicate and carefully sealed up with blue wax  one copy was directed to greenwich another to the royal society another to a prominent astronomer  a brief statement of the essence of the discovery was also prepared for the leading daily paper  he considered these documents embodying as they did two years of his constant thought reading and observation too important to be entrusted for posting to the hands of a messenger too important to be sent to the subpostoffice at hand  though the day was wet dripping wet he went on foot with them to a chief office five miles off and registered them quite exhausted by the walk after his long nightwork wet through yet sustained by the sense of a great achievement he called at a booksellers for the astronomical periodicals to which he subscribed then resting for a short time at an inn he plodded his way homewards reading his papers as he went and planning how to enjoy a repose on his laurels of a week or more  on he strolled through the rain holding the umbrella vertically over the exposed page to keep it dry while he read  suddenly his eye was struck by an article  it was the review of a pamphlet by an american astronomer in which the author announced a conclusive discovery with regard to variable stars  the discovery was precisely the discovery of swithin st cleeve  another man had forestalled his fame by a period of about six weeks  then the youth found that the goddess philosophy to whom he had vowed to dedicate his whole life would not in return support him through a single hour of despair  in truth the impishness of circumstance was newer to him than it would have been to a philosopher of threescoreandten  in a wild wish for annihilation he flung himself down on a patch of heather that lay a little removed from the road and in this humid bed remained motionless while time passed by unheeded  at last from sheer misery and weariness he fell asleep  the march rain pelted him mercilessly the beaded moisture from the heavily charged locks of heath penetrated him through back and sides and clotted his hair to unsightly tags and tufts  when he awoke it was dark he thought of his grandmother and of her possible alarm at missing him on attempting to rise he found that he could hardly bend his joints and that his clothes were as heavy as lead from saturation  his teeth chattering and his knees trembling he pursued his way home where his appearance excited great concern  he was obliged at once to retire to bed and the next day he was delirious from the chill  it was about ten days after this unhappy occurrence that lady constantine learnt the news as above described and hastened along to the homestead in that state of anguish in which the heart is no longer under the control of the judgment and selfabandonment even to error verges on heroism  on reaching the house in welland bottom the door was opened to her by old hannah who wore an assiduously sorrowful look and lady constantine was shown into the large roomso wide that the beams bent in the middlewhere she took her seat in one of a methodic range of chairs beneath a portrait of the reverend mr st cleeve her astronomers erratic father  the eight unwatered dying plants in the row of eight flowerpots denoted that there was something wrong in the house  mrs martin came downstairs fretting her wonder at beholding lady constantine not altogether displacing the previous mood of grief  heres a pretty kettle of fish my lady she exclaimed  lady constantine said hush and pointed inquiringly upward  he is not overhead my lady replied swithins grandmother  his bedroom is at the back of the house  how is he now  he is better just at this moment and we are more hopeful  but he changes so  may i go up  i know he would like to see me  her presence having been made known to the sufferer she was conducted upstairs to swithins room  the way thither was through the large chamber he had used as a study and for the manufacture of optical instruments  there lay the large pasteboard telescope that had been just such a failure as crusoes large boat there were his diagrams maps globes and celestial apparatus of various sorts  the absence of the worker through illness or death is sufficient to touch the prosiest workshop and tools with the hues of pathos and it was with a swelling bosom that lady constantine passed through this arena of his youthful activities to the little chamber where he lay  old mrs martin sat down by the window and lady constantine bent over swithin  dont speak to me she whispered  it will weaken you it will excite you  if you do speak it must be very softly  she took his hand and one irrepressible tear fell upon it  nothing will excite me now lady constantine he said not even your goodness in coming  my last excitement was when i lost the battle    do you know that my discovery has been forestalled  it is that thats killing me  but you are going to recover you are better they say  is it so  i think i am today  but who can be sure  the poor boy was so upset at finding that his labour had been thrown away said his grandmother that he lay down in the rain and chilled his life out  how could you do it lady constantine whispered  o how could you think so much of renown and so little of me  why for every discovery made there are ten behind that await making  to commit suicide like this as if there were nobody in the world to care for you  it was done in my haste and i am very very sorry for it  i beg both you and all my few friends never never to forgive me  it would kill me with selfreproach if you were to pardon my rashness  at this moment the doctor was announced and mrs martin went downstairs to receive him  lady constantine thought she would remain to hear his report and for this purpose withdrew and sat down in a nook of the adjoining workroom of swithin the doctor meeting her as he passed through it into the sick chamber  he was there a torturingly long time but at length he came out to the room she waited in and crossed it on his way downstairs  she rose and followed him to the stairhead  how is he she anxiously asked  will he get over it  the doctor not knowing the depth of her interest in the patient spoke with the blunt candour natural towards a comparatively indifferent inquirer  no lady constantine he replied theres a change for the worse  and he retired down the stairs  scarcely knowing what she did lady constantine ran back to swithins side flung herself upon the bed and in a paroxysm of sorrow kissed him    x   the placid inhabitants of the parish of welland including warbling waggoners lone shepherds ploughmen the blacksmith the carpenter the gardener at the great house the steward and agent the parson clerk and so on were hourly expecting the announcement of st cleeves death the sexton had been going to see his brotherinlaw nine miles distant but promptly postponed the visit for a few days that there might be the regular professional hand present to toll the bell in a note of due fulness and solemnity an attempt by a deputy on a previous occasion of his absence having degenerated into a miserable stammering clang that was a disgrace to the parish  but swithin st cleeve did not decease a fact of which indeed the habituated reader will have been well aware ever since the rain came down upon the young man in the ninth chapter and led to his alarming illness though for that matter so many maimed histories are hourly enacting themselves in this duncoloured world as to lend almost a priority of interest to narratives concerning those     who lay great bases for eternity    which prove more short than waste or ruining  how it arose that he did not die was in this wise and his example affords another instance of that reflex rule of the vassal soul over the sovereign body which operating so wonderfully in elastic natures and more or less in all originally gave rise to the legend that supremacy lay on the other side  the evening of the day after the tender despairing farewell kiss of lady constantine when he was a little less weak than during her visit he lay with his face to the window  he lay alone quiet and resigned  he had been thinking sometimes of her and other friends but chiefly of his lost discovery  although nearly unconscious at the time he had yet been aware of that kiss as the delicate flush which followed it upon his cheek would have told but he had attached little importance to it as between woman and man  had he been dying of love instead of wet weather perhaps the impulsive act of that handsome lady would have been seized on as a proof that his love was returned  as it was her kiss seemed but the evidence of a naturally demonstrative kindliness felt towards him chiefly because he was believed to be leaving her for ever  the reds of sunset passed and dusk drew on  old hannah came upstairs to pull down the blinds and as she advanced to the window he said to her in a faint voice well hannah what news today  oh nothing sir hannah replied looking out of the window with sad apathy only that theres a comet they say  a what said the dying astronomer starting up on his elbow  a cometthats all master swithin repeated hannah in a lower voice fearing she had done harm in some way  well tell me tell me cried swithin  is it gambarts  is it charles the fifths or halleys or fayes or whose  hush said she thinking st cleeve slightly delirious again  tis god amightys of course  i havent seed en myself but they say hes getting bigger every night and that hell be the biggest one known for fifty years when hes full growed  there you must not talk any more now or ill go away  here was an amazing event little noise as it had made in the happening of all phenomena that he had longed to witness during his short astronomical career those appertaining to comets had excited him most that the magnificent comet of 1811 would not return again for thirty centuries had been quite a permanent regret with him  and now when the bottomless abyss of death seemed yawning beneath his feet one of these muchdesired apparitions as large apparently as any of its tribe had chosen to show itself  o if i could but live to see that comet through my equatorial he cried  compared with comets variable stars which he had hitherto made his study were from their remoteness uninteresting  they were to the former as the celebrities of ujiji or unyamwesi to the celebrities of his own country  members of the solar system these dazzling and perplexing rangers the fascination of all astronomers rendered themselves still more fascinating by the sinister suspicion attaching to them of being possibly the ultimate destroyers of the human race  in his physical prostration st cleeve wept bitterly at not being hale and strong enough to welcome with proper honour the present specimen of these desirable visitors  the strenuous wish to live and behold the new phenomenon supplanting the utter weariness of existence that he had heretofore experienced gave him a new vitality  the crisis passed there was a turn for the better and after that he rapidly mended  the comet had in all probability saved his life  the limitless and complex wonders of the sky resumed their old power over his imagination the possibilities of that unfathomable blue ocean were endless  finer feats than ever he would perform were to be achieved in its investigation  what lady constantine had said that for one discovery made ten awaited making was strikingly verified by the sudden appearance of this splendid marvel  the windows of st cleeves bedroom faced the west and nothing would satisfy him but that his bed should be so pulled round as to give him a view of the low sky in which the as yet minute tadpole of fire was recognizable  the mere sight of it seemed to lend him sufficient resolution to complete his own cure forthwith  his only fear now was lest from some unexpected cause or other the comet would vanish before he could get to the observatory on ringshill speer  in his fervour to begin observing he directed that an old telescope which he had used in his first celestial attempts should be tied at one end to the bedpost and at the other fixed near his eye as he reclined equipped only with this rough improvisation he began to take notes  lady constantine was forgotten till one day suddenly wondering if she knew of the important phenomenon he revolved in his mind whether as a fellow student and sincere friend of his she ought not to be sent for and instructed in the use of the equatorial  but though the image of lady constantine in spite of her kindness and unmistakably warm heart had been obscured in his mind by the heavenly body she had not so readily forgotten him  too shy to repeat her visit after so nearly betraying her secret she yet every day by the most ingenious and subtle means that could be devised by a woman who feared for herself but could not refrain from tampering with danger ascertained the state of her young friends health  on hearing of the turn in his condition she rejoiced on his account and became yet more despondent on her own  if he had died she might have mused on him as her dear departed saint without much sin but his return to life was a delight that bewildered and dismayed  one evening a little later on he was sitting at his bedroom window as usual waiting for a sufficient decline of light to reveal the comets form when he beheld crossing the field contiguous to the house a figure which he knew to be hers  he thought she must be coming to see him on the great comet question to discuss which with so delightful and kind a comrade was an expectation full of pleasure  hence he keenly observed her approach till something happened that surprised him  when at the descent of the hill she had reached the stile that admitted to mrs martins garden lady constantine stood quite still for a minute or more her gaze bent on the ground  instead of coming on to the house she went heavily and slowly back almost as if in pain and then at length quickening her pace she was soon out of sight  she appeared in the path no more that day    xi   why had lady constantine stopped and turned  a misgiving had taken sudden possession of her  her true sentiment towards st cleeve was too recognizable by herself to be tolerated  that she had a legitimate interest in him as a young astronomer was true that her sympathy on account of his severe illness had been natural and commendable was also true  but the superfluous feeling was what filled her with trepidation  superfluities have been defined as things you cannot do without and this particular emotion that came not within her rightful measure was in danger of becoming just such a superfluity with her  in short she felt there and then that to see st cleeve again would be an impropriety and by a violent effort she retreated from his precincts as he had observed  she resolved to ennoble her conduct from that moment of her life onwards she would exercise kind patronage towards swithin without once indulging herself with his company  inexpressibly dear to her deserted heart he was becoming but for the future he should at least be hidden from her eyes  to speak plainly it was growing a serious question whether if he were not hidden from her eyes she would not soon be plunging across the ragged boundary which divides the permissible from the forbidden  by the time that she had drawn near home the sun was going down  the heavy manychevroned church now subdued by violet shadow except where its upper courses caught the western stroke of flamecolour stood close to her grounds as in many other parishes though the village of which it formerly was the nucleus had become quite depopulated its cottages had been demolished to enlarge the park leaving the old building to stand there alone like a standard without an army  it was friday night and she heard the organist practising voluntaries within  the hour the notes the evensong of the birds and her own previous emotions combined to influence her devotionally  she entered turning to the right and passing under the chancel arch where she sat down and viewed the whole empty length east and west  the seminorman arches of the nave with their multitudinous notchings were still visible by the light from the tower window but the lower portion of the building was in obscurity except where the feeble glimmer from the candle of the organist spread a glowworm radiance around  the player who was miss tabitha lark continued without intermission to produce her wandering sounds unconscious of any ones presence except that of the youthful blower at her side  the rays from the organists candle illuminated but one small fragment of the chancel outside the precincts of the instrument and that was the portion of the eastern wall whereon the ten commandments were inscribed the gilt letters shone sternly into lady constantines eyes and she being as impressionable as a turtledove watched a certain one of those commandments on the second table till its thunder broke her spirit with blank contrition  she knelt down and did her utmost to eradicate those impulses towards st cleeve which were inconsistent with her position as the wife of an absent man though not unnatural in her as his victim  she knelt till she seemed scarcely to belong to the time she lived in which lost the magnitude that the nearness of its perspective lent it on ordinary occasions and took its actual rank in the long line of other centuries  having once got out of herself seen herself from afar off she was calmer and went on to register a magnanimous vow  she would look about for some maiden fit and likely to make st cleeve happy and this girl she would endow with what money she could afford that the natural result of their apposition should do him no worldly harm  the interest of her lady constantines life should be in watching the development of love between swithin and the ideal maiden  the very painfulness of the scheme to her susceptible heart made it pleasing to her conscience and she wondered that she had not before this time thought of a stratagem which united the possibility of benefiting the astronomer with the advantage of guarding against peril to both swithin and herself  by providing for him a suitable helpmate she would preclude the dangerous awakening in him of sentiments reciprocating her own  arrived at a point of exquisite misery through this heroic intention lady constantines tears moistened the books upon which her forehead was bowed  and as she heard her feverish heart throb against the desk she firmly believed the wearing impulses of that heart would put an end to her sad life and momentarily recalled the banished image of st cleeve to apostrophise him in thoughts that paraphrased the quaint lines of heines lieb liebchen     dear my love press thy hand to my breast and tell    if thou tracest the knocks in that narrow cell    a carpenter dwells there cunning is he    and slyly hes shaping a coffin for me  lady constantine was disturbed by a break in the organists meandering practice and raising her head she saw a person standing by the player it was mr torkingham and what he said was distinctly audible  he was inquiring for herself  i thought i saw lady constantine walk this way he rejoined to tabithas negative  i am very anxious indeed to meet with her  she went forward  i am here she said  dont stop playing miss lark  what is it mr torkingham  tabitha thereupon resumed her playing and mr torkingham joined lady constantine  i have some very serious intelligence to break to your ladyship he said  buti will not interrupt you here  he had seen her rise from her knees to come to him  i will call at the house the first moment you can receive me after reaching home  no tell me here she said seating herself  he came close and placed his hand on the poppyhead of the seat  i have received a communication he resumed haltingly in which i am requested to prepare you for the contents of a letter that you will receive tomorrow morning  i am quite ready  the subject is briefly this lady constantine that you have been a widow for more than eighteen months  dead  yes  sir blount was attacked by dysentery and malarious fever on the banks of the zouga in south africa so long ago as last october twelvemonths and it carried him off  of the three men who were with him two succumbed to the same illness a hundred miles further on while the third retracing his steps into a healthier district remained there with a native tribe and took no pains to make the circumstances known it seems to be only by the mere accident of his having told some third party that we know of the matter now  this is all i can tell you at present  she was greatly agitated for a few moments and the table of the law opposite which now seemed to appertain to another dispensation glistened indistinctly upon a vision still obscured by the old tears  shall i conduct you home asked the parson  no thank you said lady constantine  i would rather go alone    xii   on the afternoon of the next day mr torkingham who occasionally dropped in to see st cleeve called again as usual after duly remarking on the state of the weather congratulating him on his sure though slow improvement and answering his inquiries about the comet he said you have heard i suppose of what has happened to lady constantine  no  nothing serious  yes it is serious  the parson informed him of the death of sir blount and of the accidents which had hindered all knowledge of the sameaccidents favoured by the estrangement of the pair and the cessation of correspondence between them for some time  his listener received the news with the concern of a friend lady constantines aspect in his eyes depending but little on her condition matrimonially  there was no attempt to bring him home when he died  o no  the climate necessitates instant burial  we shall have more particulars in a day or two doubtless  poor lady constantineso good and so sensitive as she is  i suppose she is quite prostrated by the bad news  well she is rather seriousnot prostrated  the household is going into mourning  ah no she would not be quite prostrated murmured swithin recollecting himself  he was unkind to her in many ways  do you think she will go away from welland  that the vicar could not tell  but he feared that sir blounts affairs had been in a seriously involved condition which might necessitate many and unexpected changes  time showed that mr torkinghams surmises were correct  during the long weeks of early summer through which the young man still lay imprisoned if not within his own chamber within the limits of the house and garden news reached him that sir blounts mismanagement and eccentric behaviour were resulting in serious consequences to lady constantine nothing less indeed than her almost complete impoverishment  his personalty was swallowed up in paying his debts and the welland estate was so heavily charged with annuities to his distant relatives that only a mere pittance was left for her  she was reducing the establishment to the narrowest compass compatible with decent gentility  the horses were sold one by one the carriages also the greater part of the house was shut up and she resided in the smallest rooms  all that was allowed to remain of her former contingent of male servants were an odd man and a boy  instead of using a carriage she now drove about in a donkeychair the said boy walking in front to clear the way and keep the animal in motion while she wore so his informants reported not an ordinary widows cap or bonnet but something even plainer the black material being drawn tightly round her face giving her features a small demure devout cast very pleasing to the eye  now whats the most curious thing in this mr san cleeve said sammy blore who in calling to inquire after swithins health had imparted some of the above particulars is that my lady seems not to mind being a pore woman half so much as we do at seeing her so  tis a wonderful gift mr san cleeve wonderful to be able to guide yerself and not let loose yer soul in blasting at such a misfortune  i should go and drink neat regular as soon as i had swallered my breakfast till my innerds was burnt out like a old copper if it had happened to me but my ladys plan is best  though i only guess how one feels in such losses to be sure for i never had nothing to lose  meanwhile the observatory was not forgotten nor that visitant of singular shape and habits which had appeared in the sky from no one knew whence trailing its luminous streamer and proceeding on its way in the face of a wondering world till it should choose to vanish as suddenly as it had come  when about a month after the above dialogue took place swithin was allowed to go about as usual his first pilgrimage was to the ringshill speer  here he studied at leisure what he had come to see  on his return to the homestead just after sunset he found his grandmother and hannah in a state of great concern  the former was looking out for him against the evening light her face showing itself worn and rutted like an old highway by the passing of many days  her information was that in his absence lady constantine had called in her drivingchair to inquire for him  her ladyship had wished to observe the comet through the great telescope but had found the door locked when she applied at the tower  would he kindly leave the door unfastened to morrow she had asked that she might be able to go to the column on the following evening for the same purpose  she did not require him to attend  during the next day he sent hannah with the key to welland house not caring to leave the tower open  as evening advanced and the comet grew distinct he doubted if lady constantine could handle the telescope alone with any pleasure or profit to herself  unable as a devotee to science to rest under this misgiving he crossed the field in the furrow that he had used ever since the corn was sown and entered the plantation  his unpractised mind never once guessed that her stipulations against his coming might have existed along with a perverse hope that he would come  on ascending he found her already there  she sat in the observingchair the warm light from the west which flowed in through the opening of the dome brightened her face and her face only her robes of sable lawn rendering the remainder of her figure almost invisible  you have come she said with shy pleasure  i did not require you  but never mind  she extended her hand cordially to him  before speaking he looked at her with a great new interest in his eye  it was the first time that he had seen her thus and she was altered in more than dress  a soberlysweet expression sat on her face  it was of a rare and peculiar shadesomething that he had never seen before in woman  have you nothing to say she continued  your footsteps were audible to me from the very bottom and i knew they were yours  you look almost restored  i am almost restored he replied respectfully pressing her hand  a reason for living arose and i lived  what reason she inquired with a rapid blush  he pointed to the rocketlike object in the western sky  oh you mean the comet  well you will never make a courtier  you know of course what has happened to me that i have no longer a husbandhave had none for a year and a half  have you also heard that i am now quite a poor woman  tell me what you think of it  i have thought very little of it since i heard that you seemed to mind poverty but little  there is even this good in it that i may now be able to show you some little kindness for all those you have done me my dear lady  unless for economys sake i go and live abroad at dinan versailles or boulogne  swithin who had never thought of such a contingency was earnest in his regrets without however showing more than a sincere friends disappointment  i did not say it was absolutely necessary she continued  i have in fact grown so homely and homeloving i am so interested in the place and the people here that in spite of advice i have almost determined not to let the house but to continue the less businesslike but pleasanter alternative of living humbly in a part of it and shutting up the rest  your love of astronomy is getting as strong as mine he said ardently you could not tear yourself away from the observatory  you might have supposed me capable of a little human feeling as well as scientific in connection with the observatory  dear lady constantine by admitting that your astronomer has also a part of your interest  ah you did not find it out without my telling she said with a playfulness which was scarcely playful a new accession of pinkness being visible in her face  i diminish myself in your esteem by reminding you  you might do anything in this world without diminishing yourself in my esteem after the goodness you have shown  and more than that no misrepresentation no rumour no damning appearance whatever would ever shake my loyalty to you  but you put a very matteroffact construction on my motives sometimes you see me in such a hard light that i have to drop hints in quite a manoeuvring manner to let you know i am as sympathetic as other people  i sometimes think you would rather have me die than have your equatorial stolen  confess that your admiration for me was based on my house and position in the county  now i am shorn of all that glory such as it was and am a widow and am poorer than my tenants and can no longer buy telescopes and am unable from the narrowness of my circumstances to mix in circles that people formerly said i adorned i fear i have lost the little hold i once had over you  you are as unjust now as you have been generous hitherto said st cleeve with tears in his eyes at the gentle banter of the lady which he poor innocent read as her real opinions  seizing her hand he continued in tones between reproach and anger i swear to you that i have but two devotions two thoughts two hopes and two blessings in this world and that one of them is yourself  and the other  the pursuit of astronomy  and astronomy stands first  i have never ordinated two such dissimilar ideas  and why should you deplore your altered circumstances my dear lady  your widowhood if i may take the liberty to speak on such a subject is though i suppose a sadness not perhaps an unmixed evil  for though your pecuniary troubles have been discovered to the world and yourself by it your happiness in marriage was as you have confided to me not great and you are now left free as a bird to follow your own hobbies  i wonder you recognize that  but perhaps he added with a sigh of regret you will again fall a prey to some man some uninteresting country squire or other and be lost to the scientific world after all  if i fall a prey to any man it will not be to a country squire  but dont go on with this for heavens sake  you may think what you like in silence  we are forgetting the comet said st cleeve  he turned and set the instrument in order for observation and wheeled round the dome  while she was looking at the nucleus of the fiery plume that now filled so large a space of the sky as completely to dominate it swithin dropped his gaze upon the field and beheld in the dying light a number of labourers crossing directly towards the column  what do you see lady constantine asked without ceasing to observe the comet  some of the workfolk are coming this way  i know what they are coming fori promised to let them look at the comet through the glass  they must not come up here she said decisively  they shall await your time  i have a special reason for wishing them not to see me here  if you ask why i can tell you  they mistakenly suspect my interest to be less in astronomy than in the astronomer and they must have no showing for such a wild notion  what can you do to keep them out  ill lock the door said swithin  they will then think i am away  he ran down the staircase and she could hear him hastily turning the key lady constantine sighed  what weakness what weakness she said to herself  that envied power of selfcontrol where is it  that power of concealment which a woman should havewhere  to run such risks to come here aloneoh if it were known  but i was always soalways  she jumped up and followed him downstairs    xiii   he was standing immediately inside the door at the bottom though it was so dark she could hardly see him  the villagers were audibly talking just without  hes sure to come rathe or late resounded up the spiral in the vocal note of hezzy biles  he wouldnt let such a fine show as the comet makes tonight go by without peeping at itnot master cleeve  did ye bring along the flagon haymoss  then well sit down inside his little boardhouse here and wait  hell come afore bedtime  why his spy glass will stretch out that there comet as long as welland lane  id as soon miss the great peepshow that comes every year to greenhill fair as a sight of such a immortal spectacle as this said amos fry  immortal spectaclewhere did ye get that choice mossel haymoss inquired sammy blore  well well the lord save good scholarsand take just a bit o care of them that baint  as tis so dark in the hut suppose we draw out the bench into the front here souls  the bench was accordingly brought forth and in order to have a back to lean against they placed it exactly across the door into the spiral staircase  now have ye got any backy  if ye havent i have continued sammy blore  a striking of matches followed and the speaker concluded comfortably now we shall do very well  and what do this comet mean asked haymoss  that some great tumult is going to happen or that we shall die of a famine  famineno said nat chapman  that only touches such as we and the lord only consarns himself with born gentlemen  it isnt to be supposed that a strange fiery lantern like that would be lighted up for folks with ten or a dozen shillings a week and their gristing and a load o thorn faggots when we can get em  if tis a token that hes getting hot about the ways of anybody in this parish tis about my lady constantines since she is the only one of a figure worth such a hint  as for her incomethat shes now lost  ah well i dont take in all i hear  lady constantine drew close to st cleeves side and whispered trembling do you think they will wait long  or can we get out  swithin felt the awkwardness of the situation  the men had placed the bench close to the door which owing to the stairs within opened outwards so that at the first push by the pair inside to release themselves the bench must have gone over and sent the smokers sprawling on their faces  he whispered to her to ascend the column and wait till he came  and have the dead man left her nothing  hey  and have he carried his inheritance intos grave  and will his skeleton lie warm on account ot heehee said haymoss  tis all swallered up observed hezzy biles  his goingson made her miserable till a died and if i were the woman id have my randys now he ought to have bequeathed to her our young gent mr st cleeve as some sort of amends  id up and marry en if i were she since her downfall has brought em quite near together and made him as good as she in rank as he was afore in bone and breeding  dye think she will asked sammy blore  or is she meaning to enter upon a virgin life for the rest of her days  i dont want to be unreverent to her ladyship but i really dont think she is meaning any such waste of a christian carcase  i say shes rather meaning to commit flat matrimony wi somebody or other and one young gentleman in particular  but the young man himself  planned cut out and finished for the delight of ooman  yet he must be willing  that would soon come  if they get up this tower ruling plannards together much longer their plannards will soon rule them together in my way o thinking  if sheve a disposition towards the knot she can soon teach him  true true and lawfully  what before mid ha been a wrong desire is now a holy wish  the scales fell from swithin st cleeves eyes as he heard the words of his neighbours  how suddenly the truth dawned upon him how it bewildered him till he scarcely knew where he was how he recalled the full force of what he had only half apprehended at earlier times particularly of that sweet kiss she had impressed on his lips when she supposed him dyingthese vivid realizations are difficult to tell in slow verbiage  he could remain there no longer and with an electrified heart he retreated up the spiral  he found lady constantine half way to the top standing by a loophole and when she spoke he discovered that she was almost in tears  are they gone she asked  i fear they will not go yet he replied with a nervous fluctuation of manner that had never before appeared in his bearing towards her  what shall i do she asked  i ought not to be here nobody knows that i am out of the house  oh this is a mistake  i must go home somehow  did you hear what they were saying  no said she  what is the matter  surely you are disturbed  what did they say  it would be the exaggeration of frankness in me to tell you  is it what a woman ought not to be made acquainted with  it is in this case  it is so new and so indescribable an idea to methathe leant against the concave wall quite tremulous with strange incipient sentiments  what sort of an idea she asked gently  it isan awakening  in thinking of the heaven above i did not perceivethe  earth beneath  the better heaven beneath  pray dear lady constantine give me your hand for a moment  she seemed startled and the hand was not given  i am so anxious to get home she repeated  i did not mean to stay here more than five minutes  i fear i am much to blame for this accident he said  i ought not to have intruded here  but dont grieve  i will arrange for your escape somehow  be good enough to follow me down  they redescended and whispering to lady constantine to remain a few stairs behind he began to rattle and unlock the door  the men precipitately removed their bench and swithin stepped out the light of the summer night being still enough to enable them to distinguish him  well hezekiah and samuel and nat how are you he said boldly  well sir tis much as before wi me replied nat  one hour a week wi god amighty and the rest with the devil as a chap may say  and really now yer poor fathers gone id as lief that that sunday hour should pass like the rest for pason tarkenham do tease a fellers conscience that much that church is no hollerday at all to the limbs as it was in yer reverent fathers time  but weve been waiting here mr san cleeve supposing ye had not come  i have been staying at the top and fastened the door not to be disturbed  now i am sorry to disappoint you but i have another engagement this evening so that it would be inconvenient to admit you tomorrow evening or any evening but this i will show you the comet and any stars you like  they readily agreed to come the next night and prepared to depart  but what with the flagon and the pipes and the final observations getting away was a matter of time  meanwhile a cloud which nobody had noticed arose from the north overhead and large drops of rain began to fall so rapidly that the conclave entered the hut till it should be over  st cleeve strolled off under the firs  the next moment there was a rustling through the trees at another point and a man and woman appeared  the woman took shelter under a tree and the man bearing wraps and umbrellas came forward  my ladys man and maid said sammy  is her ladyship here asked the man  no  i reckon her ladyship keeps more kissable company replied nat chapman  pack o stuff said blore  not here  well to be sure  we cant find her anywhere in the wide house  ive been sent to look for her with these overclothes and umbrella  ive suffered horseflesh traipsing up and down and cant find her nowhere  lord lord where can she be and two months wages owing to me  why so anxious anthony green as i think yer name is shaped  you be not a married man said hezzy  tis what they call me neighbours whether or no  but surely you was a bachelor chap by late afore her ladyship got rid of the regular servants and took ye  i were but thats past  and how came ye to bow yer head to t anthony  tis what you never was inclined to  you was by no means a doting man in my time  well had i been left to my own free choice tis as like as not i should ha shunned forming such kindred being at that time a poor day man or weekly at my highest luck in hiring  but tis wearing work to hold out against the custom of the country and the woman wanting ye to stand by her and save her from unborn shame so since common usage would have it i let myself be carried away by opinion and took her  though shes never once thanked me for covering her confusion thats true  but tis the way of the lost when safe and i dont complain  here she is just behind under the tree if youd like to see hera very nice homespun woman to look at too for all her few weatherstains    well well where can my lady be  and i the trusty jineral mantis more than my place is worth to lose her  come forward christiana and talk nicely to the workfolk  while the woman was talking the rain increased so much that they all retreated further into the hut  st cleeve who had impatiently stood a little way off now saw his opportunity and putting in his head said the rain beats in you had better shut the door  i must ascend and close up the dome  slamming the door upon them without ceremony he quickly went to lady constantine in the column and telling her they could now pass the villagers unseen he gave her his arm  thus he conducted her across the front of the hut into the shadows of the firs  i will run to the house and harness your little carriage myself he said tenderly  i will then take you home in it  no please dont leave me alone under these dismal trees  neither would she hear of his getting her any wraps and opening her little sunshade to keep the rain out of her face she walked with him across the insulating field after which the trees of the park afforded her a sufficient shelter to reach home without much damage  swithin was too greatly affected by what he had overheard to speak much to her on the way and protected her as if she had been a shorn lamb after a farewell which had more meaning than sound in it he hastened back to ringshill speer  the workfolk were still in the hut and by dint of friendly converse and a sip at the flagon had so cheered mr and mrs anthony green that they neither thought nor cared what had become of lady constantine  st cleeves sudden sense of new relations with that sweet patroness had taken away in one halfhour his natural ingenuousness  henceforth he could act a part  i have made all secure at the top he said putting his head into the hut  i am now going home  when the rain stops lock this door and bring the key to my house    xiv   the laboured resistance which lady constantines judgment had offered to her rebellious affection ere she learnt that she was a widow now passed into a bashfulness that rendered her almost as unstable of mood as before  but she was one of that mettlefervid cordial and spontaneouswho had not the heart to spoil a passion and her affairs having gone to rack and ruin by no fault of her own she was left to a painfully narrowed existence which lent even something of rationality to her attachment  thus it was that her tender and unambitious soul found comfort in her reverses  as for st cleeve the tardiness of his awakening was the natural result of inexperience combined with devotion to a hobby  but like a spring bud hard in bursting the delay was compensated by after speed  at once breathlessly recognizing in this fellowwatcher of the skies a woman who loved him in addition to the patroness and friend he truly translated the nearly forgotten kiss she had given him in her moment of despair  lady constantine in being eight or nine years his senior was an object even better calculated to nourish a youths first passion than a girl of his own age superiority of experience and ripeness of emotion exercising the same peculiar fascination over him as over other young men in their first ventures in this kind  the alchemy which thus transmuted an abstracted astronomer into an eager loverand must it be said spoilt a promising young physicist to produce a commonplace inamoratomay be almost described as working its change in one short night  next morning he was so fascinated with the novel sensation that he wanted to rush off at once to lady constantine and say i love you true in the intensest tones of his mental condition to register his assertion in her heart before any of those accidents which creep in twixt vows and change decrees of kings should occur to hinder him  but his embarrassment at standing in a new position towards her would not allow him to present himself at her door in any such hurry  he waited on as helplessly as a girl for a chance of encountering her  but though she had tacitly agreed to see him on any reasonable occasion lady constantine did not put herself in his way  she even kept herself out of his way  now that for the first time he had learnt to feel a strong impatience for their meeting her shyness for the first time led her to delay it  but given two people living in one parish who long from the depths of their hearts to be in each others company what resolves of modesty policy pride or apprehension will keep them for any length of time apart  one afternoon he was watching the sun from his tower half echoing the greek astronomers wish that he might be set close to that luminary for the wonder of beholding it in all its glory under the slight penalty of being consumed the next instant  he glanced over the highroad between the field and the park which sublunary features now too often distracted his attention from his telescope and saw her passing along that way  she was seated in the donkeycarriage that had now taken the place of her landau the white animal looking no larger than a cat at that distance the buttoned boy who represented both coachman and footman walked alongside the animals head at a solemn pace the dog stalked at the distance of a yard behind the vehicle without indulging in a single gambol and the whole turnout resembled in dignity a dwarfed state procession  here was an opportunity but for two obstructions the boy who might be curious and the dog who might bark and attract the attention of any labourers or servants near  yet the risk was to be run and knowing that she would soon turn up a certain shady lane at right angles to the road she had followed he ran hastily down the staircase crossed the barley which now covered the field by the path not more than a foot wide that he had trodden for himself and got into the lane at the other end  by slowly walking along in the direction of the turnpikeroad he soon had the satisfaction of seeing her coming  to his surprise he also had the satisfaction of perceiving that neither boy nor dog was in her company  they both blushed as they approached she from sex he from inexperience one thing she seemed to see in a moment that in the interval of her absence st cleeve had become a man and as he greeted her with this new and maturer light in his eyes she could not hide her embarrassment or meet their fire  i have just sent my page across to the column with your book on cometary nuclei she said softly that you might not have to come to the house for it  i did not know i should meet you here  didnt you wish me to come to the house for it  i did not frankly  you know why do you not  yes i know  well my longing is at rest  i have met you again  but are you unwell that you drive out in this chair  no i walked out this morning and am a little tired  i have been looking for you night and day  why do you turn your face aside  you used not to be so  her hand rested on the side of the chair and he took it  do you know that since we last met i have been thinking of youdaring to think of youas i never thought of you before  yes i know it  how did you know  i saw it in your face when you came up  well i suppose i ought not to think of you so  and yet had i not learned to i should never fully have felt how gentle and sweet you are only think of my loss if i had lived and died without seeing more in you than in astronomy  but i shall never leave off doing so now  when you talk i shall love your understanding when you are silent i shall love your face  but how shall i know that you care to be so much to me  her manner was disturbed as she recognized the impending selfsurrender which she knew not how to resist and was not altogether at ease in welcoming  o lady constantine he continued bending over her give me some proof more than mere seeming and inference which are all i have at present that you dont think this i tell you of presumption in me  i have been unable to do anything since i last saw you for pondering uncertainly on this  some proof or little sign that we are one in heart  a blush settled again on her face and half in effort half in spontaneity she put her finger on her cheek  he almost devotionally kissed the spot  does that suffice she asked scarcely giving her words voice  yes i am convinced  then that must be the end  let me drive on the boy will be back again soon  she spoke hastily and looked askance to hide the heat of her cheek  no the tower door is open and he will go to the top and waste his time in looking through the telescope  then you should rush back for he will do some damage  no he may do what he likes tinker and spoil the instrument destroy my papersanything so that he will stay there and leave us alone  she glanced up with a species of pained pleasure  you never used to feel like that she said and there was keen self reproach in her voice  you were once so devoted to your science that the thought of an intruder into your temple would have driven you wild now you dont care and who is to blame  ah not you not you  the animal ambled on with her and he leaning on the side of the little vehicle kept her company  well dont let us think of that he said  i offer myself and all my energies frankly and entirely to you my dear dear lady whose i shall be always  but my words in telling you this will only injure my meaning instead of emphasize it  in expressing even to myself my thoughts of you i find that i fall into phrases which as a critic i should hitherto have heartily despised for their commonness  whats the use of saying for instance as i have just said that i give myself entirely to you and shall be yours alwaysthat you have my devotion my highest homage  those words have been used so frequently in a flippant manner that honest use of them is not distinguishable from the unreal  he turned to her and added smiling your eyes are to be my stars for the future  yes i know iti know it and all you would say  i dreaded even while i hoped for this my dear young friend she replied her eyes being full of tears  i am injuring you who knows that i am not ruining your futurei who ought to know better  nothing can come of this nothing mustand i am only wasting your time  why have i drawn you off from a grand celestial study to study poor lonely me  say you will never despise me when you get older for this episode in our lives  but you willi know you will  all men do when they have been attracted in their unsuspecting youth as i have attracted you  i ought to have kept my resolve  what was that  to bear anything rather than draw you from your high purpose to be like the noble citizen of old greece who attending a sacrifice let himself be burnt to the bone by a coal that jumped into his sleeve rather than disturb the sacred ceremony  but can i not study and love both  i hope soi earnestly hope so  but youll be the first if you do and i am the responsible one if you do not  you speak as if i were quite a child and you immensely older  why how old do you think i am  i am twenty  you seem younger  well thats so much the better  twenty sounds strong and firm  how old do you think i am  i have never thought of considering  he innocently turned to scrutinize her face  she winced a little  but the instinct was premature  time had taken no liberties with her features as yet nor had trouble very roughly handled her  i will tell you she replied speaking almost with physical pain yet as if determination should carry her through  i am eightandtwentynearlyi mean a little more a few months more  am i not a fearful deal older than you  at first it seems a great deal he answered musing  but it doesnt seem much when one gets used to it  nonsense she exclaimed  it is a good deal  very well then sweetest lady constantine let it be he said gently  you should not let it be  a polite man would have flatly contradicted me     o i am ashamed of this she added a moment after with a subdued sad look upon the ground  i am speaking by the card of the outer world which i have left behind utterly no such lip service is known in your sphere  i care nothing for those things really but that which is called the eve in us will out sometimes  well we will forget that now as we must at no very distant date forget all the rest of this  he walked beside her thoughtfully awhile with his eyes also bent on the road  why must we forget it all he inquired  it is only an interlude  an interlude  it is no interlude to me  o how can you talk so lightly of this lady constantine  and yet if i were to go away from here i might perhaps soon reduce it to an interlude  yes he resumed impulsively i will go away  love dies and it is just as well to strangle it in its birth it can only die once  ill go  no no she said looking up apprehensively  i misled you  it is no interlude to meit is tragical  i only meant that from a worldly point of view it is an interlude which we should try to forget  but the world is not all  you will not go away  but he continued drearily yes yes i see it all you have enlightened me  it will be hurting your prospects even more than mine if i stay now sir blount is dead you are free againmay marry where you will but for this fancy of ours  ill leave welland before harm comes of my staying  dont decide to do a thing so rash she begged seizing his hand and looking miserable at the effect of her words  i shall have nobody left in the world to care for  and now i have given you the great telescope and lent you the column it would be ungrateful to go away  i was wrong believe me that i did not mean that it was a mere interlude to me  o if you only knew how very very far it is from that  it is my doubt of the result to you that makes me speak so slightingly  they were now approaching crossroads and casually looking up they beheld thirty or forty yards beyond the crossing mr torkingham who was leaning over a gate his back being towards them  as yet he had not recognized their approach  the masterpassion had already supplanted st cleeves natural ingenuousness by subtlety  would it be well for us to meet mr torkingham just now he began  certainly not she said hastily and pulling the rein she instantly drove down the righthand road  i cannot meet anybody she murmured would it not be better that you leave me nownot for my pleasure but that there may arise no distressing tales about us before we knowhow to act in thisthisshe smiled faintly at him heartaching extremity  they were passing under a huge oaktree whose limbs irregular with shoulders knuckles and elbows stretched horizontally over the lane in a manner recalling absaloms death  a slight rustling was perceptible amid the leafage as they drew out from beneath it and turning up his eyes swithin saw that very buttoned page whose advent they had dreaded looking down with interest at them from a perch not much higher than a yard above their heads  he had a bunch of oakapples in one hand plainly the object of his climb and was furtively watching lady constantine with the hope that she might not see him  but that she had already done though she did not reveal it and fearing that the latter words of their conversation had been overheard they spoke not till they had passed the next turning  she stretched out her hand to his  this must not go on she said imploringly  my anxiety as to what may be said of such methods of meeting makes me too unhappy  see what has happened  she could not help smiling  out of the fryingpan into the fire  after meanly turning to avoid the parson we have rushed into a worse publicity  it is too humiliating to have to avoid people and lowers both you and me  the only remedy is not to meet  very well said swithin with a sigh  so it shall be  and with smiles that might more truly have been tears they parted there and then    xv   the summer passed away and autumn with its infinite suite of tints came creeping on  darker grew the evenings tearfuller the moonlights and heavier the dews  meanwhile the comet had waxed to its largest dimensionsso large that not only the nucleus but a portion of the tail had been visible in broad day  it was now on the wane though every night the equatorial still afforded an opportunity of observing the singular object which would soon disappear altogether from the heavens for perhaps thousands of years  but the astronomer of the ringshill speer was no longer a match for his celestial materials  scientifically he had become but a dim vapour of himself the lover had come into him like an armed man and cast out the student and his intellectual situation was growing a lifeanddeath matter  the resolve of the pair had been so far kept they had not seen each other in private for three months  but on one day in october he ventured to write a note to her     i can do nothing  i have ceased to study ceased to observe  the    equatorial is useless to me  this affection i have for you absorbs my    life and outweighs my intentions  the power to labour in this    grandest of fields has left me  i struggle against the weakness till    i think of the cause and then i bless her  but the very desperation    of my circumstances has suggested a remedy and this i would inform    you of at once     can you come to me since i must not come to you  i will wait to    morrow night at the edge of the plantation by which you would enter to    the column  i will not detain you my plan can be told in ten words  the night after posting this missive to her he waited at the spot mentioned  it was a melancholy evening for coming abroad  a blusterous wind had risen during the day and still continued to increase  yet he stood watchful in the darkness and was ultimately rewarded by discerning a shady muffled shape that embodied itself from the field accompanied by the scratching of silk over stubble  there was no longer any disguise as to the nature of their meeting  it was a lovers assignation pure and simple and boldly realizing it as such he clasped her in his arms  i cannot bear this any longer he exclaimed  three months since i saw you alone  only a glimpse of you in church or a bow from the distance in all that time  what a fearful struggle this keeping apart has been  yet i would have had strength to persist since it seemed best she murmured when she could speak had not your words on your condition so alarmed and saddened me  this inability of yours to work or study or observeit is terrible  so terrible a sting is it to my conscience that your hint about a remedy has brought me instantly  yet i dont altogether mind it since it is you my dear who have displaced the work and yet the loss of time nearly distracts me when i have neither the power to work nor the delight of your company  but your remedy  o i cannot help guessing it  yes you are going away  let us ascend the column we can speak more at ease there  then i will explain all  i would not ask you to climb so high but the hut is not yet furnished  he entered the cabin at the foot and having lighted a small lantern conducted her up the hollow staircase to the top where he closed the slides of the dome to keep out the wind and placed the observingchair for her  i can stay only five minutes she said without sitting down  you said it was important that you should see me and i have come  i assure you it is at a great risk  if i am seen here at this time i am ruined for ever  but what would i not do for you  o swithin your remedyis it to go away  there is no other and yet i dread that like death  i can tell you in a moment but i must begin at the beginning  all this ruinous idleness and distraction is caused by the misery of our not being able to meet with freedom  the fear that something may snatch you from me keeps me in a state of perpetual apprehension  it is too true also of me  i dread that some accident may happen and waste my days in meeting the trouble halfway  so our lives go on and our labours stand still  now for the remedy dear lady constantine allow me to marry you  she started and the wind without shook the building sending up a yet intenser moan from the firs  i mean marry you quite privately  let it make no difference whatever to our outward lives for years for i know that in my present position you could not possibly acknowledge me as husband publicly  but by marrying at once we secure the certainty that we cannot be divided by accident coaxing or artifice and at ease on that point i shall embrace my studies with the old vigour and you yours  lady constantine was so agitated at the unexpected boldness of such a proposal from one hitherto so boyish and deferential that she sank into the observingchair her intention to remain for only a few minutes being quite forgotten  she covered her face with her hands  no no i dare not she whispered  but is there a single thing else left to do he pleaded kneeling down beside her less in supplication than in abandonment  what else can we do  wait till you are famous  but i cannot be famous unless i strive and this distracting condition prevents all striving  could you not strive on if igave you a promise a solemn promise to be yours when your name is fairly well known  st cleeve breathed heavily  it will be a long weary time he said and even with your promise i shall work but halfheartedly  every hour of study will be interrupted with suppose this or this happens suppose somebody persuades her to break her promise worse still suppose some rival maligns me and so seduces her away  no lady constantine dearest best as you are that element of distraction would still remain and where that is no sustained energy is possible  many erroneous things have been written and said by the sages but never did they float a greater fallacy than that love serves as a stimulus to win the loved one by patient toil  i cannot argue with you she said weakly  my only possible other chance would lie in going away he resumed after a moments reflection with his eyes on the lantern flame which waved and smoked in the currents of air that leaked into the dome from the fierce windstream without  if i might take away the equatorial supposing it possible that i could find some suitable place for observing in the southern hemispheresay at the capei might be able to apply myself to serious work again after the lapse of a little time  the southern constellations offer a less exhausted field for investigation  i wonder if i might  you mean she answered uneasily that you might apply yourself to work when your recollection of me began to fade and my life to become a matter of indifference to you    yes go  noi cannot bear it  the remedy is worse than the disease  i cannot let you go away  then how can you refuse the only condition on which i can stay without ruin to my purpose and scandal to your name  dearest agree to my proposal as you love both me and yourself  he waited while the firtrees rubbed and prodded the base of the tower and the wind roared around and shook it but she could not find words to reply  would to god he burst out that i might perish here like winstanley in his lighthouse  then the difficulty would be solved for you  you are so wrong so very wrong in saying so she exclaimed passionately  you may doubt my wisdom pity my shortsightedness but there is one thing you do knowthat i love you dearly  you doi know it he said softened in a moment  but it seems such a simple remedy for the difficulty that i cannot see how you can mind adopting it if you care so much for me as i do for you  should we live    just as we are exactly    supposing i agreed she faintly inquired  yes that is my idea  quite privately you say  how couldthe marriage be quite private  i would go away to london and get a license  then you could come to me and return again immediately after the ceremony  i could return at leisure and not a soul in the world would know what had taken place think dearest with what a free conscience you could then assist me in my efforts to plumb these deeps above us  any feeling that you may now have against clandestine meetings as such would then be removed and our hearts would be at rest  there was a certain scientific practicability even in his lovemaking and it here came out excellently  but she sat on with suspended breath her heart wildly beating while he waited in openmouthed expectation each was swayed by the emotion within them much as the candleflame was swayed by the tempest without  it was the most critical evening of their lives  the pale rays of the little lantern fell upon her beautiful face snugly and neatly bound in by her black bonnet but not a beam of the lantern leaked out into the night to suggest to any watchful eye that human life at its highest excitement was beating within the dark and isolated tower for the dome had no windows and every shutter that afforded an opening for the telescope was hermetically closed  predilections and misgivings so equally strove within her still youthful breast that she could not utter a word her intention wheeled this way and that like the balance of a watch  his unexpected proposition had brought about the smartest encounter of inclination with prudence of impulse with reserve that she had ever known  of all the reasons that she had expected him to give for his urgent request to see her this evening an offer of marriage was probably the last  whether or not she had ever amused herself with hypothetical fancies on such a subjectand it was only natural that she should vaguely have done sothe courage in her prot√©g√© coolly to advance it without a hint from herself that such a proposal would be tolerated showed her that there was more in his character than she had reckoned on and the discovery almost frightened her  the humour attitude and tenor of her attachment had been of quite an unpremeditated quality unsuggestive of any such audacious solution to their distresses as this  i repeat my question dearest he said after her long pause  shall it be done  or shall i exile myself and study as best i can in some distant country out of sight and sound  are those the only alternatives  yes yes i suppose they are  she waited yet another moment bent over his kneeling figure and kissed his forehead  yes it shall be done she whispered  i will marry you  my angel i am content  he drew her yielding form to his heart and her head sank upon his shoulder as he pressed his two lips continuously upon hers  to such had the study of celestial physics brought them in the space of eight months one week and a few odd days  i am weaker than youfar the weaker she went on her tears falling rather than lose you out of my sight i will marry without stipulation or condition  buti put it to your kindnessgrant me one little request  he instantly assented  it is that in consideration of my peculiar position in this countyo you cant understand ityou will not put an end to the absolute secrecy of our relationship without my full assent  also that you will never come to welland house without first discussing with me the advisability of the visit accepting my opinion on the point  there see how a timid woman tries to fence herself in  my dear ladylove neither of those two highhanded courses should i have taken even had you not stipulated against them  the very essence of our marriage plan is that those two conditions are kept  i see as well as you do even more than you do how important it is that for the presentay for a long time hencei should still be but the curates lonely son unattached to anybody or anything with no object of interest but his science and you the recluse lady of the manor to whom he is only an acquaintance  see what deceits love sows in honest minds  it would be a humiliation to you at present that i could not bear if a marriage between us were made public an inconvenience without any compensating advantage  i am so glad you assume it without my setting it before you  now i know you are not only good and true but politic and trustworthy  well then here is our covenant  my lady swears to marry me i in return for such great courtesy swear never to compromise her by intruding at welland house and to keep the marriage concealed till i have won a position worthy of her  or till i request it to be made known she added possibly foreseeing a contingency which had not occurred to him  or till you request it he repeated  it is agreed murmured lady constantine    xvi   after this there only remained to be settled between them the practical details of the project  these were that he should leave home in a couple of days and take lodgings either in the distant city of bath or in a convenient suburb of london till a sufficient time should have elapsed to satisfy legal requirements that on a fine morning at the end of this time she should hie away to the same place and be met at the station by st cleeve armed with the marriage license whence they should at once proceed to the church fixed upon for the ceremony returning home independently in the course of the next two or three days  while these tactics were under discussion the twoandthirty winds of heaven continued as before to beat about the tower though their onsets appeared to be somewhat lessening in force  himself now calmed and satisfied swithin as is the wont of humanity took serener views of natures crushing mechanics without and said the wind doesnt seem disposed to put the tragic period to our hopes and fears that i spoke of in my momentary despair  the disposition of the wind is as vicious as ever she answered looking into his face with pausing thoughts on perhaps other subjects than that discussed  it is your mood of viewing it that has changed there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so  and as if flatly to stultify swithins assumption a circular hurricane exceeding in violence any that had preceded it seized hold upon rings hill speer at that moment with the determination of a conscious agent the first sensation of a resulting catastrophe was conveyed to their intelligence by the flapping of the candleflame against the lanternglass then the wind which hitherto they had heard rather than felt rubbed past them like a fugitive  swithin beheld around and above him in place of the concavity of the dome the open heaven with its racing clouds remote horizon and intermittent gleam of stars  the dome that had covered the tower had been whirled off bodily and they heard it descend crashing upon the trees  finding himself untouched swithin stretched out his arms towards lady constantine whose apparel had been seized by the spinning air nearly lifting her off her legs  she too was as yet unharmed  each held the other for a moment when fearing that something further would happen they took shelter in the staircase  dearest what an escape he said still holding her  what is the accident she asked  has the whole top really gone  the dome has been blown off the roof  as soon as it was practicable he relit the extinguished lantern and they emerged again upon the leads where the extent of the disaster became at once apparent  saving the absence of the enclosing hemisphere all remained the same  the dome being constructed of wood was light by comparison with the rest of the structure and the wheels which allowed it horizontal or as swithin expressed it azimuth motion denied it a firm hold upon the walls so that it had been lifted off them like a cover from a pot  the equatorial stood in the midst as it had stood before  having executed its grotesque purpose the wind sank to comparative mildness  swithin took advantage of this lull by covering up the instruments with cloths after which the betrothed couple prepared to go downstairs  but the events of the night had not yet fully disclosed themselves  at this moment there was a sound of footsteps and a knocking at the door below  it cant be for me said lady constantine  i retired to my room before leaving the house and told them on no account to disturb me  she remained at the top while swithin went down the spiral  in the gloom he beheld hannah  o master swithin can ye come home  the wind have blowed down the chimley that dont smoke and the pinningend with it and the old ancient house that have been in your family so long as the memory of man is naked to the world  it is a mercy that your grammer were not killed sitting by the hearth poor old soul and soon to walk wi godfor a s getting wambling on her pins mr swithin as aged folks do  as i say a was all but murdered by the elements and doing no more harm than the babes in the wood nor speaking one harmful word  and the fire and smoke were blowed all across house like a chapter in revelation and your poor reverent fathers features scorched to flakes looking like the vilest ruffian and the gilt frame spoiled  every flitch every eye piece and every chine is buried under the walling and i fed them pigs with my own hands master swithin little thinking they would come to this end  do ye collect yourself mr swithin and come at once  i willi will  ill follow you in a moment  do you hasten back again and assist  when hannah had departed the young man ran up to lady constantine to whom he explained the accident  after sympathizing with old mrs martin lady constantine added i thought something would occur to mar our scheme  i am not quite sure of that yet  on a short consideration with him she agreed to wait at the top of the tower till he could come back and inform her if the accident were really so serious as to interfere with his plan for departure  he then left her and there she sat in the dark alone looking over the parapet and straining her eyes in the direction of the homestead  at first all was obscurity but when he had been gone about ten minutes lights began to move to and fro in the hollow where the house stood and shouts occasionally mingled with the wind which retained some violence yet playing over the trees beneath her as on the strings of a lyre  but not a bough of them was visible a cloak of blackness covering everything netherward while overhead the windy sky looked down with a strange and disguised face the three or four stars that alone were visible being so dissociated by clouds that she knew not which they were  under any other circumstances lady constantine might have felt a nameless fear in thus sitting aloft on a lonely column with a forest groaning under her feet and palaeolithic dead men feeding its roots but the recent passionate decision stirred her pulses to an intensity beside which the ordinary tremors of feminine existence asserted themselves in vain  the apocalyptic effect of the scene surrounding her was indeed not inharmonious and afforded an appropriate background to her intentions  after what seemed to her an interminable space of time quick steps in the staircase became audible above the roar of the firs and in a few instants st cleeve again stood beside her  the case of the homestead was serious  hannahs account had not been exaggerated in substance the gable end of the house was open to the garden the joists left without support had dropped and with them the upper floor  by the help of some labourers who lived near and lady constantines man anthony who was passing at the time the homestead had been propped up and protected for the night by some rickcloths but swithin felt that it would be selfish in the highest degree to leave two lonely old women to themselves at this juncture  in short he concluded despondently i cannot go to stay in bath or london just now perhaps not for another fortnight  never mind she said  a fortnight hence will do as well  and i have these for you he continued  your man green was passing my grandmothers on his way back from warborne where he had been he says for any letters that had come for you by the evening post  as he stayed to assist the other men i told him i would go on to your house with the letters he had brought  of course i did not tell him i should see you here  thank you  of course not  now ill return at once  in descending the column her eye fell upon the superscription of one of the letters and she opened and glanced over it by the lantern light  she seemed startled and musing said the postponement of ourintention must be i fear for a long time  i find that after the end of this month i cannot leave home safely even for a day  perceiving that he was about to ask why she added i will not trouble you with the reason now it would only harass you  it is only a family business and cannot be helped  then we cannot be married tillgod knows when said swithin blankly i cannot leave home till after the next week or two you cannot leave home unless within that time  so what are we to do  i do not know  my dear dear one dont let us be beaten like this  dont let a well considered plan be overthrown by a mere accident  heres a remedy  do you go and stay the requisite time in the parish we are to be married in instead of me  when my grandmother is again well housed i can come to you instead of you to me as we first said  then it can be done within the time  reluctantly shyly and yet with a certain gladness of heart she gave way to his proposal that they should change places in the programme there was much that she did not like in it she said  it seemed to her as if she were taking the initiative by going and attending to the preliminaries  it was the mans part to do that in her opinion and was usually undertaken by him  but argued swithin there are cases in which the woman does give the notices and so on that is to say when the man is absolutely hindered from doing so and ours is such a case  the seeming is nothing i know the truth and what does it matter  you do not refuseretract your word to be my wife because to avoid a sickening delay the formalities require you to attend to them in place of me  she did not refuse she said  in short she agreed to his entreaty  they had in truth gone so far in their dream of union that there was no drawing back now  whichever of them was forced by circumstances to be the protagonist in the enterprise the thing must be done  their intention to become husband and wife at first halting and timorous had accumulated momentum with the lapse of hours till it now bore down every obstacle in its course  since you beg me tosince there is no alternative between my going and a long postponement she said as they stood in the dark porch of welland house before partingsince i am to go first and seem to be the pioneer in this adventure promise me swithin promise your viviette that in years to come when perhaps you may not love me so warmly as you do now  that will never be  well hoping it will not but supposing it should promise me that you will never reproach me as the one who took the initiative when it should have been yourself forgetting that it was at your request promise that you will never say i showed immodest readiness to do so or anything which may imply your obliviousness of the fact that i act in obedience to necessity and your earnest prayer  need it be said that he promised never to reproach her with that or any other thing as long as they should live  the few details of the reversed arrangement were soon settled bath being the place finally decided on then with a warm audacity which events had encouraged he pressed her to his breast and she silently entered the house  he returned to the homestead there to attend to the unexpected duties of repairing the havoc wrought by the gale        that night in the solitude of her chamber lady constantine reopened and read the subjoined letterone of those handed to her by st cleeve      street piccadilly    october 15 18     dear vivietteyou will be surprised to learn that i am in england    and that i am again out of harnessunless you should have seen the    latter in the papers  rio janeiro may do for monkeys but it wont do    for me  having resigned the appointment i have returned here as a    preliminary step to finding another vent for my energies in other    words another milch cow for my sustenance  i knew nothing whatever    of your husbands death till two days ago so that any letter from you    on the subject at the time it became known must have miscarried    hypocrisy at such a moment is worse than useless and i therefore do    not condole with you particularly as the event though new to a    banished man like me occurred so long since  you are better without    him viviette and are now just the limb for doing something for    yourself notwithstanding the threadbare state in which you seem to    have been cast upon the world  you are still young and as i imagine    unless you have vastly altered since i beheld you goodlooking    therefore make up your mind to retrieve your position by a match with    one of the local celebrities and you would do well to begin drawing    neighbouring covers at once  a genial squire with more weight than    wit more realty than weight and more personalty than realty    considering the circumstances would be best for you  you might    make a position for us both by some such alliance for to tell the    truth i have had but inandout luck so far  i shall be with you in    little more than a fortnight when we will talk over the matter    seriously if you dont objectyour affectionate brother     louis  it was this allusion to her brothers coming visit which had caught her eye in the tower staircase and led to a modification in the wedding arrangement  having read the letter through once lady constantine flung it aside with an impatient little stamp that shook the decaying old floor and casement its contents produced perturbation misgiving but not retreat  the deep glow of enchantment shed by the idea of a private union with her beautiful young lover killed the pale light of cold reasoning from an indifferently good relative  oh no she murmured as she sat covering her face with her hand  not for wealth untold could i give him up now  no argument short of apollo in person from the clouds would have influenced her  she made her preparations for departure as if nothing had intervened    xvii   in her days of prosperity lady constantine had often gone to the city of bath either frivolously for shopping purposes or musicoreligiously to attend choir festivals in the abbey so there was nothing surprising in her reverting to an old practice  that the journey might appear to be of a somewhat similar nature she took with her the servant who had been accustomed to accompany her on former occasions though the woman having now left her service and settled in the village as the wife of anthony green with a young child on her hands could with some difficulty leave home  lady constantine overcame the anxious mothers scruples by providing that young green should be well cared for and knowing that she could count upon this womans fidelity if upon anybodys in case of an accident for it was chiefly lady constantines exertions that had made an honest wife of mrs green she departed for a fortnights absence  the next day found mistress and maid settled in lodgings in an old plum coloured brick street which a hundred years ago could boast of rank and fashion among its residents though now the broad fanlight over each broad door admitted the sun to the halls of a lodginghouse keeper only the lampposts were still those that had done duty with oil lights and rheumatic old coachmen and postilions that once had driven and ridden gloriously from london to lands end ornamented with their bent persons and bow legs the pavement in front of the chief inn in the sorry hope of earning sixpence to keep body and soul together  we are kept well informed on the time o day my lady said mrs green as she pulled down the blinds in lady constantines room on the evening of their arrival  theres a church exactly at the back of us and i hear every hour strike  lady constantine said she had noticed that there was a church quite near  well it is better to have that at the back than other folks winders and if your ladyship wants to go there it wont be far to walk  thats what occurred to me said lady constantine if i should want to go  during the ensuing days she felt to the utmost the tediousness of waiting merely that time might pass  not a soul knew her there and she knew not a soul a circumstance which while it added to her sense of secrecy intensified her solitude  occasionally she went to a shop with green as her companion  though there were purchases to be made they were by no means of a pressing nature and but poorly filled up the vacancies of those strange speculative daysdays surrounded by a shade of fear yet poetized by sweet expectation  on the thirteenth day she told green that she was going to take a walk and leaving the house she passed by the obscurest streets to the abbey after wandering about beneath the aisles till her courage was screwed to its highest she went out at the other side and looking timidly round to see if anybody followed walked on till she came to a certain door which she reached just at the moment when her heart began to sink to its very lowest rendering all the screwing up in vain  whether it was because the month was october or from any other reason the deserted aspect of the quarter in general sat especially on this building  moreover the pavement was up and heaps of stone and gravel obstructed the footway  nobody was coming nobody was going in that thoroughfare she appeared to be the single one of the human race bent upon marriage business which seemed to have been unanimously abandoned by all the rest of the world as proven folly  but she thought of swithin his blonde hair ardent eyes and eloquent lips and was carried onward by the very reflection  entering the surrogates room lady constantine managed at the last juncture to state her errand in tones so collected as to startle even herself to which her listener replied also as if the whole thing were the most natural in the world  when it came to the affirmation that she had lived fifteen days in the parish she said with dismay  o no  i thought the fifteen days meant the interval of residence before the marriage takes place  i have lived here only thirteen days and a half  now i must come again  ahwelli think you need not be so particular said the surrogate as a matter of fact though the letter of the law requires fifteen days residence many people make five sufficient  the provision is inserted as you doubtless are aware to hinder runaway marriages as much as possible and secret unions and other such objectionable practices  you need not come again  that evening lady constantine wrote to swithin st cleeve the last letter of the fortnight     my dearestdo come to me as soon as you can  by a sort of    favouring blunder i have been able to shorten the time of waiting by a    day  come at once for i am almost broken down with apprehension  it    seems rather rash at moments all this and i wish you were here to    reassure me  i did not know i should feel so alarmed  i am    frightened at every footstep and dread lest anybody who knows me    should accost me and find out why i am here  i sometimes wonder how    i could have agreed to come and enact your part but i did not realize    how trying it would be  you ought not to have asked me swithin upon    my word it was too cruel of you and i will punish you for it when    you come  but i wont upbraid  i hope the homestead is repaired that    has cost me all this sacrifice of modesty  if it were anybody in the    world but you in question i would rush home without waiting here    for the end of iti really think i would  but dearest no  i must    show my strength now or let it be for ever hid  the barriers of    ceremony are broken down between us and it is for the best that i am    here  and yet at no point of this trying prelude need lady constantine have feared for her strength  deeds in this connexion demand the particular kind of courage that such perfervid women are endowed with the courage of their emotions in which young men are often lamentably deficient  her fear was in truth the fear of being discovered in an unwonted position not of the act itself  and though her letter was in its way a true exposition of her feeling had it been necessary to go through the whole legal process over again she would have been found equal to the emergency  it had been for some days a point of anxiety with her what to do with green during the morning of the wedding  chance unexpectedly helped her in this difficulty  the day before the purchase of the license green came to lady constantine with a letter in her hand from her husband anthony her face as long as a fiddle  i hope theres nothing the matter said lady constantine  the childs took bad my lady said mrs green with suspended floods of water in her eyes  i love the child better than i shall love all them thats coming put together for hes been a good boy to his mother ever since twelve weeks afore he was born  twas he a tender deary that made anthony marry me and thereby turned hisself from a little calamity to a little blessing  for as you know the man were a backward man in the church part o matrimony my lady though hell do anything when hes forced a bit by his manly feelings  and now to lose the childhoohoohoo  what shall i doo  well you want to go home at once i suppose  mrs green explained between her sobs that such was her desire and though this was a day or two sooner than her mistress had wished to be left alone she consented to greens departure  so during the afternoon her woman went off with directions to prepare for lady constantines return in two or three days  but as the exact day of her return was uncertain no carriage was to be sent to the station to meet her her intention being to hire one from the hotel  lady constantine was now left in utter solitude to await her lovers arrival    xviii   a more beautiful october morning than that of the next day never beamed into the welland valleys  the yearly dissolution of leafage was setting in apace  the foliage of the park trees rapidly resolved itself into the multitude of complexions which mark the subtle grades of decay reflecting wet lights of such innumerable hues that it was a wonder to think their beauties only a repetition of scenes that had been exhibited there on scores of previous octobers and had been allowed to pass away without a single dirge from the imperturbable beings who walked among them  far in the shadows semiopaque screens of blue haze made mysteries of the commonest gravelpit dingle or recess  the wooden cabin at the foot of ringshill speer had been furnished by swithin as a sitting and sleeping apartment some little while before this time for he had found it highly convenient during night observations at the top of the column to remain on the spot all night not to disturb his grandmother by passing in and out of the house and to save himself the labour of incessantly crossing the field  he would much have liked to tell her the secret and had it been his own to tell would probably have done so but sharing it with an objector who knew not his grandmothers affection so well as he did himself there was no alternative to holding his tongue  the more effectually to guard it he decided to sleep at the cabin during the two or three nights previous to his departure leaving word at the homestead that in a day or two he was going on an excursion  it was very necessary to start early  long before the great eye of the sun was lifted high enough to glance into the welland valley st cleeve arose from his bed in the cabin and prepared to depart cooking his breakfast upon a little stove in the corner  the young rabbits littered during the foregoing summer watched his preparations through the open door from the grey dawn without as he bustled half dressed in and out under the boughs and among the blackberries and brambles that grew around  it was a strange place for a bridegroom to perform his toilet in but considering the unconventional nature of the marriage a not inappropriate one  what events had been enacted in that earthen camp since it was first thrown up nobody could say but the primitive simplicity of the young mans preparations accorded well with the prehistoric spot on which they were made  embedded under his feet were possibly even now rude trinkets that had been worn at bridal ceremonies of the early inhabitants  little signified those ceremonies today or the happiness or otherwise of the contracting parties  that his own rite nevertheless signified much was the inconsequent reasoning of swithin as it is of many another bridegroom besides and he like the rest went on with his preparations in that mood which sees in his stale repetition the wondrous possibilities of an untried move  then through the wet cobwebs that hung like movable diaphragms on each blade and bough he pushed his way down to the furrow which led from the secluded firtree island to the wide world beyond the field  he was not a stranger to enterprise and still less to the contemplation of enterprise but an enterprise such as this he had never even outlined that his dear lady was troubled at the situation he had placed her in by not going himself on that errand he could see from her letter but believing an immediate marriage with her to be the true way of restoring to both that equanimity necessary to serene philosophy he held it of little account how the marriage was brought about and happily began his journey towards her place of sojourn  he passed through a little copse before leaving the parish the smoke from newly lit fires rising like the stems of blue trees out of the few cottage chimneys  here he heard a quick familiar footstep in the path ahead of him and turning the corner of the bushes confronted the foot post on his way to welland  in answer to st cleeves inquiry if there was anything for himself the postman handed out one letter and proceeded on his route  swithin opened and read the letter as he walked till it brought him to a standstill by the importance of its contents  they were enough to agitate a more phlegmatic youth than he  he leant over the wicket which came in his path and endeavoured to comprehend the sense of the whole  the large long envelope contained first a letter from a solicitor in a northern town informing him that his paternal greatuncle who had recently returned from the cape whither he had gone in an attempt to repair a broken constitution was now dead and buried  this greatuncles name was like a new creation to swithin  he had held no communication with the young mans branch of the family for innumerable yearsnever in fact since the marriage of swithins father with the simple daughter of welland farm  he had been a bachelor to the end of his life and had amassed a fairly good professional fortune by a long and extensive medical practice in the smoky dreary manufacturing town in which he had lived and died  swithin had always been taught to think of him as the embodiment of all that was unpleasant in man  he was narrow sarcastic and shrewd to unseemliness  that very shrewdness had enabled him without much professional profundity to establish his large and lucrative connexion which lay almost entirely among a class who neither looked nor cared for drawingroom courtesies  however what dr st cleeve had been as a practitioner matters little he was now dead and the bulk of his property had been left to persons with whom this story has nothing to do  but swithin was informed that out of it there was a bequest of 600 pounds a year to himselfpayment of which was to begin with his twentyfirst year and continue for his life unless he should marry before reaching the age of twentyfive  in the latter precocious and objectionable event his annuity would be forfeited  the accompanying letter said the solicitor would explain all  this the second letter was from his uncle to himself written about a month before the formers death and deposited with his will to be forwarded to his nephew when that event should have taken place  swithin read with the solemnity that such posthumous epistles inspire the following words from one who during life had never once addressed him     dear nephewyou will doubtless experience some astonishment at    receiving a communication from one whom you have never personally    known and who when this comes into your hands will be beyond the    reach of your knowledge  perhaps i am the loser by this lifelong    mutual ignorance  perhaps i am much to blame for it perhaps not  but    such reflections are profitless at this date i have written with    quite other views than to work up a sentimental regret on such an    amazingly remote hypothesis as that the fact of a particular pair of    people not meeting among the millions of other pairs of people who    have never met is a great calamity either to the world in general or    to themselves     the occasion of my addressing you is briefly this nine months ago a    report casually reached me that your scientific studies were pursued    by you with great ability and that you were a young man of some    promise as an astronomer  my own scientific proclivities rendered the    report more interesting than it might otherwise have been to me and    it came upon me quite as a surprise that any issue of your fathers    marriage should have so much in him or you might have seen more of me    in former years than you are ever likely to do now  my health had    then begun to fail and i was starting for the cape or i should have    come myself to inquire into your condition and prospects  i did not    return till six months later and as my health had not improved i sent    a trusty friend to examine into your life pursuits and    circumstances without your own knowledge and to report his    observations to me  this he did  through him i learnt of favourable    news     1 that you worked assiduously at the science of astronomy     2 that everything was auspicious in the career you had chosen     of unfavourable news     1 that the small income at your command even when eked out by the    sum to which you would be entitled on your grandmothers death and the    freehold of the homestead would be inadequate to support you    becomingly as a scientific man whose lines of work were of a nature    not calculated to produce emoluments for many years if ever     2 that there was something in your path worse than narrow means    and that that something was a woman     to save you if possible from ruin on these heads i take the    preventive measures detailed below     the chief step is as my solicitor will have informed you that at    the age of twentyfive the sum of 600 pounds a year be settled on you    for life provided you have not married before reaching that agea    yearly gift of an equal sum to be also provisionally made to you in    the interimand vice versa that if you do marry before reaching the    age of twentyfive you will receive nothing from the date of the    marriage     one object of my bequest is that you may have resources sufficient to    enable you to travel and study the southern constellations  when at    the cape after hearing of your pursuits i was much struck with the    importance of those constellations to an astronomer just pushing into    notice  there is more to be made of the southern hemisphere than ever    has been made of it yet the mine is not so thoroughly worked as the    northern and thither your studies should tend     the only other preventive step in my power is that of exhortation at    which i am not an adept  nevertheless i say to you swithin st    cleeve dont make a fool of yourself as your father did  if your    studies are to be worth anything believe me they must be carried on    without the help of a woman  avoid her and every one of the sex if    you mean to achieve any worthy thing  eschew all of that sort for    many a year yet  moreover i say the lady of your acquaintance avoid    in particular  i have heard nothing against her moral character    hitherto i have no doubt it has been excellent  she may have many    good qualities both of heart and of mind  but she has in addition    to her original disqualification as a companion for you that is that    of sex these two serious drawbacks she is much older than    yourself     much older said swithin resentfully     and she is so impoverished that the title she derives from her late    husband is a positive objection  beyond this frankly i dont think    well of her  i dont think well of any woman who dotes upon a man    younger than herself  to care to be the first fancy of a young fellow    like you shows no great common sense in her  if she were worth her    salt she would have too much pride to be intimate with a youth in your    unassured position to say no worse  she is old enough to know that a    liaison with her may and almost certainly would be your ruin and    on the other hand that a marriage would be preposterousunless she    is a complete goose and in that case there is even more reason for    avoiding her than if she were in her few senses     a woman of honourable feeling nephew would be careful to do nothing    to hinder you in your career as this putting of herself in your way    most certainly will  yet i hear that she professes a great anxiety on    this same future of yours as a physicist  the best way in which she    can show the reality of her anxiety is by leaving you to yourself    perhaps she persuades herself that she is doing you no harm  well    let her have the benefit of the possible belief but depend upon it    that in truth she gives the lie to her conscience by maintaining such    a transparent fallacy  womens brains are not formed for assisting at    any profound science they lack the power to see things except in the    concrete  shell blab your most secret plans and theories to every    one of her acquaintance     shes got none said swithin beginning to get warm     and make them appear ridiculous by announcing them before they are    matured  if you attempt to study with a woman youll be ruled by her    to entertain fancies instead of theories aircastles instead of    intentions qualms instead of opinions sickly prepossessions instead    of reasoned conclusions  your wide heaven of study young man will    soon reduce itself to the miserable narrow expanse of her face and    your myriad of stars to her two trumpery eyes     a woman waking a young mans passions just at a moment when he is    endeavouring to shine intellectually is doing little less than    committing a crime     like a certain philosopher i would upon my soul have all young men    from eighteen to twentyfive kept under barrels seeing how often in    the lack of some such sequestering process the woman sits down before    each as his destiny and too frequently enervates his purpose till he    abandons the most promising course ever conceived     but no more  i now leave your fate in your own hands  your well    wishing relative     jocelyn st cleeve    doctor in medicine  as coming from a bachelor and hardened misogynist of seventytwo the opinions herein contained were nothing remarkable but their practical result in restricting the sudden endowment of swithins researches by conditions which turned the favour into a harassment was at this unique moment discomfiting and distracting in the highest degree  sensational however as the letter was the passionate intention of the day was not hazarded for more than a few minutes thereby  the truth was the caution and bribe came too late too unexpectedly to be of influence  they were the sort of thing which required fermentation to render them effective  had st cleeve received the exhortation a month earlier had he been able to run over in his mind at every wakeful hour of thirty consecutive nights a private catechism on the possibilities opened up by this annuity there is no telling what might have been the stress of such a web of perplexity upon him a young man whose love for celestial physics was second to none  but to have held before him at the last moment the picture of a future advantage that he had never once thought of or discounted for present staying power it affected him about as much as the view of horizons shown by sheetlightning  he saw an immense prospect it went and the world was as before  he caught the train at warborne and moved rapidly towards bath not precisely in the same key as when he had dressed in the hut at dawn but as regarded the mechanical part of the journey as unhesitatingly as before  and with the change of scene even his gloom left him his bosoms lord sat lightly in his throne  st cleeve was not sufficiently in mind of poetical literature to remember that wise poets are accustomed to read that lightness of bosom inversely  swithin thought it an omen of good fortune and as thinking is causing in not a few such cases he was perhaps in spite of poets right    xix   at the station lady constantine appeared standing expectant he saw her face from the window of the carriage long before she saw him  he no sooner saw her than he was satisfied to his hearts content with his prize  if his greatuncle had offered him from the grave a kingdom instead of her he would not have accepted it  swithin jumped out and nature never painted in a womans face more devotion than appeared in my ladys at that moment  to both the situation seemed like a beautiful allegory not to be examined too closely lest its defects of correspondence with real life should be apparent  they almost feared to shake hands in public so much depended upon their passing that morning without molestation  a fly was called and they drove away  take this she said handing him a folded paper  it belongs to you rather than to me  at crossings and other occasional pauses pedestrians turned their faces and looked at the pair for no reason but that among so many there were naturally a few of the sort who have eyes to note what incidents come in their way as they plod on but the two in the vehicle could not but fear that these innocent beholders had special detective designs on them  you look so dreadfully young she said with humorous fretfulness as they drove along swithins cheeks being amazingly fresh from the morning air  do try to appear a little haggard that the parson maynt ask us awkward questions  nothing further happened and they were set down opposite a shop about fifty yards from the church door at five minutes to eleven  we will dismiss the fly she said  it will only attract idlers  on turning the corner and reaching the church they found the door ajar but the building contained only two persons a man and a womanthe clerk and his wife as they learnt  swithin asked when the clergyman would arrive  the clerk looked at his watch and said at just on eleven oclock  he ought to be here said swithin  yes replied the clerk as the hour struck  the fact is sir he is a deppity and apt to be rather wandering in his wits as regards time and such like which hev stood in the way of the mans getting a benefit  but no doubt hell come  the regular incumbent is away then  hes gone for his bare pasons fortnightthats all and we was forced to put up with a weaktalented man or none  the best men goes into the brewing or into the shipping nowadays you see sir doctrines being rather shaddery at present and your moneys worth not sure in our line  so we church officers be left poorly provided with men for odd jobs  ill tell ye what sir i think id better run round to the gentlemans lodgings and try to find him  pray do said lady constantine  the clerk left the church his wife busied herself with dusting at the further end and swithin and viviette were left to themselves  the imagination travels so rapidly and a womans forethought is so assumptive that the clerks departure had no sooner doomed them to inaction than it was borne in upon lady constantines mind that she would not become the wife of swithin st cleeve either today or on any other day  her divinations were continually misleading her she knew but a hitch at the moment of marriage surely had a meaning in it  ahthe marriage is not to be she said to herself  this is a fatality  it was twenty minutes past and no parson had arrived  swithin took her hand  if it cannot be today it can be tomorrow he whispered  i cannot say she answered  something tells me no  it was almost impossible that she could know anything of the deterrent force exercised on swithin by his dead uncle that morning  yet her manner tallied so curiously well with such knowledge that he was struck by it and remained silent  you have a black tie she continued looking at him  yes replied swithin  i bought it on my way here  why could it not have been less sombre in colour  my greatuncle is dead  you had a greatuncle  you never told me  i never saw him in my life  i have only heard about him since his death  he spoke in as quiet and measured a way as he could but his heart was sinking  she would go on questioning he could not tell her an untruth she would discover particulars of that greatuncles provision for him which he swithin was throwing away for her sake and she would refuse to be his for his own sake  his conclusion at this moment was precisely what hers had been five minutes sooner they were never to be husband and wife  but she did not continue her questions for the simplest of all reasons hasty footsteps were audible in the entrance and the parson was seen coming up the aisle the clerk behind him wiping the beads of perspiration from his face  the somewhat sorry clerical specimen shook hands with them and entered the vestry and the clerk came up and opened the book  the poor gentlemans memory is a bit topsyturvy whispered the latter he had got it in his mind that twere a funeral and i found him wandering about the cemetery alooking for us  however alls well as ends well  and the clerk wiped his forehead again  how illomened murmured viviette  but the parson came out robed at this moment and the clerk put on his ecclesiastical countenance and looked in his book  lady constantines momentary languor passed her blood resumed its courses with a new spring  the grave utterances of the church then rolled out upon the palpitating pair and no couple ever joined their whispers thereto with more fervency than they  lady constantine as she continued to be called by the outside world though she liked to think herself the mrs st cleeve that she legally was had told green that she might be expected at welland in a day or two or three as circumstances should dictate  though the time of return was thus left open it was deemed advisable by both swithin and herself that her journey back should not be deferred after the next day in case any suspicions might be aroused  as for st cleeve his comings and goings were of no consequence  it was seldom known whether he was at home or abroad by reason of his frequent seclusion at the column  late in the afternoon of the next day he accompanied her to the bath station intending himself to remain in that city till the following morning  but when a man or youth has such a tender article on his hands as a thirtyhour bride it is hardly in the power of his strongest reason to set her down at a railway and send her off like a superfluous portmanteau  hence the experiment of parting so soon after their union proved excruciatingly severe to these  the evening was dull the breeze of autumn crept fitfully through every slit and aperture in the town not a soul in the world seemed to notice or care about anything they did lady constantine sighed and there was no resisting ithe could not leave her thus  he decided to get into the train with her and keep her company for at least a few stations on her way  it drew on to be a dark night and seeing that there was no serious risk after all he prolonged his journey with her so far as to the junction at which the branch line to warborne forked off  here it was necessary to wait a few minutes before either he could go back or she could go on they wandered outside the station doorway into the gloom of the road and there agreed to part  while she yet stood holding his arm a phaeton sped towards the station entrance where in ascending the slope to the door the horse suddenly jibbed  the gentleman who was driving being either impatient or possessed with a theory that all jibbers may be started by severe whipping applied the lash as a result of it the horse thrust round the carriage to where they stood and the end of the drivers sweeping whip cut across lady constantines face with such severity as to cause her an involuntary cry  swithin turned her round to the lamplight and discerned a streak of blood on her cheek  by this time the gentleman who had done the mischief with many words of regret had given the reins to his man and dismounted  i will go to the waitingroom for a moment whispered viviette hurriedly and loosing her hand from his arm she pulled down her veil and vanished inside the building  the stranger came forward and raised his hat  he was a slightly built and apparently townbred man of twentyeight or thirty his manner of address was at once careless and conciliatory  i am greatly concerned at what i have done he said  i sincerely trust that your wifebut observing the youthfulness of swithin he withdrew the word suggested by the manner of swithin towards lady constantinei trust the young lady was not seriously cut  i trust not said swithin with some vexation  where did the lash touch her  straight down her cheek  do let me go to her and learn how she is and humbly apologize  ill inquire  he went to the ladies room in which viviette had taken refuge  she met him at the door her handkerchief to her cheek and swithin explained that the driver of the phaeton had sent to make inquiries  i cannot see him she whispered  he is my brother louis  he is no doubt going on by the train to my house  dont let him recognize me  we must wait till he is gone  swithin thereupon went out again and told the young man that the cut on her face was not serious but that she could not see him after which they parted  st cleeve then heard him ask for a ticket for warborne which confirmed lady constantines view that he was going on to her house  when the branch train had moved off swithin returned to his bride who waited in a trembling state within  on being informed that he had departed she showed herself much relieved  where does your brother come from said swithin  from london immediately  rio before that  he has a friend or two in this neighbourhood and visits here occasionally  i have seldom or never spoken to you of him because of his long absence  is he going to settle near you  no nor anywhere i fear  he is or rather was in the diplomatic service  he was first a clerk in the foreign office and was afterwards appointed attach√© at rio janeiro  but he has resigned the appointment  i wish he had not  swithin asked why he resigned  he complained of the banishment and the climate and everything that people complain of who are determined to be dissatisfiedthough poor fellow there is some ground for his complaints  perhaps some people would say that he is idle  but he is scarcely that he is rather restless than idle so that he never persists in anything  yet if a subject takes his fancy he will follow it up with exemplary patience till something diverts him  he is not kind to you is he dearest  why do you think that  your manner seems to say so  well he may not always be kind  but look at my face does the mark show  a streak straight as a meridian was visible down her cheek  the blood had been brought almost to the surface but was not quite through that which had originally appeared thereon having possibly come from the horse  it signified that tomorrow the red line would be a black one  swithin informed her that her brother had taken a ticket for warborne and she at once perceived that he was going on to visit her at welland though from his letter she had not expected him so soon by a few days meanwhile continued swithin you can now get home only by the late train having missed that one  but swithin dont you see my new trouble  if i go to welland house to night and find my brother just arrived there and he sees this cut on my face which i suppose you described to him  i did  he will know i was the lady with you  whom he called my wife  i wonder why we look husband and wife already  then what am i to do  for the ensuing three or four days i bear in my face a clue to his discovery of our secret  then you must not be seen  we must stay at an inn here  o no she said timidly  it is too near home to be quite safe  we might not be known but if we were  we cant go back to bath now  ill tell you dear viviette what we must do  well go on to warborne in separate carriages well meet outside the station thence well walk to the column in the dark and ill keep you a captive in the cabin till the scar has disappeared  as there was nothing which better recommended itself this course was decided on and after taking from her trunk the articles that might be required for an incarceration of two or three days they left the said trunk at the cloakroom and went on by the last train which reached warborne about ten oclock  it was only necessary for lady constantine to cover her face with the thick veil that she had provided for this escapade to walk out of the station without fear of recognition  st cleeve came forth from another compartment and they did not rejoin each other till they had reached a shadowy bend in the old turnpike road beyond the irradiation of the warborne lamplight  the walk to welland was long  it was the walk which swithin had taken in the rain when he had learnt the fatal forestalment of his stellar discovery but now he was moved by a less desperate mood and blamed neither god nor man  they were not pressed for time and passed along the silent lonely way with that sense rather of predestination than of choice in their proceedings which the presence of night sometimes imparts  reaching the park gate they found it open and from this they inferred that her brother louis had arrived  leaving the house and park on their right they traced the highway yet a little further and plunging through the stubble of the opposite field drew near the isolated earthwork bearing the plantation and tower which together rose like a flattened dome and lantern from the lighterhued plain of stubble  it was far too dark to distinguish firs from other trees by the eye alone but the peculiar dialect of sylvan language which the piny multitude used would have been enough to proclaim their class at any time  in the lovers stealthy progress up the slopes a dry stick here and there snapped beneath their feet seeming like a shot of alarm  on being unlocked the hut was found precisely as swithin had left it two days before  lady constantine was thoroughly wearied and sat down while he gathered a handful of twigs and spikelets from the masses strewn without and lit a small fire first taking the precaution to blind the little window and relock the door  lady constantine looked curiously around by the light of the blaze  the hut was small as the prophets chamber provided by the shunammite in one corner stood the stove with a little table and chair a small cupboard hard by a pitcher of water a rack overhead with various articles including a kettle and a gridiron while the remaining three or four feet at the other end of the room was fitted out as a dormitory for swithins use during late observations in the tower overhead  it is not much of a palace to offer you he remarked smiling  but at any rate it is a refuge  the cheerful firelight dispersed in some measure lady constantines anxieties  if we only had something to eat she said  dear me cried st cleeve blankly  thats a thing i never thought of  nor i till now she replied  he reflected with misgiving  beyond a small loaf of bread in the cupboard i have nothing  however just outside the door there are lots of those little rabbits about the size of rats that the keepers call runners  and they are as tame as possible  but i fear i could not catch one now  yet dear viviette wait a minute ill try  you must not be starved  he softly let himself out and was gone some time  when he reappeared he produced not a rabbit but four sparrows and a thrush  i could do nothing in the way of a rabbit without setting a wire he said  but i have managed to get these by knowing where they roost  he showed her how to prepare the birds and having set her to roast them by the fire departed with the pitcher to replenish it at the brook which flowed near the homestead in the neighbouring bottom  they are all asleep at my grandmothers he informed her when he re entered panting with the dripping pitcher  they imagine me to be a hundred miles off  the birds were now ready and the table was spread  with this fare eked out by dry toast from the loaf and moistened with cups of water from the pitcher to which swithin added a little wine from the flask he had carried on his journey they were forced to be content for their supper    xx   when lady constantine awoke the next morning swithin was nowhere to be seen  before she was quite ready for breakfast she heard the key turn in the door and felt startled till she remembered that the comer could hardly be anybody but he  he brought a basket with provisions an extra cupandsaucer and so on  in a short space of time the kettle began singing on the stove and the morning meal was ready  the sweet resinous air from the firs blew in upon them as they sat at breakfast the birds hopped round the door which somewhat riskily they ventured to keep open and at their elbow rose the lank column into an upper realm of sunlight which only reached the cabin in fitful darts and flashes through the trees  i could be happy here for ever said she clasping his hand  i wish i could never see my great gloomy house again since i am not rich enough to throw it open and live there as i ought to do  poverty of this sort is not unpleasant at any rate  what are you thinking of  i am thinking about my outing this morning  on reaching my grandmothers she was only a little surprised to see me  i was obliged to breakfast there or appear to do so to divert suspicion and this food is supposed to be wanted for my dinner and supper  there will of course be no difficulty in my obtaining an ample supply for any length of time as i can take what i like from the buttery without observation  but as i looked in my grandmothers face this morning and saw her looking affectionately in mine and thought how she had never concealed anything from me and had always had my welfare at heart i feltthat i should like to tell her what we have done  o noplease not swithin she exclaimed piteously  very well he answered  on no consideration will i do so without your consent  and no more was said on the matter  the morning was passed in applying wet rag and other remedies to the purple line on viviettes cheek and in the afternoon they set up the equatorial under the replaced dome to have it in order for night observations  the evening was clear dry and remarkably cold by comparison with the daytime weather  after a frugal supper they replenished the stove with charcoal from the homestead which they also burnt during the dayan idea of viviettes that the smoke from a wood fire might not be seen more frequently than was consistent with the occasional occupation of the cabin by swithin as heretofore  at eight oclock she insisted upon his ascending the tower for observations in strict pursuance of the idea on which their marriage had been based namely that of restoring regularity to his studies  the sky had a new and startling beauty that night  a broad fluctuating semicircular arch of vivid white light spanned the northern quarter of the heavens reaching from the horizon to the star eta in the greater bear  it was the aurora borealis just risen up for the winter season out of the freezing seas of the north where every autumn vapour was now undergoing rapid congelation  o let us sit and look at it she said and they turned their backs upon the equatorial and the southern glories of the heavens to this new beauty in a quarter which they seldom contemplated  the lustre of the fixed stars was diminished to a sort of blueness little by little the arch grew higher against the dark void like the form of the spiritmaiden in the shades of glenfinlas till its crown drew near the zenith and threw a tissue over the whole waggon and horses of the great northern constellation  brilliant shafts radiated from the convexity of the arch coming and going silently  the temperature fell and lady constantine drew her wrap more closely around her  well go down said swithin  the cabin is beautifully warm  why should we try to observe tonight  indeed we cannot the aurora light overpowers everything  very well  tomorrow night there will be no interruption  i shall be gone  you leave me tomorrow viviette  yes tomorrow morning  the truth was that with the progress of the hours and days the conviction had been borne in upon viviette more and more forcibly that not for kingdoms and principalities could she afford to risk the discovery of her presence here by any living soul  but let me see your face dearest he said  i dont think it will be safe for you to meet your brother yet  as it was too dark to see her face on the summit where they sat they descended the winding staircase and in the cabin swithin examined the damaged cheek  the line though so far attenuated as not to be observable by any one but a close observer had not quite disappeared but in consequence of her reiterated and almost tearful anxiety to go and as there was a strong probability that her brother had left the house swithin decided to call at welland next morning and reconnoitre with a view to her return  locking her in he crossed the dewy stubble into the park  the house was silent and deserted and only one tall stalk of smoke ascended from the chimneys  notwithstanding that the hour was nearly nine he knocked at the door  is lady constantine at home asked swithin with a disingenuousness now habitual yet unknown to him six months before  no mr st cleeve my lady has not returned from bath  we expect her every day  nobody staying in the house  my ladys brother has been here but he is gone on to budmouth  he will come again in two or three weeks i understand  this was enough  swithin said he would call again and returned to the cabin where waking viviette who was not by nature an early riser he waited on the column till she was ready to breakfast  when this had been shared they prepared to start  a long walk was before them  warborne station lay five miles distant and the next station above that nine miles  they were bound for the latter their plan being that she should there take the train to the junction where the whip accident had occurred claim her luggage and return with it to warborne as if from bath  the morning was cool and the walk not wearisome  when once they had left behind the stubblefield of their environment and the parish of welland they sauntered on comfortably lady constantines spirits rising as she withdrew further from danger  they parted by a little brook about half a mile from the station swithin to return to welland by the way he had come  lady constantine telegraphed from the junction to warborne for a carriage to be in readiness to meet her on her arrival and then waiting for the down train she travelled smoothly home reaching welland house about five minutes sooner than swithin reached the column hard by after footing it all the way from where they had parted    xxi   from that day forward their life resumed its old channel in general outward aspect  perhaps the most remarkable feature in their exploit was its comparative effectiveness as an expedient for the end designedthat of restoring calm assiduity to the study of astronomy  swithin took up his old position as the lonely philosopher at the column and lady constantine lapsed back to immured existence at the house with apparently not a friend in the parish  the enforced narrowness of life which her limited resources necessitated was now an additional safeguard against the discovery of her relations with st cleeve  her neighbours seldom troubled her as much it must be owned from a tacit understanding that she was not in a position to return invitations as from any selfish coldness engendered by her want of wealth  at the first meeting of the secretly united pair after their short honeymoon they were compelled to behave as strangers to each other  it occurred in the only part of welland which deserved the name of a village street and all the labourers were returning to their midday meal with those of their wives who assisted at outdoor work  before the eyes of this innocent though quite untrustworthy group swithin and his viviette could only shake hands in passing though she contrived to say to him in an undertone my brother does not return yet for some time  he has gone to paris  i will be on the lawn this evening if you can come  it was a fluttered smile that she bestowed on him and there was no doubt that every fibre of her heart vibrated afresh at meeting with such reserve one who stood in his close relation to her  the shades of night fell early now and swithin was at the spot of appointment about the time that he knew her dinner would be over  it was just where they had met at the beginning of the year but many changes had resulted since then  the flowerbeds that had used to be so neatly edged were now jagged and leafy black stars appeared on the pale surface of the gravel walks denoting tufts of grass that grew unmolested there lady constantines external affairs wore just that aspect which suggests that new blood may be advantageously introduced into the line and new blood had been introduced in good soothwith what social result remained to be seen  she silently entered on the scene from the same window which had given her passage in months gone by  they met with a concerted embrace and st cleeve spoke his greeting in whispers  we are quite safe dearest said she  but the servants  my meagre staff consists of only two women and the boy and they are away in the other wing  i thought you would like to see the inside of my house after showing me the inside of yours  so we will walk through it instead of staying out here  she let him in through the casement and they strolled forward softly swithin with some curiosity never before having gone beyond the library and adjoining room  the whole western side of the house was at this time shut up her life being confined to two or three small rooms in the south east corner  the great apartments through which they now whisperingly walked wore already that funereal aspect that comes from disuse and inattention  triangular cobwebs already formed little hammocks for the dust in corners of the wainscot and a close smell of wood and leather seasoned with mousedroppings pervaded the atmosphere  so seldom was the solitude of these chambers intruded on by human feet that more than once a mouse stood and looked the twain in the face from the arm of a sofa or the top of a cabinet without any great fear  swithin had no residential ambition whatever but he was interested in the place  will the house ever be thrown open to gaiety as it was in old times said he  not unless you make a fortune she replied laughingly  it is mine for my life as you know but the estate is so terribly saddled with annuities to sir blounts distant relatives one of whom will succeed me here that i have practically no more than my own little private income to exist on  and are you bound to occupy the house  not bound to  but i must not let it on lease  and was there any stipulation in the event of your remarriage  it was not mentioned  it is satisfactory to find that you lose nothing by marrying me at all events dear viviette  i hope you lose nothing eitherat least of consequence  what have i to lose  i meant your liberty  suppose you become a popular physicist popularity seems cooling towards art and coquetting with science nowa days and a better chance offers and one who would make you a newer and brighter wife than i am comes in your way  will you never regret this will you never despise me  swithin answered by a kiss and they again went on proceeding like a couple of burglars lest they should draw the attention of the cook or green  in one of the upper rooms his eyes were attracted by an old chamber organ which had once been lent for use in the church  he mentioned his recollection of the same which led her to say that reminds me of something  there is to be a confirmation in our parish in the spring and you once told me that you had never been confirmed  what shocking neglect  why was it  i hardly know  the confusion resulting from my fathers death caused it to be forgotten i suppose  now dear swithin you will do this to please mebe confirmed on the present occasion  since i have done without the virtue of it so long might i not do without it altogether  no no she said earnestly  i do wish it indeed  i am made unhappy when i think you dont care about such serious matters  without the church to cling to what have we  each other  but seriously i should be inverting the established order of spiritual things people ought to be confirmed before they are married  thats really of minor consequence  now dont think slightingly of what so many good men have laid down as necessary to be done  and dear swithin i somehow feel that a certain levity which has perhaps shown itself in our treatment of the sacrament of marriageby making a clandestine adventure of what is after all a solemn ritewould be well atoned for by a due seriousness in other points of religious observance this opportunity should therefore not be passed over  i thought of it all last night and you are a parsons son remember and he would have insisted on it if he had been alive  in short swithin do be a good boy and observe the churchs ordinances  lady constantine by virtue of her temperament was necessarily either lover or d√©vote and she vibrated so gracefully between these two conditions that nobody who had known the circumstances could have condemned her inconsistencies  to be led into difficulties by those mastering emotions of hers to aim at escape by turning round and seizing the apparatus of religionwhich could only rightly be worked by the very emotions already bestowed elsewhereit was after all but natures well meaning attempt to preserve the honour of her daughters conscience in the trying quandary to which the conditions of sex had given rise  as viviette could not be confirmed herself and as communion sunday was a long way off she urged swithin thus  and the new bishop is such a good man she continued  i used to have a slight acquaintance with him when he was a parish priest  very well dearest  to please you ill be confirmed  my grandmother too will be delighted no doubt  they continued their ramble lady constantine first advancing into rooms with the candle to assure herself that all was empty and then calling him forward in a whisper  the stillness was broken only by these whispers or by the occasional crack of a floorboard beneath their tread  at last they sat down and shading the candle with a screen she showed him the faded contents of this and that drawer or cabinet or the wardrobe of some member of the family who had died young early in the century when muslin reigned supreme when waists were close to armpits and muffs as large as smugglers tubs  these researches among habilimental hulls and husks whose human kernels had long ago perished went on for about half an hour when the companions were startled by a loud ringing at the frontdoor bell    xxii   lady constantine flung down the oldfashioned lacework whose beauties she had been pointing out to swithin and exclaimed who can it be  not louis surely  they listened  an arrival was such a phenomenon at this unfrequented mansion and particularly a late arrival that no servant was on the alert to respond to the call and the visitor rang again more loudly than before  sounds of the tardy opening and shutting of a passagedoor from the kitchen quarter then reached their ears and viviette went into the corridor to hearken more attentively  in a few minutes she returned to the wardroberoom in which she had left swithin  yes it is my brother she said with difficult composure  i just caught his voice  he has no doubt come back from paris to stay  this is a rather vexatious indolent way he has never to write to prepare me  i can easily go away said swithin  by this time however her brother had been shown into the house and the footsteps of the page were audible coming in search of lady constantine  if you will wait there a moment she said directing st cleeve into a bedchamber which adjoined you will be quite safe from interruption and i will quickly come back  taking the light she left him  swithin waited in darkness  not more than ten minutes had passed when a whisper in her voice came through the keyhole  he opened the door  yes he is come to stay she said  he is at supper now  very well dont be flurried dearest  shall i stay too as we planned  o swithin i fear not she replied anxiously  you see how it is  to night we have broken the arrangement that you should never come here and this is the result  will it offend you ifi ask you to leave  not in the least  upon the whole i prefer the comfort of my little cabin and homestead to the gauntness and alarms of this place  there now i fear you are offended she said a tear collecting in her eye  i wish i was going back with you to the cabin  how happy we were those three days of our stay there  but it is better perhaps just now that you should leave me  yes these rooms are oppressive  they require a large household to make them cheerful     yet swithin she added after reflection i will not request you to go  do as you think best  i will light a nightlight and leave you here to consider  for myself i must go downstairs to my brother at once or hell wonder what i am doing  she kindled the little light and again retreated closing the door upon him  swithin stood and waited some time till he considered that upon the whole it would be preferable to leave  with this intention he emerged and went softly along the dark passage towards the extreme end where there was a little crooked staircase that would conduct him down to a disused side door  descending this stair he duly arrived at the other side of the house facing the quarter whence the wind blew and here he was surprised to catch the noise of rain beating against the windows  it was a state of weather which fully accounted for the visitors impatient ringing  st cleeve was in a minor kind of dilemma  the rain reminded him that his hat and greatcoat had been left downstairs in the front part of the house and though he might have gone home without either in ordinary weather it was not a pleasant feat in the pelting winter rain  retracing his steps to viviettes room he took the light and opened a closetdoor that he had seen ajar on his way down  within the closet hung various articles of apparel upholstery lumber of all kinds filling the back part  swithin thought he might find here a cloak of hers to throw round him but finally took down from a peg a more suitable garment the only one of the sort that was there  it was an old motheaten greatcoat heavily trimmed with fur and in removing it a companion cap of sealskin was disclosed  whose can they be he thought and a gloomy answer suggested itself pooh he then said summoning the scientific side of his nature matter is matter and mental association only a delusion  putting on the garments he returned the light to lady constantines bedroom and again prepared to depart as before  scarcely however had he regained the corridor a second time when he heard a light footstepseemingly viviettesagain on the front landing wondering what she wanted with him further he waited taking the precaution to step into the closet till sure it was she  the figure came onward bent to the keyhole of the bedroom door and whispered supposing him still inside swithin on second thoughts i think you may stay with safety  having no further doubt of her personality he came out with thoughtless abruptness from the closet behind her and looking round suddenly she beheld his shadowy furclad outline  at once she raised her hands in horror as if to protect herself from him she uttered a shriek and turned shudderingly to the wall covering her face  swithin would have picked her up in a moment but by this time he could hear footsteps rushing upstairs in response to her cry  in consternation and with a view of not compromising her he effected his retreat as fast as possible reaching the bend of the corridor just as her brother louis appeared with a light at the other extremity  whats the matter for heavens sake viviette said louis  my husband she involuntarily exclaimed  what nonsense  o yes it is nonsense she added with an effort  it was nothing  but what was the cause of your cry  she had by this time recovered her reason and judgment  o it was a trick of the imagination she said with a faint laugh  i live so much alone that i get superstitiousandi thought for the moment i saw an apparition  of your late husband  yes  but it was nothing it was the outline of thetall clock and the chair behind  would you mind going down and leaving me to go into my room for a moment  she entered the bedroom and her brother went downstairs  swithin thought it best to leave well alone and going noiselessly out of the house plodded through the rain homeward  it was plain that agitations of one sort and another had so weakened viviettes nerves as to lay her open to every impression  that the clothes he had borrowed were some castoff garments of the late sir blount had occurred to st cleeve in taking them but in the moment of returning to her side he had forgotten this and the shape they gave to his figure had obviously been a reminder of too sudden a sort for her  musing thus he walked along as if he were still as before the lonely student dissociated from all mankind and with no shadow of right or interest in welland house or its mistress  the greatcoat and cap were unpleasant companions but swithin having been reared or having reared himself in the scientific school of thought would not give way to his sense of their weirdness  to do so would have been treason to his own beliefs and aims  when nearly home at a point where his track converged on another path there approached him from the latter a group of indistinct forms  the tones of their speech revealed them to be hezzy biles nat chapman fry and other labourers  swithin was about to say a word to them till recollecting his disguise he deemed it advisable to hold his tongue lest his attire should tell a too dangerous tale as to where he had come from by degrees they drew closer their walk being in the same direction  goodnight strainger said nat  the stranger did not reply  all of them paced on abreast of him and he could perceive in the gloom that their faces were turned inquiringly upon his form  then a whisper passed from one to another of them then chapman who was the boldest dropped immediately behind his heels and followed there for some distance taking close observations of his outline after which the men grouped again and whispered  thinking it best to let them pass on swithin slackened his pace and they went ahead of him apparently without much reluctance  there was no doubt that they had been impressed by the clothes he wore and having no wish to provoke similar comments from his grandmother and hannah swithin took the precaution on arriving at welland bottom to enter the homestead by the outhouse  here he deposited the cap and coat in secure hiding afterwards going round to the front and opening the door in the usual way  in the entry he met hannah who said  only to hear what have been seed tonight mr swithin  the workfolk have dropped in to tell us  in the kitchen were the men who had outstripped him on the road  their countenances instead of wearing the usual knotty irregularities had a smoothedout expression of blank concern  swithins entrance was unobtrusive and quiet as if he had merely come down from his study upstairs and they only noticed him by enlarging their gaze so as to include him in the audience  we was in a deep talk at the moment continued blore and natty had just brought up that story about old jeremiah paddocks crossing the park one night at one oclock in the morning and seeing sir blount ashutting my lady outodoors and we was saying that it seemed a true return that he should perish in a foreign land when we happened to look up and there was sir blount awalking along  did it overtake you or did you overtake it whispered hannah sepulchrally  i dont say twas it returned sammy  god forbid that i should drag in a resurrection word about what perhaps was still solid manhood and has to die  but he or it closed in upon us as twere  yes closed in upon us said haymoss  and i said goodnight strainger added chapman  yes goodnight straingerthat wez yer words natty  i support ye in it  and then he closed in upon us still more  we closed in upon he rather said chapman  well well tis the same thing in such matters  and the form was sir blounts  my nostrils told me forthere a smelled  yes i could smelln being to leeward  lord lord what unwholesome scandals this about the ghost of a respectable gentleman said mrs martin who had entered from the sittingroom  now wait maam  i dont say twere a low smell mind ye  twere a high smell a sort of gamey flaviour calling to mind venison and hare just as youd expect of a great squirenot like a poor mans natomy at all and that was what strengthened my faith that twas sir blount  the skins that old coat was made of ruminated swithin  well well ive not held out against the figure o starvation these fiveandtwenty year on nine shillings a week to be afeard of a walking vapour sweet or savoury said hezzy  so heres homealong  bide a bit longer and im going too continued fry  well when i found twas sir blount my spet dried up within my mouth for neither hedge nor bush were there for refuge against any foul spring a might have made at us  twas very curious but we had likewise amentioned his name just afore in talking of the confirmation thats shortly coming on said hezzy  is there soon to be a confirmation  yes  in this parishthe first time in welland church for twenty years as i say i had told em that he was confirmed the same year that i went up to have it done as i have very good cause to mind  when we went to be examined the pason said to me rehearse the articles of thy belief  mr blount as he was then was nighest me and he whispered women and wine  women and wine says i to the pason and for that i was sent back till next confirmation sir blount never owning that he was the rascal  confirmation was a sight different at that time mused biles  the bishops didnt lay it on so strong then as they do now  nowadays yer bishop gies both hands to every jackrag and tomstraw that drops the knee afore him but twas six chaps to one blessing when we was boys  the bishop o that time would stretch out his palms and run his fingers over our row of crowns as offhand as a bank gentleman telling money  the great lords of the church in them days wasnt particular to a soul or two more or less and for my part i think living was easier for t  the new bishop i hear is a bachelorman or a widow gentleman is it asked mrs martin  bachelor i believe maam  mr san cleeve making so bold youve never faced him yet i think  mrs martin shook her head  no it was a piece of neglect  i hardly know how it happened she said  i am going to this time said swithin and turned the chat to other matters    xxiii   swithin could not sleep that night for thinking of his viviette  nothing told so significantly of the conduct of her first husband towards the poor lady as the abiding dread of him which was revealed in her by any sudden revival of his image or memory  but for that consideration her almost childlike terror at swithins inadvertent disguise would have been ludicrous  he waited anxiously through several following days for an opportunity of seeing her but none was afforded  her brothers presence in the house sufficiently accounted for this  at length he ventured to write a note requesting her to signal to him in a way she had done once or twice beforeby pulling down a blind in a particular window of the house one of the few visible from the top of the ringshill column this to be done on any evening when she could see him after dinner on the terrace  when he had levelled the glass at that window for five successive nights he beheld the blind in the position suggested  three hours later quite in the dusk he repaired to the place of appointment  my brother is away this evening she explained and thats why i can come out  he is only gone for a few hours nor is he likely to go for longer just yet  he keeps himself a good deal in my company which has made it unsafe for me to venture near you  has he any suspicion  none apparently  but he rather depresses me  how viviette  swithin feared from her manner that this was something serious  i would rather not tell  butwell never mind  yes swithin i will tell you  there should be no secrets between us he urges upon me the necessity of marrying day after day  for money and position of course  yes  but i take no notice  i let him go on  really this is sad said the young man  i must work harder than ever or you will never be able to own me  o yes in good time she cheeringly replied  i shall be very glad to have you always near me  i felt the gloom of our position keenly when i was obliged to disappear that night without assuring you it was only i who stood there  why were you so frightened at those old clothes i borrowed  dont askdont ask she said burying her face on his shoulder  i dont want to speak of that  there was something so ghastly and so uncanny in your putting on such garments that i wish you had been more thoughtful and had left them alone  he assured her that he did not stop to consider whose they were  by the way they must be sent back he said  no i never wish to see them again  i cannot help feeling that your putting them on was ominous  nothing is ominous in serene philosophy he said kissing her  things are either causes or they are not causes  when can you see me again  in such wise the hour passed away  the evening was typical of others which followed it at irregular intervals through the winter  and during the intenser months of the season frequent falls of snow lengthened even more than other difficulties had done the periods of isolation between the pair  swithin adhered with all the more strictness to the letter of his promise not to intrude into the house from his sense of her powerlessness to compel him to keep out should he choose to rebel  a student of the greatest forces in nature he had like many others of his sort no personal force to speak of in a social point of view mainly because he took no interest in human ranks and formulas and hence he was as docile as a child in her hands wherever matters of that kind were concerned  her brother wintered at welland but whether because his experience of tropic climes had unfitted him for the brumal rigours of britain or for some other reason he seldom showed himself out of doors and swithin caught but passing glimpses of him  now and then viviettes impulsive affection would overcome her sense of risk and she would press swithin to call on her at all costs  this he would by no means do  it was obvious to his more logical mind that the secrecy to which they had bound themselves must be kept in its fulness or might as well be abandoned altogether  he was now sadly exercised on the subject of his uncles will  there had as yet been no pressing reasons for a full and candid reply to the solicitor who had communicated with him owing to the fact that the payments were not to begin till swithin was oneandtwenty but time was going on and something definite would have to be done soon  to own to his marriage and consequent disqualification for the bequest was easy in itself but it involved telling at least one man what both viviette and himself had great reluctance in telling anybody  moreover he wished viviette to know nothing of his loss in making her his wife  all he could think of doing for the present was to write a postponing letter to his uncles lawyer and wait events  the one comfort of this dreary wintertime was his perception of a returning ability to work with the regularity and much of the spirit of earlier days        one bright night in april there was an eclipse of the moon and mr torkingham by arrangement brought to the observatory several labouring men and boys to whom he had promised a sight of the phenomenon through the telescope  the coming confirmation fixed for may was again talked of and st cleeve learnt from the parson that the bishop had arranged to stay the night at the vicarage and was to be invited to a grand luncheon at welland house immediately after the ordinance  this seemed like a going back into life again as regarded the mistress of that house and st cleeve was a little surprised that in his communications with viviette she had mentioned no such probability  the next day he walked round the mansion wondering how in its present state any entertainment could be given therein  he found that the shutters had been opened which had restored an unexpected liveliness to the aspect of the windows  two men were putting a chimneypot on one of the chimneystacks and two more were scraping green mould from the front wall  he made no inquiries on that occasion three days later he strolled thitherward again  now a great cleaning of windowpanes was going on hezzy biles and sammy blore being the operators for which purpose their services must have been borrowed from the neighbouring farmer  hezzy dashed water at the glass with a force that threatened to break it in the broad face of sammy being discernible inside smiling at the onset  in addition to these anthony green and another were weeding the gravel walks and putting fresh plants into the flowerbeds  neither of these reasonable operations was a great undertaking singly looked at but the life viviette had latterly led and the mood in which she had hitherto regarded the premises rendered it somewhat significant  swithin however was rather curious than concerned at the proceedings and returned to his tower with feelings of interest not entirely confined to the worlds overhead  lady constantine may or may not have seen him from the house but the same evening which was fine and dry while he was occupying himself in the observatory with cleaning the eyepieces of the equatorial skullcap on head observingjacket on and in other ways primed for sweeping the customary stealthy step on the winding staircase brought her form in due course into the rays of the bullseye lantern  the meeting was all the more pleasant to him from being unexpected and he at once lit up a larger lamp in honour of the occasion  it is but a hasty visit she said when after putting up her mouth to be kissed she had seated herself in the low chair used for observations panting a little with the labour of ascent  but i hope to be able to come more freely soon  my brother is still living on with me  yes he is going to stay until the confirmation is over  after the confirmation he will certainly leave  so good it is of you dear to please me by agreeing to the ceremony  the bishop you know is going to lunch with us  it is a wonder he has promised to come for he is a man averse to society and mostly keeps entirely with the clergy on these confirmation tours or circuits or whatever they call them  but mr torkinghams house is so very small and mine is so close at hand that this arrangement to relieve him of the fuss of one meal at least naturally suggested itself and the bishop has fallen in with it very readily  how are you getting on with your observations  have you not wanted me dreadfully to write down notes  well i have been obliged to do without you whether or no  see herehow much i have done  and he showed her a book ruled in columns headed object right ascension declination features remarks and so on  she looked over this and other things but her mind speedily winged its way back to the confirmation  it is so new to me she said to have persons coming to the house that i feel rather anxious  i hope the luncheon will be a success  you know the bishop said swithin  i have not seen him for many years  i knew him when i was quite a girl and he held the little living of puddlesubmixen near us but after that time and ever since i have lived here i have seen nothing of him there has been no confirmation in this village they say for twenty years  the other bishop used to make the young men and women go to warborne he wouldnt take the trouble to come to such an outoftheway parish as ours  this cleaning and preparation that i observe going on must be rather a tax upon you  my brother louis sees to it and what is more bears the expense  your brother said swithin with surprise  well he insisted on doing so she replied in a hesitating despondent tone  he has been active in the whole matter and was the first to suggest the invitation  i should not have thought of it  well i will hold aloof till it is all over  thanks dearest for your considerateness  i wish it was not still advisable  but i shall see you on the day and watch my own philosopher all through the service from the corner of my pew     i hope you are well prepared for the rite swithin she added turning tenderly to him it would perhaps be advisable for you to give up this astronomy till the confirmation is over in order to devote your attention exclusively to that more serious matter  more serious  well i will do the best i can  i am sorry to see that you are less interested in astronomy than you used to be viviette  no it is only that these preparations for the bishop unsettle my mind from study  now put on your other coat and hat and come with me a little way    xxiv   the morning of the confirmation was come  it was midmay time bringing with it weather not perhaps quite so blooming as that assumed to be natural to the month by the joyous poets of three hundred years ago but a very tolerable wellwearing may that the average rustic would willingly have compounded for in lieu of mays occasionally fairer but usually more foul  among the larger shrubs and flowers which composed the outworks of the welland gardens the lilac the laburnum and the guelderrose hung out their respective colours of purple yellow and white whilst within these belted round from every disturbing gale rose the columbine the peony the larkspur and the solomons seal  the animate things that moved amid this scene of colour were plodding bees gadding butterflies and numerous sauntering young feminine candidates for the impending confirmation who having gaily bedecked themselves for the ceremony were enjoying their own appearance by walking about in twos and threes till it was time to start  swithin st cleeve whose preparations were somewhat simpler than those of the village belles waited till his grandmother and hannah had set out and then locking the door followed towards the distant church  on reaching the churchyard gate he met mr torkingham who shook hands with him in the manner of a man with several irons in the fire and telling swithin where to sit disappeared to hunt up some candidates who had not yet made themselves visible  casting his eyes round for viviette and seeing nothing of her swithin went on to the church porch and looked in  from the north side of the nave smiled a host of girls gaily uniform in dress age and a temporary repression of their natural tendency to skip like a hare over the meshes of good counsel  their white muslin dresses their round white caps from beneath whose borders hairknots and curls of various shades of brown escaped upon their low shoulders as if against their will lighted up the dark pews and grey stonework to an unwonted warmth and life  on the south side were the young men and boysheavy angular and massive as indeed was rather necessary considering what they would have to bear at the hands of wind and weather before they returned to that mouldy nave for the last time  over the heads of all these he could see into the chancel to the square pew on the north side which was attached to welland house  there he discerned lady constantine already arrived her brother louis sitting by her side  swithin entered and seated himself at the end of a bench and she who had been on the watch at once showed by subtle signs her consciousness of the presence of the young man who had reversed the ordained sequence of the church services on her account  she appeared in black attire though not strictly in mourning a touch of red in her bonnet setting off the richness of her complexion without making her gay  handsomest woman in the church she decidedly was and yet a disinterested spectator who had known all the circumstances would probably have felt that the future considered swithins more natural mate would have been one of the muslin clad maidens who were to be presented to the bishop with him that day  when the bishop had arrived and gone into the chancel and blown his nose the congregation were sufficiently impressed by his presence to leave off looking at one another  the right reverend cuthbert helmsdale dd ninetyfourth occupant of the episcopal throne of the diocese revealed himself to be a personage of dark complexion whose darkness was thrown still further into prominence by the lawn protuberances that now rose upon his two shoulders like the eastern and western hemispheres  in stature he seemed to be tall and imposing but something of this aspect may have been derived from his robes  the service was as usual of a length which severely tried the tarrying powers of the young people assembled and it was not till the youth of all the other parishes had gone up that the turn came for the welland bevy  swithin and some older ones were nearly the last  when at the heels of mr torkingham he passed lady constantines pew he lifted his eyes from the red lining of that gentlemans hood sufficiently high to catch hers  she was abstracted tearful regarding him with all the rapt mingling of religion love fervour and hope which such women can feel at such times and which men know nothing of  how fervidly she watched the bishop place his hand on her beloved youths head how she saw the great episcopal ring glistening in the sun among swithins brown curls how she waited to hear if dr helmsdale uttered the form this thy child which he used for the younger ones or this thy servant which he used for those older and how when he said this thy child she felt a prick of conscience like a person who had entrapped an innocent youth into marriage for her own gratification till she remembered that she had raised his social position therebyall this could only have been told in its entirety by herself  as for swithin he felt ashamed of his own utter lack of the high enthusiasm which beamed so eloquently from her eyes  when he passed her again on the return journey from the bishop to his seat her face was warm with a blush which her brother might have observed had he regarded her  whether he had observed it or not as soon as st cleeve had sat himself down again louis glanville turned and looked hard at the young astronomer  this was the first time that st cleeve and viviettes brother had been face to face in a distinct light their first meeting having occurred in the dusk of a railwaystation  swithin was not in the habit of noticing peoples features he scarcely ever observed any detail of physiognomy in his friends a generalization from their whole aspect forming his idea of them and he now only noted a young man of perhaps thirty who lolled a good deal and in whose small dark eyes seemed to be concentrated the activity that the rest of his frame decidedly lacked this gentlemans eyes were henceforward to the end of the service continually fixed upon swithin but as this was their natural direction from the position of his seat there was no great strangeness in the circumstance  swithin wanted to say to viviette now i hope you are pleased i have conformed to your ideas of my duty leaving my fitness out of consideration but as he could only see her bonnet and forehead it was not possible even to look the intelligence  he turned to his left hand where the organ stood with miss tabitha lark seated behind it  it being now sermontime the youthful blower had fallen asleep over the handle of his bellows and tabitha pulled out her handkerchief intending to flap him awake with it  with the handkerchief tumbled out a whole family of unexpected articles a silver thimble a photograph a little purse a scentbottle some loose halfpence nine green gooseberries a key  they rolled to swithins feet and passively obeying his first instinct he picked up as many of the articles as he could find and handed them to her amid the smiles of the neighbours  tabitha was halfdead with humiliation at such an event happening under the very eyes of the bishop on this glorious occasion she turned pale as a sheet and could hardly keep her seat  fearing she might faint swithin who had genuinely sympathized bent over and whispered encouragingly dont mind it tabitha  shall i take you out into the air  she declined his offer and presently the sermon came to an end  swithin lingered behind the rest of the congregation sufficiently long to see lady constantine accompanied by her brother the bishop the bishops chaplain mr torkingham and several other clergy and ladies enter to the grand luncheon by the door which admitted from the churchyard to the lawn of welland house the whole group talking with a vivacity all the more intense as it seemed from the recent two hours enforced repression of their social qualities within the adjoining building  the young man stood till he was left quite alone in the churchyard and then went slowly homeward over the hill perhaps a trifle depressed at the impossibility of being near viviette in this her one day of gaiety and joining in the conversation of those who surrounded her  not that he felt much jealousy of her situation as his wife in comparison with his own  he had so clearly understood from the beginning that in the event of marriage their outward lives were to run on as before that to rebel now would have been unmanly in himself and cruel to her by adding to embarrassments that were great enough already  his momentary doubt was of his own strength to achieve sufficiently high things to render him in relation to her other than a patronized young favourite whom she had married at an immense sacrifice of position  now at twenty he was doomed to isolation even from a wife could it be that at say thirty he would be welcomed everywhere  but with motion through the sun and air his mood assumed a lighter complexion and on reaching home he remembered with interest that venus was in a favourable aspect for observation that afternoon    xxv   meanwhile the interior of welland house was rattling with the progress of the ecclesiastical luncheon  the bishop who sat at lady constantines side seemed enchanted with her company and from the beginning she engrossed his attention almost entirely  the truth was that the circumstance of her not having her whole soul centred on the success of the repast and the pleasure of bishop helmsdale imparted to her in a great measure the mood to ensure both  her brother louis it was who had laid out the plan of entertaining the bishop to which she had assented but indifferently  she was secretly bound to another on whose career she had staked all her happiness  having thus other interests she evinced today the ease of one who hazards nothing and there was no sign of that preoccupation with housewifely contingencies which so often makes the hostess hardly recognizable as the charming woman who graced a friends home the day before  in marrying swithin lady constantine had played her cardrecklessly impulsively ruinously perhaps but she had played it it could not be withdrawn and she took this mornings luncheon as an episode that could result in nothing to her beyond the days entertainment  hence by that power of indirectness to accomplish in an hour what strenuous aiming will not effect in a lifetime she fascinated the bishop to an unprecedented degree  a bachelor he rejoiced in the commanding period of life that stretches between the time of waning impulse and the time of incipient dotage when a woman can reach the male heart neither by awakening a young mans passion nor an old mans infatuation  he must be made to admire or he can be made to do nothing unintentionally that is how viviette operated on her guest  lady constantine to external view was in a position to desire many things and of a sort to desire them  she was obviously by nature impulsive to indiscretion  but instead of exhibiting activities to correspond recently gratified affection lent to her manner just now a sweet serenity a truly christian contentment which it puzzled the learned bishop exceedingly to find in a warm young widow and increased his interest in her every moment  thus matters stood when the conversation veered round to the mornings confirmation  that was a singularly engaging young man who came up among mr torkinghams candidates said the bishop to her somewhat abruptly  but abruptness does not catch a woman without her wit  which one she said innocently  that youth with the corncoloured hair as a poet of the new school would call it who sat just at the side of the organ  do you know who he is  in answering viviette showed a little nervousness for the first time that day  o yes  he is the son of an unfortunate gentleman who was formerly curate herea mr st cleeve  i never saw a handsomer young man in my life said the bishop  lady constantine blushed  there was a lack of selfconsciousness too in his manner of presenting himself which very much won me  a mr st cleeve do you say  a curates son  his father must have been st cleeve of all angels whom i knew  how comes he to be staying on here what is he doing  mr torkingham who kept one ear on the bishop all the lunchtime finding that lady constantine was not ready with an answer hastened to reply your lordship is right  his father was an all angels man  the youth is rather to be pitied  he was a man of talent affirmed the bishop  but i quite lost sight of him  he was curate to the late vicar resumed the parson and was much liked by the parish but being erratic in his tastes and tendencies he rashly contracted a marriage with the daughter of a farmer and then quarrelled with the local gentry for not taking up his wife  this lad was an only child  there was enough money to educate him and he is sufficiently well provided for to be independent of the world so long as he is content to live here with great economy  but of course this gives him few opportunities of bettering himself  yes naturally replied the bishop of melchester  better have been left entirely dependent on himself  these halfincomes do men little good unless they happen to be either weaklings or geniuses  lady constantine would have given the world to say he is a genius and the hope of my life but it would have been decidedly risky and in another moment was unnecessary for mr torkingham said there is a certain genius in this young man i sometimes think  well he really looks quite out of the common said the bishop  youthful genius is sometimes disappointing observed viviette not believing it in the least  yes said the bishop  though it depends lady constantine on what you understand by disappointing  it may produce nothing visible to the worlds eye and yet may complete its development within to a very perfect degree  objective achievements though the only ones which are counted are not the only ones that exist and have value and i for one should be sorry to assert that because a man of genius dies as unknown to the world as when he was born he therefore was an instance of wasted material  objective achievements were however those that lady constantine had a weakness for in the present case and she asked her more experienced guest if he thought early development of a special talent a good sign in youth  the bishop thought it well that a particular bent should not show itself too early lest disgust should result  still argued lady constantine rather firmly for she felt this opinion of the bishops to be one throwing doubt on swithin sustained fruition is compatible with early bias  tycho brahe showed quite a passion for the solar system when he was but a youth and so did kepler and james ferguson had a surprising knowledge of the stars by the time he was eleven or twelve  yes sustained fruition conceded the bishop rather liking the words is certainly compatible with early bias  fenelon preached at fourteen  hemr st cleeveis not in the church said lady constantine  he is a scientific young man my lord explained mr torkingham  an astronomer she added with suppressed pride  an astronomer  really that makes him still more interesting than being handsome and the son of a man i knew  how and where does he study astronomy  he has a beautiful observatory  he has made use of an old column that was erected on this manor to the memory of one of the constantines  it has been very ingeniously adapted for his purpose and he does very good work there  i believe he occasionally sends up a paper to the royal society or greenwich or somewhere and to astronomical periodicals  i should have had no idea from his boyish look that he had advanced so far the bishop answered  and yet i saw on his face that within there was a book worth studying  his is a career i should very much like to watch  a thrill of pleasure chased through lady constantines heart at this praise of her chosen one  it was an unwitting compliment to her taste and discernment in singling him out for her own despite its temporary inexpediency  her brother louis now spoke  i fancy he is as interested in one of his fellowcreatures as in the science of astronomy observed the cynic dryly  in whom said lady constantine quickly  in the fair maiden who sat at the organa pretty girl rather  i noticed a sort of byplay going on between them occasionally during the sermon which meant mating if i am not mistaken  she said lady constantine  she is only a village girl a dairymans daughtertabitha lark who used to come to read to me  she may be a savage for all that i know but there is something between those two young people nevertheless  the bishop looked as if he had allowed his interest in a stranger to carry him too far and mr torkingham was horrified at the irreverent and easy familiarity of louis glanvilles talk in the presence of a consecrated bishop  as for viviette her tongue lost all its volubility she felt quite faint at heart and hardly knew how to control herself  i have never noticed anything of the sort said mr torkingham  it would be a matter for regret said the bishop if he should follow his father in forming an attachment that would be a hindrance to him in any honourable career though perhaps an early marriage intrinsically considered would not be bad for him  a youth who looks as if he had come straight from old greece may be exposed to many temptations should he go out into the world without a friend or counsellor to guide him  despite her sudden jealousy viviettes eyes grew moist at the picture of her innocent swithin going into the world without a friend or counsellor but she was sick in soul and disquieted still by louiss dreadful remarks who unbeliever as he was in human virtue could have no reason whatever for representing swithin as engaged in a private love affair if such were not his honest impression  she was so absorbed during the remainder of the luncheon that she did not even observe the kindly light that her presence was shedding on the right reverend ecclesiastic by her side  he reflected it back in tones duly mellowed by his position the minor clergy caught up the rays thereof and so the gentle influence played down the table  the company soon departed when luncheon was over and the remainder of the day passed in quietness the bishop being occupied in his room at the vicarage with writing letters or a sermon  having a long journey before him the next day he had expressed a wish to be housed for the night without ceremony and would have dined alone with mr torkingham but that by a happy thought lady constantine and her brother were asked to join them  however when louis crossed the churchyard and entered the vicarage drawingroom at seven oclock his sister was not in his company  she was he said suffering from a slight headache and much regretted that she was on that account unable to come  at this intelligence the social sparkle disappeared from the bishops eye and he sat down to table endeavouring to mould into the form of episcopal serenity an expression which was really one of common human disappointment  in his simple statement louis glanville had by no means expressed all the circumstances which accompanied his sisters refusal at the last moment to dine at her neighbours house  louis had strongly urged her to bear up against her slight indispositionif it were that and not disinclinationand come along with him on just this one occasion perhaps a more important episode in her life than she was aware of viviette thereupon knew quite well that he alluded to the favourable impression she was producing on the bishop notwithstanding that neither of them mentioned the bishops name  but she did not give way though the argument waxed strong between them and louis left her in no very amiable mood saying i dont believe you have any more headache than i have viviette  it is some provoking whim of yoursnothing more  in this there was a substratum of truth  when her brother had left her and she had seen him from the window entering the vicarage gate viviette seemed to be much relieved and sat down in her bedroom till the evening grew dark and only the lights shining through the trees from the parsonage diningroom revealed to the eye where that dwelling stood  then she arose and putting on the cloak she had used so many times before for the same purpose she locked her bedroom door to be supposed within in case of the accidental approach of a servant and let herself privately out of the house  lady constantine paused for a moment under the vicarage windows till she could sufficiently well hear the voices of the diners to be sure that they were actually within and then went on her way which was towards the ringshill column  she appeared a mere spot hardly distinguishable from the grass as she crossed the open ground and soon became absorbed in the black mass of the fir plantation  meanwhile the conversation at mr torkinghams dinnertable was not of a highly exhilarating quality  the parson in long selfcommuning during the afternoon had decided that the diocesan synod whose annual session at melchester had occurred in the month previous would afford a solid and unimpeachable subject to launch during the meal whenever conversation flagged and that it would be one likely to win the respect of his spiritual chieftain for himself as the introducer  accordingly in the further belief that you could not have too much of a good thing mr torkingham not only acted upon his idea but at every pause rallied to the synod point with unbroken firmness  everything which had been discussed at that last sessionsuch as the introduction of the lay element into the councils of the church the reconstitution of the ecclesiastical courts church patronage the tithe questionwas revived by mr torkingham and the excellent remarks which the bishop had made in his addresses on those subjects were quoted back to him  as for bishop helmsdale himself his instincts seemed to be to allude in a debonair spirit to the incidents of the past dayto the flowers in lady constantines beds the date of her houseperhaps with a view of hearing a little more about their owner from louis who would very readily have followed the bishops lead had the parson allowed him room but this mr torkingham seldom did and about halfpast nine they prepared to separate  louis glanville had risen from the table and was standing by the window looking out upon the sky and privately yawning the topics discussed having been hardly in his line  a fine night he said at last  i suppose our young astronomer is hard at work now said the bishop following the direction of louiss glance towards the clear sky  yes said the parson he is very assiduous whenever the nights are good for observation  i have occasionally joined him in his tower and looked through his telescope with great benefit to my ideas of celestial phenomena  i have not seen what he has been doing lately  suppose we stroll that way said louis  would you be interested in seeing the observatory bishop  i am quite willing to go said the bishop if the distance is not too great  i should not be at all averse to making the acquaintance of so exceptional a young man as this mr st cleeve seems to be and i have never seen the inside of an observatory in my life  the intention was no sooner formed than it was carried out mr torkingham leading the way    xxvi   half an hour before this time swithin st cleeve had been sitting in his cabin at the base of the column working out some figures from observations taken on preceding nights with a view to a theory that he had in his head on the motions of certain socalled fixed stars  the evening being a little chilly a small fire was burning in the stove and this and the shaded lamp before him lent a remarkably cosy air to the chamber  he was awakened from his reveries by a scratching at the window pane like that of the point of an ivy leaf which he knew to be really caused by the tip of his sweetheartwifes forefinger  he rose and opened the door to admit her not without astonishment as to how she had been able to get away from her friends  dearest viv why whats the matter he said perceiving that her face as the lamplight fell on it was sad and even stormy  i thought i would run across to see you  i have heard something sosoto your discredit and i know it cant be true  i know you are constancy itself but your constancy produces strange effects in peoples eyes  good heavens  nobody has found us out  no noit is not that  you know swithin that i am always sincere and willing to own if i am to blame in anything  now will you prove to me that you are the same by owning some fault to me  yes dear indeed directly i can think of one worth owning  i wonder one does not rush upon your tongue in a moment  i confess that i am sufficiently a pharisee not to experience that spontaneity  swithin dont speak so affectedly when you know so well what i mean is it nothing to you that after all our vows for life you have thought it right toflirt with a village girl  o viviette interrupted swithin taking her hand which was hot and trembling  you who are full of noble and generous feelings and regard me with devoted tenderness that has never been surpassed by womanhow can you be so greatly at fault  i flirt viviette  by thinking that you injure yourself in my eyes  why i am so far from doing so that i continually pull myself up for watching you too jealously as today when i have been dreading the effect upon you of other company in my absence and thinking that you rather shut the gates against me when you have bigwigs to entertain  do you swithin she cried  it was evident that the honest tone of his words was having a great effect in clearing away the clouds  she added with an uncertain smile but how can i believe that after what was seen today  my brother not knowing in the least that i had an iota of interest in you told me that he witnessed the signs of an attachment between you and tabitha lark in church this morning  ah cried swithin with a burst of laughter  now i know what you mean and what has caused this misunderstanding  how good of you viviette to come at once and have it out with me instead of brooding over it with dark imaginings and thinking bitter things of me as many women would have done  he succinctly told the whole story of his little adventure with tabitha that morning and the sky was clear on both sides when shall i be able to claim you he added and put an end to all such painful accidents as these  she partially sighed  her perception of what the outside world was made of latterly somewhat obscured by solitude and her lovers company had been revived today by her entertainment of the bishop clergymen and more particularly clergymens wives and it did not diminish her sense of the difficulties in swithins path to see anew how little was thought of the greatest gifts mental and spiritual if they were not backed up by substantial temporalities  however the pair made the best of their future that circumstances permitted and the interview was at length drawing to a close when there came without the slightest forewarning a smart rattattat upon the little door  o i am lost said viviette seizing his arm  why was i so incautious  it is nobody of consequence whispered swithin assuringly  somebody from my grandmother probably to know when i am coming home  they were unperceived so far for the only window which gave light to the hut was screened by a curtain  at that moment they heard the sound of their visitors voices and with a consternation as great as her own swithin discerned the tones of mr torkingham and the bishop of melchester  where shall i get  what shall i do said the poor lady clasping her hands  swithin looked around the cabin and a very little look was required to take in all its resources  at one end as previously explained were a table stove chair cupboard and so on while the other was completely occupied by a diminutive arabian bedstead hung with curtains of pinkand white chintz  on the inside of the bed there was a narrow channel about a foot wide between it and the wall of the hut  into this cramped retreat viviette slid herself and stood trembling behind the curtains  by this time the knock had been repeated more loudly the light through the windowblind unhappily revealing the presence of some inmate  swithin threw open the door and mr torkingham introduced his visitors  the bishop shook hands with the young man told him he had known his father and at swithins invitation weak as it was entered the cabin the vicar and louis glanville remaining on the threshold not to inconveniently crowd the limited space within  bishop helmsdale looked benignantly around the apartment and said quite a settlement in the backwoodsquite far enough from the world to afford the votary of science the seclusion he needs and not so far as to limit his resources  a hermit might apparently live here in as much solitude as in a primeval forest  his lordship has been good enough to express an interest in your studies said mr torkingham to st cleeve  and we have come to ask you to let us see the observatory  with great pleasure stammered swithin  where is the observatory inquired the bishop peering round again  the staircase is just outside this door swithin answered  i am at your lordships service and will show you up at once  and this is your little bed for use when you work late said the bishop  yes i am afraid it is rather untidy swithin apologized  and here are your books the bishop continued turning to the table and the shaded lamp  you take an observation at the top i presume and come down here to record your observations  the young man explained his precise processes as well as his state of mind would let him and while he was doing so mr torkingham and louis waited patiently without looking sometimes into the night and sometimes through the door at the interlocutors and listening to their scientific converse  when all had been exhibited here below swithin lit his lantern and inviting his visitors to follow led the way up the column experiencing no small sense of relief as soon as he heard the footsteps of all three tramping on the stairs behind him  he knew very well that once they were inside the spiral viviette was out of danger her knowledge of the locality enabling her to find her way with perfect safety through the plantation and into the park home  at the top he uncovered his equatorial and for the first time at ease explained to them its beauties and revealed by its help the glories of those stars that were eligible for inspection  the bishop spoke as intelligently as could be expected on a topic not peculiarly his own but somehow he seemed rather more abstracted in manner now than when he had arrived  swithin thought that perhaps the long clamber up the stairs coming after a hard days work had taken his spontaneity out of him and mr torkingham was afraid that his lordship was getting bored but this did not appear to be the case for though he said little he stayed on some time longer examining the construction of the dome after relinquishing the telescope while occasionally swithin caught the eyes of the bishop fixed hard on him  perhaps he sees some likeness of my father in me the young man thought and the party making ready to leave at this time he conducted them to the bottom of the tower  swithin was not prepared for what followed their descent  all were standing at the foot of the staircase  the astronomer lantern in hand offered to show them the way out of the plantation to which mr torkingham replied that he knew the way very well and would not trouble his young friend  he strode forward with the words and louis followed him after waiting a moment and finding that the bishop would not take the precedence  the latter and swithin were thus left together for one moment whereupon the bishop turned  mr st cleeve he said in a strange voice i should like to speak to you privately before i leave tomorrow morning  can you meet melet me seein the churchyard at halfpast ten oclock  o yes my lord certainly said swithin  and before he had recovered from his surprise the bishop had joined the others in the shades of the plantation  swithin immediately opened the door of the hut and scanned the nook behind the bed  as he had expected his bird had flown    xxvii   all night the astronomers mind was on the stretch with curiosity as to what the bishop could wish to say to him  a dozen conjectures entered his brain to be abandoned in turn as unlikely  that which finally seemed the most plausible was that the bishop having become interested in his pursuits and entertaining friendly recollections of his father was going to ask if he could do anything to help him on in the profession he had chosen  should this be the case thought the suddenly sanguine youth it would seem like an encouragement to that spirit of firmness which had led him to reject his late uncles offer because it involved the renunciation of lady constantine  at last he fell asleep and when he awoke it was so late that the hour was ready to solve what conjecture could not  after a hurried breakfast he paced across the fields entering the churchyard by the south gate precisely at the appointed minute  the inclosure was well adapted for a private interview being bounded by bushes of laurel and alder nearly on all sides  he looked round the bishop was not there nor any living creature save himself  swithin sat down upon a tombstone to await bishop helmsdales arrival  while he sat he fancied he could hear voices in conversation not far off and further attention convinced him that they came from lady constantines lawn which was divided from the churchyard by a high wall and shrubbery only  as the bishop still delayed his coming though the time was nearly eleven and as the lady whose sweet voice mingled with those heard from the lawn was his personal property swithin became exceedingly curious to learn what was going on within that screened promenade  a way of doing so occurred to him  the key was in the church door he opened it entered and ascended to the ringers loft in the west tower  at the back of this was a window commanding a full view of viviettes garden front  the flowers were all in gayest bloom and the creepers on the walls of the house were bursting into tufts of young green  a broad gravelwalk ran from end to end of the facade terminating in a large conservatory in the walk were three people pacing up and down  lady constantines was the central figure her brother being on one side of her and on the other a stately form in a corded shovelhat of glossy beaver and black breeches  this was the bishop  viviette carried over her shoulder a sunshade lined with red which she twirled idly  they were laughing and chatting gaily and when the group approached the churchyard many of their remarks entered the silence of the church tower through the ventilator of the window  the conversation was general yet interesting enough to swithin  at length louis stepped upon the grass and picked up something that had lain there which turned out to be a bowl throwing it forward he took a second and bowled it towards the first or jack  the bishop who seemed to be in a sprightly mood followed suit and bowled one in a curve towards the jack turning and speaking to lady constantine as he concluded the feat  as she had not left the gravelled terrace he raised his voice so that the words reached swithin distinctly  do you follow us he asked gaily  i am not skilful she said  i always bowl narrow  the bishop meditatively paused  this moment reminds one of the scene in richard the second he said i mean the duke of yorks garden where the queen and her two ladies play and the queen says     what sport shall we devise here in this garden    to drive away the heavy thought of care  to which her lady answers madam well play at bowls  thats an unfortunate quotation for you said lady constantine for if i dont forget the queen declines saying twill make me think the world is full of rubs and that my fortune runs against the bias  then i cite mal a propos  but it is an interesting old game and might have been played at that very date on this very green  the bishop lazily bowled another and while he was doing it viviettes glance rose by accident to the church tower window where she recognized swithins face  her surprise was only momentary and waiting till both her companions backs were turned she smiled and blew him a kiss  in another minute she had another opportunity and blew him another afterwards blowing him one a third time  her blowings were put a stop to by the bishop and louis throwing down the bowls and rejoining her in the path the house clock at the moment striking halfpast eleven  this is a fine way of keeping an engagement said swithin to himself i have waited an hour while you indulge in those trifles  he fumed turned and behold somebody was at his elbow tabitha lark swithin started and said how did you come here tabitha  in the course of my calling mr st cleeve said the smiling girl  i come to practise on the organ  when i entered i saw you up here through the tower arch and i crept up to see what you were looking at  the bishop is a striking man is he not  yes rather said swithin  i think he is much devoted to lady constantine and i am glad of it arent you  o yesvery said swithin wondering if tabitha had seen the tender little salutes between lady constantine and himself  i dont think she cares much for him added tabitha judicially  or even if she does she could be got away from him in no time by a younger man  pooh thats nothing said swithin impatiently  tabitha then remarked that her blower had not come to time and that she must go to look for him upon which she descended the stairs and left swithin again alone  a few minutes later the bishop suddenly looked at his watch lady constantine having withdrawn towards the house  apparently apologizing to louis the bishop came down the terrace and through the door into the churchyard  swithin hastened downstairs and joined him in the path under the sunny wall of the aisle  their glances met and it was with some consternation that swithin beheld the change that a few short minutes had wrought in that episcopal countenance  on the lawn with lady constantine the rays of an almost perpetual smile had brightened his dark aspect like flowers in a shady place now the smile was gone as completely as yesterday the lines of his face were firm his dark eyes and whiskers were overspread with gravity and as he gazed upon swithin from the repose of his stable figure it was like an evangelized king of spades come to have it out with the knave of hearts        to return for a moment to louis glanville  he had been somewhat struck with the abruptness of the bishops departure and more particularly by the circumstance that he had gone away by the private door into the churchyard instead of by the regular exit on the other side  true great men were known to suffer from absence of mind and bishop helmsdale having a dim sense that he had entered by that door yesterday might have unconsciously turned thitherward now  louis upon the whole thought little of the matter and being now left quite alone on the lawn he seated himself in an arbour and began smoking  the arbour was situated against the churchyard wall  the atmosphere was as still as the air of a hothouse only fourteen inches of brickwork divided louis from the scene of the bishops interview with st cleeve and as voices on the lawn had been audible to swithin in the churchyard voices in the churchyard could be heard without difficulty from that close corner of the lawn  no sooner had louis lit a cigar than the dialogue began  ah you are here st cleeve said the bishop hardly replying to swithins good morning  i fear i am a little late  well my request to you to meet me may have seemed somewhat unusual seeing that we were strangers till a few hours ago  i dont mind that if your lordship wishes to see me  i thought it best to see you regarding your confirmation yesterday and my reason for taking a more active step with you than i should otherwise have done is that i have some interest in you through having known your father when we were undergraduates  his rooms were on the same staircase with mine at all angels and we were friendly till time and affairs separated us even more completely than usually happens  however about your presenting yourself for confirmation  the bishops voice grew stern  if i had known yesterday morning what i knew twelve hours later i wouldnt have confirmed you at all  indeed my lord  yes i say it and i mean it  i visited your observatory last night  you did my lord  in inspecting it i noticed something which i may truly describe as extraordinary  i have had young men present themselves to me who turned out to be notoriously unfit either from giddiness from being profane or intemperate or from some bad quality or other  but i never remember a case which equalled the cool culpability of this  while infringing the first principles of social decorum you might at least have respected the ordinance sufficiently to have stayed away from it altogether  now i have sent for you here to see if a last entreaty and a direct appeal to your sense of manly uprightness will have any effect in inducing you to change your course of life  the voice of swithin in his next remark showed how tremendously this attack of the bishop had told upon his feelings  louis of course did not know the reason why the words should have affected him precisely as they did to any one in the secret the double embarrassment arising from misapprehended ethics and inability to set matters right because his word of secrecy to another was inviolable would have accounted for the young mans emotion sufficiently well  i am very sorry your lordship should have seen anything objectionable said swithin  may i ask what it was  you know what it was  something in your chamber which forced me to the above conclusions  i disguised my feelings of sorrow at the time for obvious reasons but i never in my whole life was so shocked  at what my lord  at what i saw  pardon me bishop helmsdale but you said just now that we are strangers so what you saw in my cabin concerns me only  there i contradict you  twentyfour hours ago that remark would have been plausible enough but by presenting yourself for confirmation at my hands you have invited my investigation into your principles  swithin sighed  i admit it he said  and what do i find them  you say reprehensible  but you might at least let me hear the proof  i can do more sir  i can let you see it  there was a pause  louis glanville was so highly interested that he stood upon the seat of the arbour and looked through the leafage over the wall  the bishop had produced an article from his pocket  what is it said swithin laboriously scrutinizing the thing  why dont you see said the bishop holding it out between his finger and thumb in swithins face  a braceleta coral bracelet  i found the wanton object on the bed in your cabin  and of the sex of the owner there can be no doubt  more than that she was concealed behind the curtains for i saw them move  in the decision of his opinion the bishop threw the coral bracelet down on a tombstone  nobody was in my room my lord who had not a perfect right to be there said the younger man  well well thats a matter of assertion  now dont get into a passion and say to me in your haste what youll repent of saying afterwards  i am not in a passion i assure your lordship  i am too sad for passion  very well thats a hopeful sign  now i would ask you as one man of another do you think that to come to me the bishop of this large and important diocese as you came yesterday and pretend to be something that you are not is quite upright conduct leave alone religious  think it over  we may never meet again  but bear in mind what your bishop and spiritual head says to you and see if you cannot mend before it is too late  swithin was meek as moses but he tried to appear sturdy  my lord i am in a difficult position he said mournfully how difficult nobody but myself can tell  i cannot explain there are insuperable reasons against it  but will you take my word of assurance that i am not so bad as i seem  some day i will prove it  till then i only ask you to suspend your judgment on me  the bishop shook his head incredulously and went towards the vicarage as if he had lost his hearing  swithin followed him with his eyes and louis followed the direction of swithins  before the bishop had reached the vicarage entrance lady constantine crossed in front of him  she had a basket on her arm and was in fact going to visit some of the poorer cottages  who could believe the bishop now to be the same man that he had been a moment before  the darkness left his face as if he had come out of a cave his look was all sweetness and shine and gaiety as he again greeted viviette    xxviii   the conversation which arose between the bishop and lady constantine was of that lively and reproductive kind which cannot be ended during any reasonable halt of two people going in opposite directions  he turned and walked with her along the laurelscreened lane that bordered the churchyard till their voices died away in the distance  swithin then aroused himself from his thoughtful regard of them and went out of the churchyard by another gate  seeing himself now to be left alone on the scene louis glanville descended from his post of observation in the arbour  he came through the private doorway and on to that spot among the graves where the bishop and st cleeve had conversed  on the tombstone still lay the coral bracelet which dr helmsdale had flung down there in his indignation for the agitated introspective mood into which swithin had been thrown had banished from his mind all thought of securing the trinket and putting it in his pocket  louis picked up the little red scandalbreeding thing and while walking on with it in his hand he observed tabitha lark approaching the church in company with the young blower whom she had gone in search of to inspire her organpractising within  louis immediately put together with that rare diplomatic keenness of which he was proud the little scene he had witnessed between tabitha and swithin during the confirmation and the bishops stern statement as to where he had found the bracelet  he had no longer any doubt that it belonged to her  poor girl he said to himself and sang in an undertone        tra deri dera    lhistoire nest pas nouvelle  when she drew nearer louis called her by name  she sent the boy into the church and came forward blushing at having been called by so fine a gentleman  louis held out the bracelet  here is something i have found or somebody else has found he said to her  i wont state where  put it away and say no more about it  i will not mention it either  now go on into the church where you are going and may heaven have mercy on your soul my dear  thank you sir said tabitha with some perplexity yet inclined to be pleased and only recognizing in the situation the fact that lady constantines humorous brother was making her a present  you are much obliged to me  o yes  well miss lark ive discovered a secret you see  what may that be mr glanville  that you are in love  i dont admit it sir  who told you so  nobody  only i put two and two together  now take my advice  beware of lovers  they are a bad lot and bring young women to tears  some do i dare say  but some dont  and you think that in your particular case the latter alternative will hold good  we generally think we shall be lucky ourselves though all the world before us in the same situation have been otherwise  o yes or we should die outright of despair  well i dont think you will be lucky in your case  please how do you know so much since my case has not yet arrived asked tabitha tossing her head a little disdainfully but less than she might have done if he had not obtained a charter for his discourse by giving her the bracelet  fie tabitha  i tell you it has not arrived she said with some anger  i have not got a lover and everybody knows i havent and its an insinuating thing for you to say so  louis laughed thinking how natural it was that a girl should so emphatically deny circumstances that would not bear curious inquiry  why of course i meant myself he said soothingly  so then you will not accept me  i didnt know you meant yourself she replied  but i wont accept you  and i think you ought not to jest on such subjects  well perhaps not  however dont let the bishop see your bracelet and all will be well  but mind lovers are deceivers  tabitha laughed and they parted the girl entering the church  she had been feeling almost certain that having accidentally found the bracelet somewhere he had presented it in a whim to her as the first girl he met yet now she began to have momentary doubts whether he had not been labouring under a mistake and had imagined her to be the owner  the bracelet was not valuable it was in fact a mere toythe pair of which this was one being a little present made to lady constantine by swithin on the day of their marriage and she had not worn them with sufficient frequency out of doors for tabitha to recognize either as positively her ladyships  but when out of sight of the blower the girl momentarily tried it on in a corner by the organ it seemed to her that the ornament was possibly lady constantines  now that the pink beads shone before her eyes on her own arm she remembered having seen a bracelet with just such an effect gracing the wrist of lady constantine upon one occasion  a temporary selfsurrender to the sophism that if mr louis glanville chose to give away anything belonging to his sister she tabitha had a right to take it without question was soon checked by a resolve to carry the tempting strings of coral to her ladyship that evening and inquire the truth about them  this decided on she slipped the bracelet into her pocket and played her voluntaries with a light heart        bishop helmsdale did not tear himself away from welland till about two oclock that afternoon which was three hours later than he had intended to leave  it was with a feeling of relief that swithin looking from the top of the tower saw the carriage drive out from the vicarage into the turnpike road and whirl the right reverend gentleman again towards warborne  the coast being now clear of him swithin meditated how to see viviette and explain what had happened  with this in view he waited where he was till evening came on  meanwhile lady constantine and her brother dined by themselves at welland house  they had not met since the morning and as soon as they were left alone louis said you have done very well so far but you might have been a little warmer  done well she asked with surprise  yes with the bishop  the difficult question is how to follow up our advantage  how are you to keep yourself in sight of him  heavens louis you dont seriously mean that the bishop of melchester has any feelings for me other than friendly  viviette this is affectation  you know he has as well as i do  she sighed  yes she said  i own i had a suspicion of the same thing  what a misfortune  a misfortune  surely the world is turned upside down  you will drive me to despair about our future if you see things so awry  exert yourself to do something so as to make of this accident a steppingstone to higher things  the gentleman will give us the slip if we dont pursue the friendship at once  i cannot have you talk like this she cried impatiently  i have no more thought of the bishop than i have of the pope  i would much rather not have had him here to lunch at all  you said it would be necessary to do it and an opportunity and i thought it my duty to show some hospitality when he was coming so near mr torkinghams house being so small  but of course i understood that the opportunity would be one for you in getting to know him your prospects being so indefinite at present not one for me  if you dont follow up this chance of being spiritual queen of melchester you will never have another of being anything  mind this viviette you are not so young as you were  you are getting on to be a middleaged woman and your black hair is precisely of the sort which time quickly turns grey  you must make up your mind to grizzled bachelors or widowers  young marriageable men wont look at you or if they do just now in a year or two more theyll despise you as an antiquated party  lady constantine perceptibly paled  young men what she asked  say that again  i said it was no use to think of young men they wont look at you much longer or if they do it will be to look away again very quickly  you imply that if i were to marry a man younger than myself he would speedily acquire a contempt for me  how much younger must a man be than his wifeto get that feeling for her  she was resting her elbow on the chair as she faintly spoke the words and covered her eyes with her hand  an exceedingly small number of years said louis drily  now the bishop is at least fifteen years older than you and on that account no less than on others is an excellent match  you would be head of the church in this diocese what more can you require after these years of miserable obscurity  in addition you would escape that minor thorn in the flesh of bishops wives of being only mrs while their husbands are peers  she was not listening his previous observation still detained her thoughts  louis she said in the case of a woman marrying a man much younger than herself does he get to dislike her even if there has been a social advantage to him in the union  yesnot a whit less  ask any person of experience  but what of that lets talk of our own affairs  you say you have no thought of the bishop  and yet if he had stayed here another day or two he would have proposed to you straight off  seriously louis i could not accept him  why not  i dont love him  oh oh i like those words cried louis throwing himself back in his chair and looking at the ceiling in satirical enjoyment  a woman who at twoandtwenty married for convenience at thirty talks of not marrying without love the rule of inverse that is in which more requires less and less requires more  as your only brother older than yourself and more experienced i insist that you encourage the bishop  dont quarrel with me louis she said piteously  we dont know that he thinks anything of mewe only guess  i know itand you shall hear how i know  i am of a curious and conjectural nature as you are aware  last night when everybody had gone to bed i stepped out for a five minutes smoke on the lawn and walked down to where you get near the vicarage windows  while i was there in the dark one of them opened and bishop helmsdale leant out  the illuminated oblong of your window shone him full in the face between the trees and presently your shadow crossed it  he waved his hand and murmured some tender words though what they were exactly i could not hear  what a vague imaginary storyas if he could know my shadow  besides a man of the bishops dignity wouldnt have done such a thing  when i knew him as a younger man he was not at all romantic and hes not likely to have grown so now  thats just what he is likely to have done  no lover is so extreme a specimen of the species as an old lover  come viviette no more of this fencing  i have entered into the project heart and soulso much that i have postponed my departure till the matter is well under way  louismy dear louisyou will bring me into some disagreeable position said she clasping her hands  i do entreat you not to interfere or do anything rash about me  the step is impossible  i have something to tell you some day  i must live on and endure  everything except this penury replied louis unmoved  come i have begun the campaign by inviting bishop helmsdale and ill take the responsibility of carrying it on  all i ask of you is not to make a ninny of yourself  come give me your promise  no i cannoti dont know how to  i only know one thingthat i am in no hurry  no hurry be hanged  agree like a good sister to charm the bishop  i must consider she replied with perturbed evasiveness  it being a fine evening louis went out of the house to enjoy his cigar in the shrubbery  on reaching his favourite seat he found he had left his cigarcase behind him he immediately returned for it  when he approached the window by which he had emerged he saw swithin st cleeve standing there in the dusk talking to viviette inside  st cleeves back was towards louis but whether at a signal from her or by accident he quickly turned and recognized glanville whereupon raising his hat to lady constantine the young man passed along the terracewalk and out by the churchyard door  louis rejoined his sister  i didnt know you allowed your lawn to be a public thoroughfare for the parish he said  i am not exclusive especially since i have been so poor replied she  then do you let everybody pass this way or only that illustrious youth because he is so goodlooking  i have no strict rule in the case  mr st cleeve is an acquaintance of mine and he can certainly come here if he chooses  her colour rose somewhat and she spoke warmly  louis was too cautious a bird to reveal to her what had suddenly dawned upon his mindthat his sister in common with the to his thinking unhappy tabitha lark had been foolish enough to get interested in this phenomenon of the parish this scientific adonis  but he resolved to cure at once her tender feeling if it existed by letting out a secret which would inflame her dignity against the weakness  a goodlooking young man he said with his eyes where swithin had vanished  but not so good as he looks  in fact a regular young sinner  what do you mean  oh only a little feature i discovered in st cleeves history  but i suppose he has a right to sow his wild oats as well as other young men  tell me what you allude todo louis  it is hardly fit that i should  however the case is amusing enough  i was sitting in the arbour today and was an unwilling listener to the oddest interview i ever heard of  our friend the bishop discovered when we visited the observatory last night that our astronomer was not alone in his seclusion  a lady shared his romantic cabin with him and finding this the bishop naturally enough felt that the ordinance of confirmation had been profaned  so his lordship sent for master swithin this morning and meeting him in the churchyard read him such an excommunicating lecture as i warrant he wont forget in his lifetime  hahaha  twas very goodvery  he watched her face narrowly while he spoke with such seeming carelessness  instead of the agitation of jealousy that he had expected to be aroused by this hint of another woman in the case there was a curious expression more like embarrassment than anything else which might have been fairly attributed to the subject  can it be that i am mistaken he asked himself  the possibility that he might be mistaken restored louis to goodhumour and lights having been brought he sat with his sister for some time talking with purpose of swithins low rank on one side and the sordid struggles that might be in store for him  st cleeve being in the unhappy case of deriving his existence through two channels of society it resulted that he seemed to belong to either this or that according to the altitude of the beholder  louis threw the light entirely on swithins agricultural side bringing out old mrs martin and her connexions and her ways of life with luminous distinctness till lady constantine became greatly depressed  she in her hopefulness had almost forgotten latterly that the bucolic element so incisively represented by messrs hezzy biles haymoss fry sammy blore and the rest entered into his condition at all to her he had been the son of his academic father alone  but she would not reveal the depression to which she had been subjected by this resuscitation of the homely half of poor swithin presently putting an end to the subject by walking hither and thither about the room  what have you lost said louis observing her movements  nothing of consequencea bracelet  coral he inquired calmly  yes  how did you know it was coral  you have never seen it have you  he was about to make answer but the amazed enlightenment which her announcement had produced in him through knowing where the bishop had found such an article led him to reconsider himself  then like an astute man by no means sure of the dimensions of the intrigue he might be uncovering he said carelessly i found such a one in the churchyard today  but i thought it appeared to be of no great rarity and i gave it to one of the village girls who was passing by  did she take it  who was she said the unsuspecting viviette  really i dont remember  i suppose it is of no consequence  o no its value is nothing comparatively  it was only one of a pair such as young girls wear  lady constantine could not add that in spite of this she herself valued it as being swithins present and the best he could afford  panicstruck by his ruminations although revealing nothing by his manner louis soon after went up to his room professedly to write letters  he gave vent to a low whistle when he was out of hearing  he of course remembered perfectly well to whom he had given the corals and resolved to seek out tabitha the next morning to ascertain whether she could possibly have owned such a trinket as well as his sisterwhich at present he very greatly doubted though fervently hoping that she might    xxix   the effect upon swithin of the interview with the bishop had been a very marked one  he felt that he had good ground for resenting that dignitarys tone in haughtily assuming that all must be sinful which at the first blush appeared to be so and in narrowly refusing a young man the benefit of a single doubt  swithins assurance that he would be able to explain all some day had been taken in contemptuous incredulity  he may be as virtuous as his prototype timothy but hes an opinionated old fogey all the same said st cleeve petulantly  yet on the other hand swithins nature was so fresh and ingenuous notwithstanding that recent affairs had somewhat denaturalized him that for a man in the bishops position to think him immoral was almost as overwhelming as if he had actually been so and at moments he could scarcely bear existence under so gross a suspicion  what was his union with lady constantine worth to him when by reason of it he was thought a reprobate by almost the only man who had professed to take an interest in him  certainly by contrast with his airbuilt image of himself as a worthy astronomer received by all the world and the envied husband of viviette the present imputation was humiliating  the glorious light of this tender and refined passion seemed to have become debased to burlesque hues by pure accident and his aesthetic no less than his ethic taste was offended by such an anticlimax  he who had soared amid the remotest grandeurs of nature had been taken to task on a rudimentary question of morals which had never been a question with him at all  this was what the exigencies of an awkward attachment had brought him to but he blamed the circumstances and not for one moment lady constantine  having now set his heart against a longer concealment he was disposed to think that an excellent way of beginning a revelation of their marriage would be by writing a confidential letter to the bishop detailing the whole case  but it was impossible to do this on his own responsibility he still recognized the understanding entered into with viviette before the marriage to be as binding as everthat the initiative in disclosing their union should come from her  yet he hardly doubted that she would take that initiative when he told her of his extraordinary reprimand in the churchyard  this was what he had come to do when louis saw him standing at the window  but before he had said halfadozen words to viviette she motioned him to go on which he mechanically did ere he could sufficiently collect his thoughts on its advisability or otherwise  he did not however go far  while louis and his sister were discussing him in the drawingroom he lingered musing in the churchyard hoping that she might be able to escape and join him in the consultation he so earnestly desired  she at last found opportunity to do this  as soon as louis had left the room and shut himself in upstairs she ran out by the window in the direction swithin had taken  when her footsteps began crunching on the gravel he came forward from the churchyard door  they embraced each other in haste and then in a few short panting words she explained to him that her brother had heard and witnessed the interview on that spot between himself and the bishop and had told her the substance of the bishops accusation not knowing she was the woman in the cabin  and what i cannot understand is this she added how did the bishop discover that the person behind the bedcurtains was a woman and not a man  swithin explained that the bishop had found the bracelet on the bed and had brought it to him in the churchyard  o swithin what do you say  found the coral bracelet  what did you do with it  swithin clapped his hand to his pocket  dear me  i recollecti left it where it lay on reuben heaths tombstone  oh my dear dear swithin she cried miserably  you have compromised me by your forgetfulness  i have claimed the article as mine  my brother did not tell me that the bishop brought it from the cabin  what can i can i do that neither the bishop nor my brother may conclude i was the woman there  but if we announce our marriage  even as your wife the position was too undignifiedtoo i dont know whatfor me ever to admit that i was there  right or wrong i must declare the bracelet was not mine  such an escapadewhy it would make me ridiculous in the county and anything rather than that  i was in hope that you would agree to let our marriage be known said swithin with some disappointment  i thought that these circumstances would make the reason for doing so doubly strong  yes  but there are alas reasons against it still stronger  let me have my way  certainly dearest  i promised that before you agreed to be mine  my reputationwhat is it  perhaps i shall be dead and forgotten before the next transit of venus  she soothed him tenderly but could not tell him why she felt the reasons against any announcement as yet to be stronger than those in favour of it  how could she when her feeling had been cautiously fed and developed by her brother louiss unvarnished exhibition of swithins material position in the eyes of the worldthat of a young man the scion of a family of farmers recently her tenants living at the homestead with his grandmother mrs martin  to soften her refusal she said in declaring it one concession swithin i certainly will make  i will see you oftener  i will come to the cabin and tower frequently and will contrive too that you come to the house occasionally  during the last winter we passed whole weeks without meeting dont let us allow that to happen again  very well dearest said swithin goodhumouredly  i dont care so terribly much for the old mans opinion of me after all  for the present then let things be as they are  nevertheless the youth felt her refusal more than he owned but the unequal temperament of swithins age so soon depressed on his own account was also soon to recover on hers and it was with almost a childs forgetfulness of the past that he took her view of the case  when he was gone she hastily reentered the house  her brother had not reappeared from upstairs but she was informed that tabitha lark was waiting to see her if her ladyship would pardon the said tabitha for coming so late  lady constantine made no objection and saw the young girl at once  when lady constantine entered the waitingroom behold in tabithas outstretched hand lay the coral ornament which had been causing viviette so much anxiety  i guessed on second thoughts that it was yours my lady said tabitha with rather a frightened face and so i have brought it back  but how did you come by it tabitha  mr glanville gave it to me he must have thought it was mine  i took it fancying at the moment that he handed it to me because i happened to come by first after he had found it  lady constantine saw how the situation might be improved so as to effect her deliverance from this troublesome little web of evidence  oh you can keep it she said brightly  it was very good of you to bring it back  but keep it for your very own  take mr glanville at his word and dont explain  and tabitha divide the strands into two bracelets there are enough of them to make a pair  the next morning in pursuance of his resolution louis wandered round the grounds till he saw the girl for whom he was waiting enter the church  he accosted her over the wall  but puzzling to view a coral bracelet blushed on each of her young arms for she had promptly carried out the suggestion of lady constantine  you are wearing it i see tabitha with the other he murmured  then you mean to keep it  yes i mean to keep it  you are sure it is not lady constantines  i find she has one like it  quite sure  but you had better take it to her sir and ask her said the saucy girl  oh no thats not necessary replied louis considerably shaken in his convictions  when louis met his sister a short time after he did not catch her as he had intended to do by saying suddenly i have found your bracelet  i know who has got it  you cannot have found it she replied quietly for i have discovered that it was never lost and stretching out both her hands she revealed one on each viviette having performed the same operation with her remaining bracelet that she had advised tabitha to do with the other  louis was mystified but by no means convinced  in spite of this attempt to hoodwink him his mind returned to the subject every hour of the day there was no doubt that either tabitha or viviette had been with swithin in the cabin  he recapitulated every case that had occurred during his visit to welland in which his sisters manner had been of a colour to justify the suspicion that it was she  there was that strange incident in the corridor when she had screamed at what she described to be a shadowy resemblance to her late husband how very improbable that this fancy should have been the only cause of her agitation  then he had noticed during swithins confirmation a blush upon her cheek when he passed her on his way to the bishop and the fervour in her glance during the few moments of the imposition of hands  then he suddenly recalled the night at the railway station when the accident with the whip took place and how when he reached welland house an hour later he had found no viviette there  running thus from incident to incident he increased his suspicions without being able to cull from the circumstances anything amounting to evidence but evidence he now determined to acquire without saying a word to any one  his plan was of a cruel kind to set a trap into which the pair would blindly walk if any secret understanding existed between them of the nature he suspected    xxx   louis began his stratagem by calling at the tower one afternoon as if on the impulse of the moment  after a friendly chat with swithin whom he found there having watched him enter louis invited the young man to dine the same evening at the house that he might have an opportunity of showing him some interesting old scientific works in folio which according to louiss account he had stumbled on in the library  louis set no great bait for st cleeve in this statement for old science was not old art which having perfected itself has died and left its secret hidden in its remains  but swithin was a responsive fellow and readily agreed to come being moreover always glad of a chance of meeting viviette en famille  he hoped to tell her of a scheme that had lately suggested itself to him as likely to benefit them both that he should go away for a while and endeavour to raise sufficient funds to visit the great observatories of europe with an eye to a post in one of them  hitherto the only bar to the plan had been the exceeding narrowness of his income which though sufficient for his present life was absolutely inadequate to the requirements of a travelling astronomer  meanwhile louis glanville had returned to the house and told his sister in the most innocent manner that he had been in the company of st cleeve that afternoon getting a few wrinkles on astronomy that they had grown so friendly over the fascinating subject as to leave him no alternative but to invite st cleeve to dine at welland the same evening with a view to certain researches in the library afterwards  i could quite make allowances for any youthful errors into which he may have been betrayed louis continued sententiously since for a scientist he is really admirable  no doubt the bishops caution will not be lost upon him and as for his birth and connexionsthose he cant help  lady constantine showed such alacrity in adopting the idea of having swithin to dinner and she ignored his youthful errors so completely as almost to betray herself  in fulfilment of her promise to see him oftener she had been intending to run across to swithin on that identical evening  now the trouble would be saved in a very delightful way by the exercise of a little hospitality which viviette herself would not have dared to suggest  dinnertime came and with it swithin exhibiting rather a blushing and nervous manner that was unfortunately more likely to betray their cause than was viviettes own more practised bearing  throughout the meal louis sat like a spider in the corner of his web observing them narrowly and at moments flinging out an artful thread here and there with a view to their entanglement  but they underwent the ordeal marvellously well  perhaps the actual tie between them through being so much closer and of so much more practical a nature than even their critic supposed it was in itself a protection against their exhibiting that ultrareciprocity of manner which if they had been merely lovers might have betrayed them  after dinner the trio duly adjourned to the library as had been planned and the volumes were brought forth by louis with the zest of a bibliophilist  swithin had seen most of them before and thought but little of them but the pleasure of staying in the house made him welcome any reason for doing so and he willingly looked at whatever was put before him from bertiuss ptolemy to reess cyclop√¶dia  the evening thus passed away and it began to grow late  swithin who among other things had planned to go to greenwich next day to view the royal observatory would every now and then start up and prepare to leave for home when glanville would unearth some other volume and so detain him yet another halfhour  by george he said looking at the clock when swithin was at last really about to depart  i didnt know it was so late  why not stay here tonight st cleeve  it is very dark and the way to your place is an awkward crosscut over the fields  it would not inconvenience us at all mr st cleeve if you would care to stay said lady constantine  i am afraidthe fact is i wanted to take an observation at twenty minutes past two began swithin  oh now never mind your observation said louis  thats only an excuse  do that tomorrow night  now you will stay  it is settled viviette say he must stay and well have another hour of these charming intellectual researches  viviette obeyed with delightful ease  do stay mr st cleeve she said sweetly  well in truth i can do without the observation replied the young man as he gave way  it is not of the greatest consequence  thus it was arranged but the researches among the tomes were not prolonged to the extent that louis had suggested  in threequarters of an hour from that time they had all retired to their respective rooms lady constantines being on one side of the west corridor swithins opposite and louiss at the further end  had a person followed louis when he withdrew that watcher would have discovered on peeping through the keyhole of his door that he was engaged in one of the oddest of occupations for such a mansweeping down from the ceiling by means of a walkingcane a long cobweb which lingered on high in the corner  keeping it stretched upon the cane he gently opened the door and set the candle in such a position on the mat that the light shone down the corridor  thus guided by its rays he passed out slipperless till he reached the door of st cleeves room where he applied the dangling spiders thread in such a manner that it stretched across like a tightrope from jamb to jamb barring in its fragile way entrance and egress  the operation completed he retired again and extinguishing his light went through his bedroom window out upon the flat roof of the portico to which it gave access  here louis made himself comfortable in his chair and smokingcap enjoying the fragrance of a cigar for something like halfanhour  his position commanded a view of the two windows of lady constantines room and from these a dim light shone continuously  having the window partly open at his back and the door of his room also scarcely closed his ear retained a fair command of any noises that might be made  in due time faint movements became audible whereupon returning to his room he reentered the corridor and listened intently  all was silent again and darkness reigned from end to end  glanville however groped his way along the passage till he again reached swithins door where he examined by the light of a waxmatch he had brought the condition of the spiders thread  it was gone somebody had carried it off bodily as samson carried off the pin and the web  in other words a person had passed through the door  still holding the faint waxlight in his hand louis turned to the door of lady constantines chamber where he observed first that though it was pushed together so as to appear fastened to cursory view the door was not really closed by about a quarter of an inch  he dropped his light and extinguished it with his foot  listening he heard a voice withinviviettes voice in a subdued murmur though speaking earnestly  without any hesitation louis then returned to swithins door opened it and walked in  the starlight from without was sufficient now that his eyes had become accustomed to the darkness to reveal that the room was unoccupied and that nothing therein had been disturbed  with a heavy tread louis came forth walked loudly across the corridor knocked at lady constantines door and called viviette  she heard him instantly replying yes in startled tones  immediately afterwards she opened her door and confronted him in her dressinggown with a light in her hand  what is the matter louis she said  i am greatly alarmed  our visitor is missing  missing  what mr st cleeve  yes  i was sitting up to finish a cigar when i thought i heard a noise in this direction  on coming to his room i find he is not there  good heaven  i wonder what has happened she exclaimed in apparently intense alarm  i wonder said glanville grimly  suppose he is a somnambulist  if so he may have gone out and broken his neck  i have never heard that he is one but they say that sleeping in strange places disturbs the minds of people who are given to that sort of thing and provokes them to it  unfortunately for your theory his bed has not been touched  oh what then can it be  her brother looked her full in the face  viviette he said sternly  she seemed puzzled  well she replied in simple tones  i heard voices in your room he continued  voices  a voiceyours  yes you may have done so  it was mine  a listener is required for a speaker  true louis  well to whom were you speaking  god  viviette  i am ashamed of you  i was saying my prayers  prayersto god  to st swithin rather  what do you mean louis she asked flushing up warm and drawing back from him  it was a form of prayer i use particularly when i am in trouble  it was recommended to me by the bishop and mr torkingham commends it very highly  on your honour if you have any he said bitterly whom have you there in your room  no human being  flatly i dont believe you  she gave a dignified little bow and waving her hand into the apartment said very well then search and see  louis entered and glanced round the room behind the curtains under the bed out of the windowa view from which showed that escape thence would have been impossibleeverywhere in short capable or incapable of affording a retreat to humanity but discovered nobody  all he observed was that a light stood on the low table by her bedside that on the bed lay an open prayerbook the counterpane being unpressed except into a little pit beside the prayer book apparently where her head had rested in kneeling  but where is st cleeve he said turning in bewilderment from these evidences of innocent devotion  where can he be she chimed in with real distress  i should so much like to know  look about for him  i am quite uneasy  i will on one condition that you own that you love him  why should you force me to that she murmured  it would be no such wonder if i did  come you do  well i do  now ill look for him  louis took a light and turned away astonished that she had not indignantly resented his intrusion and the nature of his questioning  at this moment a slight noise was heard on the staircase and they could see a figure rising step by step and coming forward against the long lights of the staircase window  it was swithin in his ordinary dress and carrying his boots in his hand  when he beheld them standing there so motionless he looked rather disconcerted but came on towards his room  lady constantine was too agitated to speak but louis said i am glad to see you again  hearing a noise a few minutes ago i came out to learn what it could be  i found you absent and we have been very much alarmed  i am very sorry said swithin with contrition  i owe you a hundred apologies but the truth is that on entering my bedroom i found the sky remarkably clear and though i told you that the observation i was to make was of no great consequence on thinking it over alone i felt it ought not to be allowed to pass so i was tempted to run across to the observatory and make it as i had hoped without disturbing anybody  if i had known that i should alarm you i would not have done it for the world  swithin spoke very earnestly to louis and did not observe the tender reproach in viviettes eyes when he showed by his tale his decided notion that the prime use of dark nights lay in their furtherance of practical astronomy  everything being now satisfactorily explained the three retired to their several chambers and louis heard no more noises that night or rather morning his attempts to solve the mystery of viviettes life here and her relations with st cleeve having thus far resulted chiefly in perplexity  true an admission had been wrung from her and even without such an admission it was clear that she had a tender feeling for swithin how to extinguish that romantic folly it now became his object to consider    xxxi   swithins midnight excursion to the tower in the cause of science led him to oversleep himself and when the brother and sister met at breakfast in the morning he did not appear  dont disturb himdont disturb him said louis laconically  hullo viviette what are you reading there that makes you flame up so  she was glancing over a letter that she had just opened and at his words looked up with misgiving  the incident of the previous night left her in great doubt as to what her bearing towards him ought to be  she had made no show of resenting his conduct at the time from a momentary supposition that he must know all her secret and afterwards finding that he did not know it it seemed too late to affect indignation at his suspicions  so she preserved a quiet neutrality  even had she resolved on an artificial part she might have forgotten to play it at this instant the letter being of a kind to banish previous considerations  it is a letter from bishop helmsdale she faltered  well done  i hope for your sake it is an offer  thats just what it is  nosurely said louis beginning a laugh of surprise  yes she returned indifferently  you can read it if you like  i dont wish to pry into a communication of that sort  oh you may read it she said tossing the letter across to him  louis thereupon read as under     the palace melchester    june 28 18     my dear lady constantineduring the two or three weeks that have    elapsed since i experienced the great pleasure of renewing my    acquaintance with you the varied agitation of my feelings has clearly    proved that my only course is to address you by letter and at once    whether the subject of my communication be acceptable to you or not i    can at least assure you that to suppress it would be far less natural    and upon the whole less advisable than to speak out frankly even if    afterwards i hold my peace for ever     the great change in my experience during the past year or twothe    change that is which has resulted from my advancement to a    bishoprichas frequently suggested to me of late that a    discontinuance in my domestic life of the solitude of past years was a    question which ought to be seriously contemplated  but whether i    should ever have contemplated it without the great good fortune of my    meeting with you is doubtful  however the thing has been considered    at last and without more ado i candidly ask if you would be willing    to give up your life at welland and relieve my household loneliness    here by becoming my wife     i am far from desiring to force a hurried decision on your part and    will wait your good pleasure patiently should you feel any    uncertainty at the moment as to the step  i am quite disqualified by    habits and experience for the delightful procedure of urging my suit    in the ardent terms which would be so appropriate towards such a lady    and so expressive of my inmost feeling  in truth a prosy cleric of    fiveandforty wants encouragement to make him eloquent  of this    however i can assure you that if admiration esteem and devotion    can compensate in any way for the lack of those qualities which might    be found to burn with more outward brightness in a younger man those    it is in my power to bestow for the term of my earthly life  your    steady adherence to church principles and your interest in    ecclesiastical polity as was shown by your bright questioning on    those subjects during our morning walk round your grounds have    indicated strongly to me the grace and appropriateness with which you    would fill the position of a bishops wife and how greatly you would    add to his reputation should you be disposed to honour him with your    hand  formerly there have been times when i was of opinionand you    will rightly appreciate my candour in owning itthat a wife was an    impediment to a bishops due activities but constant observation has    convinced me that far from this being the truth a meet consort    infuses life into episcopal influence and teaching     should you reply in the affirmative i will at once come to see you    and with your permission will among other things show you a few    plain practical rules which i have interested myself in drawing up    for our future guidance  should you refuse to change your condition    on my account your decision will as i need hardly say be a great    blow to me  in any event i could not do less than i have done after    giving the subject my full consideration  even if there be a slight    deficiency of warmth on your part my earnest hope is that a mind    comprehensive as yours will perceive the immense power for good that    you might exercise in the position in which a union with me would    place you and allow that perception to weigh in determining your    answer     i remain my dear lady constantine with the highest respect and    affectionyours always     c melchester  well you will not have the foolhardiness to decline now that the question has actually been popped i should hope said louis when he had done reading  certainly i shall she replied  you will really be such a flat viviette  you speak without much compliment  i have not the least idea of accepting him  surely you will not let your infatuation for that young fellow carry you so far after my acquainting you with the shady side of his character you call yourself a religious woman say your prayers out loud follow up the revived methods in church practice and what not and yet you can think with partiality of a person who far from having any religion in him breaks the most elementary commandments in the decalogue  i cannot agree with you she said turning her face askance for she knew not how much of her brothers language was sincere and how much assumed the extent of his discoveries with regard to her secret ties being a mystery  at moments she was disposed to declare the whole truth and have done with it  but she hesitated and left the words unsaid and louis continued his breakfast in silence  when he had finished and she had eaten little or nothing he asked once more how do you intend to answer that letter  here you are the poorest woman in the county abandoned by people who used to be glad to know you and leading a life as dismal and dreary as a nuns when an opportunity is offered you of leaping at once into a leading position in this part of england  bishops are given to hospitality you would be welcomed everywhere  in short your answer must be yes  and yet it will be no she said in a low voice  she had at length learnt from the tone of her brothers latter remarks that at any rate he had no knowledge of her actual marriage whatever indirect ties he might suspect her guilty of  louis could restrain himself no longer at her answer  then conduct your affairs your own way  i know you to be leading a life that wont bear investigation and im hanged if ill stay here any longer  saying which glanville jerked back his chair and strode out of the room  in less than a quarter of an hour and before she had moved a step from the table she heard him leaving the house    xxxii   what to do she could not tell  the step which swithin had entreated her to take objectionable and premature as it had seemed in a county aspect would at all events have saved her from this dilemma  had she allowed him to tell the bishop his simple story in its fulness who could say but that that divine might have generously bridled his own impulses entered into the case with sympathy and forwarded with zest their designs for the future owing to his interest of old in swithins father and in the naturally attractive features of the young mans career  a puff of wind from the open window wafting the bishops letter to the floor aroused her from her reverie  with a sigh she stooped and picked it up glanced at it again then arose and with the deliberateness of inevitable action wrote her reply     welland house june 29 18     my dear bishop of melchesteri confess to you that your letter so    gracious and flattering as it is has taken your friend somewhat    unawares  the least i can do in return for its contents is to reply    as quickly as possible     there is no one in the world who esteems your high qualities more    than myself or who has greater faith in your ability to adorn the    episcopal seat that you have been called on to fill  but to your    question i can give only one reply and that is an unqualified    negative  to state this unavoidable decision distresses me without    affectation and i trust you will believe that though i decline the    distinction of becoming your wife i shall never cease to interest    myself in all that pertains to you and your office and shall feel the    keenest regret if this refusal should operate to prevent a lifelong    friendship between usi am my dear bishop of melchester ever    sincerely yours     viviette constantine  a sudden revulsion from the subterfuge of writing as if she were still a widow wrought in her mind a feeling of dissatisfaction with the whole scheme of concealment and pushing aside the letter she allowed it to remain unfolded and unaddressed  in a few minutes she heard swithin approaching when she put the letter out of the way and turned to receive him  swithin entered quietly and looked round the room  seeing with unexpected pleasure that she was there alone he came over and kissed her  her discomposure at some foregone event was soon obvious  has my staying caused you any trouble he asked in a whisper  where is your brother this morning  she smiled through her perplexity as she took his hand  the oddest things happen to me dear swithin she said  do you wish particularly to know what has happened now  yes if you dont mind telling me  i do mind telling you  but i must  among other things i am resolving to give way to your representationsin part at least  it will be best to tell the bishop everything and my brother if not other people  i am truly glad to hear it viviette said he cheerfully  i have felt for a long time that honesty is the best policy  i at any rate feel it now  but it is a policy that requires a great deal of courage  it certainly requires some couragei should not say a great deal and indeed as far as i am concerned it demands less courage to speak out than to hold my tongue  but you silly boy you dont know what has happened  the bishop has made me an offer of marriage  good gracious what an impertinent old man  what have you done about it dearest  well i have hardly accepted him she replied laughing  it is this event which has suggested to me that i should make my refusal a reason for confiding our situation to him  what would you have done if you had not been already appropriated  thats an inscrutable mystery  he is a worthy man but he has very pronounced views about his own position and some other undesirable qualities  still who knows  you must bless your stars that you have secured me  now let us consider how to draw up our confession to him  i wish i had listened to you at first and allowed you to take him into our confidence before his declaration arrived  he may possibly resent the concealment now  however this cannot be helped  i tell you what viviette said swithin after a thoughtful pause if the bishop is such an earthly sort of man as this a man who goes falling in love and wanting to marry you and so on i am not disposed to confess anything to him at all  i fancied him altogether different from that  but hes none the worse for it dear  i think he isto lecture me and love you all in one breath  still thats only a passing phase and you first proposed making a confidant of him  i did     very well  then we are to tell nobody but the bishop  and my brother louis  i must tell him it is unavoidable  he suspects me in a way i could never have credited of him  swithin as was before stated had arranged to start for greenwich that morning permission having been accorded him by the astronomerroyal to view the observatory and their final decision was that as he could not afford time to sit down with her and write to the bishop in collaboration each should during the day compose a wellconsidered letter disclosing their position from his and her own point of view lady constantine leading up to her confession by her refusal of the bishops hand  it was necessary that she should know what swithin contemplated saying that her statements might precisely harmonize  he ultimately agreed to send her his letter by the next mornings post when having read it she would in due course despatch it with her own  as soon as he had breakfasted swithin went his way promising to return from greenwich by the end of the week  viviette passed the remainder of that long summer day during which her young husband was receding towards the capital in an almost motionless state  at some instants she felt exultant at the idea of announcing her marriage and defying general opinion  at another her heart misgave her and she was tormented by a fear lest swithin should some day accuse her of having hampered his deliberatelyshaped plan of life by her intrusive romanticism  that was often the trick of men who had sealed by marriage in their inexperienced youth a love for those whom their maturer judgment would have rejected as too obviously disproportionate in years  however it was now too late for these lugubrious thoughts and bracing herself she began to frame the new reply to bishop helmsdalethe plain unvarnished tale that was to supplant the undivulging answer first written  she was engaged on this difficult problem till daylight faded in the west and the broadfaced moon edged upwards like a plate of old gold over the elms towards the village  by that time swithin had reached greenwich her brother had gone she knew not whither and she and loneliness dwelt solely as before within the walls of welland house  at this hour of sunset and moonrise the new parlourmaid entered to inform her that mr cecils head clerk from warborne particularly wished to see her  mr cecil was her solicitor and she knew of nothing whatever that required his intervention just at present  but he would not have sent at this time of day without excellent reasons and she directed that the young man might be shown in where she was  on his entry the first thing she noticed was that in his hand he carried a newspaper  in case you should not have seen this evenings paper lady constantine mr cecil has directed me to bring it to you at once on account of what appears there in relation to your ladyship  he has only just seen it himself  what is it  how does it concern me  i will point it out  read it yourself to me  though i am afraid theres not enough light  i can see very well here said the lawyers clerk stepping to the window  folding back the paper he read     news from south africa     cape town may 17 via plymoutha correspondent of the cape    chronicle states that he has interviewed an englishman just arrived    from the interior and learns from him that a considerable    misapprehension exists in england concerning the death of the    traveller and hunter sir blount constantine  o hes living  my husband is alive she cried sinking down in nearly a fainting condition  no my lady  sir blount is dead enough i am sorry to say  dead did you say  certainly lady constantine there is no doubt of it  she sat up and her intense relief almost made itself perceptible like a fresh atmosphere in the room  yes  then what did you come for she asked calmly  that sir blount has died is unquestionable replied the lawyers clerk gently  but there has been some mistake about the date of his death  he died of malarious fever on the banks of the zouga october 24 18  no he only lay ill there a long time it seems  it was a companion who died at that date  but ill read the account to your ladyship with your permission     the decease of this somewhat eccentric wanderer did not occur at the    time hitherto supposed but only in last december  the following is    the account of the englishman alluded to given as nearly as possible    in his own words during the illness of sir blount and his friend by    the zouga three of the servants went away taking with them a portion    of his clothing and effects and it must be they who spread the report    of his death at this time  after his companions death he mended and    when he was strong enough he and i travelled on to a healthier    district  i urged him not to delay his return to england but he was    much against going back there again and became so rough in his manner    towards me that we parted company at the first opportunity i could    find  i joined a party of white traders returning to the west coast    i stayed here among the portuguese for many months  i then found that    an english travelling party were going to explore a district adjoining    that which i had formerly traversed with sir blount  they said they    would be glad of my services and i joined them  when we had crossed    the territory to the south of ulunda and drew near to marzambo i    heard tidings of a man living there whom i suspected to be sir blount    although he was not known by that name  being so near i was induced    to seek him out and found that he was indeed the same  he had    dropped his old name altogether and had married a native princess  married a native princess said lady constantine  thats what it says my ladymarried a native princess according to the rites of the tribe and was living very happily with her  he told me he should never return to england again  he also told me that having seen this princess just after i had left him he had been attracted by her and had thereupon decided to reside with her in that country as being a land which afforded him greater happiness than he could hope to attain elsewhere  he asked me to stay with him instead of going on with my party and not reveal his real title to any of them  after some hesitation i did stay and was not uncomfortable at first  but i soon found that sir blount drank much harder now than when i had known him and that he was at times very greatly depressed in mind at his position one morning in the middle of december last i heard a shot from his dwelling  his wife rushed frantically past me as i hastened to the spot and when i entered i found that he had put an end to himself with his revolver  his princess was brokenhearted all that day  when we had buried him i discovered in his house a little box directed to his solicitors at warborne in england and a note for myself saying that i had better get the first chance of returning that offered and requesting me to take the box with me  it is supposed to contain papers and articles for friends in england who have deemed him dead for some time  the clerk stopped his reading and there was a silence  the middle of last december she at length said in a whisper  has the box arrived yet  not yet my lady  we have no further proof of anything  as soon as the package comes to hand you shall know of it immediately  such was the clerks mission and leaving the paper with her he withdrew  the intelligence amounted to thus much that sir blount having been alive till at least six weeks after her marriage with swithin st cleeve swithin st cleeve was not her husband in the eye of the law that she would have to consider how her marriage with the latter might be instantly repeated to establish herself legally as that young mans wife    xxxiii   next morning viviette received a visit from mr cecil himself  he informed her that the box spoken of by the servant had arrived quite unexpectedly just after the departure of his clerk on the previous evening  there had not been sufficient time for him to thoroughly examine it as yet but he had seen enough to enable him to state that it contained letters dated memoranda in sir blounts handwriting notes referring to events which had happened later than his supposed death and other irrefragable proofs that the account in the newspapers was correct as to the main factthe comparatively recent date of sir blounts decease  she looked up and spoke with the irresponsible helplessness of a child  on reviewing the circumstances i cannot think how i could have allowed myself to believe the first tidings she said  everybody else believed them and why should you not have done so said the lawyer  how came the will to be permitted to be proved as there could after all have been no complete evidence she asked  if i had been the executrix i would not have attempted it  as i was not i know very little about how the business was pushed through  in a very unseemly way i think  well no said mr cecil feeling himself morally called upon to defend legal procedure from such imputations  it was done in the usual way in all cases where the proof of death is only presumptive  the evidence such as it was was laid before the court by the applicants your husbands cousins and the servants who had been with him deposed to his death with a particularity that was deemed sufficient  their error was not that somebody diedfor somebody did die at the time affirmedbut that they mistook one person for another the person who died being not sir blount constantine  the court was of opinion that the evidence led up to a reasonable inference that the deceased was actually sir blount and probate was granted on the strength of it  as there was a doubt about the exact day of the month the applicants were allowed to swear that he died on or after the date last given of his existencewhich in spite of their error then has really come true now of course  they little think what they have done to me by being so ready to swear she murmured  mr cecil supposing her to allude only to the pecuniary straits in which she had been prematurely placed by the will taking effect a year before its due time said true  it has been to your ladyships loss and to their gain  but they will make ample restitution no doubt and all will be wound up satisfactorily  lady constantine was far from explaining that this was not her meaning and after some further conversation of a purely technical nature mr cecil left her presence  when she was again unencumbered with the necessity of exhibiting a proper bearing the sense that she had greatly suffered in pocket by the undue haste of the executors weighed upon her mind with a pressure quite inappreciable beside the greater gravity of her personal position  what was her position as legatee to her situation as a woman  her face crimsoned with a flush which she was almost ashamed to show to the daylight as she hastily penned the following note to swithin at greenwichcertainly one of the most informal documents she had ever written     welland thursday     o swithin my dear swithin what i have to tell you is so sad and so    humiliating that i can hardly write itand yet i must  though we are    dearer to each other than all the world besides and as firmly united    as if we were one i am not legally your wife  sir blount did not die    till some time after we in england supposed  the service must be    repeated instantly  i have not been able to sleep all night  i feel    so frightened and ashamed that i can scarcely arrange my thoughts  the    newspapers sent with this will explain if you have not seen    particulars  do come to me as soon as you can that we may consult on    what to do  burn this at once     your viviette  when the note was despatched she remembered that there was another hardly less important question to be answeredthe proposal of the bishop for her hand  his communication had sunk into nothingness beside the momentous news that had so greatly distressed her  the two replies lay before herthe one she had first written simply declining to become dr helmsdales wife without giving reasons the second which she had elaborated with so much care on the previous day relating in confidential detail the history of her love for swithin their secret marriage and their hopes for the future asking his advice on what their procedure should be to escape the strictures of a censorious world  it was the letter she had barely finished writing when mr cecils clerk announced news tantamount to a declaration that she was no wife at all  this epistle she now destroyedand with the less reluctance in knowing that swithin had been somewhat averse to the confession as soon as he found that bishop helmsdale was also a victim to tender sentiment concerning her  the first in which at the time of writing the suppressio veri was too strong for her conscience had now become an honest letter and sadly folding it she sent the missive on its way  the sense of her undefinable position kept her from much repose on the second night also but the following morning brought an unexpected letter from swithin written about the same hour as hers to him and it comforted her much  he had seen the account in the papers almost as soon as it had come to her knowledge and sent this line to reassure her in the perturbation she must naturally feel  she was not to be alarmed at all  they two were husband and wife in moral intent and antecedent belief and the legal flaw which accident had so curiously uncovered could be mended in halfan hour  he would return on saturday night at latest but as the hour would probably be far advanced he would ask her to meet him by slipping out of the house to the tower any time during service on sunday morning when there would be few persons about likely to observe them  meanwhile he might provisionally state that their best course in the emergency would be instead of confessing to anybody that there had already been a solemnization of marriage between them to arrange their remarriage in as open a manner as possibleas if it were the justreached climax of a sudden affection instead of a harking back to an old departureprefacing it by a public announcement in the usual way  this plan of approaching their second union with all the show and circumstance of a new thing recommended itself to her strongly but for one objectionthat by such a course the wedding could not without appearing like an act of unseemly haste take place so quickly as she desired for her own moral satisfaction  it might take place somewhat early say in the course of a month or two without bringing down upon her the charge of levity for sir blount a notoriously unkind husband had been out of her sight four years and in his grave nearly one  but what she naturally desired was that there should be no more delay than was positively necessary for obtaining a new licensetwo or three days at longest and in view of this celerity it was next to impossible to make due preparation for a wedding of ordinary publicity performed in her own church from her own house with a feast and amusements for the villagers a tea for the school children a bonfire and other of those proclamatory accessories which by meeting wonder halfway deprive it of much of its intensity  it must be admitted too that she even now shrank from the shock of surprise that would inevitably be caused by her openly taking for husband such a mere youth of no position as swithin still appeared notwithstanding that in years he was by this time within a trifle of oneandtwenty  the straightforward course had nevertheless so much to recommend it so well avoided the disadvantage of future revelation which a private repetition of the ceremony would entail that assuming she could depend upon swithin as she knew she could do good sense counselled its serious consideration  she became more composed at her queer situation hour after hour passed and the first spasmodic impulse of womanly decorumnot to let the sun go down upon her present improper statewas quite controllable  she could regard the strange contingency that had arisen with something like philosophy  the day slipped by she thought of the awkwardness of the accident rather than of its humiliation and loving swithin now in a far calmer spirit than at that past date when they had rushed into each others arms and vowed to be one for the first time she ever and anon caught herself reflecting were it not that for my honours sake i must remarry him i should perhaps be a nobler woman in not allowing him to encumber his bright future by a union with me at all  this thought at first artificially raised as little more than a mental exercise became by stages a genuine conviction and while her heart enforced her reason regretted the necessity of abstaining from selfsacrificethe being obliged despite his curious escape from the first attempt to lime swithins young wings again solely for her credits sake  however the deed had to be done swithin was to be made legally hers selfishness in a conjuncture of this sort was excusable and even obligatory  taking brighter views she hoped that upon the whole this yoking of the young fellow with her a portionless woman and his senior would not greatly endanger his career  in such a mood night overtook her and she went to bed conjecturing that swithin had by this time arrived in the parish was perhaps even at that moment passing homeward beneath her walls and that in less than twelve hours she would have met him have ventilated the secret which oppressed her and have satisfactorily arranged with him the details of their reunion    xxxiv   sunday morning came and complicated her previous emotions by bringing a new and unexpected shock to mingle with them  the postman had delivered among other things an illustrated newspaper sent by a hand she did not recognize and on opening the cover the sheet that met her eyes filled her with a horror which she could not express  the print was one which drew largely on its imagination for its engravings and it already contained an illustration of the death of sir blount constantine  in this work of art he was represented as standing with his pistol to his mouth his brains being in process of flying up to the roof of his chamber and his native princess rushing terrorstricken away to a remote position in the thicket of palms which neighboured the dwelling  the crude realism of the picture possibly harmless enough in its effect upon others overpowered and sickened her  by a curious fascination she would look at it again and again till every line of the engravers performance seemed really a transcript from what had happened before his eyes  with such details fresh in her thoughts she was going out of the door to make arrangements for confirming by repetition her marriage with another  no interval was available for serious reflection on the tragedy or for allowing the softening effects of time to operate in her mind  it was as though her first husband had died that moment and she was keeping an appointment with another in the presence of his corpse  so revived was the actuality of sir blounts recent life and death by this incident that the distress of her personal relations with swithin was the single force in the world which could have coerced her into abandoning to him the interval she would fain have set apart for getting over these new and painful impressions  selfpity for illusage afforded her good reasons for ceasing to love sir blount but he was yet too closely intertwined with her past life to be destructible on the instant as a memory  but there was no choice of occasions for her now and she steadily waited for the church bells to cease chiming  at last all was silent the surrounding cottagers had gathered themselves within the walls of the adjacent building  tabitha larks first voluntary then droned from the tower window and lady constantine left the garden in which she had been loitering and went towards ringshill speer  the sense of her situation obscured the morning prospect  the country was unusually silent under the intensifying sun the songless season of birds having just set in  choosing her path amid the efts that were basking upon the outer slopes of the plantation she wound her way up the treeshrouded camp to the wooden cabin in the centre  the door was ajar but on entering she found the place empty  the tower door was also partly open and listening at the foot of the stairs she heard swithin above shifting the telescope and wheeling round the rumbling dome apparently in preparation for the next nocturnal reconnoitre  there was no doubt that he would descend in a minute or two to look for her and not wishing to interrupt him till he was ready she reentered the cabin where she patiently seated herself among the books and papers that lay scattered about  she did as she had often done before when waiting there for him that is she occupied her moments in turning over the papers and examining the progress of his labours  the notes were mostly astronomical of course and she had managed to keep sufficiently abreast of him to catch the meaning of a good many of these  the litter on the table however was somewhat more marked this morning than usual as if it had been hurriedly overhauled  among the rest of the sheets lay an open note and in the entire confidence that existed between them she glanced over and read it as a matter of course  it was a most businesslike communication and beyond the address and date contained only the following words     dear sirwe beg leave to draw your attention to a letter we    addressed to you on the 26th ult to which we have not yet been    favoured with a reply  as the time for payment of the first moiety of    the six hundred pounds per annum settled on you by your late uncle is    now at hand we should be obliged by your giving directions as to    where and in what manner the money is to be handed over to you and    shall also be glad to receive any other definite instructions from you    with regard to the futurewe are dear sir yours faithfully     hanner and rawles     swithin st cleeve esq  an income of six hundred a year for swithin whom she had hitherto understood to be possessed of an annuity of eighty pounds at the outside with no prospect of increasing the sum but by hard work  what could this communication mean  he whose custom and delight it was to tell her all his heart had breathed not a syllable of this matter to her though it met the very difficulty towards which their discussions invariably tendedhow to secure for him a competency that should enable him to establish his pursuits on a wider basis and throw himself into more direct communion with the scientific world  quite bewildered by the lack of any explanation she rose from her seat and with the note in her hand ascended the winding towersteps  reaching the upper aperture she perceived him under the dome moving musingly about as if he had never been absent an hour his light hair frilling out from under the edge of his velvet skullcap as it was always wont to do  no question of marriage seemed to be disturbing the mind of this juvenile husband of hers  the primum mobile of his gravitation was apparently the equatorial telescope which she had given him and which he was carefully adjusting by means of screws and clamps  hearing her movements he turned his head  o here you are my dear viviette  i was just beginning to expect you he exclaimed coming forward  i ought to have been looking out for you but i have found a little defect here in the instrument and i wanted to set it right before evening comes on  as a rule it is not a good thing to tinker your glasses but i have found that the diffractionrings are not perfect circles  i learnt at greenwich how to correct themso kind they have been to me thereand so i have been loosening the screws and gently shifting the glass till i think that i have at last made the illumination equal all round  i have so much to tell you about my visit one thing is that the astronomical world is getting quite excited about the coming transit of venus  there is to be a regular expedition fitted out  how i should like to join it  he spoke enthusiastically and with eyes sparkling at the mental image of the said expedition and as it was rather gloomy in the dome he rolled it round on its axis till the shuttered slit for the telescope directly faced the morning sun which thereupon flooded the concave interior touching the bright metalwork of the equatorial and lighting up her pale troubled face  but swithin she faltered my letter to youour marriage  o yes this marriage question he added  i had not forgotten it dear vivietteor at least only for a few minutes  can you forget it swithin for a moment  o how can you she said reproachfully  it is such a distressing thing  it drives away all my rest  forgotten is not the word i should have used he apologized temporarily dismissed it from my mind is all i meant  the simple fact is that the vastness of the field of astronomy reduces every terrestrial thing to atomic dimensions  do not trouble dearest  the remedy is quite easy as i stated in my letter  we can now be married in a prosy public way  yes early or latenext week next month six months hencejust as you choose  say the word when and i will obey  the absence of all anxiety or consternation from his face contrasted strangely with hers which at last he saw and looking at the writing she held inquired  but what paper have you in your hand  a letter which to me is actually inexplicable said she her curiosity returning to the letter and overriding for the instant her immediate concerns  what does this income of six hundred a year mean  why have you never told me about it dear swithin or does it not refer to you  he looked at the note flushed slightly and was absolutely unable to begin his reply at once  i did not mean you to see that viviette he murmured  why not  i thought you had better not as it does not concern me further now  the solicitors are labouring under a mistake in supposing that it does  i have to write at once and inform them that the annuity is not mine to receive  what a strange mystery in your life she said forcing a perplexed smile  something to balance the tragedy in mine  i am absolutely in the dark as to your past history it seems  and yet i had thought you told me everything  i could not tell you that viviette because it would have endangered our relationsthough not in the way you may suppose  you would have reproved me  you who are so generous and noble would have forbidden me to do what i did and i was determined not to be forbidden  to do what  to marry you  why should i have forbidden  must i tellwhat i would not he said placing his hands upon her arms and looking somewhat sadly at her  well perhaps as it has come to this you ought to know all since it can make no possible difference to my intentions now  we are one for everlegal blunders notwithstanding for happily they are quickly reparableand this question of a devise from my uncle jocelyn only concerned me when i was a single man  thereupon with obviously no consideration of the possibilities that were reopened of the nullity of their marriage contract he related in detail and not without misgiving for having concealed them so long the events that had occurred on the morning of their weddingday how he had met the postman on his way to warborne after dressing in the cabin and how he had received from him the letter his dead uncle had confided to his family lawyers informing him of the annuity and of the important request attachedthat he should remain unmarried until his fiveandtwentieth year how in comparison with the possession of her dear self he had reckoned the income as nought abandoned all idea of it there and then and had come on to the wedding as if nothing had happened to interrupt for a moment the working out of their plan how he had scarcely thought with any closeness of the circumstances of the case since until reminded of them by this note she had seen and a previous one of a like sort received from the same solicitors  o swithin swithin she cried bursting into tears as she realized it all and sinking on the observingchair i have ruined you yes i have ruined you  the young man was dismayed by her unexpected grief and endeavoured to soothe her but she seemed touched by a poignant remorse which would not be comforted  and now she continued as soon as she could speak when you are once more free and in a positionactually in a position to claim the annuity that would be the making of you i am compelled to come to you and beseech you to undo yourself again merely to save me  not to save you viviette but to bless me  you do not ask me to re marry it is not a question of alternatives at all it is my straight course  i do not dream of doing otherwise  i should be wretched if you thought for one moment i could entertain the idea of doing otherwise  but the more he said the worse he made the matter  it was a state of affairs that would not bear discussion at all and the unsophisticated view he took of his course seemed to increase her responsibility  why did your uncle attach such a cruel condition to his bounty she cried bitterly  o he little thinks how hard he hits me from the graveme who have never done him wrong and you too  swithin are you sure that he makes that condition indispensable  perhaps he meant that you should not marry beneath you perhaps he did not mean to object in such a case as your marrying forgive me for saying it a little above you  there is no doubt that he did not contemplate a case which has led to such happiness as this has done the youth murmured with hesitation for though he scarcely remembered a word of his uncles letter of advice he had a dim apprehension that it was couched in terms alluding specifically to lady constantine  are you sure you cannot retain the money and be my lawful husband too she asked piteously  o what a wrong i am doing you  i did not dream that it could be as bad as this  i knew i was wasting your time by letting you love me and hampering your projects but i thought there were compensating advantages  this wrecking of your future at my hands i did not contemplate  you are sure there is no escape  have you his letter with the conditions or the will  let me see the letter in which he expresses his wishes  i assure you it is all as i say he pensively returned  even if i were not legally bound by the conditions i should be morally  but how does he put it  how does he justify himself in making such a harsh restriction  do let me see the letter swithin  i shall think it a want of confidence if you do not  i may discover some way out of the difficulty if you let me look at the papers  eccentric wills can be evaded in all sorts of ways  still he hesitated  i would rather you did not see the papers he said  but she persisted as only a fond woman can  her conviction was that she who as a woman many years his senior should have shown her love for him by guiding him straight into the paths he aimed at had blocked his attempted career for her own happiness  this made her more intent than ever to find out a device by which while she still retained him he might also retain the lifeinterest under his uncles will  her entreaties were at length too potent for his resistance  accompanying her downstairs to the cabin he opened the desk from which the other papers had been taken and against his better judgment handed her the ominous communication of jocelyn st cleeve which lay in the envelope just as it had been received threequarters of a year earlier  dont read it now he said  dont spoil our meeting by entering into a subject which is virtually past and done with  take it with you and look it over at your leisuremerely as an old curiosity remember and not as a still operative document  i have almost forgotten what the contents are beyond the general advice and stipulation that i was to remain a bachelor  at any rate she rejoined do not reply to the note i have seen from the solicitors till i have read this also  he promised  but now about our public wedding he said  like certain royal personages we shall have had the religious rite and the civil contract performed on independent occasions  will you fix the day  when is it to be and shall it take place at a registrars office since there is no necessity for having the sacred part over again  ill think replied she  ill think it over  and let me know as soon as you can how you decide to proceed  i will write tomorrow or come  i do not know what to say now  i cannot forget how i am wronging you  this is almost more than i can bear  to divert her mind he began talking about greenwich observatory and the great instruments therein and how he had been received by the astronomers and the details of the expedition to observe the transit of venus together with many other subjects of the sort to which she had not power to lend her attention  i must reach home before the people are out of church she at length said wearily  i wish nobody to know i have been out this morning  and forbidding swithin to cross into the open in her company she left him on the edge of the isolated plantation which had latterly known her tread so well    xxxv   lady constantine crossed the field and the park beyond and found on passing the church that the congregation was still within  there was no hurry for getting indoors the open windows enabling her to hear that mr torkingham had only just given out his text  so instead of entering the house she went through the gardendoor to the old bowlinggreen and sat down in the arbour that louis had occupied when he overheard the interview between swithin and the bishop  not until then did she find courage to draw out the letter and papers relating to the bequest which swithin in a critical moment had handed to her  had he been ever so little older he would not have placed that unconsidered confidence in viviette which had led him to give way to her curiosity  but the influence over him which eight or nine outnumbering years lent her was immensely increased by her higher position and wider experiences and he had yielded the point as he yielded all social points while the same conditions exempted him from any deep consciousness that it was his duty to protect her even from herself  the preamble of dr st cleeves letter in which he referred to his pleasure at hearing of the young mans promise as an astronomer disturbed her not at allindeed somewhat prepossessed her in favour of the old gentleman who had written it  the first item of what he called unfavourable news namely the allusion to the inadequacy of swithins income to the wants of a scientific man whose lines of work were not calculated to produce pecuniary emolument for many years deepened the cast of her face to concern  she reached the second item of the socalled unfavourable news and her face flushed as she read how the doctor had learnt that there was something in your path worse than narrow means and that something is a woman  to save you if possible from ruin on these heads she read on i take the preventive measures entailed below  and then followed the announcement of the 600 pounds a year settled on the youth for life on the single condition that he remained unmarried till the age of twentyfivejust as swithin had explained to her  she next learnt that the bequest was for a definite objectthat he might have resources sufficient to enable him to travel in an inexpensive way and begin a study of the southern constellations which according to the shrewd old mans judgment were a mine not so thoroughly worked as the northern and therefore to be recommended  this was followed by some sentences which hit her in the face like a switch  the only other preventive step in my power is that of exhortation    swithin st cleeve dont make a fool of yourself as your father did  if your studies are to be worth anything believe me they must be carried on without the help of a woman  avoid her and every one of the sex if you mean to achieve any worthy thing  eschew all of that sort for many a year yet  moreover i say the lady of your acquaintance avoid in particular     she has in addition to her original disqualification as a companion for you that is that of sex these two special drawbacks she is much older than yourself  lady constantines indignant flush forsook her and pale despair succeeded in its stead  alas it was true  handsome and in her prime she might be but she was too old for swithin  and she is so impoverished     beyond this frankly i dont think well of her  i dont think well of any woman who dotes upon a man younger than herself     to care to be the first fancy of a young fellow like you shows no great common sense in her  if she were worth her salt she would have too much pride to be intimate with a youth in your unassured position to say no more  viviettes face by this time tingled hot again  she is old enough to know that a liaison with her may and almost certainly would be your ruin and on the other hand that a marriage would be preposterousunless she is a complete fool and in that case there is even more reason for avoiding her than if she were in her few senses  a woman of honourable feeling nephew would be careful to do nothing to hinder you in your career as this putting of herself in your way most certainly will  yet i hear that she professes a great anxiety on this same future of yours as a physicist  the best way in which she can show the reality of her anxiety is by leaving you to yourself  leaving him to himself  she paled again as if chilled by a conviction that in this the old man was right  shell blab your most secret plans and theories to every one of her acquaintance and make you appear ridiculous by announcing them before they are matured  if you attempt to study with a woman youll be ruled by her to entertain fancies instead of theories aircastles instead of intentions qualms instead of opinions sickly prepossessions instead of reasoned conclusions     an experienced woman waking a young mans passions just at a moment when he is endeavouring to shine intellectually is doing little less than committing a crime        thus much the letter and it was enough for her indeed  the flushes of indignation which had passed over her as she gathered this mans opinion of herself combined with flushes of grief and shame when she considered that swithinher dear swithinwas perfectly acquainted with this cynical view of her nature that reject it as he might and as he unquestionably did such thoughts of her had been implanted in him and lay in him  stifled as they were they lay in him like seeds too deep for germination which accident might some day bring near the surface and aerate into life  the humiliation of such a possibility was almost too much to endure the mortificationshe had known nothing like it till now  but this was not all  there succeeded a feeling in comparison with which resentment and mortification were happy moodsa miserable conviction that this old man who spoke from the grave was not altogether wrong in his speaking that he was only half wrong that he was perhaps virtually right  only those persons who are by nature affected with that ready esteem for others positions which induces an undervaluing of their own fully experience the deep smart of such convictions against selfthe wish for annihilation that is engendered in the moment of despair at feeling that at length we our best and firmest friend cease to believe in our cause  viviette could hear the people coming out of church on the other side of the garden wall  their footsteps and their cheerful voices died away the bell rang for lunch and she went in  but her life during that morning and afternoon was wholly introspective  knowing the full circumstances of his situation as she knew them nowas she had never before known themought she to make herself the legal wife of swithin st cleeve and so secure her own honour at any price to him such was the formidable question which lady constantine propounded to her startled understanding  as a subjectively honest woman alone beginning her charity at home there was no doubt that she ought  save thyself was sound old testament doctrine and not altogether discountenanced in the new  but was there a line of conduct which transcended mere selfpreservation and would it not be an excellent thing to put it in practice now  that she had wronged st cleeve by marrying himthat she would wrong him infinitely more by completing the marriagethere was in her opinion no doubt  she in her experience had sought out him in his inexperience and had led him like a child  she rememberedas if it had been her fault though it was in fact only her misfortunethat she had been the one to go for the license and take up residence in the parish in which they were wedded  he was now just oneandtwenty  without her he had all the world before him six hundred a year and leave to cut as straight a road to fame as he should choose with her this story was negatived  no money from his uncle no power of advancement but a bondage with a woman whose disparity of years though immaterial just now would operate in the future as a wet blanket upon his social ambitions and that content with life as it was which she had noticed more than once in him latterly a content imperilling his scientific spirit by abstracting his zeal for progress  it was impossible in short to blind herself to the inference that marriage with her had not benefited him  matters might improve in the future but to take upon herself the whole liability of swithins life as she would do by depriving him of the help his uncle had offered was a fearful responsibility  how could she an unendowed woman replace such assistance  his recent visit to greenwich which had momentarily revived that zest for his pursuit that was now less constant than heretofore should by rights be supplemented by other such expeditions  it would be true benevolence not to deprive him of means to continue them so as to keep his ardour alive regardless of the cost to herself  it could be done  by the extraordinary favour of a unique accident she had now an opportunity of redeeming swithins seriously compromised future and restoring him to a state no worse than his first  his annuity could be enjoyed by him his travels undertaken his studies pursued his high vocation initiated by one little sacrificethat of herself  she only had to refuse to legalize their marriage to part from him for ever and all would be well with him thenceforward  the pain to him would after all be but slight whatever it might be to his wretched viviette  the ineptness of retaining him at her side lay not only in the fact itself of injury to him but in the likelihood of his living to see it as such and reproaching her for selfishness in not letting him go in this unprecedented opportunity for correcting a move proved to be false  he wished to examine the southern heavensperhaps his uncles letter was the father of the wishand there was no telling what good might not result to mankind at large from his exploits there  why should she to save her narrow honour waste the wide promise of his ability  that in immolating herself by refusing him and leaving him free to work wonders for the good of his fellowcreatures she would in all probability add to the sum of human felicity consoled her by its breadth as an idea even while it tortured her by making herself the scapegoat or single unit on whom the evil would fall  ought a possibly large number swithin included to remain unbenefited because the one individual to whom his release would be an injury chanced to be herself  love between man and woman which in homer moses and other early exhibitors of life is mere desire had for centuries past so far broadened as to include sympathy and friendship surely it should in this advanced stage of the world include benevolence also  if so it was her duty to set her young man free  thus she laboured with a generosity more worthy even than its object to sink her love for her own decorum in devotion to the world in general and to swithin in particular  to counsel her activities by her understanding rather than by her emotions as usual was hard work for a tender woman but she strove hard and made advance  the selfcentred attitude natural to one in her situation was becoming displaced by the sympathetic attitude which though it had to be artificially fostered at first gave her by degrees a certain sweet sense that she was rising above selflove  that maternal element which had from time to time evinced itself in her affection for the youth and was imparted by her superior ripeness in experience and years appeared now again as she drew nearer the resolve not to secure propriety in her own social condition at the expense of this youths earthly utility  unexpectedly grand fruits are sometimes forced forth by harsh pruning the illiberal letter of swithins uncle was suggesting to lady constantine an altruism whose thoroughness would probably have amazed that queer old gentleman into a withdrawal of the conditions that had induced it  to love st cleeve so far better than herself as this was to surpass the love of women as conventionally understood and as mostly existing  before however clinching her decision by any definite step she worried her little brain by devising every kind of ingenious scheme in the hope of lighting on one that might show her how that decision could be avoided with the same good result  but to secure for him the advantages offered and to retain him likewise reflection only showed it to be impossible  yet to let him go for ever was more than she could endure and at length she jumped at an idea which promised some sort of improvement on that design  she would propose that reunion should not be entirely abandoned but simply postponednamely till after his twentyfifth birthdaywhen he might be her husband without at any rate the loss to him of the income  by this time he would approximate to a mans full judgment and that painful aspect of her as one who had deluded his raw immaturity would have passed for ever  the plan somewhat appeased her disquieted honour  to let a marriage sink into abeyance for four or five years was not to nullify it and though she would leave it to him to move its substantiation at the end of that time without present stipulations she had not much doubt upon the issue  the clock struck five  this silent mental debate had occupied her whole afternoon  perhaps it would not have ended now but for an unexpected incidentthe entry of her brother louis  he came into the room where she was sitting or rather writhing and after a few words to explain how he had got there and about the mistake in the date of sir blounts death he walked up close to her  his next remarks were apologetic in form but in essence they were bitterness itself  viviette he said i am sorry for my hasty words to you when i last left this house  i readily withdraw them  my suspicions took a wrong direction  i think now that i know the truth  you have been even madder than i supposed  in what way she asked distantly  i lately thought that unhappy young man was only your toofavoured lover  you thought wrong he is not  he is noti believe youfor he is more  i now am persuaded that he is your lawful husband  can you deny it  i can  on your sacred word  on my sacred word he is not that either  thank heaven for that assurance said louis exhaling a breath of relief  i was not so positive as i pretended to bebut i wanted to know the truth of this mystery  since you are not fettered to him in that way i care nothing  louis turned away and that afforded her an opportunity for leaving the room  those few words were the last grains that had turned the balance and settled her doom  she would let swithin go  all the voices in her world seemed to clamour for that consummation  the mornings mortification the afternoons benevolence and the evenings instincts of evasion had joined to carry the point  accordingly she sat down and wrote to swithin a summary of the thoughts above detailed  we shall separate she concluded  you to obey your uncles orders and explore the southern skies i to wait as one who can implicitly trust you  do not see me again till the years have expired  you will find me still the same  i am your wife through all time the letter of the law is not needed to reassert it at present while the absence of the letter secures your fortune  nothing can express what it cost lady constantine to marshal her arguments but she did it and vanquished selfcomfort by a sense of the general expediency  it may unhesitatingly be affirmed that the only ignoble reason which might have dictated such a step was nonexistent that is to say a serious decline in her affection  tenderly she had loved the youth at first and tenderly she loved him now as time and her afterconduct proved  women the most delicate get used to strange moral situations  eve probably regained her normal sweet composure about a week after the fall on first learning of her anomalous position lady constantine had blushed hot and her pure instincts had prompted her to legalize her marriage without a moments delay  heaven and earth were to be moved at once to effect it  day after day had passed her union had remained unsecured and the idea of its nullity had gradually ceased to be strange to her till it became of little account beside her bold resolve for the young mans sake    xxxvi   the immediate effect upon st cleeve of the receipt of her wellreasoned argument for retrocession was naturally a bitter attack upon himself for having been guilty of such cruel carelessness as to leave in her way the lawyers letter that had first made her aware of his uncles provision for him  immature as he was he could realize viviettes position sufficiently well to perceive what the poor lady must suffer at having suddenly thrust upon her the responsibility of repairing her own situation as a wife by ruining his as a legatee  true it was by the purest inadvertence that his pending sacrifice of means had been discovered but he should have taken special pains to render such a mishap impossible  if on the first occasion when a revelation might have been made with impunity he would not put it in the power of her good nature to relieve his position by refusing him he should have shown double care not to do so now when she could not exercise that benevolence without the loss of honour  with a young mans inattention to issues he had not considered how sharp her feelings as a woman must be in this contingency  it had seemed the easiest thing in the world to remedy the defect in their marriage and therefore nothing to be anxious about  and in his innocence of any thought of appropriating the bequest by taking advantage of the loophole in his matrimonial bond he undervalued the importance of concealing the existence of that bequest  the looming fear of unhappiness between them revived in swithin the warm emotions of their earlier acquaintance  almost before the sun had set he hastened to welland house in search of her  the air was disturbed by stiff summer blasts productive of windfalls and premature descents of leafage  it was an hour when unripe apples shower down in orchards and unbrowned chestnuts descend in their husks upon the park glades  there was no help for it this afternoon but to call upon her in a direct manner regardless of suspicions  he was thunderstruck when while waiting in the full expectation of being admitted to her presence the answer brought back to him was that she was unable to see him  this had never happened before in the whole course of their acquaintance but he knew what it meant and turned away with a vague disquietude  he did not know that lady constantine was just above his head listening to his movements with the liveliest emotions and while praying for him to go longing for him to insist on seeing her and spoil all  but the faintest symptom being always sufficient to convince him of having blundered he unwittingly took her at her word and went rapidly away  however he called again the next day and she having gained strength by one victory over herself was enabled to repeat her refusal with greater ease  knowing this to be the only course by which her point could be maintained she clung to it with strenuous and religious pertinacity  thus immured and selfcontrolling she passed a week  her brother though he did not live in the house preferring the nearest wateringplace at this time of the year was continually coming there and one day he happened to be present when she denied herself to swithin for the third time  louis who did not observe the tears in her eyes was astonished and delighted she was coming to her senses at last  believing now that there had been nothing more between them than a tooplainly shown partiality on her part he expressed his commendation of her conduct to her face  at this instead of owning to its advantage also her tears burst forth outright  not knowing what to make of this louis said  well i am simply upholding you in your course  yes yes i know it she cried  and it is my deliberately chosen course  i wish heswithin st cleevewould go on his travels at once and leave the place  six hundred a year has been left him for travel and study of the southern constellations and i wish he would use it  you might represent the advantage to him of the course if you cared to  louis thought he could do no better than let swithin know this as soon as possible  accordingly when st cleeve was writing in the hut the next day he heard the crackle of footsteps over the firneedles outside and jumped up supposing them to be hers but to his disappointment it was her brother who appeared at the door  excuse my invading the hermitage st cleeve he said in his careless way but i have heard from my sister of your good fortune  my good fortune  yes in having an opportunity for roving and with a travellers conceit i couldnt help coming to give you the benefit of my experience  when do you start  i have not formed any plan as yet  indeed i had not quite been thinking of going  louis stared  not going  then i may have been misinformed  what i have heard is that a good uncle has kindly bequeathed you a sufficient income to make a second isaac newton of you if you only use it as he directs  swithin breathed quickly but said nothing  if you have not decided so to make use of it let me implore you as your friend and one nearly old enough to be your father to decide at once  such a chance does not happen to a scientific youth once in a century  thank you for your good advicefor it is good in itself i know said swithin in a low voice  but has lady constantine spoken of it at all  she thinks as i do  she has spoken to you on the subject  certainly  more than that it is at her requestthough i did not intend to say sothat i come to speak to you about it now  frankly and plainly said swithin his voice trembling with a compound of scientific and amatory emotion that defies definition does she say seriously that she wishes me to go  she does  then go i will replied swithin firmly  i have been fortunate enough to interest some leading astronomers including the astronomer royal and in a letter received this morning i learn that the use of the cape observatory has been offered me for any southern observations i may wish to make  this offer i will accept  will you kindly let lady constantine know this since she is interested in my welfare  louis promised and when he was gone swithin looked blankly at his own situation as if he could scarcely believe in its reality  her letter to him then had been deliberately written she meant him to go  but he was determined that none of those misunderstandings which ruin the happiness of lovers should be allowed to operate in the present case  he would see her if he slept under her walls all night to do it and would hear the order to depart from her own lips  this unexpected stand she was making for his interests was winning his admiration to such a degree as to be in danger of defeating the very cause it was meant to subserve a woman like this was not to be forsaken in a hurry  he wrote two lines and left the note at the house with his own hand     the cabin ringshill    july 7th     dearest vivietteif you insist i will go  but letterwriting will    not do  i must have the command from your own two lips otherwise i    shall not stir  i am here every evening at seven  can you comes  this note as fate would have it reached her hands in the single hour of that week when she was in a mood to comply with his request just when moved by a reactionary emotion after dismissing swithin  she went upstairs to the window that had so long served purposes of this kind and signalled yes  st cleeve soon saw the answer she had given and watched her approach from the tower as the sunset drew on  the vivid circumstances of his life at this date led him ever to remember the external scenes in which they were set  it was an evening of exceptional irradiations and the west heaven gleamed like a foundry of all metals common and rare  the clouds were broken into a thousand fragments and the margin of every fragment shone  foreseeing the disadvantage and pain to her of maintaining a resolve under the pressure of a meeting he vowed not to urge her by word or sign to put the question plainly and calmly and to discuss it on a reasonable basis only like the philosophers they assumed themselves to be  but this intention was scarcely adhered to in all its integrity  she duly appeared on the edge of the field flooded with the metallic radiance that marked the close of this day whereupon he quickly descended the steps and met her at the cabin door  they entered it together  as the evening grew darker and darker he listened to her reasoning which was precisely a repetition of that already sent him by letter and by degrees accepted her decision since she would not revoke it  time came for them to say goodbye and then     he turnd and saw the terror in her eyes    that yearnd upon him shining in such wise    as a star midway in the midnight fixd  it was the misery of her own condition that showed forth hitherto obscured by her ardour for ameliorating his  they closed together and kissed each other as though the emotion of their whole yearandhalfs acquaintance had settled down upon that moment  i wont go away from you said swithin huskily  why did you propose it for an instant  thus the nearly ended interview was again prolonged and viviette yielded to all the passion of her first union with him  time however was merciless and the hour approached midnight and she was compelled to depart  swithin walked with her towards the house as he had walked many times before believing that all was now smooth again between them and caring it must be owned very little for his fame as an expositor of the southern constellations just then  when they reached the silent house he said what he had not ventured to say before fix the dayyou have decided that it is to be soon and that i am not to go  but youthful swithin was far very far from being up to the fond subtlety of viviette this evening  i cannot decide here she said gently releasing herself from his arm i will speak to you from the window  wait for me  she vanished and he waited  it was a long time before the window opened and he was not aware that with her customary complication of feeling she had knelt for some time inside the room before looking out  well said he  it cannot be she answered  i cannot ruin you  but the day after you are fiveandtwenty our marriage shall be confirmed if you choose  o my viviette how is this he cried  swithin i have not altered  but i feared for my powers and could not tell you whilst i stood by your side  i ought not to have given way as i did tonight  take the bequest and go  you are too youngto be fetteredi should have thought of it  do not communicate with me for at least a year it is imperative  do not tell me your plans  if we part we do part  i have vowed a vow not to further obstruct the course you had decided on before you knew me and my puling ways and by heavens help ill keep that vow     now go  these are the parting words of your own viviette  swithin who was stable as a giant in all that appertained to nature and life outside humanity was a mere pupil in domestic matters  he was quite awed by her firmness and looked vacantly at her for a time till she closed the window  then he mechanically turned and went as she had commanded    xxxvii   a week had passed away  it had been a time of cloudy mental weather to swithin and viviette but the only noteworthy fact about it was that what had been planned to happen therein had actually taken place  swithin had gone from welland and would shortly go from england  she became aware of it by a note that he posted to her on his way through warborne  there was much evidence of haste in the note and something of reserve  the latter she could not understand but it might have been obvious enough if she had considered  on the morning of his departure he had sat on the edge of his bed the sunlight streaming through the early mist the housemartens scratching the back of the ceiling over his head as they scrambled out from the roof for their days gnatchasing the thrushes cracking snails on the garden stones outside with the noisiness of little smiths at work on little anvils  the sun in sending its rods of yellow fire into his room sent as he suddenly thought mental illumination with it  for the first time as he sat there it had crossed his mind that viviette might have reasons for this separation which he knew not of  there might be family reasonsmysterious blood necessities which are said to rule members of old mustymansioned families and are unknown to other classes of societyand they may have been just now brought before her by her brother louis on the condition that they were religiously concealed  the idea that some family skeleton like those he had read of in memoirs had been unearthed by louis and held before her terrified understanding as a matter which rendered swithins departure and the neutralization of the marriage no less indispensable to them than it was an advantage to himself seemed a very plausible one to swithin just now  viviette might have taken louis into her confidence at last for the sake of his brotherly advice  swithin knew that of her own heart she would never wish to get rid of him but coerced by louis might she not have grown to entertain views of its expediency  events made such a supposition on st cleeves part as natural as it was inaccurate and conjoined with his own excitement at the thought of seeing a new heaven overhead influenced him to write but the briefest and most hurried final note to her in which he fully obeyed her sensitive request that he would omit all reference to his plans  these at the last moment had been modified to fall in with the winter expedition formerly mentioned to observe the transit of venus at a remote southern station  the business being done and himself fairly plunged into the preliminaries of an important scientific pilgrimage swithin acquired that lightness of heart which most young men feel in forsaking old love for new adventure no matter how charming may be the girl they leave behind them  moreover in the present case the man was endowed with that schoolboy temperament which does not see or at least consider with much curiosity the effect of a given scheme upon others than himself the bearing upon lady constantine of what was an undoubted predicament for any woman was forgotten in his feeling that she had done a very handsome and noble thing for him and that he was therefore bound in honour to make the most of it  his going had resulted in anything but lightness of heart for her  her sad fancy could indeed indulge in dreams of her yellowhaired laddie without that formerly besetting fear that those dreams would prompt her to actions likely to distract and weight him  she was wretched on her own account relieved on his  she no longer stood in the way of his advancement and that was enough  for herself she could live in retirement visit the wood the old camp the column and like oenone think of the life they had led there     mournful oenone wandering forlorn    of paris once her playmate on the hills  leaving it entirely to his goodness whether he would come and claim her in the future or desert her for ever  she was diverted for a time from these sad performances by a letter which reached her from bishop helmsdale  to see his handwriting again on an envelope after thinking so anxiously of making a fatherconfessor of him started her out of her equanimity  she speedily regained it however when she read his note     the palace melchester    july 30 18     my dear lady constantinei am shocked and grieved that in the    strange dispensation of things here below my offer of marriage should    have reached you almost simultaneously with the intelligence that your    widowhood had been of several months less duration than you and i and    the world had supposed  i can quite understand that viewed from any    side the news must have shaken and disturbed you and your    unequivocal refusal to entertain any thought of a new alliance at such    a moment was of course intelligible natural and praiseworthy  at    present i will say no more beyond expressing a hope that you will    accept my assurances that i was quite ignorant of the news at the hour    of writing and a sincere desire that in due time and as soon as you    have recovered your equanimity i may be allowed to renew my    proposali am my dear lady constantine yours ever sincerely     c melchester  she laid the letter aside and thought no more about it beyond a momentary meditation on the errors into which people fall in reasoning from actions to motives  louis who was now again with her became in due course acquainted with the contents of the letter and was satisfied with the promising position in which matters seemingly stood all round  lady constantine went her mournful ways as she had planned to do her chief resort being the familiar column where she experienced the unutterable melancholy of seeing two carpenters dismantle the dome of its felt covering detach its ribs and clear away the enclosure at the top till everything stood as it had stood before swithin had been known to the place  the equatorial had already been packed in a box to be in readiness if he should send for it from abroad  the cabin too was in course of demolition such having been his directions acquiesced in by her before he started  yet she could not bear the idea that these structures so germane to the events of their romance should be removed as if removed for ever  going to the men she bade them store up the materials intact that they might be reerected if desired  she had the junctions of the timbers marked with figures the boards numbered and the different sets of screws tied up in independent papers for identification  she did not hear the remarks of the workmen when she had gone to the effect that the young man would as soon think of buying a halter for himself as come back and spy at the moon from ringshill speer after seeing the glories of other nations and the gold and jewels that were found there or she might have been more unhappy than she was  on returning from one of these walks to the column a curious circumstance occurred  it was evening and she was coming as usual down through the sighing plantation choosing her way between the ramparts of the camp towards the outlet giving upon the field when suddenly in a dusky vista among the firtrunks she saw or thought she saw a goldenhaired toddling child  the child moved a step or two and vanished behind a tree  lady constantine fearing it had lost its way went quickly to the spot searched and called aloud  but no child could she perceive or hear anywhere around  she returned to where she had stood when first beholding it and looked in the same direction but nothing reappeared the only object at all resembling a little boy or girl was the upper tuft of a bunch of fern which had prematurely yellowed to about the colour of a fair childs hair and waved occasionally in the breeze  this however did not sufficiently explain the phenomenon and she returned to make inquiries of the man whom she had left at work removing the last traces of swithins cabin  but he had gone with her departure and the approach of night  feeling an indescribable dread she retraced her steps and hastened homeward doubting yet half believing what she had seemed to see and wondering if her imagination had played her some trick  the tranquil mournfulness of her night of solitude terminated in a most unexpected manner  the morning after the abovementioned incident lady constantine after meditating a while arose with a strange personal conviction that bore curiously on the aforesaid hallucination  she realized a condition of things that she had never anticipated and for a moment the discovery of her state so overwhelmed her that she thought she must die outright  in her terror she said she had sown the wind to reap the whirlwind  then the instinct of selfpreservation flamed up in her like a fire  her altruism in subjecting her selflove to benevolence and letting swithin go away from her was demolished by the new necessity as if it had been a gossamer web  there was no resisting or evading the spontaneous plan of action which matured in her mind in five minutes  where was swithin how could he be got at instantlythat was her ruling thought  she searched about the room for his last short note hoping yet doubting that its contents were more explicit on his intended movements than the few meagre syllables which alone she could call to mind  she could not find the letter in her room and came downstairs to louis as pale as a ghost  he looked up at her and with some concern said whats the matter  i am searching everywhere for a lettera note from mr st cleevejust a few words telling me when the occidental sails that i think he goes in  why do you want that unimportant document  it is of the utmost importance that i should know whether he has actually sailed or not said she in agonized tones  where can that letter be  louis knew where that letter was for having seen it on her desk he had without reading it torn it up and thrown it into the wastepaper basket thinking the less that remained to remind her of the young philosopher the better  i destroyed it he said  o louis why did you she cried  i am going to follow him i think it best to do so and i want to know if he is goneand now the date is lost  going to run after st cleeve  absurd  yes i am she said with vehement firmness  i must see him i want to speak to him as soon as possible  good lord viviette  are you mad  o what was the date of that ship  but it cannot be helped  i start at once for southampton  i have made up my mind to do it  he was going to his uncles solicitors in the north first then he was coming back to southampton  he cannot have sailed yet  i believe he has sailed muttered louis sullenly  she did not wait to argue with him but returned upstairs where she rang to tell green to be ready with the pony to drive her to warborne station in a quarter of an hour    xxxviii   viviettes determination to hamper swithin no longer had led her as has been shown to balk any weak impulse to entreat his return by forbidding him to furnish her with his foreign address  his ready disposition his fear that there might be other reasons behind made him obey her only too literally  thus to her terror and dismay she had placed a gratuitous difficulty in the way of her present endeavour  she was ready before green and urged on that factotum so wildly as to leave him no time to change his corduroys and skittyboots in which he had been gardening he therefore turned himself into a coachman as far down as his waist merelyclapping on his proper coat hat and waistcoat and wrapping a rug over his horticultural half below  in this compromise he appeared at the door mounted and reins in hand  seeing how sad and determined viviette was louis pitied her so far as to put nothing in the way of her starting though he forbore to help her  he thought her conduct sentimental foolery the outcome of mistaken pity and such a kind of gaingiving as would trouble a woman and he decided that it would be better to let this mood burn itself out than to keep it smouldering by obstruction  do you remember the date of his sailing she said finally as the pony carriage turned to drive off  he sails on the 25th that is today  but it may not be till late in the evening  with this she started and reached warborne in time for the uptrain  how much longer than it really is a long journey can seem to be was fully learnt by the unhappy viviette that day  the changeful procession of country seats past which she was dragged the names and memories of their owners had no points of interest for her now  she reached southampton about midday and drove straight to the docks  on approaching the gates she was met by a crowd of people and vehicles coming outmen women children porters police cabs and carts  the occidental had just sailed  the adverse intelligence came upon her with such odds after her mornings tension that she could scarcely crawl back to the cab which had brought her  but this was not a time to succumb  as she had no luggage she dismissed the man and without any real consciousness of what she was doing crept away and sat down on a pile of merchandise  after long thinking her case assumed a more hopeful complexion  much might probably be done towards communicating with him in the time at her command  the obvious step to this end which she should have thought of sooner would be to go to his grandmother in welland bottom and there obtain his itinerary in detailno doubt well known to mrs martin  there was no leisure for her to consider longer if she would be home again that night and returning to the railway she waited on a seat without eating or drinking till a train was ready to take her back  by the time she again stood in warborne the sun rested his chin upon the meadows and enveloped the distant outline of the ringshill column in his humid rays  hiring an empty fly that chanced to be at the station she was driven through the little town onward to welland which she approached about eight oclock  at her request the man set her down at the entrance to the park and when he was out of sight instead of pursuing her way to the house she went along the high road in the direction of mrs martins  dusk was drawing on and the bats were wheeling over the green basin called welland bottom by the time she arrived and had any other errand instigated her call she would have postponed it till the morrow  nobody responded to her knock but she could hear footsteps going hither and thither upstairs and dull noises as of articles moved from their places she knocked again and again and ultimately the door was opened by hannah as usual  i could make nobody hear said lady constantine who was so weary she could scarcely stand  i am very sorry my lady said hannah slightly awed on beholding her visitor  but we was a putting poor mr swithins room to rights now that he is as a woman may say dead and buried to us so we didnt hear your ladyship  ill call mrs martin at once  she is up in the room that used to be his workroom  here hannahs voice implied moist eyes and lady constantines instantly overflowed  no ill go up to her said viviette and almost in advance of hannah she passed up the shrunken ash stairs  the ebbing light was not enough to reveal to mrs martins aged gaze the personality of her visitor till hannah explained  ill get a light my lady said she  no i would rather not  what are you doing mrs martin  well the poor misguided boy is goneand hes gone for good to me  i am a woman of over fourscore years my lady constantine my junketting days are over and whether tis feasting or whether tis sorrowing in the land will soon be nothing to me  but his life may be long and active and for the sake of him i care for what i shall never see and wish to make pleasant what i shall never enjoy  i am setting his room in order as the place will be his own freehold when i am gone so that when he comes back he may find all his poor jimcracks and trangleys as he left em and not feel that i have betrayed his trust  mrs martins voice revealed that she had burst into such few tears as were left her and then hannah began crying likewise whereupon lady constantine whose heart had been bursting all day and who indeed considering her coming trouble had reason enough for tears broke into bitterer sobs than eithersobs of absolute pain that could no longer be concealed  hannah was the first to discover that lady constantine was weeping with them and her feelings being probably the least intense among the three she instantly controlled herself  refrain yourself my dear woman refrain she said hastily to mrs martin dont ye see how it do raft my lady  and turning to viviette she whispered her years be so great your ladyship that perhaps yell excuse her for busting out afore ye  we know when the mind is dim my lady theres not the manners there should be but decayed people cant help it poor old soul  hannah that will do now  perhaps lady constantine would like to speak to me alone said mrs martin  and when hannah had retreated mrs martin continued such a charge as she is my lady on account of her great age  youll pardon her biding here as if she were one of the family  i put up with such things because of her long service and we know that years lead to childishness  what are you doing  can i help you viviette asked as mrs martin after speaking turned to lift some large article  oh tis only the skeleton of a telescope thats got no works in his inside said swithins grandmother seizing the huge pasteboard tube that swithin had made and abandoned because he could get no lenses to suit it  i am going to hang it up to these hooks and there it will bide till he comes again  lady constantine took one end and the tube was hung up against the whitewashed wall by strings that the old woman had tied round it  heres all his equinoctial lines and his topics of capricorn and i dont know what besides mrs martin continued pointing to some charcoal scratches on the wall  i shall never rub em out no though tis such untidiness as i was never brought up to i shall never rub em out  where has swithin gone to first asked viviette anxiously  where does he say you are to write to him  nowhere yet my lady  hes gone traipsing all over europe and america and then to the south pacific ocean about this transit of venus thats going to be done there  he is to write to us firstgod knows whenfor he said that if we didnt hear from him for six months we were not to be gallied at all  at this intelligence so much worse than she had expected lady constantine stood mute sank down and would have fallen to the floor if there had not been a chair behind her  controlling herself by a strenuous effort she disguised her despair and asked vacantly from america to the south pacifictransit of venus  swithins arrangement to accompany the expedition had been made at the last moment and therefore she had not as yet been informed  yes to a lone island i believe  yes a lone islant my lady echoed hannah who had crept in and made herself one of the family again in spite of mrs martin  he is going to meet the english and american astronomers there at the end of the year  after that he will most likely go on to the cape  but before the end of the yearwhat places did he tell you of visiting  let me collect myself he is going to the observatory of cambridge united states to meet some gentlemen there and spy through the great refractor  then theres the observatory of chicago and i think he has a letter to make him beknown to a gentleman in the observatory at marseillesand he wants to go to viennaand poulkowa too he means to take in his waythere being great instruments and a lot of astronomers at each place  does he take europe or america first she asked faintly for the account seemed hopeless  mrs martin could not tell till she had heard from swithin  it depended upon what he had decided to do on the day of his leaving england  lady constantine bade the old people goodbye and dragged her weary limbs homeward  the fatuousness of forethought had seldom been evinced more ironically  had she done nothing to hinder him he would have kept up an unreserved communication with her and all might have been well  for that night she could undertake nothing further and she waited for the next day  then at once she wrote two letters to swithin directing one to marseilles observatory one to the observatory of cambridge us as being the only two spots on the face of the globe at which they were likely to intercept him  each letter stated to him the urgent reasons which existed for his return and contained a passionately regretful intimation that the annuity on which his hopes depended must of necessity be sacrificed by the completion of their original contract without delay  but letter conveyance was too slow a process to satisfy her  to send an epitome of her epistles by telegraph was after all indispensable  such an imploring sentence as she desired to address to him it would be hazardous to despatch from warborne and she took a dreary journey to a strange town on purpose to send it from an office at which she was unknown  there she handed in her message addressing it to the port of arrival of the occidental and again returned home  she waited and there being no return telegram the inference was that he had somehow missed hers  for an answer to either of her letters she would have to wait long enough to allow him time to reach one of the observatoriesa tedious while  then she considered the weakness the stultifying nature of her attempt at recall  events mocked her on all sides  by the favour of an accident and by her own immense exertions against her instincts swithin had been restored to the rightful heritage that he had nearly forfeited on her account  he had just started off to utilize it when she without a moments warning was asking him again to cast it away  she had set a certain machinery in motionto stop it before it had revolved once  a horrid apprehension possessed her  it had been easy for swithin to give up what he had never known the advantages of keeping but having once begun to enjoy his possession would he give it up now  could he be depended on for such selfsacrifice  before leaving he would have done anything at her request but the mollia tempora fandi had now passed suppose there arrived no reply from him for the next three months and that when his answer came he were to inform her that having now fully acquiesced in her original decision he found the life he was leading so profitable as to be unable to abandon it even to please her that he was very sorry but having embarked on this course by her advice he meant to adhere to it by his own  there was indeed every probability that moving about as he was doing and cautioned as he had been by her very self against listening to her too readily she would receive no reply of any sort from him for three or perhaps four months  this would be on the eve of the transit and what likelihood was there that a young man full of ardour for that spectacle would forego it at the last moment to return to a humdrum domesticity with a woman who was no longer a novelty  if she could only leave him to his career and save her own situation also  but at that moment the proposition seemed as impossible as to construct a triangle of two straight lines  in her walk home pervaded by these hopeless views she passed near the dark and deserted tower  night in that solitary place which would have caused her some uneasiness in her years of blitheness had no terrors for her now  she went up the winding path and the door being unlocked felt her way to the top  the open sky greeted her as in times previous to the domeandequatorial period but there was not a star to suggest to her in which direction swithin had gone  the absence of the dome suggested a way out of her difficulties  a leap in the dark and all would be over  but she had not reached that stage of action as yet and the thought was dismissed as quickly as it had come  the new consideration which at present occupied her mind was whether she could have the courage to leave swithin to himself as in the original plan and singly meet her impending trial despising the shame till he should return at fiveandtwenty and claim her  yet was this assumption of his return so very safe  how altered things would be at that time  at twentyfive he would still be young and handsome she would be threeand thirty fading to middleage and homeliness from a juniors point of view  a fear sharp as a frost settled down upon her that in any such scheme as this she would be building upon the sand  she hardly knew how she reached home that night  entering by the lawn door she saw a red coal in the direction of the arbour  louis was smoking there and he came forward  he had not seen her since the morning and was naturally anxious about her  she blessed the chance which enveloped her in night and lessened the weight of the encounter one half by depriving him of vision  did you accomplish your object he asked  no said she  how was that  he has sailed  a very good thing for both i say  i believe you would have married him if you could have overtaken him  that would i she said  good god  i would marry a tinker for that matter i have reasons for being any mans wife she said recklessly only i should prefer to drown myself  louis held his breath and stood rigid at the meaning her words conveyed  but louis you dont know all cried viviette  i am not so bad as you think mine has been follynot vice  i thought i had married himand then i found i had not the marriage was invalidsir blount was alive and now swithin has gone away and will not come back for my calling  how can he  his fortune is left him on condition that he forms no legal tie o will hewill he come again  never if thats the position of affairs said louis firmly after a pause  what then shall i do said viviette  louis escaped the formidable difficulty of replying by pretending to continue his havannah and she bowed down to dust by what she had revealed crept from him into the house  louiss cigar went out in his hand as he stood looking intently at the ground    xxxix   louis got up the next morning with an idea in his head  he had dressed for a journey and breakfasted hastily  before he had started viviette came downstairs  louis who was now greatly disturbed about her went up to his sister and took her hand  aux grands maux les grands remedes he said gravely  i have a plan  i have a dozen said she  you have  yes  but what are they worth  and yet there mustthere must be a way  viviette said louis promise that you will wait till i come home to night before you do anything  her distracted eyes showed slight comprehension of his request as she said yes  an hour after that time louis entered the train at warborne and was speedily crossing a country of ragged woodland which though intruded on by the plough at places remained largely intact from prehistoric times and still abounded with yews of gigantic growth and oaks tufted with mistletoe  it was the route to melchester  on setting foot in that city he took the cathedral spire as his guide the place being strange to him and went on till he reached the archway dividing melchester sacred from melchester secular  thence he threaded his course into the precincts of the damp and venerable close level as a bowlinggreen and beloved of rooks who from their elm perches on high threatened any unwary gazer with the mishap of tobit  at the corner of this reposeful spot stood the episcopal palace  louis entered the gates rang the bell and looked around  here the trees and rooks seemed older if possible than those in the close behind him  everything was dignified and he felt himself like punchinello in the kings chambers  verily in the present case glanville was not a man to stick at trifles any more than his illustrious prototype and on the servant bringing a message that his lordship would see him at once louis marched boldly in  through an old dark corridor roofed with old dark beams the servant led the way to the heavilymoulded door of the bishops room  dr helmsdale was there and welcomed louis with considerable stateliness  but his condescension was tempered with a curious anxiety and even with nervousness  he asked in pointed tones after the health of lady constantine if louis had brought an answer to the letter he had addressed to her a day or two earlier and if the contents of the letter or of the previous one were known to him  i have brought no answer from her said louis  but the contents of your letter have been made known to me  since entering the building louis had more than once felt some hesitation and it might now with a favouring manner from his entertainer have operated to deter him from going further with his intention  but the bishop had personal weaknesses that were fatal to sympathy for more than a moment  then i may speak in confidence to you as her nearest relative said the prelate and explain that i am now in a position with regard to lady constantine which in view of the important office i hold i should not have cared to place myself in unless i had felt quite sure of not being refused by her  and hence it is a great grief and some mortification to me that i was refusedowing of course to the fact that i unwittingly risked making my proposal at the very moment when she was under the influence of those strange tidings and therefore not herself and scarcely able to judge what was best for her  the bishops words disclosed a mind whose sensitive fear of danger to its own dignity hindered it from criticism elsewhere  things might have been worse for louiss pucklike idea of mismating his hermia with this demetrius  throwing a strong colour of earnestness into his mien he replied bishop viviette is my only sister i am her only brother and friend  i am alarmed for her health and state of mind  hence i have come to consult you on this very matter that you have broached  i come absolutely without her knowledge and i hope unconventionality may be excused in me on the score of my anxiety for her  certainly  i trust that the prospect opened up by my proposal combined with this other news has not proved too much for her  my sister is distracted and distressed bishop helmsdale  she wants comfort  not distressed by my letter said the bishop turning red  has it lowered me in her estimation  on the contrary while your disinterested offer was uppermost in her mind she was a different woman  it is this other matter that oppresses her  the result upon her of the recent discovery with regard to the late sir blount constantine is peculiar  to say that he illused her in his lifetime is to understate a truth  he has been dead now a considerable period but this revival of his memory operates as a sort of terror upon her  images of the manner of sir blounts death are with her night and day intensified by a hideous picture of the supposed scene which was cruelly sent her  she dreads being alone  nothing will restore my poor viviette to her former cheerfulness but a distractiona hopea new prospect  that is precisely what acceptance of my offer would afford  precisely said louis with great respect  but how to get her to avail herself of it after once refusing you is the difficulty and my earnest problem  then we are quite at one  we are  and it is to promote our wishes that i am come since she will do nothing of herself  then you can give me no hope of a reply to my second communication  none whateverby letter said louis  her impression plainly is that she cannot encourage your lordship  yet in the face of all this reticence the secret is that she loves you warmly  can you indeed assure me of that  indeed indeed said the good bishop musingly  then i must try to see her  i begin to feelto feel stronglythat a course which would seem premature and unbecoming in other cases would be true and proper conduct in this  her unhappy dilemmasher unwonted positionyes yesi see it all  i can afford to have some little misconstruction put upon my motives  i will go and see her immediately  her past has been a cruel one she wants sympathy and with heavens help ill give it  i think the remedy lies that way said louis gently  some words came from her one night which seemed to show it  i was standing on the terrace i heard somebody sigh in the dark and found that it was she  i asked her what was the matter and gently pressed her on this subject of boldly and promptly contracting a new marriage as a means of dispersing the horrors of the old  her answer implied that she would have no objection to do it and to do it at once provided she could remain externally passive in the matter that she would tacitly yield in fact to pressure but would not meet solicitation halfway  now bishop helmsdale you see what has prompted me  on the one hand is a dignitary of high position and integrity to say no more who is anxious to save her from the gloom of her situation on the other is this sister who will not make known to you her willingness to be savedpartly from apathy partly from a fear that she may be thought forward in responding favourably at so early a moment partly also perhaps from a modest sense that there would be some sacrifice on your part in allying yourself with a woman of her secluded and sad experience  o there is no sacrifice  quite otherwise  i care greatly for this alliance mr glanville  your sister is very dear to me  moreover the advantages her mind would derive from the enlarged field of activity that the position of a bishops wife would afford are palpable  i am induced to think that an early settlement of the questionan immediate coming to the pointwhich might be called too early in the majority of cases would be a right and considerate tenderness here  my only dread is that she should think an immediate following up of the subject premature  and the risk of a rebuff a second time is one which as you must perceive it would be highly unbecoming in me to run  i think the risk would be small if your lordship would approach her frankly  write she will not i am assured and knowing that and having her interest at heart i was induced to come to you and make this candid statement in reply to your communication  her late husband having been virtually dead these four or five years believed dead two years and actually dead nearly one no reproach could attach to her if she were to contract another union tomorrow  i agree with you mr glanville said the bishop warmly  i will think this over  her motive in not replying i can quite understand your motive in coming i can also understand and appreciate in a brother  if i feel convinced that it would be a seemly and expedient thing i will come to welland tomorrow  the point to which louis had brought the bishop being so satisfactory he feared to endanger it by another word  he went away almost hurriedly and at once left the precincts of the cathedral lest another encounter with dr helmsdale should lead the latter to take a new and slower view of his duties as viviettes suitor  he reached welland by dinnertime and came upon viviette in the same pensive mood in which he had left her  it seemed she had hardly moved since  have you discovered swithin st cleeves address she said without looking up at him  no said louis  then she broke out with indescribable anguish but you asked me to wait till this evening and i have waited through the long day in the belief that your words meant something and that you would bring good tidings and now i find your words meant nothing and you have not brought good tidings  louis could not decide for a moment what to say to this  should he venture to give her thoughts a new course by a revelation of his design no it would be better to prolong her despair yet another night and spring relief upon her suddenly that she might jump at it and commit herself without an interval for reflection on certain aspects of the proceeding  nothing accordingly did he say and conjecturing that she would be hardly likely to take any desperate step that night he left her to herself  his anxiety at this crisis continued to be great  everything depended on the result of the bishops selfcommunion  would he or would he not come the next day  perhaps instead of his important presence there would appear a letter postponing the visit indefinitely  if so all would be lost  louiss suspense kept him awake and he was not alone in his sleeplessness  through the night he heard his sister walking up and down in a state which betokened that for every pang of grief she had disclosed twice as many had remained unspoken  he almost feared that she might seek to end her existence by violence so unreasonably sudden were her moods and he lay and longed for the day  it was morning  she came down the same as usual and asked if there had arrived any telegram or letter but there was neither  louis avoided her knowing that nothing he could say just then would do her any good  no communication had reached him from the bishop and that looked well by one ruse and another as the day went on he led her away from contemplating the remote possibility of hearing from swithin and induced her to look at the worst contingency as her probable fate  it seemed as if she really made up her mind to this for by the afternoon she was apathetic like a woman who neither hoped nor feared  and then a fly drove up to the door  louis who had been standing in the hall the greater part of that day glanced out through a private window and went to viviette  the bishop has called he said  be ready to see him  the bishop of melchester said viviette bewildered  yes  i asked him to come  he comes for an answer to his letters  an answertohisletters she murmured  an immediate reply of yes or no  her face showed the workings of her mind  how entirely an answer of assent at once acted on for better or for worse would clear the spectre from her path there needed no tongue to tell  it would moreover accomplish that end without involving the impoverishment of swithinthe inevitable result if she had adopted the legitimate road out of her trouble  hitherto there had seemed to her dismayed mind unenlightened as to any course save one of honesty no possible achievement of both her desiresthe saving of swithin and the saving of herself  but behold here was a way  a tempter had shown it to her  it involved a great wrong which to her had quite obscured its feasibility  but she perceived now that it was indeed a way  nature was forcing her hand at this game and to what will not nature compel her weaker victims in extremes  louis left her to think it out  when he reached the drawingroom dr helmsdale was standing there with the air of a man too good for his destinywhich to be just to him was not far from the truth this time  have you broken my message to her asked the bishop sonorously  not your message your visit said louis  i leave the rest in your lordships hands  i have done all i can for her  she was in her own small room today and feeling that it must be a bold stroke or none he led the bishop across the hall till he reached her apartment and opened the door but instead of following he shut it behind his visitor  then glanville passed an anxious time  he walked from the foot of the staircase to the star of old swords and pikes on the wall from these to the stags horns thence down the corridor as far as the door where he could hear murmuring inside but not its import  the longer they remained closeted the more excited did he become  that she had not peremptorily negatived the proposal at the outset was a strong sign of its success  it showed that she had admitted argument and the worthy bishop had a pleader on his side whom he knew little of  the very weather seemed to favour dr helmsdale in his suit  a blusterous wind had blown up from the west howling in the smokeless chimneys and suggesting to the feminine mind storms at sea a tossing ocean and the hopeless inaccessibility of all astronomers and men on the other side of the same  the bishop had entered viviettes room at ten minutes past three  the long hand of the hall clock lay level at fortyfive minutes past when the knob of the door moved and he came out  louis met him where the passage joined the hall  dr helmsdale was decidedly in an emotional state his face being slightly flushed  louis looked his anxious inquiry without speaking it  she accepts me said the bishop in a low voice  and the wedding is to be soon  her long solitude and sufferings justify haste  what you said was true  sheer weariness and distraction have driven her to me  she was quite passive at last and agreed to anything i proposedsuch is the persuasive force of trained logical reasoning  a good and wise woman she perceived what a true shelter from sadness was offered in me and was not the one to despise heavens gift    xl   the silence of swithin was to be accounted for by the circumstance that neither to the mediterranean nor to america had he in the first place directed his steps  feeling himself absolutely free he had on arriving at southampton decided to make straight for the cape and hence had not gone aboard the occidental at all  his object was to leave his heavier luggage there examine the capabilities of the spot for his purpose find out the necessity or otherwise of shipping over his own equatorial and then cross to america as soon as there was a good opportunity  here he might inquire the movements of the transit expedition to the south pacific and join it at such a point as might be convenient  thus though wrong in her premisses viviette had intuitively decided with sad precision  there was as a matter of fact a great possibility of her not being able to communicate with him for several months notwithstanding that he might possibly communicate with her  this excursive time was an awakening for swithin  to altered circumstances inevitably followed altered views  that such changes should have a marked effect upon a young man who had made neither grand tour nor petty onewho had in short scarcely been away from home in his lifewas nothing more than natural  new ideas struggled to disclose themselves and with the addition of strange twinklers to his southern horizon came an absorbed attention that way and a corresponding forgetfulness of what lay to the north behind his back whether human or celestial  whoever may deplore it few will wonder that viviette who till then had stood high in his heaven if she had not dominated it sank like the north star lower and lower with his retreat southward master of a large advance of his first years income in circular notes he perhaps too readily forgot that the mere act of honour but for her selfsuppression would have rendered him penniless  meanwhile to come back and claim her at the specified time four years thence if she should not object to be claimed was as much a part of his programme as were the exploits abroad and elsewhere that were to prelude it  the very thoroughness of his intention for that advanced date inclined him all the more readily to shelve the subject now  her unhappy caution to him not to write too soon was a comfortable license in his present state of tension about sublime scientific things which knew not woman nor her sacrifices nor her fears  in truth he was not only too young in years but too literal direct and uncompromising in nature to understand such a woman as lady constantine and she suffered for that limitation in him as it had been antecedently probable that she would do  he stayed but a little time at cape town on this his first reconnoitring journey and on that account wrote to no one from the place  on leaving he found there remained some weeks on his hands before he wished to cross to america and feeling an irrepressible desire for further studies in navigation on shipboard and under clear skies he took the steamer for melbourne returning thence in due time and pursuing his journey to america where he landed at boston  having at last had enough of great circles and other nautical reckonings and taking no interest in men or cities this indefatigable scrutineer of the universe went immediately on to cambridge and there by the help of an introduction he had brought from england he revelled for a time in the glories of the gigantic refractor which he was permitted to use on occasion and in the pleasures of intercourse with the scientific group around  this brought him on to the time of starting with the transit expedition when he and his kind became lost to the eye of civilization behind the horizon of the pacific ocean  to speak of their doings on this pilgrimage of ingress and egress of tangent and parallax of external and internal contact would avail nothing  is it not all written in the chronicles of the astronomical society  more to the point will it be to mention that viviettes letter to cambridge had been returned long before he reached that place while her missive to marseilles was of course misdirected altogether  on arriving in america uncertain of an address in that country at which he would stay long swithin wrote his first letter to his grandmother and in this he ordered that all communications should be sent to await him at cape town as the only safe spot for finding him sooner or later  the equatorial he also directed to be forwarded to the same place  at this time too he ventured to break viviettes commands and address a letter to her not knowing of the strange results that had followed his absence from home  it was february  the transit was over the scientific company had broken up and swithin had steamed towards the cape to take up his permanent abode there with a view to his great task of surveying charting and theorizing on those exceptional features in the southern skies which had been but partially treated by the younger herschel  having entered table bay and landed on the quay he called at once at the postoffice  two letters were handed him and he found from the date that they had been waiting there for some time  one of these epistles which had a weatherworn look as regarded the ink and was in oldfashioned penmanship he knew to be from his grandmother  he opened it before he had as much as glanced at the superscription of the second  besides immaterial portions it contained the following     j reckon you know by now of our main news this fall but lest you    should not have heard of it j send the exact thing snipped out of the    newspaper  nobody expected her to do it quite so soon but it is said    hereabout that my lord bishop and my lady had been drawing nigh to an    understanding before the glum tidings of sir blounts taking of his    own life reached her and the account of this wicked deed was so sore    afflicting to her mind and made her poor heart so timid and low that    in charity to my lady her few friends agreed on urging her to let the    bishop go on paying his court as before notwithstanding she had not    been a widowwoman near so long as was thought  this as it turned    out she was willing to do and when my lord asked her she told him    she would marry him at once or never  thats as j was told and j had    it from those that know  the cutting from the newspaper was an ordinary announcement of marriage between the bishop of melchester and lady constantine  swithin was so astounded at the intelligence of what for the nonce seemed viviettes wanton fickleness that he quite omitted to look at the second letter and remembered nothing about it till an hour afterwards when sitting in his own room at the hotel  it was in her handwriting but so altered that its superscription had not arrested his eye  it had no beginning or date but its contents soon acquainted him with her motive for the precipitate act  the few concluding sentences are all that it will be necessary to quote here     there was no way out of it even if i could have found you without    infringing one of the conditions i had previously laid down  the long    desire of my heart has been not to impoverish you or mar your career    the new desire was to save myself and still more another yet unborn        i have done a desperate thing  yet for myself i could do no    better and for you no less  i would have sacrificed my single self    to honesty but i was not alone concerned  what woman has a right to    blight a coming life to preserve her personal integrity     the    one bright spot is that it saves you and your endowment from further    catastrophes and preserves you to the pleasant paths of scientific    fame  i no longer lie like a log across your path which is now as    open as on the day before you saw me and ere i encouraged you to win    me  alas swithin i ought to have known better  the folly was    great and the suffering be upon my head  i ought not to have    consented to that last interview all was well till then     well    i have borne much and am not unprepared  as for you swithin by    simply pressing straight on your triumph is assured  do not    communicate with me in any waynot even in answer to this  do not    think of me  do not see me ever any moreyour unhappy     viviette  swithins heart swelled within him in sudden pity for her first then he blanched with a horrified sense of what she had done and at his own relation to the deed  he felt like an awakened somnambulist who should find that he had been accessory to a tragedy during his unconsciousness she had loosened the knot of her difficulties by cutting it unscrupulously through and through  the big tidings rather dazed than crushed him his predominant feeling being soon again one of keenest sorrow and sympathy  yet one thing was obvious he could do nothingabsolutely nothing  the event which he now heard of for the first time had taken place five long months ago  he reflected and regrettedand mechanically went on with his preparations for settling down to work under the shadow of table mountain  he was as one who suddenly finds the world a stranger place than he thought but is excluded by age temperament and situation from being much more than an astonished spectator of its strangeness        the royal observatory was about a mile out of the town and hither he repaired as soon as he had established himself in lodgings  he had decided on his first visit to the cape that it would be highly advantageous to him if he could supplement the occasional use of the large instruments here by the use at his own house of his own equatorial and had accordingly given directions that it might be sent over from england  the precious possession now arrived and although the sight of itof the brasses on which her hand had often rested of the eyepiece through which her dark eyes had beamedengendered some decidedly bitter regrets in him for a time he could not long afford to give to the past the days that were meant for the future  unable to get a room convenient for a private observatory he resolved at last to fix the instrument on a solid pillar in the garden and several days were spent in accommodating it to its new position  in this latitude there was no necessity for economizing clear nights as he had been obliged to do on the old tower at welland  there it had happened more than once that after waiting idle through days and nights of cloudy weather viviette would fix her time for meeting him at an hour when at last he had an opportunity of seeing the sky so that in giving to her the golden moments of cloudlessness he was losing his chance with the orbs above  those features which usually attract the eye of the visitor to a new latitude are the novel forms of human and vegetable life and other such sublunary things  but the young man glanced slightingly at these the changes overhead had all his attention  the old subject was imprinted there but in a new type  here was a heaven fixed and ancient as the northern yet it had never appeared above the welland hills since they were heaved up from beneath  here was an unalterable circumpolar region but the polar patterns stereotyped in history and legendwithout which it had almost seemed that a polar sky could not existhad never been seen therein  st cleeve as was natural began by cursory surveys which were not likely to be of much utility to the world or to himself  he wasted several weeksindeed above two monthsin a comparatively idle survey of southern novelties in the mere luxury of looking at stellar objects whose wonders were known recounted and classified long before his own personality had been heard of  with a childs simple delight he allowed his instrument to rove evening after evening from the gorgeous glitter of canopus to the hazy clouds of magellan  before he had well finished this optical prelude there floated over to him from the other side of the equator the postscript to the epistle of his lost viviette  it came in the vehicle of a common newspaper under the head of births  april 10th 18 at the palace melchester the wife of the bishop of melchester of a son    xli   three years passed away and swithin still remained at the cape quietly pursuing the work that had brought him there  his memoranda of observations had accumulated to a wheelbarrow load and he was beginning to shape them into a treatise which should possess some scientific utility  he had gauged the southern skies with greater results than even he himself had anticipated  those unfamiliar constellations which to the casual beholder are at most a new arrangement of ordinary points of light were to this professed astronomer as to his brethren a far greater matter  it was below the surface that his material lay  there in regions revealed only to the instrumental observer were suns of hybrid kindfire fogs floating nuclei globes that flew in groups like swarms of bees and other extraordinary sightswhich when decomposed by swithins equatorial turned out to be the beginning of a new series of phenomena instead of the end of an old one  there were gloomy deserts in those southern skies such as the north shows scarcely an example of sites set apart for the position of suns which for some unfathomable reason were left uncreated their places remaining ever since conspicuous by their emptiness  the inspection of these chasms brought him a second pulsation of that old horror which he had used to describe to viviette as produced in him by bottomlessness in the north heaven  the ghostly finger of limitless vacancy touched him now on the other side  infinite deeps in the north stellar region had a homely familiarity about them when compared with infinite deeps in the region of the south pole  this was an even more unknown tract of the unknown  space here being less the historic haunt of human thought than overhead at home seemed to be pervaded with a more lonely loneliness  were there given on paper to these astronomical exercitations of st cleeve a space proportionable to that occupied by his year with viviette at welland this narrative would treble its length but not a single additional glimpse would be afforded of swithin in his relations with old emotions  in these experiments with tubes and glasses important as they were to human intellect there was little food for the sympathetic instincts which create the changes in a life  that which is the foreground and measuring base of one perspective draught may be the vanishingpoint of another perspective draught while yet they are both draughts of the same thing  swithins doings and discoveries in the southern sidereal system were no doubt incidents of the highest importance to him and yet from an intersocial point of view they served but the humble purpose of killing time while other doings more nearly allied to his heart than to his understanding developed themselves at home  in the intervals between his professional occupations he took walks over the sandflats near or among the farms which were gradually overspreading the country in the vicinity of cape town  he grew familiar with the outline of table mountain and the fleecy devils tablecloth which used to settle on its top when the wind was southeast  on these promenades he would more particularly think of viviette and of that curious pathetic chapter in his life with her which seemed to have wound itself up and ended for ever  those scenes were rapidly receding into distance and the intensity of his sentiment regarding them had proportionately abated  he felt that there had been something wrong therein and yet he could not exactly define the boundary of the wrong viviettes sad and amazing sequel to that chapter had still a fearful catastrophic aspect in his eyes but instead of musing over it and its bearings he shunned the subject as we shun by night the shady scene of a disaster and keep to the open road  he sometimes contemplated her apart from the pastleading her life in the cathedral close at melchester and wondered how often she looked south and thought of where he was  on one of these afternoon walks in the neighbourhood of the royal observatory he turned and gazed towards the signalpost on the lions rump  this was a high promontory to the northwest of table mountain and overlooked table bay  before his eyes had left the scene the signal was suddenly hoisted on the staff  it announced that a mail steamer had appeared in view over the sea  in the course of an hour he retraced his steps as he had often done on such occasions and strolled leisurely across the intervening mile and a half till he arrived at the postoffice door  there was no letter from england for him but there was a newspaper addressed in the seventeenth century handwriting of his grandmother who in spite of her great age still retained a steady hold on life  he turned away disappointed and resumed his walk into the country opening the paper as he went along  a cross in black ink attracted his attention and it was opposite a name among the deaths  his blood ran icily as he discerned the words the palace melchester  but it was not she  her husband the bishop of melchester had after a short illness departed this life at the comparatively early age of fifty years  all the enactments of the bygone days at welland now started up like an awakened army from the ground  but a few months were wanting to the time when he would be of an age to marry without sacrificing the annuity which formed his means of subsistence  it was a point in his life that had had no meaning or interest for him since his separation from viviette for women were now no more to him than the inhabitants of jupiter  but the whirligig of time having again set viviette free the aspect of home altered and conjecture as to her future found room to work anew  but beyond the simple fact that she was a widow he for some time gained not an atom of intelligence concerning her  there was no one of whom he could inquire but his grandmother and she could tell him nothing about a lady who dwelt far away at melchester  several months slipped by thus and no feeling within him rose to sufficient strength to force him out of a passive attitude  then by the merest chance his granny stated in one of her rambling epistles that lady constantine was coming to live again at welland in the old house with her child now a little boy between three and four years of age  swithin however lived on as before  but by the following autumn a change became necessary for the young man himself  his work at the cape was done  his uncles wishes that he should study there had been more than observed  the materials for his great treatise were collected and it now only remained for him to arrange digest and publish them for which purpose a return to england was indispensable  so the equatorial was unscrewed and the stand taken down the astronomers barrowload of precious memoranda and rolls upon rolls of diagrams representing three years of continuous labour were safely packed and swithin departed for good and all from the shores of cape town  he had long before informed his grandmother of the date at which she might expect him and in a reply from her which reached him just previous to sailing she casually mentioned that she frequently saw lady constantine that on the last occasion her ladyship had shown great interest in the information that swithin was coming home and had inquired the time of his return        on a late summer day swithin stepped from the train at warborne and directing his baggage to be sent on after him set out on foot for old welland once again  it seemed but the day after his departure so little had the scene changed  true there was that change which is always the first to arrest attention in places that are conventionally called unchanginga higher and broader vegetation at every familiar corner than at the former time  he had not gone a mile when he saw walking before him a clergyman whose form after consideration he recognized in spite of a novel whiteness in that part of his hair that showed below the brim of his hat  swithin walked much faster than this gentleman and soon was at his side  mr torkingham  i knew it was said swithin  mr torkingham was slower in recognizing the astronomer but in a moment had greeted him with a warm shake of the hand  i have been to the station on purpose to meet you cried mr torkingham and was returning with the idea that you had not come  i am your grandmothers emissary  she could not come herself and as she was anxious and nobody else could be spared i came for her  then they walked on together  the parson told swithin all about his grandmother the parish and his endeavours to enlighten it and in due course said you are no doubt aware that lady constantine is living again at welland  swithin said he had heard as much and added what was far within the truth that the news of the bishops death had been a great surprise to him  yes said mr torkingham with nine thoughts to one word  one might have prophesied to look at him that melchester would not lack a bishop for the next forty years  yes pale death knocks at the cottages of the poor and the palaces of kings with an impartial foot  was he a particularly good man asked swithin  he was not a ken or a heber  to speak candidly he had his faults of which arrogance was not the least  but who is perfect  swithin somehow felt relieved to hear that the bishop was not a perfect man  his poor wife i fear had not a great deal more happiness with him than with her first husband  but one might almost have foreseen it the marriage was hastythe result of a redhot caprice hardly becoming in a man of his position and it betokened a want of temperate discretion which soon showed itself in other ways  thats all there was to be said against him and now its all over and things have settled again into their old course  but the bishops widow is not the lady constantine of former days  no put it as you will she is not the same  there seems to be a nameless something on her minda troublea rooted melancholy which no mans ministry can reach  formerly she was a woman whose confidence it was easy to gain but neither religion nor philosophy avails with her now  beyond that her life is strangely like what it was when you were with us  conversing thus they pursued the turnpike road till their conversation was interrupted by a crying voice on their left  they looked and perceived that a child in getting over an adjoining stile had fallen on his face  mr torkingham and swithin both hastened up to help the sufferer who was a lovely little fellow with flaxen hair which spread out in a frill of curls from beneath a quaint closefitting velvet cap that he wore swithin picked him up while mr torkingham wiped the sand from his lips and nose and administered a few words of consolation together with a few sweetmeats which somewhat to swithins surprise the parson produced as if by magic from his pocket  one half the comfort rendered would have sufficed to soothe such a disposition as the childs  he ceased crying and ran away in delight to his unconscious nurse who was reaching up for blackberries at a hedge some way off  you know who he is of course said mr torkingham as they resumed their journey  no said swithin  oh i thought you did  yet how should you  it is lady constantines boyher only child  his fond mother little thinks he is so far away from home  dear melady constantinesah how interesting  swithin paused abstractedly for a moment then stepped back again to the stile while he stood watching the little boy out of sight  i can never venture out of doors now without sweets in my pocket continued the goodnatured vicar and the result is that i meet that young man more frequently on my rounds than any other of my parishioners  st cleeve was silent and they turned into welland lane where their paths presently diverged and swithin was left to pursue his way alone he might have accompanied the vicar yet further and gone straight to welland house but it would have been difficult to do so then without provoking inquiry  it was easy to go there now by a cross path he could be at the mansion almost as soon as by the direct road  and yet swithin did not turn he felt an indescribable reluctance to see viviette  he could not exactly say why  true before he knew how the land lay it might be awkward to attempt to call and this was a sufficient excuse for postponement  in this mood he went on following the direct way to his grandmothers homestead  he reached the gardengate and looking into the bosky basin where the old house stood saw a graceful female form moving before the porch bidding adieu to some one within the door  he wondered what creature of that mould his grandmother could know and went forward with some hesitation  at his approach the apparition turned and he beheld developed into blushing womanhood one who had once been known to him as the village maiden tabitha lark  seeing swithin and apparently from an instinct that her presence would not be desirable just then she moved quickly round into the garden  the returned traveller entered the house where he found awaiting him poor old mrs martin to whose earthly course death stood rather as the asymptote than as the end  she was perceptibly smaller in form than when he had left her and she could see less distinctly  a rather affecting greeting followed in which his grandmother murmured the words of israel now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive  the form of hannah had disappeared from the kitchen that ancient servant having been gathered to her fathers about six months before her place being filled by a young girl who knew not joseph  they presently chatted with much cheerfulness and his grandmother said have you heard what a wonderful young woman miss lark has becomea mere fleetfooted slittering maid when you were last home  st cleeve had not heard but he had partly seen and he was informed that tabitha had left welland shortly after his own departure and had studied music with great success in london where she had resided ever since till quite recently that she played at concerts oratorioshad in short joined the phalanx of wonderful women who had resolved to eclipse masculine genius altogether and humiliate the brutal sex to the dust  she is only in the garden added his grandmother  why dont ye go out and speak to her  swithin was nothing loth and strolled out under the appletrees where he arrived just in time to prevent miss lark from going off by the back gate  there was not much difficulty in breaking the ice between them and they began to chat with vivacity  now all these proceedings occupied time for somehow it was very charming to talk to miss lark and by degrees st cleeve informed tabitha of his great undertaking and of the voluminous notes he had amassed which would require so much rearrangement and recopying by an amanuensis as to absolutely appal him  he greatly feared he should not get one careful enough for such scientific matter whereupon tabitha said she would be delighted to do it for him  then blushing and declaring suddenly that it had grown quite late she left him and the garden for her relations house hard by  swithin no less than tabitha had been surprised by the disappearance of the sun behind the hill and the question now arose whether it would be advisable to call upon viviette that night  there was little doubt that she knew of his coming but more than that he could not predicate and being entirely ignorant of whom she had around her entirely in the dark as to her present feelings towards him he thought it would be better to defer his visit until the next day  walking round to the front of the house he beheld the wellknown agriculturists hezzy biles haymoss fry and some others of the same old school passing the gate homeward from their work with bundles of wood at their backs swithin saluted them over the top rail  well do my eyes and ears began hezzy and then balancing his faggot on end against the hedge he came forward the others following  says i to myself as soon as i heerd his voice hezzy continued addressing swithin as if he were a disinterested spectator and not himself please god ill pitch my nitch and go across and speak to en  i knowed in a winking twas some great navigator that i see a standing there said haymoss  but wher twere a sort of nabob or a diment digger or a lionhunter i couldnt so much as guess till i heerd en speak  and what changes have come over welland since i was last at home asked swithin  well mr san cleeve hezzy replied when youve said that a few stripling boys and maidens have busted into blooth and a few married women have plimmed and chimped my lady among em why youve said anighst all mr san cleeve  the conversation thus began was continued on divers matters till they were all enveloped in total darkness when his old acquaintances shouldered their faggots again and proceeded on their way  now that he was actually within her coasts again swithin felt a little more strongly the influence of the past and viviette than he had been accustomed to do for the last two or three years  during the night he felt half sorry that he had not marched off to the great house to see her regardless of the time of day  if she really nourished for him any particle of her old affection it had been the cruellest thing not to call  a few questions that he put concerning her to his grandmother elicited that lady constantine had no friends about hernot even her brotherand that her health had not been so good since her return from melchester as formerly  still this proved nothing as to the state of her heart and as she had kept a dead silence since the bishops death it was quite possible that she would meet him with that cold repressive tone and manner which experienced women know so well how to put on when they wish to intimate to the longlost lover that old episodes are to be taken as forgotten  the next morning he prepared to call if only on the ground of old acquaintance for swithin was too straightforward to ascertain anything indirectly  it was rather too early for this purpose when he went out from his grandmothers gardengate after breakfast and he waited in the garden  while he lingered his eye fell on ringshill speer  it appeared dark for a moment against the blue sky behind it then the fleeting cloud which shadowed it passed on and the face of the column brightened into such luminousness that the sky behind sank to the complexion of a dark foil  surely somebody is on the column he said to himself after gazing at it awhile  instead of going straight to the great house he deviated through the insulating field now sown with turnips which surrounded the plantation on ringshill  by the time that he plunged under the trees he was still more certain that somebody was on the tower  he crept up to the base with proprietary curiosity for the spot seemed again like his own  the path still remained much as formerly but the nook in which the cabin had stood was covered with undergrowth  swithin entered the door of the tower ascended the staircase about halfway on tiptoe and listened for he did not wish to intrude on the top if any stranger were there  the hollow spiral as he knew from old experience would bring down to his ears the slightest sound from above and it now revealed to him the words of a duologue in progress at the summit of the tower  mother what shall i do a childs voice said  shall i sing  the mother seemed to assent for the child began     the robin has fled from the wood    to the snug habitation of man  this performance apparently attracted but little attention from the childs companion for the young voice suggested as a new form of entertainment shall i say my prayers  yes replied one whom swithin had begun to recognize  who shall i pray for  no answer  who shall i pray for  pray for father  but he is gone to heaven  a sigh from viviette was distinctly audible  you made a mistake didnt you mother continued the little one  i must have  the strangest mistake a woman ever made  nothing more was said and swithin ascended words from above indicating to him that his footsteps were heard  in another halfminute he rose through the hatchway  a lady in black was sitting in the sun and the boy with the flaxen hair whom he had seen yesterday was at her feet  viviette he said  swithinat last she cried  the words died upon her lips and from very faintness she bent her head for instead of rushing forward to her he had stood still and there appeared upon his face a look which there was no mistaking  yes he was shocked at her worn and faded aspect  the image he had mentally carried out with him to the cape he had brought home again as that of the woman he was now to rejoin  but another woman sat before him and not the original viviette  her cheeks had lost for ever that firm contour which had been drawn by the vigorous hand of youth and the masses of hair that were once darkness visible had become touched here and there by a faint grey haze like the via lactea in a midnight sky  yet to those who had eyes to understand as well as to see the chastened pensiveness of her once handsome features revealed more promising material beneath than ever her youth had done  but swithin was hopelessly her junior  unhappily for her he had now just arrived at an age whose canon of faith it is that the silly period of womans life is her only period of beauty  viviette saw it all and knew that time had at last brought about his revenges  she had tremblingly watched and waited without sleep ever since swithin had reentered welland and it was for this  swithin came forward and took her by the hand which she passively allowed him to do  swithin you dont love me she said simply  o viviette  you dont love me she repeated  dont say it  yes but i will you have a right not to love me  you did once  but now i am an old woman and you are still a young man so how can you love me  i do not expect it  it is kind and charitable of you to come and see me here  i have come all the way from the cape he faltered for her insistence took all power out of him to deny in mere politeness what she said  yes you have come from the cape but not for me she answered  it would be absurd if you had come for me  you have come because your work there is finished     i like to sit here with my little boyit is a pleasant spot  it was once something to us was it not but that was long ago  you scarcely knew me for the same woman did you  knew youyes of course i knew you  you looked as if you did not  but you must not be surprised at me  i belong to an earlier generation than you remember  thus in sheer bitterness of spirit did she inflict wounds on herself by exaggerating the difference in their years  but she had nevertheless spoken truly  sympathize with her as he might and as he unquestionably did he loved her no longer  but why had she expected otherwise  o woman might a prophet have said to her great is thy faith if thou believest a junior lovers love will last five years  i shall be glad to know through your grandmother how you are getting on she said meekly  but now i would much rather that we part  yes do not question me  i would rather that we part  goodbye  hardly knowing what he did he touched her hand and obeyed  he was a scientist and took words literally  there is something in the inexorably simple logic of such men which partakes of the cruelty of the natural laws that are their study  he entered the towersteps and mechanically descended and it was not till he got halfway down that he thought she could not mean what she had said  before leaving cape town he had made up his mind on this one point that if she were willing to marry him marry her he would without let or hindrance  that much he morally owed her and was not the man to demur and though the swithin who had returned was not quite the swithin who had gone away though he could not now love her with the sort of love he had once bestowed he believed that all her conduct had been dictated by the purest benevolence to him by that charity which seeketh not her own hence he did not flinch from a wish to deal with lovingkindness towards hera sentiment perhaps in the longrun more to be prized than lovers love  her manner had caught him unawares but now recovering himself he turned back determinedly  bursting out upon the roof he clasped her in his arms and kissed her several times  viviette viviette he said i have come to marry you  she uttered a shrieka shriek of amazed joysuch as never was heard on that tower before or sinceand fell in his arms clasping his neck  there she lay heavily  not to disturb her he sat down in her seat still holding her fast  their little son who had stood with round conjectural eyes throughout the meeting now came close and presently looking up to swithin said  mother has gone to sleep  swithin looked down and started  her tight clasp had loosened  a wave of whiteness like that of marble which had never seen the sun crept up from her neck and travelled upwards and onwards over her cheek lips eyelids forehead temples its margin banishing back the live pink till the latter had entirely disappeared  seeing that something was wrong yet not understanding what the little boy began to cry but in his concentration swithin hardly heard it vivietteviviette he said  the child cried with still deeper grief and after a momentary hesitation pushed his hand into swithins for protection  hush hush my child said swithin distractedly  ill take care of you  o viviette he exclaimed again pressing her face to his  but she did not reply  what can this be he asked himself  he would not then answer according to his fear  he looked up for help  nobody appeared in sight but tabitha lark who was skirting the field with a bounding treadthe single bright spot of colour and animation within the wide horizon  when he looked down again his fear deepened to certainty  it was no longer a mere surmise that help was vain  sudden joy after despair had touched an overstrained heart too smartly  viviette was dead  the bishop was avenged
