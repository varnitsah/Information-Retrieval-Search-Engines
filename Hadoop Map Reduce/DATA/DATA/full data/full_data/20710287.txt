20710287	aaron trow  by anthony trollope     i would wish to declare at the beginning of this story that i shall never regard that cluster of islets which we call bermuda as the fortunate islands of the ancients  do not let professional geographers take me up and say that no one has so accounted them and that the ancients have never been supposed to have gotten themselves so far westwards  what i mean to assert is thisthat had any ancient been carried thither by enterprise or stress of weather he would not have given those islands so good a name  that the neapolitan sailors of king alonzo should have been wrecked here i consider to be more likely  the vexed bermoothes is a good name for them  there is no getting in or out of them without the greatest difficulty and a patient slow navigation which is very heartrending  that caliban should have lived here i can imagine that ariel would have been sick of the place is certain and that governor prospero should have been willing to abandon his governorship i conceive to have been only natural  when one regards the present state of the place one is tempted to doubt whether any of the governors have been conjurors since his days  bermuda as all the world knows is a british colony at which we maintain a convict establishment  most of our outlying convict establishments have been sent back upon our hands from our colonies but here one is still maintained  there is also in the islands a strong military fortress though not a fortress looking magnificent to the eyes of civilians as do malta and gibraltar  there are also here some six thousand white people and some six thousand black people eating drinking sleeping and dying  the convict establishment is the most notable feature of bermuda to a stranger but it does not seem to attract much attention from the regular inhabitants of the place  there is no intercourse between the prisoners and the bermudians  the convicts are rarely seen by them and the convict islands are rarely visited  as to the prisoners themselves of course it is not open to themor should not be open to themto have intercourse with any but the prison authorities  there have however been instances in which convicts have escaped from their confinement and made their way out among the islands poor wretches  as a rule there is but little chance for any that can so escape  the whole length of the cluster is but twenty miles and the breadth is under four  the prisoners are of course white men and the lower orders of bermuda among whom alone could a runagate have any chance of hiding himself are all negroes so that such a one would be known at once  their clothes are all marked their only chance of a permanent escape would be in the hold of an american ship but what captain of an american or other ship would willingly encumber himself with an escaped convict  but nevertheless men have escaped and in one instance i believe a convict got away so that of him no farther tidings were ever heard  for the truth of the following tale i will not by any means vouch if one were to inquire on the spot one might probably find that the ladies all believe it and the old men that all the young men know exactly how much of it is false and how much true and that the steady middleaged welltodo islanders are quite convinced that it is romance from beginning to end  my readers may range themselves with the ladies the young men or the steady wellto do middleaged islanders as they please  some years ago soon after the prison was first established on its present footing three men did escape from it and among them a certain notorious prisoner named aaron trow  trows antecedents in england had not been so villanously bad as those of many of his fellowconvicts though the one offence for which he was punished had been of a deep dye  he had shed mans blood  at a period of great distress in a manufacturing town he had led men on to riot and with his own hand had slain the first constable who had endeavoured to do his duty against him  there had been courage in the doing of the deed and probably no malice but the deed let its moral blackness have been what it might had sent him to bermuda with a sentence against him of penal servitude for life  had he been then amenable to prison disciplineeven then with such a sentence against him as thathe might have won his way back after the lapse of years to the children and perhaps to the wife that he had left behind him but he was amenable to no rulesto no discipline  his heart was sore to death with an idea of injury and he lashed himself against the bars of his cage with a feeling that it would be well if he could so lash himself till he might perish in his fury  and then a day came in which an attempt was made by a large body of convicts under his leadership to get the better of the officers of the prison  it is hardly necessary to say that the attempt failed such attempts always fail  it failed on this occasion signally and trow with two other men were condemned to be scourged terribly and then kept in solitary confinement for some lengthened term of months  before however the day of scourging came trow and his two associates had escaped  i have not the space to tell how this was effected nor the power to describe the manner  they did escape from the establishment into the islands and though two of them were taken after a single days run at liberty aaron trow had not been yet retaken even when a week was over  when a month was over he had not been retaken and the officers of the prison began to say that he had got away from them in a vessel to the states  it was impossible they said that he should have remained in the islands and not been discovered  it was not impossible that he might have destroyed himself leaving his body where it had not yet been found  but he could not have lived on in bermuda during that months search  so at least said the officers of the prison  there was however a report through the islands that he had been seen from time to time that he had gotten bread from the negroes at night threatening them with death if they told of his whereabouts and that all the clothes of the mate of a vessel had been stolen while the man was bathing including a suit of dark blue cloth in which suit of clothes or in one of such a nature a stranger had been seen skulking about the rocks near st george  all this the governor of the prison affected to disbelieve but the opinion was becoming very rife in the islands that aaron trow was still there  a vigilant search however is a task of great labour and cannot be kept up for ever  by degrees it was relaxed  the warders and gaolers ceased to patrol the island roads by night and it was agreed that aaron trow was gone or that he would be starved to death or that he would in time be driven to leave such traces of his whereabouts as must lead to his discovery and this at last did turn out to be the fact  there is a sort of prettiness about these islands which though it never rises to the loveliness of romantic scenery is nevertheless attractive in its way  the land breaks itself into little knolls and the sea runs up hither and thither in a thousand creeks and inlets and then too when the oleanders are in bloom they give a wonderfully bright colour to the landscape  oleanders seem to be the roses of bermuda and are cultivated round all the villages of the better class through the islands  there are two towns st george and hamilton and one main highroad which connects them but even this highroad is broken by a ferry over which every vehicle going from st george to hamilton must be conveyed  most of the locomotion in these parts is done by boats and the residents look to the sea with its narrow creeks as their best highway from their farms to their best market  in those daysand those days were not very long sincethe building of small ships was their chief trade and they valued their land mostly for the small scrubby cedartrees with which this trade was carried on  as one goes from st george to hamilton the road runs between two seas that to the right is the ocean that on the left is an inland creek which runs up through a large portion of the islands so that the land on the other side of it is near to the traveller  for a considerable portion of the way there are no houses lying near the road and there is one residence some way from the road so secluded that no other house lies within a mile of it by land  by water it might probably be reached within half a mile  this place was called crump island and here lived and had lived for many years an old gentleman a native of bermuda whose business it had been to buy up cedar wood and sell it to the shipbuilders at hamilton  in our story we shall not have very much to do with old mr bergen but it will be necessary to say a word or two about his house  it stood upon what would have been an island in the creek had not a narrow causeway barely broad enough for a road joined it to that larger island on which stands the town of st george  as the main road approaches the ferry it runs through some rough hilly open ground which on the right side towards the ocean has never been cultivated  the distance from the ocean here may perhaps be a quarter of a mile and the ground is for the most part covered with low furze  on the left of the road the land is cultivated in patches and here some half mile or more from the ferry a path turns away to crump island  the house cannot be seen from the road and indeed can hardly be seen at all except from the sea  it lies perhaps three furlongs from the high road and the path to it is but little used as the passage to and from it is chiefly made by water  here at the time of our story lived mr bergen and here lived mr bergens daughter  miss bergen was well known at st georges as a steady good girl who spent her time in looking after her fathers household matters in managing his two black maidservants and the black gardener and who did her duty in that sphere of life to which she had been called  she was a comely wellshaped young woman with a sweet countenance rather large in size and very quiet in demeanour  in her earlier years when young girls usually first bud forth into womanly beauty the neighbours had not thought much of anastasia bergen nor had the young men of st george been wont to stay their boats under the window of crump cottage in order that they might listen to her voice or feel the light of her eye but slowly as years went by anastasia bergen became a woman that a man might well love and a man learned to love her who was well worthy of a womans heart  this was caleb morton the presbyterian minister of st george and caleb morton had been engaged to marry miss bergen for the last two years past at the period of aaron trows escape from prison  caleb morton was not a native of bermuda but had been sent thither by the synod of his church from nova scotia  he was a tall handsome man at this time of some thirty years of age of a presence which might almost have been called commanding  he was very strong but of a temperament which did not often give him opportunity to put forth his strength and his life had been such that neither he nor others knew of what nature might be his courage the greater part of his life was spent in preaching to some few of the white people around him and in teaching as many of the blacks as he could get to hear him  his days were very quiet and had been altogether without excitement until he had met with anastasia bergen  it will suffice for us to say that he did meet her and that now for two years past they had been engaged as man and wife  old mr bergen when he heard of the engagement was not well pleased at the information  in the first place his daughter was very necessary to him and the idea of her marrying and going away had hardly as yet occurred to him and then he was by no means inclined to part with any of his money  it must not be presumed that he had amassed a fortune by his trade in cedar wood  few tradesmen in bermuda do as i imagine amass fortunes  of some few hundred pounds he was possessed and these in the course of nature would go to his daughter when he died but he had no inclination to hand any portion of them over to his daughter before they did go to her in the course of nature  now the income which caleb morton earned as a presbyterian clergyman was not large and therefore no day had been fixed as yet for his marriage with anastasia  but though the old man had been from the first averse to the match his hostility had not been active  he had not forbidden mr morton his house or affected to be in any degree angry because his daughter had a lover  he had merely grumbled forth an intimation that those who marry in haste repent at leisurethat love kept nobody warm if the pot did not boil and that as for him it was as much as he could do to keep his own pot boiling at crump cottage in answer to this anastasia said nothing  she asked him for no money but still kept his accounts managed his household and looked patiently forward for better days  old mr bergen himself spent much of his time at hamilton where he had a woodyard with a couple of rooms attached to it  it was his custom to remain here three nights of the week during which anastasia was left alone at the cottage and it happened by no means seldom that she was altogether alone for the negro whom they called the gardener would go to her fathers place at hamilton and the two black girls would crawl away up to the road tired with the monotony of the sea at the cottage  caleb had more than once told her that she was too much alone but she had laughed at him saying that solitude in bermuda was not dangerous  nor indeed was it for the people are quiet and wellmannered lacking much energy but being in the same degree free from any propensity to violence  so you are going she said to her lover one evening as he rose from the chair on which he had been swinging himself at the door of the cottage which looks down over the creek of the sea  he had sat there for an hour talking to her as she worked or watching her as she moved about the place  it was a beautiful evening and the sun had been falling to rest with almost tropical glory before his feet the bright oleanders were red with their blossoms all around him and he had thoroughly enjoyed his hour of easy rest  so you are going she said to him not putting her work out of her hand as he rose to depart  yes and it is time for me to go  i have still work to do before i can get to bed  ah well i suppose the day will come at last when i need not leave you as soon as my hour of rest is over  come of course it will come  that is if your reverence should choose to wait for it another ten years or so  i believe you would not mind waiting twenty years  not if a certain friend of mine would come down and see me of evenings when im alone after the day  it seems to me that i shouldnt mind waiting as long as i had that to look for  you are right not to be impatient he said to her after a pause as he held her hand before he went  quite right  i only wish i could school myself to be as easy about it  i did not say i was easy said anastasia  people are seldom easy in this world i take it  i said i could be patient  do not look in that way as though you pretended that you were dissatisfied with me  you know that i am true to you and you ought to be very proud of me  i am proud of you anastasia on hearing which she got up and courtesied to him  i am proud of you so proud of you that i feel you should not be left here all alone with no one to help you if you were in trouble  women dont get into trouble as men do and do not want any one to help them  if you were alone in the house you would have to go to bed without your supper because you could not make a basin of boiled milk ready for your own meal  now when your reverence has gone i shall go to work and have my tea comfortably  and then he did go bidding god bless her as he left her  three hours after that he was disturbed in his own lodgings by one of the negro girls from the cottage rushing to his door and begging him in heavens name to come down to the assistance of her mistress  when morton left her anastasia did not proceed to do as she had said and seemed to have forgotten her evening meal  she had been working sedulously with her needle during all that last conversation but when her lover was gone she allowed the work to fall from her hands and sat motionless for awhile gazing at the last streak of colour left by the setting sun but there was no longer a sign of its glory to be traced in the heavens around her the twilight in bermuda is not long and enduring as it is with us though the daylight does not depart suddenly leaving the darkness of night behind it without any intermediate time of warning as is the case farther south down among the islands of the tropics  but the soft sweet light of the evening had waned and gone and night had absolutely come upon her while anastasia was still seated before the cottage with her eyes fixed upon the white streak of motionless sea which was still visible through the gloom  she was thinking of him of his ways of life of his happiness and of her duty towards him  she had told him with her pretty feminine falseness that she could wait without impatience but now she said to herself that it would not be good for him to wait longer  he lived alone and without comfort working very hard for his poor pittance and she could see and feel and understand that a companion in his life was to him almost a necessity  she would tell her father that all this must be brought to an end  she would not ask him for money but she would make him understand that her services must at any rate in part be transferred  why should not she and morton still live at the cottage when they were married and so thinking and at last resolving she sat there till the dark night fell upon her  she was at last disturbed by feeling a mans hand upon her shoulder she jumped from her chair and faced himnot screaming for it was especially within her power to control herself and to make no utterance except with forethought  perhaps it might have been better for her had she screamed and sent a shrill shriek down the shore of that inland sea  she was silent however and with awe struck face and outstretched hands gazed into the face of him who still held her by the shoulder  the night was dark but her eyes were now accustomed to the darkness and she could see indistinctly something of his features  he was a lowsized man dressed in a suit of sailors blue clothing with a rough cap of hair on his head and a beard that had not been clipped for many weeks  his eyes were large and hollow and frightfully bright so that she seemed to see nothing else of him but she felt the strength of his fingers as he grasped her tighter and more tightly by the arm  who are you she said after a moments pause  do you know me he asked  know you  no  but the words were hardly out of her mouth before it struck her that the man was aaron trow of whom every one in bermuda had been talking  come into the house he said and give me food  and he still held her with his hand as though he would compel her to follow him  she stood for a moment thinking what she would say to him for even then with that terrible man standing close to her in the darkness her presence of mind did not desert her  surely she said i will give you food if you are hungry  but take your hand from me no man would lay his hands on a woman  a woman said the stranger  what does the starved wolf care for that  a womans blood is as sweet to him as that of a man  come into the house i tell you  and then she preceded him through the open door into the narrow passage and thence to the kitchen  there she saw that the back door leading out on the other side of the house was open and she knew that he had come down from the road and entered on that side  she threw her eyes around looking for the negro girls but they were away and she remembered that there was no human being within sound of her voice but this man who had told her that he was as a wolf thirsty after her blood  give me food at once he said  and will you go if i give it you she asked  i will knock out your brains if you do not he replied lifting from the grate a short thick poker which lay there  do as i bid you at once  you also would be like a tiger if you had fasted for two days as i have done  she could see as she moved across the kitchen that he had already searched there for something that he might eat but that he had searched in vain  with the close economy common among his class in the islands all comestibles were kept under close lock and key in the house of mr bergen  their daily allowance was given day by day to the negro servants and even the fragments were then gathered up and locked away in safety  she moved across the kitchen to the accustomed cupboard taking the keys from her pocket and he followed close upon her  there was a small oil lamp hanging from the low ceiling which just gave them light to see each other  she lifted her hand to this to tare it from its hook but he prevented her  no by heaven he said you dont touch that till ive done with it  theres light enough for you to drag out your scraps  she did drag out her scraps and a bowl of milk which might hold perhaps a quart  there was a fragment of bread a morsel of cold potatocake and the bone of a leg of kid  and is that all said he  but as he spoke he fleshed his teeth against the bone as a dog would have done  it is the best i have she said i wish it were better and you should have had it without violence as you have suffered so long from hunger  bah  better yes  you would give the best no doubt and set the hell hounds on my track the moment i am gone  i know how much i might expect from your charity  i would have fed you for pitys sake she answered  pity  who are you that you should dare to pity me  by  my young woman it is i that pity you  i must cut your throat unless you give me money  do you know that  money  i have got no money  ill make you have some before i go  come dont move till i have done  and as he spoke to her he went on tugging at the bone and swallowing the lumps of stale bread  he had already finished the bowl of milk  and now said he tell me who i am  i suppose you are aaron trow she answered very slowly  he said nothing on hearing this but continued his meal standing close to her so that she might not possibly escape from him out into the darkness  twice or thrice in those few minutes she made up her mind to make such an attempt feeling that it would be better to leave him in possession of the house and make sure if possible of her own life  there was no money there not a dollar  what money her father kept in his possession was locked up in his safe at hamilton and might he not keep to his threat and murder her when he found that she could give him nothing  she did not tremble outwardly as she stood there watching him as he ate but she thought how probable it might be that her last moments were very near  and yet she could scrutinise his features form and garments so as to carry away in her mind a perfect picture of them  aaron trowfor of course it was the escaped convictwas not a man of frightful hideous aspect had the world used him well giving him when he was young ample wages and separating him from turbulent spirits he also might have used the world well and then women would have praised the brightness of his eye and the manly vigour of his brow  but things had not gone well with him  he had been separated from the wife he had loved and the children who had been raised at his knee separated by his own violence and now as he had said of himself he was a wolf rather than a man  as he stood there satisfying the craving of his appetite breaking up the large morsels of food he was an object very sad to be seen  hunger had made him gaunt and yellow he was squalid with the dirt of his hidden lair and he had the look of a beastthat look to which men fall when they live like the brutes of prey as outcasts from their brethren  but still there was that about his brow which might have redeemed himwhich might have turned her horror into pity had he been willing that it should be so  and now give me some brandy he said  there was brandy in the housein the sittingroom which was close at their hand and the key of the little press which held it was in her pocket  it was useless she thought to refuse him and so she told him that there was a bottle partly full but that she must go to the next room to fetch it him  well go together my darling he said  theres nothing like good company  and he again put his hand upon her arm as they passed into the family sittingroom  i must take the light she said  but he unhooked it himself and carried it in his own hand  again she went to work without trembling  she found the key of the side cupboard and unlocking the door handed him a bottle which might contain about halfapint of spirits  and is that all he said  there is a full bottle here she answered handing him another but if you drink it you will be drunk and they will catch you  by heavens yes and you would be the first to help them would you not  look here she answered  if you will go now i will not say a word to any one of your coming nor set them on your track to follow you  there take the full bottle with you  if you will go you shall be safe from me  what and go without money  i have none to give you  you may believe me when i say so  i have not a dollar in the house  before he spoke again he raised the half empty bottle to his mouth and drank as long as there was a drop to drink  there said he putting the bottle down i am better after that  as to the other you are right and i will take it with me  and now young woman about the money  i tell you that i have not a dollar  look here said he and he spoke now in a softer voice as though he would be on friendly terms with her  give me ten sovereigns and i will go  i know you have it and with ten sovereigns it is possible that i may save my life  you are good and would not wish that a man should die so horrid a death  i know you are good come give me the money  and he put his hands up beseeching her and looked into her face with imploring eyes  on the word of a christian woman i have not got money to give you she replied  nonsense  and as he spoke he took her by the arm and shook her he shook her violently so that he hurt her and her breath for a moment was all but gone from her  i tell you you must make dollars before i leave you or i will so handle you that it would have been better for you to coin your very blood  may god help me at my need she said as i have not above a few penny pieces in the house  and you expect me to believe that  look here  i will shake the teeth out of your head but i will have it from you  and he did shake her again using both his hands and striking her against the wall  would youmurder me she said hardly able now to utter the words  murder you yes why not  i cannot be worse than i am were i to murder you ten times over  but with money i may possibly be better  i have it not  then i will do worse than murder you  i will make you such an object that all the world shall loathe to look on you  and so saying he took her by the arm and dragged her forth from the wall against which she had stood  then there came from her a shriek that was heard far down the shore of that silent sea and away across to the solitary houses of those living on the other sidea shriek very sad sharp and prolongedwhich told plainly to those who heard it of womans woe when in her extremest peril  that sound was spoken of in bermuda for many a day after that as something which had been terrible to hear  but then at that moment as it came wailing through the dark it sounded as though it were not human  of those who heard it not one guessed from whence it came nor was the hand of any brother put forward to help that woman at her need  did you hear that said the young wife to her husband from the far side of the arm of the sea  hear it  oh heaven yes  whence did it come  the young wife could not say from whence it came but clung close to her husbands breast comforting herself with the knowledge that that terrible sorrow was not hers  but aid did come at last or rather that which seemed as aid  long and terrible was the fight between that human beast of prey and the poor victim which had fallen into his talons  anastasia bergen was a strong wellbuilt woman and now that the time had come to her when a struggle was necessary a struggle for life for honour for the happiness of him who was more to her than herself she fought like a tigress attacked in her own lair  at such a moment as this she also could become wild and savage as the beast of the forest when he pinioned her arms with one of his as he pressed her down upon the floor she caught the first joint of the forefinger of his other hand between her teeth till he yelled in agony and another sound was heard across the silent water  and then when one hand was loosed in the struggle she twisted it through his long hair and dragged back his head till his eyes were nearly starting from their sockets  anastasia bergen had hitherto been a sheer woman all feminine in her nature  but now the foam came to her mouth and fire sprang from her eyes and the muscles of her body worked as though she had been trained to deeds of violence  of violence aaron trow had known much in his rough life but never had he combated with harder antagonist than her whom he now held beneath his breast  byi will put an end to you he exclaimed in his wrath as he struck her violently across the face with his elbow  his hand was occupied and he could not use it for a blow but nevertheless the violence was so great that the blood gushed from her nostrils while the back of her head was driven with violence against the floor but she did not lose her hold of him  her hand was still twined closely through his thick hair and in every move he made she clung to him with all her might  leave go my hair he shouted at her but she still kept her hold though he again dashed her head against the floor  there was still light in the room for when he first grasped her with both his hands he had put the lamp down on a small table  now they were rolling on the floor together and twice he had essayed to kneel on her that he might thus crush the breath from her body and deprive her altogether of her strength but she had been too active for him moving herself along the ground though in doing so she dragged him with her  but by degrees he got one hand at liberty and with that he pulled a clasp knife out of his pocket and opened it  i will cut your head off if you do not let go my hair he said  but still she held fast by him  he then stabbed at her arm using his left hand and making short ineffectual blows  her dress partly saved her and partly also the continual movement of all her limbs but nevertheless the knife wounded her  it wounded her in several places about the arm covering them both with bloodbut still she hung on  so close was her grasp in her agony that as she afterwards found she cut the skin of her own hands with her own nails  had the mans hair been less thick or strong or her own tenacity less steadfast he would have murdered her before any interruption could have saved her  and yet he had not purposed to murder her or even in the first instance to inflict on her any bodily harm  but he had been determined to get money  with such a sum of money as he had named it might he thought be possible for him to win his way across to america  he might bribe men to hide him in the hold of a ship and thus there might be for him at any rate a possibility of escape that there must be money in the house he had still thought when first he laid hands on the poor woman and then when the struggle had once begun when he had felt her muscles contending with his the passion of the beast was aroused within him and he strove against her as he would have striven against a dog  but yet when the knife was in his hand he had not driven it against her heart  then suddenly while they were yet rolling on the floor there was a sound of footsteps in the passage  aaron trow instantly leaped to his feet leaving his victim on the ground with huge lumps of his thick clotted hair in her hand  thus and thus only could he have liberated himself from her grasp  he rushed at the door and there he came against the two negro servantgirls who had returned down to their kitchen from the road on which they had been straying  trow as he half saw them in the dark not knowing how many there might be or whether there was a man among them rushed through them upsetting one scared girl in his passage  with the instinct and with the timidity of a beast his impulse now was to escape and he hurried away back to the road and to his lair leaving the three women together in the cottage  poor wretch  as he crossed the road not skulking in his impotent haste but running at his best another pair of eyes saw him and when the search became hot after him it was known that his hidingplace was not distant  it was some time before any of the women were able to act and when some step was taken anastasia was the first to take it  she had not absolutely swooned but the reaction after the violence of her efforts was so great that for some minutes she had been unable to speak  she had risen from the floor when trow left her and had even followed him to the door but since that she had fallen back into her fathers old armchair and there sat gasping not only for words but for breath also  at last she bade one of the girls to run into st george and beg mr morton to come to her aid  the girl would not stir without her companion and even then anastasia covered as she was with blood with dishevelled hair and her clothes half torn from her body accompanied them as far as the road  there they found a negro lad still hanging about the place and he told them that he had seen the man cross the road and run down over the open ground towards the rocks of the seacoast  he must be there said the lad pointing in the direction of a corner of the rocks unless he swim across the mouth of the ferry  but the mouth of that ferry is an arm of the sea and it was not probable that a man would do that when he might have taken the narrow water by keeping on the other side of the road  at about one that night caleb morton reached the cottage breathless with running and before a word was spoken between them anastasia had fallen on his shoulder and had fainted  as soon as she was in the arms of her lover all her power had gone from her  the spirit and passion of the tiger had gone and she was again a weak woman shuddering at the thought of what she had suffered  she remembered that she had had the mans hand between her teeth and by degrees she found his hair still clinging to her fingers but even then she could hardly call to mind the nature of the struggle she had undergone  his hot breath close to her own cheek she did remember and his glaring eyes and even the roughness of his beard as he pressed his face against her own but she could not say whence had come the blood nor till her arm became stiff and motionless did she know that she had been wounded  it was all joy with her now as she sat motionless without speaking while he administered to her wants and spoke words of love into her ears  she remembered the mans horrid threat and knew that by gods mercy she had been saved  and he was there caressing her loving her comforting her  as she thought of the fate that had threatened her of the evil that had been so imminent she fell forward on her knees and with incoherent sobs uttered her thanksgivings while her head was still supported on his arms  it was almost morning before she could induce herself to leave him and lie down  with him she seemed to be so perfectly safe but the moment he was away she could see aaron trows eyes gleaming at her across the room  at last however she slept and when he saw that she was at rest he told himself that his work must then begin hitherto caleb morton had lived in all respects the life of a man of peace but now asking himself no questions as to the propriety of what he would do using no inward arguments as to this or that line of conduct he girded the sword on his loins and prepared himself for war  the wretch who had thus treated the woman whom he loved should be hunted down like a wild beast as long as he had arms and legs with which to carry on the hunt  he would pursue the miscreant with any weapons that might come to his hands and might heaven help him at his need as he dealt forth punishment to that man if he caught him within his grasp  those who had hitherto known morton in the island could not recognise the man as he came forth on that day thirsty after blood and desirous to thrust himself into personal conflict with the wild ruffian who had injured him  the meek presbyterian minister had been a preacher preaching ways of peace and living in accordance with his own doctrines  the world had been very quiet for him and he had walked quietly in his appointed path  but now the world was quiet no longer nor was there any preaching of peace  his cry was for blood for the blood of the untamed savage brute who had come upon his young doe in her solitude and striven with such brutal violence to tear her heart from her bosom  he got to his assistance early in the morning some of the constables from st george and before the day was over he was joined by two or three of the warders from the convict establishment  there was with him also a friend or two and thus a party was formed numbering together ten or twelve persons  they were of course all armed and therefore it might be thought that there would be but small chance for the wretched man if they should come upon his track  at first they all searched together thinking from the tidings which had reached them that he must be near to them but gradually they spread themselves along the rocks between st george and the ferry keeping watchman on the road so that he should not escape unnoticed into the island  ten times during the day did anastasia send from the cottage up to morton begging him to leave the search to others and come down to her  but not for a moment would he lose the scent of his prey what should it be said that she had been so treated and that others had avenged her  he sent back to say that her father was with her now and that he would come when his work was over  and in that job of work the lifeblood of aaron trow was counted up  towards evening they were all congregated on the road near to the spot at which the path turns off towards the cottage when a voice was heard hallooing to them from the summit of a little hill which lies between the road and the sea on the side towards the ferry and presently a boy came running down to them full of news  danny lund has seen him said the boy he has seen him plainly in among the rocks  and then came danny lund himself a small negro lad about fourteen years of age who was known in those parts as the idlest most dishonest and most useless of his race  on this occasion however danny lund became important and every one listened to him he had seen he said a pair of eyes moving down in a cave of the rocks which he well knew  he had been in the cave often he said and could get there again  but not now not while that pair of eyes was moving at the bottom of it  and so they all went up over the hill morton leading the way with hot haste  in his waistband he held a pistol and his hand grasped a short iron bar with which he had armed himself  they ascended the top of the hill and when there the open sea was before them on two sides and on the third was the narrow creek over which the ferry passed  immediately beneath their feet were the broken rocks for on that side towards the sea the earth and grass of the hill descended but a little way towards the water  down among the rocks they all went silently caleb morton leading the way and danny lund directing him from behind  mr morton said an elderly man from st george had you not better let the warders of the gaol go first he is a desperate man and they will best understand his ways  in answer to this morton said nothing but he would let no one put a foot before him  he still pressed forward among the rocks and at last came to a spot from whence he might have sprung at one leap into the ocean  it was a broken cranny on the seashore into which the sea beat and surrounded on every side but the one by huge broken fragments of stone which at first sight seemed as though they would have admitted of a path down among them to the waters edge but which when scanned more closely were seen to be so large in size that no man could climb from one to another  it was a singularly romantic spot but now well known to them all there for they had visited it over and over again that morning  in there said danny lund keeping well behind mortons body and pointing at the same time to a cavern high up among the rocks but quite on the opposite side of the little inlet of the sea  the mouth of the cavern was not twenty yards from where they stood but at the first sight it seemed as though it must be impossible to reach it  the precipice on the brink of which they all now stood ran down sheer into the sea and the fall from the mouth of the cavern on the other side was as steep  but danny solved the mystery by pointing upwards and showing them how he had been used to climb to a projecting rock over their heads and from thence creep round by certain vantages of the stone till he was able to let himself down into the aperture  but now at the present moment he was unwilling to make essay of his prowess as a cragsman  he had he said been up on that projecting rock thrice and there had seen the eyes moving in the cavern  he was quite sure of that fact of the pair of eyes and declined to ascend the rock again  traces soon became visible to them by which they knew that some one had passed in and out of the cavern recently  the stone when examined bore those marks of friction which passage and repassage over it will always give  at the spot from whence the climber left the platform and commenced his ascent the side of the stone had been rubbed by the close friction of a mans body  a light boy like danny lund might find his way in and out without leaving such marks behind him but no heavy man could do so  thus before long they all were satisfied that aaron trow was in the cavern before them  then there was a long consultation as to what they would do to carry on the hunt and how they would drive the tiger from his lair  that he should not again come out except to fall into their hands was to all of them a matter of course  they would keep watch and ward there though it might be for days and nights  but that was a process which did not satisfy morton and did not indeed well satisfy any of them  it was not only that they desired to inflict punishment on the miscreant in accordance with the law but also that they did not desire that the miserable man should die in a hole like a starved dog and that then they should go after him to take out his wretched skeleton  there was something in that idea so horrid in every way that all agreed that active steps must be taken  the warders of the prison felt that they would all be disgraced if they could not take their prisoner alive  yet who would get round that perilous ledge in the face of such an adversary  a touch to any man while climbing there would send him headlong down among the wave  and then his fancy told to each what might be the nature of an embrace with such an animal as that driven to despair hopeless of life armed as they knew at any rate with a knife  if the first adventurous spirit should succeed in crawling round that ledge what would be the reception which he might expect in the terrible depth of that cavern  they called to their prisoner bidding him come out and telling him that they would fire in upon him if he did not show himself but not a sound was heard  it was indeed possible that they should send their bullets to perhaps every corner of the cavern and if so in that way they might slaughter him but even of this they were not sure  who could tell that there might not be some protected nook in which he could lay secure  and who could tell when the man was struck or whether he were wounded  i will get to him said morton speaking with a low dogged voice and so saying he clambered up to the rock to which danny lund had pointed  many voices at once attempted to restrain him and one or two put their hands upon him to keep him back but he was too quick for them and now stood upon the ledge of rock  can you see him they asked below  i can see nothing within the cavern said morton  look down very hard massa said danny very hard indeed down in deep dark hole and then see him big eyes moving  morton now crept along the ledge or rather he was beginning to do so having put forward his shoulders and arms to make a first step in advance from the spot on which he was resting when a hand was put forth from one corner of the caverns moutha hand armed with a pistoland a shot was fired  there could be no doubt now but that danny lund was right and no doubt now as to the whereabouts of aaron trow  a hand was put forth a pistol was fired and caleb morton still clinging to a corner of the rock with both his arms was seen to falter  he is wounded said one of the voices from below and then they all expected to see him fall into the sea  but he did not fall and after a moment or two he proceeded carefully to pick his steps along the ledge  the ball had touched him grazing his cheek and cutting through the light whiskers that he wore but he had not felt it though the blow had nearly knocked him from his perch  and then four or five shots were fired from the rocks into the mouth of the cavern  the mans arm had been seen and indeed one or two declared that they had traced the dim outline of his figure  but no sound was heard to come from the cavern except the sharp crack of the bullets against the rock and the echo of the gunpowder  there had been no groan as of a man wounded no sound of a body falling no voice wailing in despair  for a few seconds all was dark with the smoke of the gunpowder and then the empty mouth of the cave was again yawning before their eyes  morton was now near it still cautiously creeping  the first danger to which he was exposed was this that his enemy within the recess might push him down from the rocks with a touch  but on the other hand there were three or four men ready to fire the moment that a hand should be put forth and then morton could swimwas known to be a strong swimmerwhereas of aaron trow it was already declared by the prison gaolers that he could not swim  two of the warders had now followed morton on the rocks so that in the event of his making good his entrance into the cavern and holding his enemy at bay for a minute he would be joined by aid  it was strange to see how those different men conducted themselves as they stood on the opposite platform watching the attack  the officers from the prison had no other thought but of their prisoner and were intent on taking him alive or dead  to them it was little or nothing what became of morton  it was their business to encounter peril and they were ready to do sofeeling however by no means sorry to have such a man as morton in advance of them very little was said by them  they had their wits about them and remembered that every word spoken for the guidance of their ally would be heard also by the escaped convict  their prey was sure sooner or later and had not morton been so eager in his pursuit they would have waited till some plan had been devised of trapping him without danger  but the townsmen from st george of whom some dozen were now standing there were quick and eager and loud in their counsels  stay where you are mr mortonstay awhile for the love of godor hell have you down  nows your time caleb in on him now and youll have him  close with him morton close with him at once its your only chance  theres four of us here well fire on him if he as much as shows a limb  all of which words as they were heard by that poor wretch within must have sounded to him as the barking of a pack of hounds thirsting for his blood  for him at any rate there was no longer any hope in this world  my reader when chance has taken you into the huntingfield has it ever been your lot to sit by on horseback and watch the digging out of a fox  the operation is not an uncommon one and in some countries it is held to be in accordance with the rules of fair sport  for myself i think that when the brute has so far saved himself he should be entitled to the benefit of his cunning but i will not now discuss the propriety or impropriety of that practice in venery  i can never however watch the doing of that work without thinking much of the agonising struggles of the poor beast whose last refuge is being torn from over his head  there he lies within a few yards of his arch enemy the huntsman  the thick breath of the hounds make hot the air within his hole  the sound of their voices is close upon his ears  his breast is nearly bursting with the violence of that effort which at last has brought him to his retreat  and then pickaxe and mattock are plied above his head and nearer and more near to him press his foeshis double foes human and caninetill at last a huge hand grasps him and he is dragged forth among his enemies  almost as soon as his eyes have seen the light the eager noses of a dozen hounds have moistened themselves in his entrails  ah me  i know that he is vermin the vermin after whom i have been risking my neck with a bold ambition that i might ultimately witness his deathstruggles but nevertheless i would fain have saved him that last half hour of gradually diminished hope  and aaron trow was now like a hunted fox doomed to be dug out from his last refuge with this addition to his misery that these hounds when they caught their prey would not put him at once out of his misery  when first he saw that throng of men coming down from the hill top and resting on the platform he knew that his fate was come  when they called to him to surrender himself he was silent but he knew that his silence was of no avail  to them who were so eager to be his captors the matter seemed to be still one of considerable difficulty but to his thinking there was no difficulty  there were there some score of men fully armed within twenty yards of him  if he but showed a trace of his limbs he would become a mark for their bullets  and then if he were wounded and no one would come to him  if they allowed him to lie there without food till he perished  would it not be well for him to yield himself  then they called again and he was still silent  that idea of yielding is very terrible to the heart of a man  and when the worst had come to the worst did not the ocean run deep beneath his caverns month  but as they yelled at him and hallooed making their preparations for his death his presence of mind deserted the poor wretch  he had stolen an old pistol on one of his marauding expeditions of which one barrel had been loaded  that in his mad despair he had fired and now as he lay near the mouth of the cavern under the cover of the projecting stone he had no weapon with him but his hands  he had had a knife but that had dropped from him during the struggle on the floor of the cottage  he had now nothing but his hands and was considering how he might best use them in ridding himself of the first of his pursuers  the man was near him armed with all the power and majesty of right on his side whereas on his side aaron trow had nothingnot a hope  he raised his head that he might look forth and a dozen voices shouted as his face appeared above the aperture  a dozen weapons were levelled at him and he could see the gleaming of the muzzles of the guns  and then the foot of his pursuer was already on the corner stone at the caverns mouth  now caleb on him at once shouted a voice  ah me it was a moment in which to pity even such a man as aaron trow  now caleb at him at once shouted the voice  no by heavens not so even yet  the sound of triumph in those words raised the last burst of energy in the breast of that wretched man and he sprang forth head foremost from his prison house  forth he came manifest enough before the eyes of them all and with head well down and hands outstretched but with his wide glaring eyes still turned towards his pursuers as he fell he plunged down into the waves beneath him  two of those who stood by almost unconscious of what they did fired at his body as it made its rapid way to the water but as they afterwards found neither of the bullets struck him  morton when his prey thus leaped forth escaping him for awhile was already on the verge of the cavernhad even then prepared his foot for that onward spring which should bring him to the throat of his foe  but he arrested himself and for a moment stood there watching the body as it struck the water and hid itself at once beneath the ripple  he stood there for a moment watching the deed and its effect and then leaving his hold upon the rock he once again followed his quarry  down he went head foremost right on to the track in the waves which the other had made and when the two rose to the surface together each was struggling in the grasp of the other  it was a foolish nay a mad deed to do  the poor wretch who had first fallen could not have escaped  he could not even swim and had therefore flung himself to certain destruction when he took that leap from out of the caverns mouth  it would have been sad to see him perish beneath the wavesto watch him as he rose gasping for breath and then to see to him sinking again to rise again and then to go for ever  but his life had been fairly forfeitand why should one so much more precious have been flung after it  it was surely with no view of saving that pitiful life that caleb morton had leaped after his enemy  but the hound hot with the chase will follow the stag over the precipice and dash himself to pieces against the rocks  the beast thirsting for blood will rush in even among the weapons of men  morton in his fury had felt but one desire burned with but one passion  if the fates would but grant him to fix his clutches in the throat of the man who had illused his love for the rest it might all go as it would  in the earlier part of the morning while they were all searching for their victim they had brought a boat up into this very inlet among the rocks and the same boat had been at hand during the whole day  unluckily before they had come hither it had been taken round the headland to a place among the rocks at which a government skiff is always moored  the sea was still so quiet that there was hardly a ripple on it and the boat had been again sent for when first it was supposed that they had at last traced aaron trow to his hidingplace  anxiously now were all eyes turned to the headland but as yet no boat was there  the two men rose to the surface each struggling in the arms of the other  trow though he was in an element to which he was not used though he had sprung thither as another suicide might spring to certain death beneath a railway engine did not altogether lose his presence of mind  prompted by a double instinct he had clutched hold of mortons body when he encountered it beneath the waters  he held on to it as to his only protection and he held on to him also as to his only enemy  if there was a chance for a life struggle they would share that chance together and if not then together would they meet that other fate  caleb morton was a very strong man and though one of his arms was altogether encumbered by his antagonist his other arm and his legs were free  with these he seemed to succeed in keeping his head above the water weighted as he was with the body of his foe  but trows efforts were also used with the view of keeping himself above the water  though he had purposed to destroy himself in taking that leap and now hoped for nothing better than that they might both perish together he yet struggled to keep his head above the waves bodily power he had none left to him except that of holding on to mortons arm and plunging with his legs but he did hold on and thus both their heads remained above the surface  but this could not last long  it was easy to see that trows strength was nearly spent and that when he went down morton must go with him  if indeed they could be separatedif morton could once make himself free from that embrace into which he had been so anxious to leapthen indeed there might be a hope  all round that little inlet the rock fell sheer down into the deep sea so that there was no restingplace for a foot it but round the headlands on either side even within forty or fifty yards of that spot morton might rest on the rocks till a boat should come to his assistance to him that distance would have been nothing if only his limbs had been at liberty  upon the platform of rocks they were all at their wits ends  many were anxious to fire at trow but even if they hit him would mortons position have been better  would not the wounded man have still clung to him who was not wounded  and then there could be no certainty that any one of them would hit the right man  the ripple of the waves though it was very slight nevertheless sufficed to keep the bodies in motion and then too there was not among them any marksman peculiar for his skill  mortons efforts in the water were too severe to admit of his speaking but he could hear and understand the words which were addressed to him  shake him off caleb  strike him from you with your foot  swim to the right shore swim for it even if you take him with you  yes he could hear them all but hearing and obeying were very different  it was not easy to shake off that dying man and as for swimming with him that was clearly impossible  it was as much as he could do to keep his head above water let alone any attempt to move in one settled direction  for some four or five minutes they lay thus battling on the waves before the head of either of them went down  trow had been twice below the surface but it was before he had succeeded in supporting himself by mortons arm  now it seemed as though he must sink againas though both must sink  his mouth was barely kept above the water and as morton shook him with his arm the tide would pass over him  it was horrid to watch from the shore the glaring upturned eyes of the dying wretch as his long streaming hair lay back upon the wave  now caleb hold him down  hold him under was shouted in the voice of some eager friend  rising up on the water morton made a last effort to do as he was bid  he did press the mans head downwell down below the surfacebut still the hand clung to him and as he struck out against the water he was powerless against that grasp  then there came a loud shout along the shore and all those on the platform whose eyes had been fixed so closely on that terrible struggle beneath them rushed towards the rocks on the other coast the sound of oars was heard close to theman eager pressing stroke as of men who knew well that they were rowing for the salvation of a life  on they came close under the rocks obeying with every muscle of their bodies the behests of those who called to them from the shore  the boat came with such rapiditywas so recklessly urged that it was driven somewhat beyond the inlet but in passing a blow was struck which made caleb morton once more the master of his own life  the two men had been carried out in their struggle towards the open sea and as the boat curved in so as to be as close as the rocks would allow the bodies of the men were brought within the sweep of the oars  he in the bowfor there were four pulling in the boathad raised his oar as he neared the rockshad raised it high above the water and now as they passed close by the struggling men he let it fall with all its force on the upturned face of the wretched convict  it was a terrible frightful thing to dothus striking one who was so stricken but who shall say that the blow was not good and just  methinks however that the eyes and face of that dying man will haunt for ever the dreams of him who carried that oar  trow never rose again to the surface  three days afterwards his body was found at the ferry and then they carried him to the convict island and buried him  morton was picked up and taken into the boat  his life was saved but it may be a question how the battle might have gone had not that friendly oar been raised in his behalf  as it was he lay at the cottage for days before he was able to be moved so as to receive the congratulations of those who had watched that terrible conflict from the shore  nor did he feel that there had been anything in that days work of which he could be proudmuch rather of which it behoved him to be thoroughly ashamed  some six months after that he obtained the hand of anastasia bergen but they did not remain long in bermuda  he went away back to his own country my informant told me because he could not endure to meet the ghost of aaron trow at that point of the road which passes near the cottage  that the ghost of aaron trow may be seen there and round the little rocky inlet of the sea is part of the creed of every young woman in bermuda
