17230366	marmion  a tale of flodden field edited by henry morley     introduction    the lay of the last minstrel scotts first romantic tale was published in january 1805 and won for its author his first great success  the writing of marmion was begun in november 1806 constable offered as publisher to pay at once a thousand guineas for the copyright when he heard that the new poem was begun though he had not yet seen a line of it  miller and murray joined each taking a fourth part of the venture and john murray said we both view it as honourable profitable and glorious to be concerned in the publication of a new poem by walter scott  scott thirtyfive years old had the impulse upon his mind of a preceding great success took more than usual pains and thoroughly enjoyed the writing  on pleasant knolls under trees and by the banks of yarrow many lines were written and trotting quietly over the hills in later life he said to lockhart his soninlaw oh man i had many a grand gallop among these bracs when i was thinking of marmion  the description of the battle of flodden was shaped in the autumn of 1807 when scott was out practising with the light horse volunteers which had been formed in prospect of an invasion from france and of which scott was quartermaster and secretary scott at those gatherings was full of companionable mirth and in intervals between drill he would sometimes ride his charger at full speed up and down on the sands of portobello within spray of the wave while his mind was at work on such lines as    they close in clouds of smoke and dust with swordsway and with lances thrust    and such a yell was there of sudden and portentous birth as if men fought in upper earth    and fiends in upper air   marmion was published early in the year 1808 its first edition of two thousand in the form then usual of a quarto volume priced at a guinea and a half was sold in a month  then came the editions in octavo of which there were twelve between 1808 and 1825  francis jeffrey in the edinburgh review complained of anti scottish feeling and otherwise criticised his friends work in a way that alienated scott not from jeffrey but from the review and opened to john murray a prospect of securing scott for a contributor to another review the quarterly which he would found as a representative of other political opinions with which scott would be more in accord  marmion thus has a place in the story of the origin of the quarterly review  of the great popularity of marmion scott himself said at the time that it gave him such a heeze that he had almost lost his footing  the letters introducing the several books are in all scotts verse perhaps the poems that most perfectly present to us his own personality  they form no part of marmion in fact there had been a plan for their publication as a distinct book  as they stand they interweave the poet with his poem making marmion too a lay of the last minstrel in the first days of its publication  george ellis playfully observed to scott that the personal appearance of the minstrel who though the last is by far the most charming of all minstrels is by no means compensated by the idea of an author shorn of his picturesque beard deprived of his harp and writing letters to his intimate friends the minstrel of the lay was but a creature of imagination the minstrel of marmion is scott himself  h m    marmion    introduction to canto first to william stewart rose esq  ashestiel ettrick forest  novembers sky is chill and drear novembers leaf is red and sear late gazing down the steepy linn that hems our little garden in low in its dark and narrow glen you scarce the rivulet might ken so thick the tangled greenwood grew so feeble thrilled the streamlet through now murmuring hoarse and frequent seen through bush and briar no longer green an angry brook it sweeps the glade brawls over rock and wild cascade and foaming brown with doubled speed hurries its waters to the tweed     no longer autumns glowing red upon our forest hills is shed no more beneath the evening beam fair tweed reflects their purple gleam away hath passed the heatherbell that bloomed so rich on needpath fell sallow his brow and russet bare are now the sisterheights of yair the sheep before the pinching heaven to sheltered dale and down are driven where yet some faded herbage pines and yet a watery sunbeam shines in meek despondency they eye the withered sward and wintry sky and far beneath their summer hill stray sadly by glenkinnons rill the shepherd shifts his mantles fold and wraps him closer from the cold his dogs no merry circles wheel but shivering follow at his heel a cowering glance they often cast as deeper moans the gathering blast     my imps though hardy bold and wild as best befits the mountain child feel the sad influence of the hour and wail the daisys vanished flower their summer gambols tell and mourn and anxious ask  will spring return and birds and lambs again be gay and blossoms clothe the hawthorn spray     yes prattlers yes  the daisys flower again shall paint your summer bower again the hawthorn shall supply the garlands you delight to tie the lambs upon the lea shall bound the wild birds carol to the round and while you frolic light as they too short shall seem the summer day     to mute and to material things new life revolving summer brings the genial call dead nature hears and in her glory reappears but oh my countrys wintry state what second spring shall renovate what powerful call shall bid arise the buried warlike and the wise

oer nelsons shrine and vainly pierce the solemn gloom that shrouds o pitt thy hallowed tomb     deep graved in every british heart oh never let those names depart say to your sonslo here his grave who victor died on gadite wave to him as to the burning levin short bright resistless course was given whereer his countrys foes were found was heard the fated thunders sound till burst the bolt on yonder shore rolled blazed destroyedand was no more     nor mourn ye less his perished worth who bade the conqueror go forth and launched that thunderbolt of war on egypt hafnia trafalgar who born to guide such high emprize for britains weal was early wise alas to whom the almighty gave for britains sins an early grave his worth who in his mightiest hour a bauble held the pride of power spurned at the sordid lust of pelf and served his albion for herself who when the frantic crowd amain strained at subjections bursting rein oer their wild mood full conquest gained the pride he would not crush restrained showed their fierce zeal a worthier cause and brought the freemans arm to aid the freemans laws     hadst thou but lived though stripped of power a watchman on the lonely tower thy thrilling trump had roused the land when fraud or danger were at hand by thee as by the beaconlight our pilots had kept course aright as some proud column though alone thy strength had propped the tottering throne now is the stately column broke the beaconlight is quenched in smoke the trumpets silver sound is still the warder silent on the hill     oh think how to his latest day when death just hovering claimed his prey with palinures unaltered mood firm at his dangerous post he stood each call for needful rest repelled with dying hand the rudder held till in his fall with fateful sway the steerage of the realm gave way then while on britains thousand plains one unpolluted church remains whose peaceful bells neer sent around the bloody tocsins maddening sound but still upon the hallowed day convoke the swains to praise and pray while faith and civil peace are dear grace this cold marble with a tear  he who preserved them pitt lies here     nor yet suppress the generous sigh because his rival slumbers nigh nor be thy requiescat dumb lest it be said oer foxs tomb for talents mourn untimely lost when best employed and wanted most mourn genius high and lore profound and wit that loved to play not wound and all the reasoning powers divine to penetrate resolve combine and feelings keen and fancys glow  they sleep with him who sleeps below and if thou mournst they could not save from error him who owns this grave be every harsher thought suppressed and sacred be the last long rest here where the end of earthly things lays heroes patriots bards and kings where stiff the hand and still the tongue of those who fought and spoke and sung here where the fretted aisles prolong the distant notes of holy song as if some angel spoke again all peace on earth goodwill to men if ever from an english heart oh here let prejudice depart and partial feeling cast aside record that fox a briton died when europe crouched to frances yoke and austria bent and prussia broke and the firm russians purpose brave was bartered by a timorous slave even then dishonours peace he spurned the sullied olivebranch returned stood for his countrys glory fast and nailed her colours to the mast heaven to reward his firmness gave a portion in this honoured grave and neer held marble in its trust of two such wondrous men the dust     with more than mortal powers endowed how high they soared above the crowd theirs was no common party race jostling by dark intrigue for place like fabled gods their mighty war shook realms and nations in its jar beneath each banner proud to stand looked up the noblest of the land till through the british world were known the names of pitt and fox alone spells of such force no wizard grave eer framed in dark thessalian cave though his could drain the

lingering last deception dear the choirs high sounds die on my ear now slow return the lonely down the silent pastures bleak and brown the farm begirt with copsewood wild the gambols of each frolic child mixing their shrill cries with the tone of tweeds dark waters rushing on     prompt on unequal tasks to run thus nature disciplines her son meeter she says for me to stray and waste the solitary day in plucking from yon fen the reed and watch it floating down the tweed or idly list the shrilling lay with which the milkmaid cheers her way marking its cadence rise and fail as from the field beneath her pail she trips it down the uneven dale meeter for me by yonder cairn the ancient shepherds tale to learn though oft he stop in rustic fear lest his old legends tire the ear of one who in his simple mind may boast of booklearned taste refined     but thou my friend canst fitly tell for few have read romance so well how still the legendary lay oer poets bosom holds its sway how on the ancient minstrel strain time lays his palsied hand in vain and how our hearts at doughty deeds by warriors wrought in steely weeds still throb for fear and pitys sake as when the champion of the lake enters morganas fated house or in the chapel perilous despising spells and demons force holds converse with the unburied corse or when dame ganores grace to move alas that lawless was their love he sought proud tarquin in his den and freed full sixty knights or when a sinful man and unconfessed he took the sangreals holy quest and slumbering saw the vision high he might not view with waking eye     the mightiest chiefs of british song scorned not such legends to prolong they gleam through spensers elfin dream and mix in miltons heavenly theme and dryden in immortal strain had raised the table round again but that a ribald king and court bade him toil on to make them sport demanded for their niggard pay fit for their souls a looser lay licentious satire song and play the world defrauded of the high design profaned the godgiven strength and marred the lofty line     warmed by such names well may we then though dwindled sons of little men essay to break a feeble lance in the fair fields of old romance or seek the moated castles cell where long through talisman and spell while tyrants ruled and damsels wept thy genius chivalry hath slept there sound the harpings of the north till he awake and sally forth on venturous quest to prick again in all his arms with all his train shield lance and brand and plume and scarf fay giant dragon squire and dwarf and wizard with his want of might and errant maid on palfrey white around the genius weave their spells pure love who scarce his passion tells mystery half veiled and half revealed and honour with his spotless shield attention

i  day set on norhams castled steep and tweeds fair river broad and deep    and cheviots mountains lone the battled towers the donjon keep the loophole grates where captives weep the flanking walls that round it sweep    in yellow lustre shone the warriors on the turrets high moving athwart the evening sky    seemed forms of giant height their armour as it caught the rays flashed back again the western blaze    in lines of dazzling light  ii  saint georges banner broad and gay now faded as the fading ray    less bright and less was flung the evening gale had scarce the power to wave it on the donjon tower    so heavily it hung the scouts had parted on their search    the castle gates were barred above the gloomy portal arch timing his footsteps to a march    the warder kept his guard low humming as he paced along some ancient border gathering song  iii  a distant trampling sound he hears he looks abroad and soon appears oer horncliff hill a plump of spears    beneath a pennon gay a horseman darting from the crowd like lightning from a summer cloud spurs on his mettled courser proud    before the dark array beneath the sable palisade that closed the castle barricade    his buglehorn he blew the warder hasted from the wall and warned the captain in the hall    for well the blast he knew and joyfully that knight did call to sewer squire and seneschal  iv  now broach ye a pipe of malvoisie    bring pasties of the doe and quickly make the entrance free and bid my heralds ready be and every minstrel sound his glee    and all our trumpets blow and from the platform spare ye not to fire a noble salvoshot    lord marmion waits below then to the castles lower ward    sped forty yeomen tall the ironstudded gates unbarred raised the portcullis ponderous guard the lofty palisade unsparred    and let the drawbridge fall  v  along the bridge lord marmion rode proudly his redroan charger trode his helm hung at the saddlebow well by his visage you might know he was a stalwart knight and keen and had in many a battle been the scar on his brown cheek revealed a token true of bosworth field his eyebrow dark and eye of fire showed spirit proud and prompt to ire yet lines of thought upon his cheek did deep design and counsel speak his forehead by his casque worn bare his thick moustache and curly hair coalblack and grizzled here and there    but more through toil than age his squareturned joints and strength of limb showed him no carpet knight so trim but in close fight a champion grim    in camps a leader sage  vi  well was he armed from head to heel in mail and plate of milan steel but his strong helm of mighty cost was all with burnished gold embossed amid the plumage of the crest a falcon hovered on her nest with wings outspread and forward breast een such a falcon on his shield soared sable in an azure field the golden legend bore aright who checks at me to death is dight blue was the chargers broidered rein blue ribbons decked his arching mane the knightly housings ample fold was velvet blue and trapped with gold  vii  behind him rode two gallant squires of noble name and knightly sires they burned the gilded spurs to claim for well could each a warhorse tame could draw the bow the sword could sway and lightly bear the ring away nor less with courteous precepts stored could dance in hall and carve at board and frame loveditties passing rare and sing them to a lady fair  viii  four menatarms came at their backs with halbert bill and battleaxe they bore lord marmions lance so strong and led his sumptermules along and ambling palfrey when at need him listed ease his battlesteed the last and trustiest of the four on high his forky pennon bore like swallows tail in shape and hue fluttered the streamer glossy blue where blazoned sable as before the towering falcon seemed to soar last twenty yeomen two and two in hosen black and jerkins blue with falcons broidered on each breast attended on their lords behest each chosen for an archer good knew huntingcraft by lake or wood each one a sixfoot bow could bend and far a clothyard shaft could send each held a boarspear tough and strong and at their belts their quivers rung their dusty palfreys and array showed they had marched a weary way  ix  tis meet that i should tell you now how fairly armed and ordered how    the soldiers of the guard with musket pike and morion to welcome noble marmion    stood in the castleyard minstrels and trumpeters were there the gunner held his linstock yare    for welcomeshot prepared entered the train and such a clang as then through all his turrets rang    old norham never heard  x  the guards their morricepikes advanced    the trumpets flourished brave the cannon from the ramparts glanced    and thundering welcome gave a blithe salute in martial sort    the minstrels well might sound for as lord marmion crossed the court    he scattered angels round welcome to norham marmion    stout heart and open hand well dost thou brook thy gallant roan    thou flower of english land  xi  two pursuivants whom tabarts deck with silver scutcheon round their neck    stood on the steps of stone by which you reach the donjon gate and there with herald pomp and state    they hailed lord marmion they hailed him lord of fontenaye of lutterward and scrivelbaye    of tamworth tower and town and he their courtesy to requite gave them a chain of twelve marks weight    all as he lighted down now largesse largesse lord marmion    knight of the crest of gold a blazoned shield in battle won    neer guarded heart so bold  xii  they marshalled him to the castlehall    where the guests stood all aside and loudly flourished the trumpetcall    and the heralds loudly cried  room lordlings room for lord marmion    with the crest and helm of gold full well we know the trophies won    in the lists at cottiswold there vainly ralph de wilton strove    gainst marmions force to stand to him he lost his ladylove    and to the king his land ourselves beheld the listed field    a sight both sad and fair we saw lord marmion pierce his shield    and saw his saddle bare we saw the victor win the crest    he wears with worthy pride and on the gibbettree reversed    his foemans scutcheon tied place nobles for the falconknight    room room ye gentles gay for him who conquered in the right    marmion of fontenaye  xiii  then stepped to meet that noble lord    sir hugh the heron bold baron of twisell and of ford    and captain of the hold he led lord marmion to the dais    raised oer the pavement high and placed him in the upper place     they feasted full and high the whiles a northern harper rude chanted a rhyme of deadly feud    how the fierce thirwalls and ridleys all       stout willimondswick       and hardriding dick    and hughie of hawdon and will o the wall    have set on sir albany featherstonhaugh    and taken his life at the deadmansshaw scantly lord marmions ear could brook    the harpers barbarous lay yet much he praised the pains he took    and well those pains did pay for ladys suit and minstrels strain by knight should neer be heard in vain  xiv  now good lord marmion heron says    of your fair courtesy i pray you bide some little space    in this poor tower with me here may you keep your arms from rust    may breathe your warhorse well seldom hath passed a week but just    or feat of arms befell the scots can rein a mettled steed    and love to couch a spear st george a stirring life they lead    that have such neighbours near then stay with us a little space    our northern wars to learn i pray you for your ladys grace    lord marmions brow grew stern  xv  the captain marked his altered look    and gave a squire the sign a mighty wassailbowl he took    and crowned it high with wine now pledge me here lord marmion    but first i pray thee fair where hast thou left that page of thine that used to serve thy cup of wine    whose beauty was so rare when last in raby towers we met    the boy i closely eyed and often marked his cheeks were wet    with tears he fain would hide his was no rugged horseboys hand to burnish shield or sharpen brand    or saddle battlesteed but meeter seemed for lady fair to fan her cheek or curl her hair or through embroidery rich and rare    the slender silk to lead his skin was fair his ringlets gold    his bosomwhen he sighed  the russet doublets rugged fold    could scarce repel its pride say hast thou given that lovely youth    to serve in ladys bower or was the gentle page in sooth    a gentle paramour  xvi  lord marmion ill could brook such jest    he rolled his kindling eye with pain his rising wrath suppressed    yet made a calm reply that boy thou thoughtst so goodly fair he might not brook the northern air more of his fate if thou wouldst learn i left him sick in lindisfarne enough of him  but heron say why does thy lovely lady gay disdain to grace the hall today or has that dame so fair and sage gone on some pious pilgrimage he spoke in covert scorn for fame whispered light tales of herons dame  xvii  unmarked at least unrecked the taunt    careless the knight replied no bird whose feathers gaily flaunt    delights in cage to bide norham is grim and grated close hemmed in by battlement and fosse    and many a darksome tower and better loves my lady bright to sit in liberty and light    in fair queen margarets bower we hold our greyhound in our hand    our falcon on our glove but where shall we find leash or band    for dame that loves to rove let the wild falcon soar her swing shell stoop when she has tired her wing  xviii  nay if with royal jamess bride the lovely lady heron bide behold me here a messenger your tender greetings prompt to bear for to the scottish court addressed i journey at our kings behest and pray you of your grace provide for me and mine a trusty guide i have not ridden in scotland since james backed the cause of that mockprince warbeck that flemish counterfeit who on the gibbet paid the cheat then did i march with surreys power what time we razed old ayton tower  xix  for suchlike need my lord i trow norham can find you guides enow for here be some have pricked as far on scottish ground as to dunbar have drunk the monks of st bothans ale and driven the beeves of lauderdale harried the wives of greenlaws goods and given them light to set their hoods  xx  now in good sooth lord marmion cried were i in warlike wise to ride a better guard i would not lack than your stout forayers at my back but as in form of peace i go a friendly messenger to know why through all scotland near and far their king is mustering troops for war the sight of plundering border spears might justify suspicious fears and deadly feud or thirst of spoil break out in some unseemly broil a herald were my fitting guide or friar sworn in peace to bide or pardoner or travelling priest or strolling pilgrim at the least  xxi  the captain mused a little space and passed his hand across his face fain would i find the guide you want but ill may pursuivant the only men that safe can ride mine errands on the scottish side and though a bishop built this fort few holy brethren here resort even our good chaplain as i ween since our last siege we have not seen the mass he might not sing or say upon one stinted meal a day so safe he sat in durham aisle and prayed for our success the while our norham vicar woe betide is all too well in case to ride the priest of shoreswoodhe could rein the wildest warhorse in your train but then no spearman in the hall will sooner swear or stab or brawl friar john of tillmouth were the man a blithesome brother at the can a welcome guest in hall and bower he knows each castle town and tower in which the wine and ale is good twixt newcastle and holyrood but that good man as ill befalls hath seldom left our castle walls since on the vigil of saint bede in evil hour he crossed the tweed to teach dame alison her creed old bughtrig found him with his wife and john an enemy to strife sans frock and hood fled for his life the jealous churl hath deeply swore that if again he venture oer he shall shrive penitent no more little he loves such risks i know yet in your guard perchance will go  xxii  young selby at the fair hallboard carved to his uncle and that lord and reverently took up the word kind uncle woe were we each one if harm should hap to brother john he is a man of mirthful speech can many a game and gambol teach full well at tables can he play and sweep at bowls the stake away none can a lustier carol bawl the needfullest among us all when time hangs heavy in the hall and snow comes thick at christmastide and we can neither hunt nor ride a foray on the scottish side the vowed revenge of bughtrig rude may end in worse than loss of hood let friar john in safety still in chimneycorner snore his fill roast hissing crabs or flagons swill last night to norham there came one will better guide lord marmion nephew quoth heron by my fay well hast thou spoke say forth thy say  xxiii  here is a holy palmer come from salem first and last from rome one that hath kissed the blessed tomb and visited each holy shrine in araby and palestine on hills of armenie hath been where noahs ark may yet be seen by that red sea too hath he trod which parted at the prophets rod in sinais wilderness he saw the mount where israel heard the law mid thunderdint and flashing levin and shadows mists and darkness given he shows saint jamess cockleshell of fair montserrat too can tell    and of that grot where olives nod where darling of each heart and eye from all the youth of sicily    saint rosalie retired to god  xxiv  to stout saint george of norwich merry saint thomas too of canterbury cuthbert of durham and saint bede for his sins pardon hath he prayed he knows the passes of the north and seeks far shrines beyond the forth little he eats and long will wake and drinks but of the stream or lake this were a guide oer moor and dale but when our john hath quaffed his ale as little as the wind that blows and warms itself against his nose kens he or cares which way he goes  xxv  gramercy quoth lord marmion full loth were i that friar john that venerable man for me were placed in fear or jeopardy if this same palmer will me lead    from hence to holyrood like his good saint ill pay his meed instead of cockleshell or bead    with angels fair and good i love such holy ramblers still they know to charm a weary hill    with song romance or lay some jovial tale or glee or jest some lying legend at the least    they bring to cheer the way  xxvi  ah noble sir young selby said and finger on his lip he laid this man knows muchperchance een more than he could learn by holy lore still to himself hes muttering and shrinks as at some unseen thing last night we listened at his cell strange sounds we heard and sooth to tell he murmured on till morn howeer no living mortal could be near sometimes i thought i heard it plain as other voices spoke again i cannot telli like it not  friar john hath told us it is wrote no conscience clear and void of wrong can rest awake and pray so long himself still sleeps before his beads have marked ten aves and two creeds  xxvii  let pass quoth marmion by my fay this man shall guide me on my way although the great archfiend and he had sworn themselves of company so please you gentle youth to call this palmer to the castlehall the summoned palmer came in place his sable cowl oerhung his face in his black mantle was he clad with peters keys in cloth of red    on his broad shoulders wrought the scallopshell his cap did deck the crucifix around his neck    was from loretto brought his sandals were with travel tore staff budget bottle scrip he wore the faded palmbranch in his hand showed pilgrim from the holy land  xxviii  whenas the palmer came in hall nor lord nor knight was there more tall    or had a statelier step withal or looked more high and keen for no saluting did he wait but strode across the hall of state and fronted marmion where he sate    as he his peer had been but his gaunt frame was worn with toil his cheek was sunk alas the while and when he struggled at a smile    his eye looked haggard wild poor wretch the mother that him bare if she had been in presence there in his wan face and sunburned hair    she had not known her child danger long travel want or woe soon change the form that best we know  for deadly fear can time outgo    and blanch at once the hair hard toil can roughen form and face and want can quench the eyes bright grace nor does old age a wrinkle trace    more deeply than despair happy whom none of these befall but this poor palmer knew them all  xxix  lord marmion then his boon did ask the palmer took on him the task so he would march with morning tide to scottish court to be his guide but i have solemn vows to pay and may not linger by the way    to fair st andrews bound within the oceancave to pray where good saint rule his holy lay from midnight to the dawn of day    sung to the billows sound thence to saint fillans blessed well whose springs can frenzied dreams dispel    and the crazed brain restore saint mary grant that cave or spring could back to peace my bosom bring    or bid it throb no more  xxx  and now the midnight draught of sleep where wine and spices richly steep in massive bowl of silver deep    the page presents on knee lord marmion drank a fair good rest the captain pledged his noble guest the cup went through among the rest    who drained it merrily alone the palmer passed it by though selby pressed him courteously this was a sign the feast was oer it hushed the merry wassail roar    the minstrels ceased to sound soon in the castle nought was heard but the slow footstep of the guard    pacing his sober round  xxxi  with early dawn lord marmion rose and first the chapel doors unclose    then after morning rites were done a hasty mass from friar john and knight and squire had broke their fast on rich substantial repast lord marmions bugles blew to horse then came the stirrupcup in course between the baron and his host no point of courtesy was lost high thanks were by lord marmion paid solemn excuse the captain made till filing from the gate had passed that noble train their lord the last then loudly rung the trumpet call thundered the cannon from the wall    and shook the scottish shore around the castle eddied slow volumes of smoke as white as snow    and hid its turrets hoar till they rolled forth upon the air and met the river breezes there which gave again the prospect fair    introduction to canto second to the rev john marriott am  ashestiel ettrick forest  the scenes are desert now and bare where

our mirth dear mariott was the same rememberst thou my greyhounds true oer holt or hill there never flew from slip or leash there never sprang more fleet of foot or sure of fang nor dull between each merry chase passed by the intermitted space for we had fair resource in store in classic and in gothic lore we marked each memorable scene and held poetic talk between nor hill nor brook we paced along but had its legend or its song all silent nowfor now are still thy bowers untenanted bowhill no longer from thy mountains dun the yeoman hears the wellknown gun and while his honest heart glows warm at thought of his paternal farm round to his mates a brimmer fills and drinks the chieftain of the hills no fairy forms in yarrows bowers trip oer the walks or tend the flowers fair as the elves whom janet saw by moonlight dance on carterhaugh no youthful barons left to grace the forestsheriffs lonely chase and ape in manly step and tone the majesty of oberon and she is gone whose lovely face is but her least and lowest grace though if to sylphid queen twere given to show our earth the charms of heaven she could not glide along the air with form more light or face more fair no more the widows deafened ear grows quick that ladys step to hear at noontide she expects her not nor busies her to trim the cot pensive she turns her humming wheel or pensive cooks her orphans meal yet blesses

currents boil  her long descended lord is gone and left us by the stream alone and much i miss those sportive boys companions of my mountain joys just at the age twixt boy and youth when thought is speech and speech is truth close to my side with what delight they pressed to hear of wallace wight when pointing to his airy mound i called his ramparts holy ground kindled their brows to hear me speak and i have smiled to feel my cheek despite the difference of our years return again the glow of theirs ah happy boys such feelings pure they will not cannot long endure condemned to stem the worlds rude tide you may not linger by the side for fate shall thrust you from the shore and passion ply the sail and oar yet cherish the remembrance still of the lone mountain and the rill for trust dear boys the time will come when fiercer transport shall be dumb and you will think right frequently but well i hope without a sigh on the free hours that we have spent together on the brown hills bent     when musing on companions gone we doubly feel ourselves alone something my friend we yet may gain there is a pleasure in this pain it soothes the love of lonely rest deep in each gentler heart impressed tis silent amid worldly toils and stifled soon by mental broils but in a bosom thus prepared its still small voice is often heard whispering a mingled sentiment twixt resignation and content oft in my mind such thoughts awake by lone saint marys silent lake thou knowst it wellnor fen nor sedge pollute the pure lakes crystal edge abrupt and sheer the mountains sink at once upon the level brink and just a trace of silver sand marks where the water meets the land far in the mirror bright and blue each hills huge outline you may view shaggy with heath but lonely bare nor tree nor bush nor brake is there save where of land yon slender line bears thwart the lake the scattered pine yet even this nakedness has power and aids the feeling of the hour nor thicket dell nor copse you spy where living thing concealed might lie nor point retiring hides a dell where swain or woodman lone might dwell theres nothing left to fancys guess you see that all is loneliness and silence aidsthough the steep hills send to the lake a thousand rills in summer tide so soft they weep the sound but lulls the ear asleep your horses hooftread sounds too rude so stilly is the solitude     nought living meets the eye or ear but well i ween the dead are near for though in feudal strife a foe hath lain our ladys chapel low yet still beneath the hallowed soil the peasant rests him from his toil and dying bids his bones be laid where erst his simple fathers prayed     if age had tamed the passions strife and fate had cut my ties to life here have i thought twere sweet to dwell and rear again the chaplains cell like that same peaceful hermitage where milton longed to spend his age twere sweet to mark the setting day on bourhopes lonely top decay and as it faint and feeble died on the broad lake and mountains side to say thus pleasures fade away youth talents beauty thus decay and leave us dark forlorn and grey then gaze on dryhopes ruined tower and think on yarrows faded flower and when that mountainsound i heard which bids us be for storm prepared the distant rustling of his wings as up his force the tempest brings twere sweet ere yet his terrors rave to sit upon the wizards grave  that wizardpriests whose bones are thrust from company of holy dust on which no sunbeam ever shines  so superstitions creed divines  thence view the lake with sullen roar heave her broad billows to the shore and mark the wild swans mount the gale spread wide through mist their snowy sail and ever stoop again to lave their bosoms on the surging wave then when against the driving hail no longer might my plaid avail back to my lonely home retire and light my lamp and trim my fire there ponder oer some mystic lay till the wild tale had all its sway and in the bitterns distant shriek i heard unearthly voices speak and thought the wizardpriest was come to claim again his ancient home and bade my busy fancy range to frame him fitting shape and strange till from the task my brow i cleared and smiled to think that i had feared     but chief twere sweet to think such life though but escape from fortunes strife something most matchless good and wise a great and grateful sacrifice and deem each hour to musing given a step upon the road to heaven     yet him whose heart is ill at ease such peaceful solitudes displease he loves to drown his bosoms jar amid the elemental war and my black palmers choice had been some ruder and more savage scene like that which frowns round dark lochskene there eagles scream from isle to shore down all the rocks the torrents roar oer the black waves incessant driven dark mists infect the summer heaven through the rude barriers of the lake away its hurrying waters break faster and whiter dash and curl till down yon dark abyss they hurl rises the fogsmoke white as snow thunders the viewless stream below diving as if condemned to lave some demons subterranean cave who prisoned by enchanters spell shakes the dark rock with groan and yell and well that palmers form and mien had suited with the stormy scene just on the edge straining his ken to view the bottom of the den where deep deep down and far within toils with the rocks the roaring linn then issuing forth one foamy wave and wheeling round the giants grave white as the snowy chargers tail drives down the pass of moffatdale     marriott thy harp on isis strung to many a border theme has rung then list to me and thou shalt know of this mysterious man of woe    canto second the convent   i  the breeze which swept away the smoke    round norham castle rolled when all the loud artillery spoke with lightningflash and thunderstroke    as marmion left the hold it curled not tweed alone that breeze for far upon northumbrian seas it freshly blew and strong where from high whitbys cloistered pile bound to st cuthberts holy isle    it bore a barque along upon the gale she stooped her side and bounded oer the swelling tide    as she were dancing home the merry seamen laughed to see their gallant ship so lustily    furrow the green seafoam much joyed they in their honoured freight for on the deck in chair of state the abbess of saint hilda placed with five fair nuns the galley graced  ii  twas sweet to see these holy maids like birds escaped to greenwood shades    their first flight from the cage how timid and how curious too for all to them was strange and new and all the common sights they view    their wonderment engage one eyed the shrouds and swelling sail with many a benedicite one at the rippling surge grew pale    and would for terror pray then shrieked because the seadog nigh his round black head and sparkling eye    reared oer the foaming spray and one would still adjust her veil disordered by the summer gale perchance lest some more worldly eye her dedicated charms might spy perchance because such action graced her fairturned arm and slender waist light was each simple bosom there save two who ill might pleasure share  the abbess and the novice clare  iii  the abbess was of noble blood but early took the veil and hood ere upon life she cast a look or knew the world that she forsook fair too she was and kind had been as she was fair but neer had seen for her a timid lover sigh nor knew the influence of her eye love to her ear was but a name combined with vanity and shame her hopes her fears her joys were all bounded within the cloister wall the deadliest sin her mind could reach was of monastic rule the breach and her ambitions highest aim to emulate saint hildas fame for this she gave her ample dower to raise the convents eastern tower for this with carving rare and quaint she decked the chapel of the saint and gave the relicshrine of cost with ivory and gems embossed the poor her convents bounty blest the pilgrim in its halls found rest  iv  black was her garb her rigid rule reformed on benedictine school her cheek was pale her form was spare vigils and penitence austere had early quenched the light of youth but gentle was the dame in sooth though vain of her religious sway she loved to see her maids obey yet nothing stern was she in cell and the nuns loved their abbess well sad was this voyage to the dame summoned to lindisfarne she came there with saint cuthberts abbot old and tynemouths prioress to hold a chapter of saint benedict for inquisition stern and strict on two apostates from the faith and if need were to doom to death  v  nought say i here of sister clare save this that she was young and fair as yet a novice unprofessed lovely and gentle but distressed she was betrothed to one now dead or worse who had dishonoured fled her kinsmen bade her give her hand to one who loved her for her land herself almost heartbroken now was bent to take the vestal vow and shroud within saint hildas gloom her blasted hopes and withered bloom  vi  she sate upon the galleys prow and seemed to mark the waves below nay seemed so fixed her look and eye to count them as they glided by she saw them nottwas seeming all  far other scene her thoughts recall  a sunscorched desert waste and bare nor waves nor breezes murmured there there saw she where some careless hand oer a dead corpse had heaped the sand to hide it till the jackals come to tear it from the scanty tomb see what a woful look was given as she raised up her eyes to heaven  vii  lovely and gentle and distressed  these charms might tame the fiercest breast harpers have sung and poets told that he in fury uncontrolled the shaggy monarch of the wood before a virgin fair and good hath pacified his savage mood but passions in the human frame oft put the lions rage to shame and jealousy by dark intrigue with sordid avarice in league had practised with their bowl and knife against the mourners harmless life this

nuns delighted eyes monkwearmouth soon behind them lay and tynemouths priory and bay they marked amid her trees the hall of lofty seatondelaval they saw the blythe and wansbeck floods rush to the sea through sounding woods they passed the tower of widderington mother of many a valiant son at coquet isle their beads they tell to the good saint who owned the cell then did the alne attention claim and warkworth proud of percys name and next they crossed themselves to hear the whitening breakers sound so near where boiling through the rocks they roar on dunstanboroughs caverned shore thy tower proud bamborough marked they there king idas castle huge and square from its tall rock look grimly down and on the swelling ocean frown then from the coast they bore away and reached the holy islands

monasterys halls a solemn huge and darkred pile placed on the margin of the isle  x  in saxon strength that abbey frowned with massive arches broad and round    that rose alternate row and row    on ponderous columns short and low       built ere the art was known    by pointed aisle and shafted stalk    the arcades of an alleyed walk       to emulate in stone on the deep walls the heathen dane had poured his impious rage in vain and needful was such strength to these exposed to the tempestuous seas scourged by the winds eternal sway open to rovers fierce as they which could twelve hundred years withstand winds waves and northern pirates hand not but that portions of the pile rebuilded in a later style showed where the spoilers hand had been not hut the wasting seabreeze keen had worn the pillars carving quaint and mouldered in his niche the saint and rounded with consuming power the pointed angles of each tower yet still entire the abbey stood like veteran worn but unsubdued  xi  soon as they neared his turrets strong the maidens raised saint hildas song    and with the seawave and the wind    their voices sweetly shrill combined       and made harmonious close    then answering from the sandy shore    halfdrowned amid the breakers roar       according chorus rose    down to the haven of the isle    the monks and nuns in order file    from cuthberts cloisters grim banner and cross and relics there to meet saint hildas maids they bare and as they caught the sounds on air    they echoed back the hymn the islanders in joyous mood rushed emulously through the flood    to hale the barque to land conspicuous by her veil and hood signing the cross the abbess stood and blessed them with her hand  xii  suppose we now the welcome said suppose the convent banquet made    all through the holy dome through cloister aisle and gallery wherever vestal maid might pry nor risk to meet unhallowed eye    the stranger sisters roam till fell the evening damp with dew and the sharp seabreeze coldly blew for there een summer night is chill then having strayed and gazed their fill    they closed around the fire and all in turn essayed to paint the rival merits of their saint    a theme that neer can tire a holy maid for be it known that their saints honour is their own  xiii  then whitbys nuns exulting told how to their house three barons bold    must menial service do while horns blow out a note of shame and monks cry fye upon your name in wrath for loss of silvan game    saint hildas priest ye slew this on ascension day each year while labouring on our harbourpier    must herbert bruce and percy hear they told how in their convent cell a saxon princess once did dwell    the lovely edelfled and how of thousand snakes each one was changed into a coil of stone    when holy hilda prayed themselves within their holy bound their stony folds had often found they told how seafowls pinions fail as over whitbys towers they sail and sinking down with flutterings faint they do their homage to the saint  xiv  nor did saint cuthberts daughters fail to vie with these in holy tale his bodys restingplace of old how oft their patron changed they told how when the rude dane burned their pile the monks fled forth from holy isle oer northern mountain marsh and moor from sea to sea from shore to shore seven years saint cuthberts corpse they bore    they rested them in fair melrose       but though alive he loved it well    not there his relics might repose       for wondrous tale to tell    in his stone coffin forth he rides    a ponderous barque for river tides    yet light as gossamer it glides       downward to tilmouth cell nor long was his abiding there for southward did the saint repair chesterlestreet and rippon saw his holy corpse ere wardilaw    hailed him with joy and fear and after many wanderings past he chose his lordly seat at last where his cathedral huge and vast    looks down upon the wear there deep in durhams gothic shade his relics are in secret laid    but none may know the place save of his holiest servants three deep sworn to solemn secrecy    who share that wondrous grace  xv  who may his miracles declare even scotlands dauntless

reign edged alfreds falchion on the dane and turned the conqueror back again when with his norman bowyer band he came to waste northumberland  xvi  but fain saint hildas nuns would learn if on a rock by lindisfarne saint cuthbert sits and toils to frame the seaborn beads that bear his name such tales had whitbys fishers told and said they might his shape behold    and hear his anvil sound a deadened clanga huge dim form seen but and heard when gathering storm    and night were closing round but this as tale of idle fame the nuns of lindisfarne disclaim  xvii  while round the fire such legends go far different was the scene of woe where in a secret aisle beneath council was held of life and death    it was more dark and lone that vault       than the worse dungeon cell    old colwulf built it for his fault       in penitence to dwell when he for cowl and beads laid down the saxon battleaxe and crown this den which chilling every sense    of feeling hearing sight was called the vault of penitence    excluding air and light was by the prelate sexhelm made a place of burial for such dead as having died in mortal sin might not be laid the church within twas now a place of punishment whence if so loud a shriek were sent    as reached the upper air the hearers blessed themselves and said the spirits of the sinful dead    bemoaned their torments there  xviii  but though in the monastic pile did of this penitential aisle    some vague tradition go few only save the abbot knew where the place lay and still more few were those who had from him the clue    to that dread vault to go victim and executioner were blindfold when transported there in low dark rounds the arches hung from the rude rock the sidewalls sprung the gravestones rudely sculptured oer half sunk in earth by time half wore were all the pavement of the floor the mildewdrops fell one by one with tinkling plash upon the stone a cresset in an iron chain which served to light this drear domain with damp and darkness seemed to strive as if it scarce might keep alive and yet it dimly served to show the awful conclave met below  xix  there met to doom in secrecy were placed the heads of convents three all servants of saint benedict the statutes of whose order strict    on iron table lay in long black dress on seats of stone behind were these three judges shown    by the pale cressets ray the abbess of saint hildas there sat for a space with visage bare until to hide her bosoms swell and teardrops that for pity fell she closely drew her veil yon shrouded figure as i guess by her proud mien and flowing dress is tynemouths haughty prioress    and she with awe looks pale and he that ancient man whose sight has long been quenched by ages night upon whose wrinkled brow alone nor ruth nor mercys trace is shown    whose look is hard and stern  saint cuthberts abbot is his style for sanctity called through the isle    the saint of lindisfarne  xx  before them stood a guilty pair but though an equal fate they share yet one alone deserves our care her sex a pages dress belied the cloak and doublet loosely tied obscured her charms but could not hide    her cap down oer her face she drew       and on her doublet breast    she tried to hide the badge of blue       lord marmions falcon crest but at the prioress command a monk undid the silken band    that tied her tresses fair and raised the bonnet from her head and down her slender form they spread    in ringlets rich and rare constance de beverley they know sister professed of fontevraud whom the church numbered with the dead for broken vows and convent fled  xxi  when thus her face was given to view  although so pallid was her hue it did a ghastly contrast bear to those bright ringlets glistering fair  her look composed and steady eye bespoke a matchless constancy and there she stood so calm and pale that but her breathing did not fail and motion slight of eye and head and of her bosom warranted that neither sense nor pulse she lacks you might have thought a form of wax wrought to the very life was there so still she was so pale so fair  xxii  her comrade was a sordid soul    such as does murder for a meed who

clad in frock and cowl and shamed not loud to moan and howl his body on the floor to dash and crouch like hound beneath the lash while his mute partner standing near waited her doom without a tear  xxiii  yet well the luckless wretch might shriek well might her paleness terror speak for there were seen in that dark wall two niches narrow deep and tall who enters at such grisly door shall neer i ween find exit more in each a slender meal was laid of roots of water and of bread by each in benedictine dress two haggard monks stood motionless who holding high a blazing torch showed the grim entrance of the porch reflecting back the smoky beam the darkred walls and arches gleam hewn stones and cement were displayed and building tools in order laid  xxiv  these executioners were chose as men who were with mankind foes and with despite and envy fired into the cloister had retired    or who in desperate doubt of grace    strove by deep penance to efface       of some foul crime the stain    for as the vassals of her will    such men the church selected still    as either joyed in doing ill       or thought more grace to gain if in her cause they wrestled down feelings their nature strove to own by strange device were they brought there they knew not how nor knew not where  xxv  and now that blind old abbot rose    to speak the chapters doom on those the wall was to enclose    alive within the tomb but stopped because that woful maid gathering her powers to speak essayed twice she essayed and twice in vain her accents might no utterance gain nought but imperfect murmurs slip from her convulsed and quivering lip twixt each attempt all was so still you seemed to hear a distant rill     twas oceans swells and falls for though this vault of sin and fear was to the sounding surge so near a tempest there you scarce could hear    so massive were the walls  xxvi  at length an effort sent apart the blood that curdled to her heart    and light came to her eye and colour dawned upon her cheek a hectic and a fluttered streak like that left on the cheviot peak    by autumns stormy sky and when her silence broke at length still as she spoke she gathered strength    and armed herself to bear it was a fearful sight to see such high resolve and constancy    in form so soft and fair  xxvii  i speak not to implore your grace well know i for one minutes space

to prompt of love a softer tale though scarce a puny streamlets speed claimed homage from a shepherds reed yet was poetic impulse given by the green hill and clear blue heaven it was a barren scene

crawl up the low crag and ruined wall i deemed such nooks the sweetest shade the sun in all its round surveyed and still i thought that shattered tower the mightiest work of human power and marvelled

wallace wight and bruce the bold of later fields of feud and fight when pouring from their highland height the scottish clans in headlong sway had swept the scarlet ranks away while stretched at length upon the floor again i fought each combat oer pebbles and shells in order laid the mimic ranks of war displayed and onward still the scottish lion bore and still the scattered southron fled

still where stunted birches hid the rill they might not choose the lowland road for the merse forayers were abroad who fired with hate and thirst of prey had scarcely failed to bar their way oft on the trampling band from crown of some tall cliff the deer looked down on wing of jet from his repose in the deep heath the blackcock rose sprung from the gorse the timid roe nor waited for the bending bow and when the stony path began by which the naked peak they wan up flew the snowy ptarmigan the noon had long been passed before they gained the height of lammermoor thence winding down the northern way before them at the close of day old giffords towers and hamlet lay  ii  no summons calls them to the tower to spend the hospitable hour to scotlands camp the lord was gone his cautious dame in bower alone dreaded her castle to unclose so late to unknown friends or foes on through the hamlet as they paced before a porch whose front was graced with bush and flagon trimly placed    lord marmion drew his rein the village inn seemed large though rude its cheerful fire and hearty food    might well relieve his train down from their seats the horsemen sprung with jingling spurs the courtyard rung they bind their horses to the stall for forage food and firing call and various clamour fills the hall weighing the labour with the cost toils everywhere the bustling host  iii  soon by the chimneys merry blaze through the rude hostel might you gaze might see where in dark nook aloof the rafters of the sooty roof    bore wealth of winter cheer of seafowl dried and solands store and gammons of the tusky boar    and savoury haunch of deer the chimney arch projected wide above around it and beside    were tools for housewives hand nor wanted in that martial day the implements of scottish fray    the buckler lance and brand beneath its shade the place of state on oaken settle marmion sate and viewed around the blazing hearth his followers mix in noisy mirth whom with brown ale in jolly tide from ancient vessels ranged aside full actively their host supplied  iv  theirs was the glee of martial breast and laughter theirs at little jest and oft lord marmion deigned to aid and mingle in the mirth they made for though with men of high degree the proudest of the proud was he yet trained in camps he knew the art to win the soldiers hardy heart they love a captain to obey boisterous as march yet fresh as may with open hand and brow as free lover of wine and minstrelsy ever the first to scale a tower as venturous in a ladys bower such buxom chief shall lead his host from indias fires to zemblas frost  v  resting upon his pilgrim staff    right opposite the palmer stood his thin dark visage seen but half    half hidden by his hood still fixed on marmion was his look which he who ill such gaze could brook    strove by a frown to quell but not for that though more than once full met their stern encountering glance    the palmers visage fell  vi  by fits less frequent from the crowd was heard the burst of laughter loud for still as squire and archer stared on that dark face and matted beard    their glee and game declined all gazed at length in silence

melancholy sound and silence sunk on all around the air was sad but sadder still    it fell on marmions ear and plained as if disgrace and ill    and shameful death were near he drew his mantle past his face    between it and the band and rested with his head a space    reclining on his hand his thoughts i scan not but i ween that could their import have been seen the meanest groom in all the

time when here he came to seek sir hugo then our lord a braver never drew a sword a wiser never at the hour of midnight spoke the word of power the same whom ancient records call the founder of the goblin hall i would sir knight your longer stay gave you that cavern to survey of lofty roof and ample size beneath the castle deep it lies to hew the living rock profound the floor to pave the arch to round there never toiled a mortal arm  it all was wrought by word and charm and i have heard my grandsire say that the wild clamour and affray of those dread artisans of hell who laboured under hugos spell sounded as loud as oceans war among the caverns of dunbar  xx  the king lord giffords castle sought deep labouring with uncertain thought even then he mustered all his host to meet upon

quaint and fearful sight his mantle lined with foxskins white his high and wrinkled forehead bore a pointed cap such as of yore clerks say that pharaohs magi wore his shoes were marked with cross and spell upon his breast a pentacle his zone of virgin parchment thin or as some tell of dead mans skin bore many a planetary sign combust and retrograde and trine and in his hand he held prepared a naked sword without a guard  xxi  dire dealings with the fiendish race had marked strange lines upon his face vigil and fast had worn him grim his eyesight dazzled seemed and dim as one unused to upper day even his own menials with dismay beheld sir knight the grisly sire in his unwonted wild attire unwonted for traditions run he seldom thus beheld the sun i know he saidhis voice was hoarse

lefthand the townthe pictish race the trench long since in blood did trace the moor around is brown and bare the space within is green and fair the spot our village children know for there the earliest wildflowers grow but woe betide the wandering wight that treads its circle in the night the breadth across a bowshot clear gives ample space for full career opposed to the four points of heaven by four deep gaps are entrance given the southernmost our monarch passed halted and blew a gallant blast and on the north within the ring appeared the form of englands king who then a thousand leagues afar in palestine waged holy war yet arms like englands did he wield alike the leopards in the shield alike his syrian coursers frame the riders length of limb the same long afterwards did scotland know fell edward was her deadliest foe  xxiv  the vision made our monarch start but soon he manned his noble heart and in the first career they ran the elfin knight fell horse and man yet did

all around the shadowy kings denmarks grim ravens cowered their wings tis said that in that awful night remoter visions met his sight foreshowing future conquests far when our sons sons wage northern

as legends tell and they were wallace wight and gilbert hay    gentles my tale is said  xxvi  the quaighs were deep the liquors strong and on the tale the yeomanthrong had made a comment sage and long    but marmion gave a sign and with their lord the squires retire the rest around the hostel fire    their drowsy limbs recline for pillow underneath each head the quiver and the targe were laid deep slumbering on the hostel floor oppressed with toil and ale they snore the dying flame in fitful change threw on the group its shadows strange  xxvii  apart and nestling in the hay of a waste loft fitzeustace lay scarce by the pale moonlight were seen the foldings of his mantle green lightly he dreamt as youth will dream of sport by thicket or by stream of hawk or hound of ring or glove or lighter yet of ladys love a cautious tread his slumber broke and close beside him when he woke in moonbeam half and half in gloom stood a tall form with nodding plume but ere his dagger eustace drew his master marmions voice he knew  xxviii  fitzeustace risei cannot rest  yon churls wild legend haunts my breast and graver thoughts have chafed my mood the air must cool my feverish blood and fain would i ride forth to see the scene of elfin chivalry arise and saddle me my steed and gentle eustace take good heed thou dost not rouse these drowsy slaves i would not that the prating knaves had cause for saying oer their ale that i could credit such a tale then softly down the steps they slid eustace the stable door undid and darkling marmions steed arrayed while whispering thus the baron said    xxix  didst never good my youth hear tell    that on the hour when i was born saint george who graced my sires chapelle down from his steed of marble fell    a weary wight forlorn the flattering chaplains all agree the champion left his steed to me i would the omens truth to show that i could meet this elfin foe blithe would i battle for the right to ask one question at the sprite  vain thought for elves if elves there be an empty race by fount or sea to dashing waters dance and sing or round the green oak wheel their ring thus speaking he his steed bestrode and from the hostel slowly rode  xxx  fitzeustace followed him abroad and marked him pace the village road    and listened to his horses tramp    till by the lessening sound    he judged that of the pictish camp    lord marmion sought the round wonder it seemed in the squires eyes that one so wary held and wise  of whom twas said he scarce received for gospel what the church believed     should stirred by idle tale ride forth in silence of the night as hoping half to meet a sprite    arrayed in plate and mail for little did fitzeustace know that passions in contending flow    unfix the strongest mind wearied from doubt to doubt to flee we welcome fond credulity    guide confident though blind  xxxi  little for this fitzeustace cared but patient waited till he heard at distance pricked to utmost speed the foottramp of a flying steed    come townward rushing on first dead as if on turf it trode then clattering on the village road  in other pace than forth he yode    returned lord marmion down hastily he sprung from selle and in his haste wellnigh he fell to the squires hand the rein he threw and spoke no word as he withdrew but yet the moonlight did betray the falconcrest was soiled with clay and plainly might fitzeustace see by stains upon the chargers knee and his left side that on the moor he had not kept his footing sure long musing on these wondrous signs at length to rest the squire reclines broken and short for still between would dreams of terror intervene eustace did neer so blithely mark the first notes of the morning lark    introduction to canto fourth to james skene esq ashestiel ettrick forest    an ancient minstrel sagely said where is the life which late we led that motley clown in arden wood whom humorous jaques with envy viewed not even that clown could amplify on this trite text so long as i eleven years we now may tell since we have known each other well since riding side by side our hand first drew the voluntary brand and sure through many a varied scene unkindness never came between away these winged years have flown to join the mass of ages gone and though deep marked like all below with checkered shades of joy and woe though thou oer realms and seas hast ranged marked cities lost and empires changed while here at home my narrower ken somewhat of manners saw and men though varying wishes hopes and fears fevered the progress of these years yet now days weeks and months but seem the recollection of a dream so still we glide down to the sea of fathomless eternity    even now it scarcely seems a day since first i tuned this idle lay a task so often thrown aside when leisure graver cares denied that now novembers dreary gale whose voice inspired my opening tale that same november gale once more whirls the dry leaves on yarrow shore their vexed boughs streaming to the sky once more our naked birches sigh and blackhouse heights and ettrick pen have donned their wintry shrouds again and mountain dark and flooded mead bid us forsake the banks of tweed earlier than wont along the sky mixed with the rack the snow mists fly the shepherd who in summer sun had something of our envy won as thou with pencil i with pen the features traced of hill and glen  he who outstretched the livelong day at ease among the heathflowers lay viewed the light clouds with vacant look or slumbered oer his tattered book or idly busied him to guide his angle oer the lessened tide  at midnight now the snowy plain finds sterner labour for the swain    when red hath set the beamless sun through heavy vapours dark and dun when the tired ploughman dry and warm hears halfasleep the rising storm hurling the hail and sleeted rain against the casements tinkling pane the sounds that drive wild deer and fox to shelter in the brake and rocks are warnings which the shepherd ask to dismal and to dangerous task oft he looks forth and hopes in vain the blast may sink in mellowing rain till dark above and white below decided drives the flaky snow and forth the hardy swain must go long with dejected look and whine to leave the hearth his dogs repine whistling and cheering them to aid around his back he wreathes the plaid his flock he gathers and he guides to open downs and mountainsides where fiercest though the tempest blow least deeply lies the drift below the blast that whistles oer the fells stiffens his locks to icicles oft he looks back while streaming far his cottage window seems a star  loses its feeble gleamand then turns patient to the blast again and facing to the tempests sweep drives through the gloom his lagging sheep if fails his heart if his limbs fail benumbing death is in the gale his paths his landmarks all unknown close to the hut no more his own close to the aid he sought in vain the morn may find the stiffened swain the widow sees at dawning pale his orphans raise their feeble wail and close beside him in the snow poor yarrow partner of their woe couches upon his masters breast and licks his cheek to break his rest    who envies now the shepherds lot his healthy fare his rural cot his summer couch by greenwood tree his rustic kirns loud revelry his native hillnotes tuned on high to marion of the blithesome eye his crook his scrip his oaten reed and all arcadias golden creed    changes not so with us my skene of human life the varying scene our youthful summer oft we see dance by on wings of game and glee while the dark storm reserves its rage against the winter of our age as he the ancient chief of troy his manhood spent in peace and joy but grecian fires and loud alarms called ancient priam forth to arms then happy those since each must drain his share of pleasure share of pain then happy those beloved of heaven to whom the mingled cup is given whose lenient sorrows find relief whose joys are chastened by their grief and such a lot my skene was thine when thou of late wert doomed to twine  just when thy bridal hour was by  the cypress with the myrtle tie just on thy bride her sire had smiled and blessed the union of his child when love must change its joyous cheer and wipe affections filial tear nor did the actions next his end speak more the father than the friend scarce had lamented forbes paid the tribute to his minstrels shade the tale of friendship scarce was told ere the narrators heart was cold  far may we search before we find a heart so manly and so kind but not around his honoured urn shall friends alone and kindred mourn the thousand eyes his care had dried pour at his name a bitter tide and frequent falls the grateful dew for benefits the world neer knew if mortal charity dare claim the almightys attributed name inscribe above his mouldering clay the widows shield the orphans stay nor though it wake thy sorrow deem my verse intrudes on this sad theme for sacred was the pen that wrote thy fathers friend forget thou not and grateful title may i plead for many a kindly word and deed to bring my tribute to his grave tis littlebut tis all i have    to thee perchance this rambling strain recalls our summer walks again when doing naughtand to speak true not anxious to find aught to do  the wild unbounded hills we ranged while oft our talk its topic changed and desultory as our way ranged unconfined from grave to gay even when it flagged as oft will chance no effort made to break its trance we could right pleasantly pursue our sports in social silence too thou gravely labouring to portray the blighted oaks fantastic spray i spelling oer with much delight the legend of that antique knight tirante by name ycleped the white at eithers feet a trusty squire pandour and camp with eyes of fire jealous each others motions viewed and scarce suppressed their ancient feud the laverock whistled from the cloud the stream was lively but not loud from the white thorn the mayflower shed its dewy fragrance round our head not ariel lived more merrily under the blossomed bough than we    and blithesome nights too have been ours when winter stript the summers bowers careless we heard what now i hear the wild blast sighing deep and drear when fires were bright and lamps beamed gay and ladies tuned the lovely lay and he was held a laggard soul who shunned to quaff the sparkling bowl then he whose absence we deplore who breathes the gales of devons shore the longer missed bewailed the more and thou and i and dearloved rae and one whose name i may not say  for not mimosas tender tree shrinks sooner from the touch than he  in merry chorus well combined with laughter drowned the whistling wind mirth was within and care without might gnaw her nails to hear our shout not but amid the buxom scene some grave discourse might intervene  of the good horse that bore him best his shoulder hoof and arching crest for like mad toms our chiefest care was horse to ride and weapon wear such nights weve had and though the game of manhood be more sober tame and though the fieldday or the drill seem less important nowyet still such may we hope to share again the sprightly thought inspires my strain and mark how like a horseman true lord marmions march i thus renew    canto fourththe camp    i  eustace i said did blithely mark the first notes of the merry lark the lark sang shrill the cock he crew and loudly marmions bugles blew and with their light and lively call brought groom and yeoman to the stall    whistling they came and free of heart       but soon their mood was changed    complaint was heard on every part       of something disarranged some clamoured loud for armour lost some brawled and wrangled with the host by beckets

tell of the good steed he loves so well gaping for fear and ruth they saw the charger panting on his straw till one who would seem wisest cried what else but evil could betide with that cursed palmer for our guide better we had through mire and bush been lanternled by friar rush  ii     fitzeustace who the cause but guessed       nor wholly understood    his comrades clamorous plaints suppressed       he knew lord marmions mood    him ere he issued forth he sought    and found deep plunged in gloomy thought       and did his tale display    simply as if he knew of nought       to cause such disarray lord marmion gave attention cold nor marvelled at the wonders told  passed them as accidents of course and bade his clarions sound to horse  iii  young henry blount meanwhile the cost had reckoned with their scottish host and as the charge he cast and paid ill thou deservst thy hire he said dost see thou knave my horses plight fairies have ridden him all the night    and left him in a

pang to undergo here stayed their talk for marmion gave now the signal to set on the palmer showing forth the way they journeyed all the morning day  iv  the greensward way was smooth and good through humbies and through saltouns wood a forest glade which varying still here gave a view of dale and hill there narrower closed till overhead a vaulted screen the branches made a pleasant path fitzeustace said such as where errantknights might see adventures of high chivalry might meet some damsel flying fast with hair unbound and looks aghast and smooth and level course were here in her defence to break a spear here too are twilight nooks and dells and oft in such the story tells the damsel kind from danger freed did grateful pay her champions meed he spoke to cheer lord marmions mind perchance to show his lore designed    for eustace much had pored upon a huge romantic tome in the hallwindow of his home imprinted at the antique dome    of caxton or de worde therefore he spokebut spoke in vain for marmion answered nought again  v  now sudden distant trumpets shrill in notes prolonged by wood and hill    were heard to echo far each ready archer grasped his bow but by the flourish soon they know    they breathed no point of war yet cautious as in foemans land lord marmions order speeds the band    some opener ground to gain and scarce a furlong had they rode when thinner trees receding showed    a little woodland plain just in that advantageous glade the halting troop a line had made as forth from the opposing shade    issued a gallant train  vi  first came the trumpets at whose clang so late the forest echoes rang on prancing steeds they forward pressed with scarlet mantle azure vest each at his trump a banner wore which scotlands royal scutcheon bore

with henry more and strictly hath forbid resort from england to his royal court yet for he knows lord marmions name and honours much his warlike fame my liege hath deemed it shame and lack of courtesy to turn him back and by his order i your guide must lodging fit and fair provide till finds king james meet time to see the flower of english chivalry  ix  though inly chafed at this delay lord marmion bears it as he may the palmer his mysterious guide beholding thus his place supplied    sought to take leave in vain strict was the lionkings command that none who rode in marmions band    should sever from the train england has here enow of spies in lady herons witching eyes to marchmount thus apart he said but fair pretext to marmion made the right hand path they now decline and trace against the stream the tyne  x  at length up that wild dale they wind    where crichtoun castle crowns the bank for there the lions care assigned    a lodging meet for marmions rank that castle rises on the steep    of the green vale of tyne and far beneath where slow they creep from pool to eddy dark and deep where alders moist and willows weep    you hear her streams repine the towers in different ages rose their various architecture shows    the builders various hands a mighty mass that could oppose when deadliest hatred fired its foes    the vengeful douglas bands  xi  crichtoun though now thy miry court    but pens the lazy steer and sheep    thy turrets rude and tottered keep have been the minstrels loved resort oft have i traced within thy fort    of mouldering shields the mystic sense    scutcheons of honour or pretence quartered in old armorial sort    remains of rude magnificence nor wholly yet had time defaced    thy lordly gallery fair nor yet the stony cord unbraced whose twisted knots with roses laced    adorn thy ruined stair still rises unimpaired below the courtyards graceful portico above its cornice row and row    of fair hewn facets richly show       their pointed diamond form    though there but houseless cattle go       to shield them from the storm    and shuddering still may we explore       where oft whilom were captives pent    the darkness of thy massymore       or from thy grassgrown battlement may trace in undulating line the sluggish mazes of the tyne  xii  another aspect crichtoun showed as through its portal marmion rode but yet twas melancholy state received him at the outer gate for none were in the castle then but women boys or aged men with eyes scarce dried the sorrowing dame to welcome noble marmion came her son a stripling twelve years old proffered the barons rein to hold for each man that could draw a sword had marched that morning with their lord earl adam hepburnhe who died on flodden by his sovereigns side long may his lady look in vain she neer shall see his gallant train come sweeping back through crichtoun dean twas a brave race before the name of hated bothwell stained their fame  xiii  and here two days did marmion rest with every rite that honour claims attended as the kings own guest     such the command of royal james who marshalled then his lands array upon the borough moor that lay perchance he would not foemans eye upon his gathering host should pry till full prepared was every band to march against the english land here while they dwelt did lindesays wit oft cheer the barons moodier fit and in his turn he knew to prize lord marmions powerful mind and wise  trained in the lore of rome and greece and policies of war and peace  xiv  it chanced as fell the second night    that on the battlements they walked and by the slowly fading night    of varying topics talked and unaware the heraldbard said marmion might his toil have spared    in travelling so far for that a messenger from heaven in vain to james had counsel given    against the english war and closer questioned thus he told a tale which chronicles of old in scottish story have enrolled    xv  sir david lindesays tale  of all the palaces so fair    built for the royal dwelling in scotland far beyond compare    linlithgow is excelling and in its park in jovial june how sweet the merry linnets tune    how blithe the blackbirds lay the wildbuck bells from ferny brake the coot dives merry on the lake the saddest heart might pleasure take    to see all nature gay but june is to our sovereign dear the heaviest month in all the year too well his cause of grief you know june saw his fathers overthrow woe to the traitors who could bring the princely boy against his king still in his conscience burns the sting in offices as strict as lent king jamess june is ever spent  xvi  when last this ruthful month was come and in linlithgows holy dome    the king as wont was praying while for his royal fathers soul the chanters sung the bells did toll    the bishop mass was saying  for now the year brought round again the day the luckless king was slain  in katharines aisle the monarch knelt with sackclothshirt and iron belt    and eyes with sorrow streaming around him in their stalls of state the thistles knightcompanions sate    their banners oer them beaming i too was there and sooth to tell bedeafened with the jangling knell was watching where the sunbeams fell    through the stained casement gleaming but while i marked what next befell    it seemed as i were dreaming stepped from the crowd a ghostly wight in azure gown with cincture white his forehead bald his head was bare down hung at length his yellow hair now mock me not when good my lord i pledged to you my knightly word that when i saw his placid grace his simple majesty of face his solemn bearing and his pace    so stately gliding on seemed to me neer did limner paint so just an image of the saint who propped the virgin in her faint     the loved apostle john  xvii  he stepped before the monarchs chair and stood with rustic plainness there    and little reverence made nor head nor body bowed nor bent but on the desk his arm he leant    and words like these he said in a low voicebut never tone so thrilled through vein and nerve and bone my mother sent me from afar sir king to warn thee not to war     woe waits on thine array if war thou wilt of woman fair her witching wiles and wanton snare james stuart doubly warned beware    god keep thee as he may the wondering monarch seemed to seek    for answer and found none and when he raised his head to speak    the monitor was gone the marshal and myself had cast to stop him as he outward passed but lighter than the whirlwinds blast    he vanished from our eyes like sunbeam on the billow cast    that glances but and dies  xviii     while lindesay told his marvel strange       the twilight was so pale    he marked not marmions colour change       while listening to the tale    but after a suspended pause    the baron spoke of natures laws       so strong i held the force    that never superhuman cause       could eer control their course and three days since had judged your aim was but to make your guest your game but i have seen since passed the tweed what much has changed my sceptic creed and made me credit aught  he stayed and seemed to wish his words unsaid but by that strong emotion pressed which prompts us to unload our breast    een when discoverys pain to lindesay did at length unfold the tale his village host had told    at gifford to his train nought of the palmer says he there and nought of constance or of clare the thoughts which broke his sleep he seems to mention but as feverish dreams  xix  in vain said he to rest i spread my burning limbs and couched my head    fantastic thoughts returned and by their wild dominion led    my heart within me burned so sore was the delirious goad i took my steed and forth i rode and as the moon shone bright and cold soon reached the camp upon the wold the southern entrance i passed through and halted and my bugle blew methought an answer met my ear  yet was the blast so low and drear so hollow and so faintly blown it might be echo of my own  xx  thus judging for a little space i listened ere i left the place    but scarce could trust my eyes nor yet can think they served me true when sudden in the ring i view in form distinct of shape and hue    a mounted champion rise ive fought lordlion many a day in single fight and mixed affray and ever i myself may say    have borne me as a knight but when this unexpected foe seemed starting from the gulf below i care not though the truth i show    i trembled with affright and as i placed in rest my spear my hand so shook for very fear    i scarce could couch it right  xxi  why need my tongue the issue tell we ran our coursemy charger fell what could he gainst the shock of hell    i rolled upon the plain high oer my head with threatening hand the spectre took his naked brand     yet did the worst remain my dazzled eyes i upward cast  not opening hell itself could blast    their sight like what i saw full on his face the moonbeam strook  a face could never be mistook i knew the stern vindictive look    and held my breath for awe i saw the face of one who fled to foreign climes has long been dead     i well believe the last for neer from vizor raised did stare a human warrior with a glare    so grimly and so ghast thrice oer my head he shook the blade but when to good saint george i prayed the first time eer i asked his aid    he plunged it in the sheath and on his courser mounting light he seemed to vanish from my sight the moonbeam drooped and deepest night    sunk down upon the heath twere long to tell what cause i have    to know his face that met me there called by his hatred from the grave    to cumber upper air dead or alive good cause had he to be my mortal enemy  xxii  marvelled sir david of the mount then learned in story gan recount    such chance had happed of old when once near norham there did fight a spectre fell of fiendish might in likeness of a scottish knight    with brian bulmer bold and trained him nigh to disallow the aid of his baptismal vow and such a phantom too tis said with highland broadsword targe and plaid    and fingers red with gore is seen in rothiemurcus

in faith in bosom bold true son of chivalry should hold    these midnight terrors vain for seldom hath such spirit power to harm save in the evil hour when guilt we meditate within or harbour unrepented sin lord marmion turned him half aside and twice to clear his voice he tried    then pressed sir davids hand  but nought at length in answer said and here their farther converse stayed    each ordering that his band should bowne them with the rising day to scotlands camp to take their way     such was the kings command  xxiii  early they took dunedins road and i could trace each step they trode hill brook nor dell nor rock nor stone lies on the path to me unknown much might it boast of storied lore but passing such digression oer suffice it that their route was laid across the furzy hills of braid they passed the glen and scanty rill and climbed the opposing bank until they gained the top of blackford hill  xxiv     blackford on whose uncultured breast       among the broom and thorn and whin    a truantboy i sought the nest    or listed as i lay at rest       while rose on breezes thin    the murmur of the city crowd    and from his steeple jangling loud       saint giless mingling din    now from the summit to the plain    waves all the hill with yellow grain       and oer the landscape as i look    nought do i see unchanged remain       save the rude cliffs and chiming brook to me they make a heavy moan of early friendships past and gone  xxv  but different far the change has been    since marmion from the crown of blackford saw that martial scene    upon the bent so brown thousand pavilions white as snow spread all the borough moor below    upland and dale and down a thousand did i say  i ween thousands on thousands there were seen that chequered all the heath between    the streamlet and the town in crossing ranks extending far forming a camp irregular oft giving way where still there stood some relics of the old oak wood that darkly huge did intervene and tamed the glaring white with green in these extended lines there lay a martial kingdoms vast array  xxvi  for from hebudes dark with rain to eastern lodons fertile plain and from the southern redswire edge to farthest rosses rocky ledge from west to east from south to north scotland sent all her warriors forth marmion might hear the mingled hum of myriads up the mountain come the horses tramp and tingling clank where chiefs reviewed their vassal rank    and chargers shrilling neigh and see the shifting lines advance while frequent flashed from shield and lance    the suns reflected ray  xxvii  thin curling in the morning air the wreaths of failing smoke declare to embers now the brands decayed where the nightwatch their fires had made they saw slow rolling on the plain full many a baggagecart and wain and dire artillerys clumsy car by sluggish oxen tugged to war and there were borthwicks sisters seven and culverins which france had given illomened gift the guns remain the conquerors spoil on flodden plain  xxviii  nor marked they less where in the air a thousand streamers flaunted fair    various in shape device and hue    green sanguine purple red and blue broad narrow swallowtailed and square scroll pennon pensil bandrol there    oer the pavilions flew highest and midmost was descried the royal banner floating wide    the staff a pinetree strong and straight pitched deeply in a massive stone  which still in memory is shown     yet bent beneath the standards weight       wheneer the western wind unrolled    with toil the huge and cumbrous fold and gave to view the dazzling field where in proud scotlands royal shield    the ruddy lion ramped in gold  xxix  lord marmion viewed the landscape bright  he viewed it with a chiefs delight     until within him burned his heart    and lightning from his eye did part       as on the battleday    such glance did falcon never dart       when stooping on his prey oh well lord lion hast thou said thy king from warfare to dissuade    were but a vain essay for by saint george were that host mine not power infernal nor divine should once to peace my soul incline till i had dimmed their armours shine    in glorious battlefray answered the bard of milder mood  fair is the sightand yet twere good    that kings would think withal when peace and wealth their land has blessed tis better to sit still at rest than rise perchance to fall  xxx  still on the spot lord marmion stayed for fairer scene he neer surveyed    when sated with the martial show    that peopled all the plain below    the wandering eye could oer it go    and mark the distant city glow       with gloomy splendour red    for on the smokewreaths huge and slow    that round her sable turrets flow       the morning beams were shed    and tinged them with a lustre proud    like that which streaks a thundercloud such dusky grandeur clothed the height where the huge castle holds its state    and all the steep slope down whose ridgy back heaves to the sky piled deep and massy close and high    mine own romantic town but northward far with purer blaze on ochil mountains fell the rays and as each heathy top they kissed it gleamed a purple amethyst yonder the shores of fife you saw here preston bay and berwick law    and broad between them rolled the gallant frith the eye might note whose islands on its bosom float    like emeralds chased in gold fitz eustace heart felt closely pent as if to give his rapture vent the spur he to his charger lent    and raised his bridle hand and making demivolte in air cried wheres the coward that would not dare    to fight for such a land the lindesay smiled his joy to see nor marmions frown repressed his glee  xxxi  thus while they looked a flourish proud where mingled trump and clarion loud    and fife and kettledrum and sackbut deep and psaltery and warpipe with discordant cry and cymbal clattering to the sky making wild music bold and high    did up the mountain come the whilst the bells with distant chime merrily tolled the hour of prime    and thus the lindesay spoke thus clamour still the warnotes when the king to mass his way has taen or to st katharines of sienne    or chapel of saint rocque to you they speak of martial fame but me remind of peaceful game    when blither was their cheer thrilling in falkland woods the air in signal none his steed should spare

the barrier guard have open made    so lindesay bade the palisade that closed the tented ground their men the warders backward drew and carried pikes as they rode through    into its ample bound fast ran the scottish warriors there upon the southern band to stare and envy with their wonder rose to see such wellappointed foes such length of shaft such mighty bows so huge that many simply thought but for a vaunt such weapons wrought and little deemed their force to feel through links of mail and plates of steel when rattling upon flodden vale the clothyard arrows flew like hail  ii  nor less did marmions skilful view glance every line and squadron through and much he marvelled one small land could marshal forth such various band    for menatarms were here heavily sheathed in mail and plate like iron towers for strength and weight on flemish steeds of bone and height    with battleaxe and spear young knights and squires a lighter train practised their chargers on the plain by aid of leg of hand and rein    each warlike feat to show to pass to wheel the croupe to gain the high curvet that not in vain the sword sway might descend amain    on foemans casque below he saw the hardy burghers there march armed on foot with faces bare    for vizor they wore none nor waving plume nor crest of knight but burnished were their corslets bright their brigantines and gorgets light    like very silver shone long pikes they had for standing fight    twohanded swords they wore and many wielded mace of weight    and bucklers bright they bore  iii  on foot the yeomen too but dressed in his steeljack a swarthy vest    with iron quilted well each at his back a slender store his forty days provision bore    as feudal statutes tell his arms were halbert axe or spear a crossbow there a

yet deem not in his thoughtful eye did aught of dastard terror lie    more dreadful far his ire than theirs who scorning dangers name in eager mood to battle came their valour like light straw on flame    a fierce but fading fire  iv  not so the borderer bred to war he knew the battles din afar    and joyed to hear it swell his peaceful day was slothful ease nor harp nor pipe his ear could please    like the loud slogan yell on active steed with lance and blade the lightarmed pricker plied his trade     let nobles fight for fame let vassals follow where they lead burghers to guard their townships bleed    but wars the borderers game their gain their glory their delight to sleep the day maraud the night    oer mountain moss and moor joyful to fight they took their way scarce caring who might win the day    their booty was secure these as lord marmions train passed by looked on at first with careless eye nor marvelled aught well taught to know the form and force of english bow but when they saw the lord arrayed in splendid arms and rich brocade each borderer to his kinsman said    hist ringan seest thou there canst guess which road theyll homeward ride oh could we but on border side by eusedale glen or liddells tide    beset a prize so fair that fangless lion too their guide might chance to lose his glistering hide brown maudlin of that doublet pied    could make a kirtle rare  v  next marmion marked the celtic race of different language form and face     avarious race of man just then the chiefs their tribes arrayed and wild and garish semblance made the chequered trews and belted plaid and varying notes the warpipes brayed    to every varying clan wild through their red or sable hair looked out their eyes with savage stare    on marmion as he passed their legs above the knee were bare their frame was sinewy short and spare    and hardened to the blast of taller race the chiefs they own were by the eagles plumage known the hunted reddeers undressed hide their hairy buskins well supplied the graceful bonnet decked their head back from their shoulders hung the plaid a broadsword of unwieldy length a dagger proved for edge and strength    a studded targe they wore and quivers bows and shaftsbut oh short was the shaft and weak the bow    to that which england bore the islesmen carried at their backs the ancient danish battleaxe they raised a wild and wondering cry as with his guide rode marmion by loud were their clamouring tongues as when the clanging seafowl leave the fen and with their cries discordant mixed grumbled and yelled the pipes betwixt  vi  thus through the scottish camp they passed and reached the city gate at last where all around a wakeful guard armed burghers kept their watch and ward well had they cause of jealous fear when lay encamped in field so near the borderer and the mountaineer as through the bustling streets they go all was alive with martial show at every turn with dinning clang the armourers anvil clashed and rang or toiled the swarthy smith to wheel the bar that arms the chargers heel or axe or falchion to the side of jarring grindstone was applied page groom and squire with hurrying pace through street and lane and marketplace    bore lance or casque or sword while burghers with important face    described each newcome lord discussed his lineage told his name his following and his warlike fame the lion led to lodging meet which high oerlooked the crowded street    there must the baron rest till past the hour of vesper tide and then to holyrood must ride     such was the kings behest meanwhile the lions care assigns a banquet rich and costly wines    to marmion and his train and when the appointed hour succeeds the baron dons his peaceful weeds and following lindesay as he leads    the palacehalls they gain  vii  old holyrood rung merrily that night with wassail mirth and glee king james within her princely bower feasted the chiefs of scotlands power summoned to spend the parting hour for he had charged that his array should southward march by break of day well loved that splendid monarch aye    the banquet and the song by day the tourney and by night the merry dance traced fast and light the maskers quaint the pageant bright    the revel loud and long this feast outshone his banquets past it was his blithestand his last the dazzling lamps from gallery gay cast on the court a dancing ray here to the harp did minstrels sing there ladies touched a softer string with longeared cap and motley vest the licensed fool retailed his jest his magic tricks the juggler plied at dice and draughts the gallants vied while some in close recess apart courted the ladies of their heart    nor courted them in vain for often in the parting hour victorious love asserts his power    oer coldness and disdain and flinty is her heart can view to battle march a lover true  can hear perchance his last adieu    nor own her share of pain  viii  through this mixed crowd of glee and game the king to greet lord marmion came    while reverent all made room an easy task it was i trow king jamess manly form to know although his courtesy to show he doffed to marmion bending low    his broidered cap and plume for royal was his garb and mien    his cloak of crimson velvet piled    trimmed with the fur of martin wild his vest of changeful satin sheen    the dazzled eye beguiled his gorgeous collar hung adown wrought with the badge of scotlands crown the thistle brave of old renown his trusty blade toledo right descended from a baldric bright white were his buskins on the heel his spurs inlaid of gold and steel his bonnet all of crimson fair was buttoned with a ruby rare and marmion deemed he neer had seen a prince of such a noble mien  ix  the monarchs form was middle size for feat of strength or exercise    shaped in proportion fair and hazel was his eagle eye and auburn of the darkest dye    his short curled beard and hair light was his footstep in the dance    and firm his stirrup in the lists and oh he had that merry glance    that seldom ladys heart resists lightly from fair to fair he flew and loved to plead lament and sue  suit lightly won and shortlived pain for monarchs seldom sigh in vain    i said he joyed in banquet bower but mid his mirth twas often strange how suddenly his cheer would change    his look oercast and lower if in a sudden turn he felt the pressure of his iron belt that bound his breast in penance pain in memory of his father slain even so twas strange how evermore soon as the passing pang was oer forward he rushed with double glee into the stream of revelry thus dimseen object of affright startles the courser in his flight and half he halts half springs aside but feels the quickening spur applied and straining on the tightened rein scours doubly swift oer hill and plain  x  oer jamess heart the courtiers say sir hugh the herons wife held sway    to scotlands court she came to be a hostage for her lord who cessfords gallant heart had gored and with the king to make accord    had sent his lovely dame nor to that lady free alone did the gay king allegiance own    for the fair queen of france sent him a turquoise ring and glove and charged him as her knight and love    for her to break a lance and strike three strokes with scottish brand and march three miles on southron land and bid the banners of his band    in english breezes dance and thus for frances queen he drest his manly limbs in mailed vest and thus admitted english fair his inmost counsels still to share and thus for both he madly planned the ruin of himself and land    and yet the sooth to tell nor englands fair nor frances queen were worth one pearldrop bright and sheen    from margarets eyes that fell his own queen margaret who in lithgows bower all lonely sat and wept the weary hour  xi  the queen sits lone in lithgow pile and weeps the weary day the war against her native soil her monarchs risk in battle broil and in gay holyrood the while dame heron rises with a smile    upon the harp to play fair was her rounded arm as oer    the strings her fingers flew and as she touched and tuned them all ever her bosoms rise and fall    was plainer given to view for all for heat was laid aside her wimple and her hood untied and first she pitched her voice to sing then glanced her dark eye on the king and then around the silent ring and laughed and blushed and oft did say her pretty oath by yea and nay she could not would not durst not play at length upon the harp with glee mingled with arch simplicity a soft yet lively air she rung while thus the wily lady sung    xiilochinvar  oh young lochinvar is come out of the west through all the wide border his steed was the best and save his good broadsword he weapons had none he rode all unarmed and he rode all alone so faithful in love and so dauntless in war there never was knight like the young lochinvar  he stayed not for brake and he stopped not for stone he swam the esk river where ford there was none but ere he alighted at netherby gate the bride had consented the gallant came late for a laggard in love and a dastard in war was to wed the fair ellen of brave lochinvar  so boldly he entered the netherby hall among bridesmen and kinsmen and brothers and all then spoke the brides father his hand on his sword  for the poor craven bridegroom said never a word  oh come ye in peace here or come ye in war or to dance at our bridal young lord lochinvar  i long wooed your daughter my suit you denied love swells like the solway but ebbs like its tide and now am i come with this lost love of mine to lead but one measure drink one cup of wine there are maidens in scotland more lovely by far that would gladly be bride to the young lochinvar  the bride kissed the goblet  the knight took it up he quaffed off the wine and he threw down the cup she looked down to blush and she looked up to sigh with a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye he took her soft hand ere her mother could bar  now tread we a measure said young lochinvar  so stately his form and so lovely her face that never a hall such a galliard did grace while her mother did fret and her father did fume and the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume and the bridesmaidens whispered twere better by far to have matched our fair cousin with young lochinvar  one touch to her hand and one word in her ear when they reached the halldoor and the charger stood near so light to the croup the fair lady he swung so light to the saddle before her he sprung she is won we are gone over bank bush and scaur theyll have fleet steeds that follow quoth young lochinvar  there was mounting mong graemes of the netherby clan forsters fenwicks and musgraves they rode and they ran there was racing and chasing on cannobie lee but the lost bride of netherby neer did they see so daring in love and so dauntless in war have ye eer heard of gallant like young lochinvar  xiii  the monarch oer the siren hung and beat the measure as she sung and pressing closer and more near he whispered praises in her ear in loud applause the courtiers vied and ladies winked and spoke aside    the witching dame to marmion threw       a glance where seemed to reign    the pride that claims applauses due    and of her royal conquest too       a real or feigned disdain familiar was the look and told marmion and she were friends of old the king observed their meeting eyes with something like displeased surprise for monarchs ill can rivals brook een in a word or smile or look straight took he forth the parchment broad which marmions high commission showed our borders sacked by many a raid our peaceful liegemen robbed he said on day of truce our warden slain stout barton killed his vassals taen  unworthy were we here to reign should these for vengeance cry in vain our full defiance hate and scorn our herald has to henry borne  xiv  he paused and led where douglas stood and with stern eye the pageant viewed  i mean that douglas sixth of yore who coronet of angus bore and when his blood and heart were high did the third james in camp defy and all his minions led to die    on lauders dreary flat princes and favourites long grew tame and trembled at the homely name    of archibald bellthecat the same who left the dusky vale of hermitage in liddisdale    its dungeons and its towers where bothwells turrets brave the air and bothwell bank is blooming fair    to fix his princely bowers though now in age he had laid down his armour for the peaceful gown    and for a staff his brand yet often would flash forth the fire that could in youth a monarchs ire    and minions pride withstand and een that day at council board    unapt to soothe his sovereigns mood    against the war had angus stood and chafed his royal lord  xv     his giant form like ruined tower though falln its muscles brawny vaunt hugeboned and tall and grim and gaunt    seemed oer the gaudy scene to lower his locks and beard in silver grew his eyebrows kept their sable hue near douglas when the monarch stood his bitter speech he thus pursued lord marmion since these letters say that in the north you needs must stay    while slightest hopes of peace remain uncourteous speech it were and stern to sayreturn to lindisfarne    until my herald come again then rest you in tantallon hold your host shall be the douglas bold  a chief unlike his sires of old he wears their motto on his blade their blazon oer his towers displayed yet loves his sovereign to oppose more than to face his countrys foes    and i bethink me by saint stephen but een this morn to me was given a prize the firstfruits of the war taen by a galley from dunbar    a bevy of the maids of heaven under your guard these holy maids shall safe return to cloister shades and while they at tantallon stay requiem for cochranes soul may say and with the slaughtered favourites name across the monarchs brow there came a cloud of ire remorse and shame  xvi  in answer nought could angus speak his proud heart swelled wellnigh to break he turned aside and down his cheek    a burning tear there stole his hand the monarch sudden took that sight his kind heart could not brook    now by the bruces soul  angus my hasty speech forgive for sure as doth his spirit live as he said of the douglas old    i well may say of you  that never king did subject hold in speech more free in war more bold more tender and more true forgive me douglas once again and while the king his hand did strain the old mans tears fell down like rain to seize the moment marmion tried and whispered to the king aside oh let such tears unwonted plead for respite short from dubious deed a child will weep a brambles smart a maid to see her sparrow part a stripling for a womans heart but woe awaits a country when she sees the tears of bearded men then oh what omen dark and high when douglas wets his manly eye  xvii  displeased was james that stranger viewed and tampered with his changing mood laugh those that can weep those that may thus did the fiery monarch say southward i march by break of day and if within tantallon strong the good lord marmion tarries long perchance our meeting next may fall at tamworth in his castlehall the haughty marmion felt the taunt and answered grave the royal vaunt much honoured were my humble home if in its halls king james should come but nottingham has archers good and yorkshiremen are stern of mood northumbrian prickers wild and rude on derby hills the paths are steep in ouse and tyne the fords are deep and many a banner will be torn and many a knight to earth be borne and many a sheaf of arrows spent ere scotlands king shall cross the trent yet pause brave prince while yet you may the monarch lightly turned away and to his nobles loud did call lords to the dancea hall a hall himself his cloak and sword flung by and led dame heron gallantly and minstrels at the royal order rung out blue bonnets oer the border  xviii  leave we these revels now to tell what to saint hildas maids befell whose galley as they sailed again to whitby by a scot was taen now at dunedin did they bide till james should of their fate decide    and soon by his command were gently summoned to prepare to journey under marmions care as escort honoured safe and fair    again to english land the abbess told her chaplet oer nor knew which saint she should implore for when she thought of constance sore    she feared lord marmions mood and judge what clara must have felt the sword that hung in marmions belt    had drunk de wiltons blood unwittingly king james had given    as guard to whitbys shades the man most dreaded under heaven    by these defenceless maids yet what petition could avail or who would listen to the tale of woman prisoner and nun mid bustle of a war begun they deemed it hopeless to avoid the convoy of their dangerous guide  xix  their lodging so the king assigned to marmions as their guardian joined and thus it fell that passing nigh the palmer caught the abbess eye    who warned him by a scroll she had a secret to reveal that much concerned the churchs weal    and health of sinners soul and with deep charge of secrecy    she named a place to meet within an open balcony that hung from dizzy pitch and high    above the stately street to which as common to each home at night they might in secret come  xx  at night in secret there they came the palmer and the holy dame the moon among the clouds rose high and all the city hum was by upon the street where late before did din of war and warriors roar    you might have heard a pebble fall a beetle hum a cricket sing an owlet flap his boding wing    on giless steeple tall the antique buildings climbing high whose gothic frontlets sought the sky    were here wrapt deep in shade there on their brows the moonbeam broke through the faint wreaths of silvery smoke    and on the casements played    and other light was none to see       save torches gliding far    before some chieftain of degree    who left the royal revelry       to bowne him for the war a solemn scene the abbess chose a solemn hour her secret to disclose  xxi  o holy palmer she began  for sure he must be sainted man whose blessed feet have trod the ground where the redeemers tomb is found  for his dear churchs sake my tale attend nor deem of light avail though i must speak of worldly love  how vain to those who wed above de wilton and lord marmion wooed clara de clare of gloucesters blood idle it were of whitbys dame to say of that same blood i came and once when jealous rage was high lord marmion said despiteously wilton was traitor in his heart and had made league with martin swart when he came here on simnels part and only cowardice did restrain his rebel aid on stokefields plain and down he threw his glove  the thing was tried as wont before the king where frankly did de wilton own that swart in gueldres he had known and that between them then there went some scroll of courteous compliment for this he to his castle sent but when his messenger returned judge how de wiltons fury burned for in his packet there were laid letters that claimed disloyal aid and proved king henrys cause betrayed his fame thus blighted in the field he strove to clear by spear and shield to clear his fame in vain he strove for wondrous are his ways above perchance some form was unobserved perchance in prayer or faith he swerved else how could guiltless champion quail or how the blessed ordeal fail  xxii  his squire who now de wilton saw as recreant doomed to suffer law    repentant owned in vain that while he had the scrolls in care a stranger maiden passing fair had drenched him with a beverage rare    his words no faith could gain with clare alone he credence won who rather than wed marmion did to saint hildas shrine repair to give our house her livings fair and die a vestal votress there the impulse from the earth was given but bent her to the paths of heaven a purer heart a lovelier maid neer sheltered her in whitbys shade no not since saxon edelfled    only one trace of earthly strain       that for her lovers loss    she cherishes a sorrow vain       and murmurs at the cross    and then her heritageit goes       along the banks of tame    deep fields of grain the reaper mows    in meadows rich the heifer lows    the falconer and huntsman knows       its woodlands for the game shame were it to saint hilda dear and i her humble votress here    should do a deadly sin her temple spoiled before mine eyes if this false marmion such a prize    by my consent should win yet hath our boisterous monarch sworn that clare shall from our house be torn and grievous cause have i to fear such mandate doth lord marmion bear  xxiii  now prisoner helpless and betrayed to evil power i claim thine aid    by every step that thou hast trod to holy shrine and grotto dim by every martyrs tortured limb by angel saint and seraphim    and by the church of god for mark when wilton was betrayed and with his squire forged letters laid she was alas that sinful maid    by whom the deed was done  oh shame and horror to be said     she was a perjured nun no clerk in all the land like her traced quaint and varying character perchance you may a marvel deem    that marmions paramour for such vile thing she was should scheme    her lovers nuptial hour but oer him thus she hoped to gain as privy to his honours stain    illimitable power for this she secretly retained    each proof that might the plot reveal    instructions with his hand and seal and thus saint hilda deigned       through sinners perfidy impure       her houses glory to secure    and clares immortal weal  xxiv  twere long and needless here to tell how to my hand these papers fell    with me they must not stay saint hilda keep her abbess true who knows what outrage he might do    while journeying by the way o blessed saint if eer again i venturous leave thy calm domain to travel or by land or main    deep penance may i pay now saintly palmer mark my prayer i give this packet to thy care for thee to stop they will not dare    and oh with cautious speed to wolseys hand the papers bring that he may show them to the king    and for thy wellearned meed thou holy man at whitbys shrine a weekly mass shall still be thine    while priests can sing and read what ailst thou  speak  for as he took the charge a strong emotion shook    his frame and ere reply they heard a faint yet shrilly tone like distant clarion feebly blown    that on the breeze did die and loud the abbess shrieked in fear saint withold save us  what is here    look at yon city cross see on its battled tower appear phantoms that scutcheons seem to rear

figures that seemed to rise and die gibber and sign advance and fly while nought confirmed could ear or eye    discern of sound or mien yet darkly did it seem as there heralds and pursuivants prepare with trumpet sound and blazon fair    a summons to proclaim but indistinct the pageant proud as fancyforms of midnight cloud when flings the moon upon her shroud    a wavering tinge of flame it flits expands and shifts till loud from midmost of the spectre crowd    this awful summons came  xxvi  prince prelate potentate and peer    whose names i now shall call scottish or foreigner give ear

your earthly dust     by wrath by pride by fear by each oermastering passions tone by the dark grave and dying groan when forty days are passed and gone i cite you at your monarchs throne    to answer

sinners yoke at that dread accent with a scream parted the pageant like a dream    the summoner was gone prone on her face the abbess fell and fast and fast her beads did tell her nuns came startled by the yell    and found her there alone she marked not at the scene aghast what time or how the palmer passed  xxvii  shift we the scene  the camp doth move    dunedins streets are empty now save

now and where the abbess marmion and clare bold douglas to tantallon fair    they journey in thy charge lord marmion rode on his right hand the palmer still was with the band angus like lindesay did command    that none should roam at large but in that palmers altered mien a wondrous change might now be seen    freely he spoke of war of marvels wrought by single hand when lifted for a native land and still looked high as if he planned    some desperate deed afar his courser would he feed and stroke and tucking up his sable frock would first his mettle bold provoke    then soothe or quell his pride old hubert said that never one he saw except lord marmion    a steed so fairly ride  xxviii  some halfhours march behind there came    by eustace governed fair a troop escorting hildas dame

conquest by that meanness won he almost loathed to think upon led him at times to hate the cause which made him burst through honours laws if eer he loved twas her alone who died within that vault of

without delay you shall repair to your good kinsman lord fitzclare  xxx  the startled abbess loud exclaimed but she at whom the blow was aimed grew pale as death and cold as lead  she deemed she heard

of douglas blood the turret held a narrow stair which mounted gave you access where a parapets embattled row did seaward round the castle go sometimes in dizzy steps descending sometimes in narrow circuit bending sometimes in platform broad extending its varying circle did combine bulwark and bartisan and line and bastion tower and vantagecoign above the booming ocean leant the far projecting battlement the billows burst in ceaseless flow upon the precipice below whereer tantallon faced the land gateworks and walls were strongly manned no need upon the seagirt side the steepy rock and frantic tide approach of human step denied and thus these lines and ramparts rude were left in deepest solitude  iii  and for they were so lonely clare would to these battlements repair and muse upon her sorrows there    and list the seabirds cry or slow like noontide ghost would glide along the dark grey bulwarks side and ever on the heaving tide    look down with weary eye oft did the cliff and swelling main recall the thoughts of whitbys fane  a home she neer might see again    for she had laid adown so douglas bade the hood and veil and frontlet of the cloister pale    and benedictine gown it were unseemly sight he said a novice out of convent shade now her bright locks with sunny glow again adorned her brow of snow her mantle rich whose borders round a deep and fretted broidery bound in golden foldings sought the ground of holy ornament alone remained a cross with ruby stone    and often did she look on that which in her hand she bore with velvet bound and broidered oer    her breviary book in such a place so lone so grim at dawning pale or twilight dim    it fearful would have been to meet a form so richly dressed with book in hand and cross on breast    and such a woeful mien fitzeustace loitering with his bow to practise on the gull and crow saw her at distance gliding slow    and did by mary swear  some lovelorn fay she might have been or in romance some spellbound queen for neer in workday world was seen    a form so witching fair  iv  once walking thus at evening tide it chanced a gliding sail she spied and sighing thoughtthe abbess there perchance does to her home repair her peaceful rule where duty free walks hand in hand with charity where oft devotions tranced glow can such a glimpse of heaven bestow that the enraptured sisters see high vision and deep mystery the very form of hilda fair hovering upon the sunny air and smiling on her votaries prayer oh wherefore to my duller eye did still the saint her form deny was it that seared by sinful scorn my heart could neither melt nor burn or lie my warm affections low with him that taught them first to glow yet gentle abbess well i knew to pay thy kindness grateful due and well could brook the mild command that ruled thy simple maiden band how different now condemned to bide my doom from this dark tyrants pride but marmion has to learn ere long that constant mind and hate of wrong descended to a feeble girl from red de clare stout gloucesters earl of such a stem a sapling weak he neer shall bend although he break  v  but seewhat makes this armour here    for in her path there lay targe corslet helmshe viewed them near the breastplate pierceday much i fear weak fence wert thou gainst foemans spear that hath made fatal entrance here    as these dark bloodgouts say thus wilton  oh not corslets ward not truth as diamond pure and hard could be thy manly bosoms guard    on yon disastrous day she raised her eyes in mournful mood  wilton himself before her stood it might have seemed his passing ghost for every youthful grace was lost and joy unwonted and surprise gave their strange wildness to his eyes expect not noble dames and lords that i can tell such scene in words what skilful limner eer would choose to paint the rainbows varying hues unless to mortal it were given to dip his brush in dyes of heaven far less can my weak line declare    each changing passions shade brightning to rapture from despair sorrow surprise and pity there and joy with her angelic air and hope that paints the future fair    their varying hues displayed each oer its rivals ground extending alternate conquering shifting blending till all fatigued the conflict yield and mighty love retains the field shortly i tell what then he said by many a tender word delayed and modest blush and bursting sigh and question kind and fond reply  vi  de wiltons history  forget we that disastrous day when senseless in the lists i lay    thence draggedbut how i cannot know       for sense and recollection fled    i found me on a pallet low       within my ancient beadsmans shed    austinrememberst thou my clare how thou didst blush when the old man when first our infant love began    said we would make a matchless pair menials and friends and kinsmen fled from the degraded traitors bed  he only held my burning head and tended me for many a day while wounds and fever held their sway but far more needful was his care when sense returned to wake despair    for i did tear the closing wound    and dash me frantic on the ground if eer i heard the name of clare at length to calmer reason brought much by his kind attendance wrought    with him i left my native strand and in a palmers weeds arrayed my hated name and form to shade    i journeyed many a land no more a lord of rank and birth but mingled with the dregs of earth    oft austin for my reason feared when i would sit and deeply brood on dark revenge and deeds of blood    or wild mad schemes upreared my friend at length fell sick and said    god would remove him soon and while upon his dying bed    he begged of me a boon  if eer my deadliest enemy beneath my brand should conquered lie even then my mercy should awake and spare his life for austins sake  vii  still restless as a second cain to scotland next my route was taen    full well the paths i knew fame of my fate made various sound that death in pilgrimage i found that i had perished of my wound     none cared which tale was true and living eye could never guess de wilton in his palmers dress for now that sable slough is shed and trimmed my shaggy beard and head i scarcely know me in the glass a chance most wondrous did provide that i should be that barons guide     i will not name his name  vengeance to god alone belongs but when i think on all my wrongs    my blood is liquid flame and neer the time shall i forget when in a scottish hostel set    dark looks we did exchange what were his thoughts i cannot tell but in my bosom mustered hell    its plans of dark revenge  viii  a word of vulgar augury that broke from me i scarce knew why    brought on a village tale which wrought upon his moody sprite and sent him armed forth by night    i borrowed steed and mail and weapons from his sleeping band and passing from a postern door we met and countered hand to hand     he fell on gifford moor for the deathstroke my brand i drew  oh then my helmdd head he knew    the palmers cowl was gone  then had three inches of my blade the heavy debt of vengeance paid  my hand the thought of austin stayed    i left him there alone o good old man even from the grave thy spirit could thy master save if i had slain my foeman neer had whitbys abbess in her fear given to my hand this packet dear of power to clear my injured fame and vindicate de wiltons name perchance you heard the abbess tell of the strange pageantry of hell    that broke our secret speech  it rose from the infernal shade or featly was some juggle played    a tale of peace to teach appeal to heaven i judged was best when my name came among the rest  ix  now here within tantallon hold to douglas late my tale i told to whom my house was known of old won by my proofs his falchion bright this eve anew shall dub me knight these were the arms that once did turn the tide of fight on otterburne and harry hotspur forced to yield when the dead douglas won the field these angus gavehis armourers care ere morn shall every breach repair for naught he said was in his halls but ancient armour on the walls and aged chargers in the stalls and women priests and greyhaired men the rest were all in twisel glen and now i watch my armour here by law of arms till midnights near then once again a belted knight seek surreys camp with dawn of light  x  there soon again we meet my clare this baron means to guide thee there douglas reveres his kings command else would he take thee from his band and there thy kinsman surrey too will give de wilton justice due now meeter far for martial broil firmer my limbs and strung by toil once moreo wilton must we then risk newfound happiness again    trust fate of arms once more and is there not an humble glen    where we content and poor might build a cottage in the shade a shepherd thou and i to aid    thy task on dale and moor  that reddening browtoo well i know not even thy clare can peace bestow    while falsehood stains thy name go then to fight  clare bids thee go clare can a warriors feelings know    and weep a warriors shame can red earl gilberts spirit feel buckle the spurs upon thy heel and belt thee with thy brand of steel    and send thee forth to fame  xi  that night upon the rocks and bay the midnight moonbeam slumbering lay and poured its silver light and pure through loophole and through embrazure    upon tantallons tower and hall but chief where arched windows wide illuminate the chapels pride    the sober glances fall much was there need though seamed with scars two veterans of the douglas wars    though two grey priests were there and each a blazing torch held high you could not by their blaze descry    the chapels carving fair amid that dim and smoky light chequering the silvery moonshine bright    a bishop by the altar stood    a noble lord of douglas blood with mitre sheen and rocquet white yet showed his meek and thoughtful eye but little pride of prelacy more pleased that in a barbarous age he gave rude scotland virgils page than that beneath his rule he held the bishopric of fair dunkeld beside him ancient angus stood doffed his furred gown and sable hood oer his huge form and visage pale he wore a cap and shirt of mail and leaned his large and wrinkled hand upon the huge and sweeping brand which wont of yore in battle fray his foemans limbs to shred away as woodknife lops the sapling spray    he seemed as from the tombs around       rising at judgmentday    some giant douglas may be found       in all his old array so pale his face so huge his limb so old his arms his look so grim  xii  then at the altar wilton kneels and clare the spurs bound on his heels and think what next he must have felt at buckling of the falchion belt    and judge how clara changed her hue while fastening to her lovers side a friend which though in danger tried    he once had found untrue then douglas struck him with his blade saint michael and saint andrew aid       i dub thee knight arise sir ralph de wiltons heir for king for church for lady fair       see that thou fight and bishop gawain as he rose saidwilton grieve not for thy woes    disgrace and trouble for he who honour best bestows    may give thee double de wilton sobbed for sob he must  whereer i meet a douglas trust    that douglas is my brother nay nay old douglas said not so to surreys camp thou now must go    thy wrongs no longer smother i have two sons in yonder field and if thou meetst them under shield upon them bravelydo thy worst and foul fall him that blenches first  xiii  not far advanced was morning day when marmion did his troop array    to surreys camp to ride he had safeconduct for his band beneath the royal seal and hand    and douglas gave a guide the ancient earl with stately grace would clara on her palfrey place and whispered in an undertone let the hawk stoop his prey is flown the train from out the castle drew but marmion stopped to bid adieu though something i might plain he said of cold respect to stranger guest sent hither by your kings behest    while in tantallons towers i stayed part we in friendship from your land and noble earl receive my hand but douglas round him drew his cloak folded his arms and thus he spoke my manors halls and bowers shall still be open at my sovereigns will to each one whom he lists howeer unmeet to be the owners peer my castles are my kings alone from turret to foundationstone  the hand of douglas is his own and never shall in friendly grasp the hand of such as marmion clasp  xiv  burned marmions swarthy cheek like fire and shook his very frame for ire    andthis to me he said an twere not for thy hoary head such hand as marmions had not spared    to cleave the douglas head and first i tell thee haughty peer he who does englands message here although the meanest in her state may well proud angus be thy mate and douglas more i tell thee here    even in thy pitch of pride here in thy hold thy vassals near  nay never look upon your lord and lay your hands upon your sword     i tell thee thourt defied and if thou saidst i am not peer to any lord in scotland here lowland or highland far or near    lord angus thou hast lied on the earls cheek the flush of rage oercame the ashen hue of age fierce he broke forthand darst thou then to beard the lion in his den    the douglas in his hall and hopst thou thence unscathed to go no by saint bride of bothwell no up drawbridge groomswhat warder ho    let the portcullis fall lord marmion turnedwell was his need and dashed the rowels in his steed like arrow through the archway sprung the ponderous gate behind him rung to pass there was such scanty room the bars descending razed his plume  xv  the steed along the drawbridge flies just as it trembled on the rise nor lighter does the swallow skim along the smooth lakes level brim and when lord marmion reached his band he halts and turns with clenched hand and shout of loud defiance pours and shook his gauntlet at the towers horse horse the douglas cried and chase but soon he reined his furys pace a royal messenger he came though most unworthy of the name a letter forged  saint jude to speed did ever knight so foul a deed at first in heart it liked me ill when the king praised his clerkly skill thanks to st bothan son of mine save gawain neer could pen a line so swore i and i swear it still let my boybishop fret his fill saint mary mend my fiery mood old age neer cools the douglas blood i thought to slay him where he stood tis pity of him too he cried bold can he speak and fairly ride i warrant him a warrior tried with this his mandate he recalls and slowly seeks his castle halls  xvi  the day in marmions journey wore yet ere his passions gust was oer they crossed the heights of stanrig moor his troop more closely there he scanned and missed the palmer from the band palmer or not young blount did say he parted at the peep of day good sooth it was in strange array in what array said marmion quick my lord i ill can spell the trick but all night long with clink and bang close to my couch did hammers clang at dawn the falling drawbridge rang and from a loophole while i peep old bellthecat came from the keep wrapped in a gown of sables fair as fearful of the morning air beneath when that was blown aside a rusty shirt of mail i spied by archibald won in bloody work against the saracen and turk last night it hung not in the hall i thought some marvel would befall and next i saw them saddled lead old cheviot forth the earls best steed a matchless horse though something old prompt in his paces cool and bold i heard the sheriff sholto say the earl did much the master pray to use him on the battleday but he preferrednay henry cease thou sworn horsecourser hold thy peace eustace thou bearst a braini pray what did blount see at break of day  xvii  in brief my lord we both descried for then i stood by henrys side the palmer mount and outwards ride    upon the earls own favourite steed all sheathed he was in armour bright and much resembled that same knight subdued by you in cotswold fight    lord angus wished him speed the instant that fitzeustace spoke a sudden light on marmion broke ah dastard fool to reason lost he muttered twas nor fay nor ghost i met upon the moonlight wold but living man of earthly mould    o dotage blind and gross had i but fought as wont one thrust had laid de wilton in the dust    my path no more to cross how stand we nowhe told his tale to douglas and with some avail    twas therefore gloomed his rugged brow will surrey dare to entertain gainst marmion charge disproved and vain    small risk of that i trow yet clares sharp questions must i shun must separate constance from the nun  oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive a palmer toono wonder why i felt rebuked beneath his eye i might have known there was but one whose look could quell lord marmion  xviii  stung with these thoughts he urged to speed his troop and reached at eve the tweed where lennels convent closed their march there now is left but one frail arch    yet mourn thou not its cells our time a fair exchange has made hard by in hospitable shade    a reverend pilgrim dwells well worth the whole bernardine brood that eer wore sandal frock or hood yet did saint bernards abbot there give marmion entertainment fair and lodging for his train and clare next morn the baron climbed the tower to view afar the scottish power    encamped on flodden edge the white pavilions made a show like remnants of the winter snow    along the dusky ridge long marmion looked  at length his eye unusual movement might descry    amid the shifting lines the scottish host drawn out appears for flashing on the edge of spears    the eastern sunbeam shines their front now deepening now extending their flank inclining wheeling bending now drawing back and now descending the skilful marmion well could know they watched the motions of some foe who traversed on the plain below  xix  even so it was  from flodden ridge    the scots beheld the english host    leave barmore wood their evening post    and heedful watched them as they crossed the till by twisel bridge    high sight it is and haughty while    they dive into the deep defile    beneath the caverned cliff they fall    beneath the castles airy wall by rock by oak by hawthorn tree    troop after troop are disappearing    troop after troop their banners rearing upon the eastern bank you see still pouring down the rocky den    where flows the sullen till and rising from the dimwood glen standards on stardards men on men    in slow succession still and sweeping oer the gothic arch and pressing on in ceaseless march    to gain the opposing hill that morn to many a trumpet clang twisel thy rocks deep echo rang and many a chief of birth and rank saint helen at thy fountain drank thy hawthorn glade which now we see in springtide bloom so lavishly had then from many an axe its doom to give the marching columns room  xx  and why stands scotland idly now dark flodden on thy airy brow since england gains the pass the while and struggles through the deep defile what checks the fiery soul of james why sits that champion of the dames    inactive on his steed and sees between him and his land between him and tweeds southern strand    his host lord surrey lead what vails the vain knighterrants brand oh douglas for thy leading wand    fierce randolph for thy speed oh for one hour of wallace wight or wellskilled bruce to rule the fight and cry saint andrew and our right another sight had seen that morn from fates dark book a leaf been torn and flodden had been bannockbourne the precious hour has passed in vain and englands host has gained the plain wheeling their march and circling still around the base of flodden hill  xxi  ere yet the bands met marmions eye fitzeustace shouted loud and high hark hark my lord an english drum and see ascending squadrons come    between tweeds river and the hill foot horse and cannon  hap what hap my basnet to a prentice cap    lord surreys oer the till yet more yet morehow far arrayed they file from out the hawthorn shade    and sweep so gallant by with all their banners bravely spread    and all their armour flashing high saint george might waken from the dead    to see fair englands standards fly stint in thy prate quoth blount thoudst best and listen to our lords behest with kindling brow lord marmion said  this instant be our band arrayed the river must be quickly crossed that we may join lord surreys host if fight king jamesas well i trust that fight he will and fight he must the lady clare behind our lines shall tarry while the battle joins  xxii  himself he swift on horseback threw scarce to the abbot bade adieu far less would listen to his prayer to leave behind the helpless clare down to the tweed his band he drew and muttered as the flood they view the pheasant in the falcons claw he scarce will yield to please a daw lord angus may the abbot awe    so clare shall bide with me then on that dangerous ford and deep where to the tweed leats eddies creep    he ventured desperately and not a moment will he bide till squire or groom before him ride headmost of all he stems the tide    and stems it gallantly eustace held clare upon her horse    old hubert led her rein stoutly they braved the currents course and though far downward driven per force    the southern bank they gain behind them straggling came to shore    as best they might the train each oer his head his yewbow bore    a caution not in vain deep need that day that every string by wet unharmed should sharply ring a moment then lord marmion stayed and breathed his steed his men arrayed    then forward moved his band until lord surreys rearguard won he halted by a cross of stone that on a hillock standing lone    did all the field command  xxiii  hence might they see the full array of either host for deadly fray their marshalled lines stretched east and west    and fronted north and south and distant salutation passed    from the loud cannon mouth not in the close successive rattle that breathes the voice of modern battle    but slow and far between the hillock gained lord marmion stayed here by this cross he gently said you well may view the scene here shalt thou tarry lovely clare oh think of marmion in thy prayer thou wilt not wellno less my care shall watchful for thy weal prepare you blount and eustace are her guard    with ten picked archers of my train with england if the day go hard    to berwick speed amain but if we conquer cruel maid my spoils shall at your feet be laid    when here we meet again he waited not for answer there and would not mark the maids despair    nor heed the discontented look from either squire but spurred amain and dashing through the battle plain    his way to surrey took  xxiv  the good lord marmion by my life    welcome to dangers hour short greeting serves in time of strife    thus have i ranged my power myself will rule this central host    stout stanley fronts their right my sons command the vaward post    with brian tunstall stainless knight    lord dacre with his horsemen light    shall be in rearward of the fight and succour those that need it most    now gallant marmion well i know    would gladly to the vanguard go edmund the admiral tunstall there with thee their charge will blithely share there fight thine own retainers too beneath de burg thy steward true thanks noble surrey  marmion said nor farther greeting there he paid but parting like a thunderbolt first in the vanguard made a halt    where such a shout there rose of marmion  marmion that the cry up flodden mountain shrilling high    startled the scottish foes  xxv  blount and fitzeustace rested still with lady clare upon the hill on which for far the day was spent the western sunbeams now were bent the cry they heard its meaning knew could plain their distant comrades view sadly to blount did eustace say unworthy office here to stay no hope of gilded spurs today but see look upon flodden bent the scottish foe has fired his tent    and sudden as he spoke from the sharp ridges of the hill all downward to the banks of till    was wreathed in sable smoke volumed and fast and rolling far the cloud enveloped scotlands war    as down the hill they broke nor martial shout nor minstrel tone announced their march their tread alone at times one warning trumpet blown    at times a stifled hum told england from his mountainthrone    king james did rushing come scarce could they hear or see their foes    until at weaponpoint they close they close in clouds of smoke and dust with swordsway and with lances thrust    and such a yell was there of sudden and portentous birth as if men fought upon the earth    and fiends in upper air oh life and death were in the shout recoil and rally charge and rout    and triumph and despair long looked the anxious squires their eye could in the darkness nought descry  xxvi  at length the freshening western blast aside the shroud of battle cast and first the ridge of mingled spears above the brightening cloud appears and in the smoke the pennons flew as in the storm the white seamew then marked they dashing broad and far the broken billows of the war and plumed crests of chieftains brave floating like foam upon the wave    but nought distinct they see wide raged the battle on the plain spears shook and falchions flashed amain fell englands arrowflight like rain crests rose and stooped and rose again    wild and disorderly amid the scene of tumult high they saw lord marmions falcon fly and stainless tunstalls banner white and edmund howards lion bright still bear them bravely in the fight    although against them come of gallant gordons many a one and many a stubborn badenochman and many a rugged border clan    with huntley and with home  xxvii far on the left unseen the while stanley broke lennox and argyle though there the western mountaineer rushed with bare bosom on the spear and flung the feeble targe aside and with both hands the broadsword plied twas vain but fortune on the right with fickle smile cheered scotlands fight then fell that spotless banner white    the howards lion fell yet still lord marmions falcon flew with wavering flight while fiercer grew    around the battleyell the border slogan rent the sky a home a gordon was the cry loud were the clanging blows advancedforced backnow low now high    the pennon sunk and rose as bends the barques mast in the gale when rent are rigging shrouds and sail    it wavered mid the foes no longer blount the view could bear by heaven and all its saints  i swear    i will not see it lost fitzeustace you with lady clare may bid your beads and patter prayer     i gallop to the host and to the fray he rode amain followed by all the archer train the fiery youth with desperate charge made for a space an opening large     the rescued banner rose  but darkly closed the war around like pinetrees rooted from the ground    it sunk among the foes then eustace mounted too yet stayed as loth to leave the helpless maid    when fast as shaft can fly bloodshot his eyes his nostrils spread the loose rein dangling from his head housing and saddle bloody red    lord marmions steed rushed by and eustace maddening at the sight    a look and sign to clara cast    to mark he would return in haste then plunged into the fight  xxviii  ask me not what the maiden feels    left in that dreadful hour alone perchance her reason stoops or reels    perchance a courage not her own    braces her mind to desperate tone the scattered van of england wheels    she only said as loud in air    the tumult roared is wilton there    they fly or maddened by despair fight but to dieis wilton there with that straight up the hill there rode    two horsemen drenched with gore and in their arms a helpless load    a wounded knight they bore his hand still strained the broken brand his arms were smeared with blood and sand dragged from among the horses feet with dinted shield and

pain rung forth a lowly moan and half he murmuredis there none    of all my halls have nursed page squire or groom one cup to bring of blessed water from the spring    to slake my dying thirst  xxx  o woman in our hours of ease uncertain coy and hard to please and variable as the shade by the light quivering aspen made when pain and anguish wring the brow a ministering angel thou scarce were the piteous accents said when with the barons casque the maid    to the nigh streamlet ran forgot were hatred wrongs and fears the plaintive voice alone she hears    sees but the dying man she stooped her by the runnels side    but in abhorrence backward drew for oozing from the mountains side where raged the war a darkred tide    was curdling in the streamlet blue where shall she turnbehold her mark    a little fountain cell where water clear as diamondspark    in a stone basin fell above some halfworn letters say drink  weary  pilgrim  drink  and  pray  for  the  kind  soul  of  sybil  gray     who  built  this  cross  and  well   she filled the helm and back she hied and with surprise and joy espied    a monk supporting marmions head a pious man whom duty brought to dubious verge of battle fought    to shrive the dying bless the dead  xxxi  deep drank lord marmion of the wave and as she stooped his brow to lave  is it the hand of clare he said or injured constance bathes my head    then as remembrance rose  speak not to me of shrift or prayer    i must redress her woes short space few words are mine to spare forgive and listen gentle clare    alas she said the while oh think of your immortal weal in vain for constance is your zeal    shedied at holy isle lord marmion started from the ground as light as if he felt no wound though in the action burst the tide in torrents from his wounded side then it was truth he saidi knew that the dark presage must be true i would the fiend to whom belongs the vengeance due to all her wrongs    would spare me but a day for wasting fire and dying groan and priests slain on the altar stone    might bribe him for delay it may not bethis dizzy trance  curse on yon base marauders lance and doubly cursed my failing brand a sinful heart makes feeble hand then fainting down on earth he sunk supported by the trembling monk  xxxii  with fruitless labour clara bound and strove to staunch the gushing wound the monk with unavailing cares exhausted all the churchs prayers ever he said that close and near a ladys voice was in his ear and that the priest he could not hear    for that she ever sung in the lost battle borne down by the

divine    oh think on faith and bliss by many a deathbed i have been and many a sinners parting seen    but never aught like this the war that for a space did fail now trebly thundering swelled the gale    andstanley was the cry a light on marmions visage spread    and fired his glazing eye with dying hand above his head he shook the fragment of his blade    and shouted victory charge chester charge  on stanley on were the last words of marmion  xxxiii  by this though deep the evening fell still rose the battles deadly swell for still the scots around their king unbroken fought in desperate ring wheres now their victor vaward wing    where huntly and where home oh for a blast of that dread horn on fontarabian echoes borne    that to king charles did come when rowland brave and olivier and every paladin and peer    on roncesvalles died such blast might warn them not in vain to quit the plunder of the slain and turn the doubtful day again    while yet on flodden side afar the royal standard flies and round it toils and bleeds and dies    our caledonian pride in vain the wishfor far away while spoil and havoc mark their way near sybils cross the plunderers stray oh lady cried the monk away    and placed her on her steed and led her to the chapel fair    of tillmouth upon tweed there all the night they spent in prayer and at the dawn of morning there she met her kinsman lord fitzclare  xxxiv  but as they left the darkning heath more desperate grew the strife of death the english shafts in volleys hailed in headlong charge their horse assailed front flank and rear the squadrons sweep to break the scottish circle deep    that fought around their king but yet though thick the shafts as snow though charging knights like whirlwinds go though billmen ply the ghastly blow    unbroken was the ring the stubborn spearmen still made good their dark impenetrable wood each stepping where his comrade stood    the instant that he fell no thought was there of dastard flight linked in the serried phalanx tight groom fought like noble squire like knight    as fearlessly and well till utter darkness closed her wing oer their thin host and wounded king then skilful surreys sage commands led back from strife his shattered bands    and from the charge they drew as mountainwaves from wasted lands    sweep back to ocean blue then did their loss his foemen know their king their lords their mightiest low they melted from the field as snow when streams are swolln and south winds blow    dissolves in silent dew tweeds echoes heard the ceaseless plash    while many a broken band disordered through her currents dash    to gain the scottish land to town and tower to down and dale to tell red floddens dismal tale and raise the universal wail tradition legend tune and song shall many an age that wail prolong still from the sire the son shall hear of the stern strife and carnage drear    of floddens fatal field where shivered was fair scotlands spear    and broken was her shield  xxxv  day dawns upon the mountains side there scotland lay thy bravest pride chiefs knights and nobles many a one the sad survivors all are gone view not that corpse mistrustfully defaced and mangled though it be nor to yon border castle high look northward with upbraiding eye    nor cherish hope in vain that journeying far on foreign strand the royal pilgrim to his land    may yet return again he saw the wreck his rashness wrought reckless of life he desperate fought    and fell on flodden plain and well in death his trusty brand firm clenched within his manly hand    beseemed the monarch slain but oh how changed since yon blithe night gladly i turn me from the sight    unto my tale again  xxxvi  short is my tale fitzeustace care a pierced and mangled body bare to moated lichfields lofty pile and there beneath the southern aisle a tomb with gothic sculpture fair did long lord marmions image bear now vainly for its site you look twas levelled when fanatic brook the fair cathedral stormed and took but thanks to heaven and good saint chad a guerdon meet the spoiler had there erst was martial marmion found his feet upon a couchant hound    his hands to heaven upraised and all around on scutcheon rich and tablet carved and fretted niche    his arms and feats were blazed and yet though all was carved so fair and priest for marmion breathed the prayer the last lord marmion lay not there from ettrick woods a peasant swain followed his lord to flodden plain  one of those flowers whom plaintive lay in scotland mourns as wede away sore wounded sybils cross he spied and dragged him to its foot and died close by the noble marmions side the spoilers stripped and gashed the slain and thus their corpses were mistaen and thus in the proud barons tomb the lowly woodsman took the room  xxxvii  less easy task it were to show lord marmions nameless grave and low    they dug his grave een where he lay       but every mark is gone    times wasting hand has done away    the simple cross of sybil gray       and broke her font of stone but yet out from the little hill oozes the slender springlet still    oft halts the stranger there for thence may best his curious eye the memorable field descry and shepherd boys repair to seek the waterflag and rush and rest them by the hazel bush    and plait their garlands fair nor dream they sit upon the grave that holds the bones of marmion brave when thou shalt find the little hill with thy heart commune and be still if ever in temptation strong thou leftst the right path for the wrong if every devious step thus trod still led thee further from the road dread thou to speak presumptuous doom on noble marmions lowly tomb but say he died a gallant knight with sword in hand for englands right  xxxviii  i do not rhyme to that dull elf who cannot image to himself that all through floddens dismal night wilton was foremost in the fight that when brave surreys steed was slain twas wilton mounted him again twas wiltons brand that deepest hewed amid the spearmens stubborn wood unnamed by holinshed or hall he was the living soul of all that after fight his faith made plain he won his rank and lands again and charged his old paternal shield with bearings won on flodden field nor sing i to that simple maid to whom it must in terms be said that king and kinsmen did agree to bless fair claras constancy who cannot unless i relate paint to her mind the bridals state that wolseys voice the blessing spoke more sands and denny passed the joke that bluff king hal the curtain drew and katherines hand the stocking threw and afterwards for many a day that it was held enough to say in blessing to a wedded pair love they like wilton and like clare    lenvoyto the reader    why then a final note prolong or lengthen out a closing song unless to bid the gentles speed who long have listed to my rede to statesmen grave if such may deign to read the minstrels idle strain sound head clean hand and piercing wit and patriotic heartas pitt a garland for the heros crest and twined by her he loves the best to every lovely lady bright what can i wish but faithful knight to every faithful lover too what can i wish but lady true and knowledge to the studious sage  and pillow to the head of age to thee dear schoolboy whom my lay has cheated of thy hour of play light task and
