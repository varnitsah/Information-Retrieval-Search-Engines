 263     anticipation       i will wash my brain in the splendid breeze     i will lay my cheek to the northern sun     i will drink the breath of the mossy trees     and the clouds shall meet me one by one     i will fling the scholars pen aside     and grasp once more the broncos rein     and i will ride and ride and ride     till the rain is snow and the seed is grain      the way is long and cold and lone                 but i go     it leads where pines forever moan             their weight of snow                 yet i go     there are voices in the wind that call     there are hands that beckon to the plain     i must journey where the trees grow tall     and the lonely heron clamors in the rain      where the desert flames with furnace heat                 i have trod     where the horned toads tiny feet                 in a land                 of burning sand                 leave a mark     i have ridden in the noon and in the dark     now i go to see the snows     where the mossy mountains rise     wild and bleakand the rose     and pink of morning fill the skies     with a color that is singing                 and the lights                 of polar nights                 utter cries     as they sweep from star to star                 swinging ringing     where the sunless middays are     the trail of the goldseekers     chapter i  coming of the ships   i   a little over a year ago a small steamer swung to at a seattle wharf and emptied a flood of eager passengers upon the dock it was an obscure craft making infrequent trips round the aleutian islands which form the farthest western point of the united states to the mouth of a practically unknown river called the yukon which empties into the ocean near the post of st michaels on the northwestern coast of alaska  the passengers on this boat were not distinguished citizens nor fair to look upon they were roughly dressed and some of them were pale and worn as if with long sickness or exhausting toil yet this ship and these passengers startled the whole englishspeaking world swift as electricity could fly the magical word gold went forth like a brazen eagle across the continent to turn the faces of millions of earths toilers toward a region which up to that time had been unknown or of ill report for this ship contained a million dollars in gold these seedy passengers carried great bags of nuggets and bottles of shining dust which they had burned at risk of their lives out of the perpetually frozen ground so far in the north that the winter had no sun and the summer midnight had no dusk  the world was instantly filled with the stories of these men and of their tons of bullion there was a moment of arrested attentionthen the listeners smiled and nodded knowingly to each other and went about their daily affairs  but other ships similarly laden crept laggardly through the gates of puget sound bringing other miners with bags and bottles and then the world believed thereafter the journals of all christendom had to do with the klondike and the golden river men could not hear enough or read enough of the mysterious northwest  in less than ten days after the landing of the second ship all trains westwardbound across america were heavily laden with fieryhearted adventurers who set their faces to the new eldorado with exultant confidence resolute to do and dare  miners from colorado and cowboys from montana met and mingled with civil engineers and tailors from new york city and adventurous merchants from chicago set shoulder to shoemakers from lynn all kinds and conditions of prospectors swarmed upon the boats at seattle vancouver and other coast cities some entered upon new routes to the gold fields which were now known to be far in the yukon valley while others took the already wellknown route by way of st michaels and thence up the sinuous and sinister stream whose waters began on the eastern slope of the glacial peaks just inland from juneau and swept to the north and west for more than two thousand miles it was understood that this way was long and hard and cold yet thousands eagerly embarked on keels of all designs and of all conditions of unseaworthiness by far the greater number assaulted the mountain passes of skagway  as the autumn came on the certainty of the gold deposits deepened but the tales of savage cliffs of snowwalled trails of swift and icy rivers grew more numerous more definite and more appalling weakhearted jasons dropped out and returned to warn their friends of the dread powers to be encountered in the northern mountains  as the uncertainties of the river route and the sufferings and toils of the chilcoot and the white pass became known the adventurers cast about to find other ways of reaching the gold fields which had come now to be called the klondike because of the extreme richness of a small river of that name which entered the yukon well on toward the arctic circle  from this attempt to avoid the perils of other routes much talk arose of the dalton trail the taku trail the stikeen route the telegraph route and the edmonton overland trail every town within two thousand miles of the klondike river advertised itself as the point of departure for the gold fields and set forth the special advantages of its entrance way crying out meanwhile against the cruel mendacity of those who dared to suggest other and more dangerous and costly ways  the winter was spent in urging these claims and thousands of men planned to try some one or the other of these sidedoors the movement overland seemed about to surpass the wonderful transcontinental march of miners in 49 and 50 and those who loved the trail for its own sake and were eager to explore an unknown country hesitated only between the two trails which were entirely overland one of these led from edmonton to the headwaters of the pelly the other started from the canadian pacific railway at ashcroft and made its tortuous way northward between the great glacial coast range on the left and the lateral spurs of the continental divide on the east  the promoters of each of these routes spoke of the beautiful valleys to be crossed of the lovely streams filled with fish of the game and fruit each was called the poor mans route because with a few ponies and a gun the prospector could traverse the entire distance during the summer arriving on the banks of the yukon not merely browned and hearty but a veteran of the trail  it was pointed out also that the ashcroft route led directly across several great gold districts and that the adventurer could combine business and pleasure on the trip by examining the ominica country the kisgagash mountains the peace river and the upper waters of the stikeen these places were all spoken of as if they were close beside the trail and easy of access and the prediction was freely made that a flood of men would sweep up this valley such as had never been known in the history of goldseeking  as the winter wore on this prediction seemed about to be realized in every town in the west in every factory in the east men were organizing parties of exploration grub stakers by the hundred were outfitted a vast army was ready to march in the early spring when a new interest suddenly appeareda new army sprang into being  against the greed for gold arose the lust of battle war came to change the current of popular interest the newspapers called home their reporters in the north and sent them into the south the dakota cowboys just ready to join the ranks of the goldseekers entered the army of the united states finding in its southern campaigns an outlet to their undying passion for adventure while the factory hands who had organized themselves into a goldseeking company turned themselves into a squad of military volunteers for the time the gold of the north was forgotten in the war of the south   ii   however there were those not so profoundly interested in the war or whose arrangements had been completed before the actual outbreak of cannonshot and would not be turned aside an immense army still pushed on to the north this i joined on the 20th day of april leaving my home in wisconsin bound for the overland trail and bearing a joyous heart i believed that i was about to see and take part in a most picturesque and impressive movement across the wilderness i believed it to be the last great march of the kind which could ever come in america so rapidly were the wild places being settled up i wished therefore to take part in this tramp of the goldseekers to be one of them and record their deeds i wished to return to the wilderness also to forget books and theories of art and social problems and come again face to face with the great free spaces of woods and skies and streams i was not a goldseeker but a nature hunter and i was eager to enter this the wildest region yet remaining in northern america i willingly and with joy took the long way round the hard way through     the cowboy       of rough rude stock this saddle sprite     is grosser grown with savage things     inured to storms his fierce delight     is lawless as the beasts he swings     his swift rope overlibidinous obscene     careless of dust and dirt serene     he faces snows in calm disdain     or makes his bed down in the rain      chapter ii  outfitting   we went to sleep while the train was rushing past the lonely settlers shacks on the minnesota prairies when we woke we found ourselves far out upon the great plains of canada the morning was cold and rainy and there were long lines of snow in the swales of the limitless sod which was silent dun and still with a majesty of arrested motion like a polar ocean it was like dakota as i saw it in 1881 when it was a treeless desolate expanse swept by owls and hawks cut by feet of wild cattle unmarred and unadorned of man the clouds ragged forbidding and gloomy swept southward as if with a duty to perform no green thing appeared all was gray and sombre and the horizon lines were hid in the cold white mist spring was just coming on  our car which was a tourist sleeper was filled with goldseekers some of them bound for the stikeen river some for skagway while a few like myself had set out for teslin lake by way of the prairie route there were women going to join their husbands at dawson city and young girls on their way to vancouver and seattle and whole families emigrating to washington  by the middle of the forenoon we were pretty well acquainted and knowing that two long days were before us we set ourselves to the task of passing the time the women cooked their meals on the range in the forward part of the car or attended to the toilets of the children quite as regularly as in their own homes while the men having no duties to perform played cards or talked endlessly concerning their prospects in the northwest and when weary of this joined in singing topical songs  no one knew his neighbors name and for the most part no one cared all were in mountaineer dress with rifles revolvers and boxes of cartridges and the sight of a flock of antelopes developed in each man a frenzy of desire to have a shot at them it was a wild ride and all day we climbed over low swells passing little lakes covered with geese and brant practically the only living things late in the afternoon we entered upon the selkirks where no life was  these mountains i had long wished to see and they were in no sense a disappointment desolate deathhaunted they pushed their white domes into the blue sky in savage grandeur the little snowcovered towns seemed to cower at their feet like timid animals lost in the immensity of the forest all day we rode among these heights and at night we went to sleep feeling the chill of their desolate presence  we reached ashcroft which was the beginning of the long trail at sunrise the town lay low on the sand a spatter of little frame buildings mainly saloons and lodging houses and resembled an ordinary cowtown in the western states  rivers of dust were flowing in the streets as we debarked from the train the land seemed dry as ashes and the hills which rose near resembled those of montana or colorado the little hotel swarmed with the rudest and crudest types of men not dangerous men only thoughtless and profane teamsters and cowboys who drank thirstily and ate like wolves they spat on the floor while at the table leaning on their elbows gracelessly in the barroom they drank and chewed tobacco and talked in loud voices upon nothing at all  down on the flats along the railway a dozen camps of klondikers were set exposed to the dust and burning sun the sidewalks swarmed with outfitters everywhere about us the talk of teamsters and cattle men went on concerning regions of which i had never heard men spoke of hat creek the chilcoten country soda creek lake la hache and lilloat chinamen in long boots much too large for them came and went sombrely buying gold sacks and picks they were mining quietly on the upper waters of the fraser and were popularly supposed to be getting rich  the townspeople were possessed of thrift quite american in quality and were making the most of the rush over the trail the grass is improving each day they said to the goldseekers who were disposed to feel that the townsmen were anything but disinterested especially the hotel keepers among the outfitters of course the chief beneficiaries were the horse dealers and every corral swarmed with mangy little cayuses thin hairy and wildeyed while on the fences in silent meditation or lowvoiced conferences the intending purchasers sat in rows like dyspeptic ravens the wind storm continued filling the houses with dust and making life intolerable in the camps below the town but the crowds moved to and fro restlessly on the one wooden sidewalk outfitting busily the costumes were as various as the fancies of the men but laced boots and cowboy hats predominated  as i talked with some of the more thoughtful and conscientious citizens i found them taking a very serious view of our trip into the interior it is a mighty hard and long road they said and a lot of those fellows who have never tried a trail of this kind will find it anything but a picnic excursion they had known a few men who had been as far as hazleton and the tales of rain flies and mosquitoes which these adventurers brought back with them they repeated in confidential whispers  however i had determined to go and had prepared myself for every emergency i had designed an insectproof tent and was provided with a rubber mattress a down sleepingbag rainproof clothing and stout shoes i purchased as did many of the others two bills of goods from the hudson bay company to be delivered at hazleton on the skeena and at glenora on the stikeen even with this arrangement it was necessary to carry every crumb of food in one case three hundred and sixty miles and in the other case four hundred miles however the first two hundred and twenty miles would be in the nature of a practice march for the trail ran through a country with occasional ranches where feed could be obtained we planned to start with four horses taking on others as we needed them and for one week we scrutinized the ponies swarming around the corrals in an attempt to find two packhorses that would not give out on the trail or buck their packs off at the start  we do not intend to be bothered with a lot of mean broncos i said and would not permit myself to be deceived before many days had passed we had acquired the reputation of men who thoroughly knew what they wanted at least it became known that we would not buy wild cayuses at an exorbitant price  all the week long we saw men starting out with sorebacked or blind or weak or mean broncos and heard many stories of their troubles and trials the trail was said to be littered for fifty miles with all kinds of supplies  one evening as i stood on the porch of the hotel i saw a man riding a spirited dapplegray horse up the street as i watched the splendid fling of his forefeet the proud carriage of his head the splendid nostrils the deep intelligent eyes i said there is my horse i wonder if he is for sale  a bystander remarked hes coming to see you and you can have the horse if you want it  the rider drew rein and i went out to meet him after looking the horse all over with a subtle show of not being in haste i asked how much will you take for him  fifty dollars he replied and i knew by the tone of his voice that he would not take less  i hemmed and hawed a decent interval examining every limb meanwhile finally i said get off your horse  with a certain sadness the man complied i placed in his hand a fiftydollar bill and took the horse by the bridle what is his name  i call him prince  he shall be called prince ladrone i said to burton as i led the horse away  each moment increased my joy and pride in my dapplegray gelding i could scarcely convince myself of my good fortune and concluded there must be something the matter with the horse i was afraid of some trick some meanness for almost all mountain horses are streaky but i could discover nothing he was quick on his feet as a cat listened to every word that was spoken to him and obeyed as instantly and as cheerfully as a dog he took up his feet at request he stood over in the stall at a touch and took the bit readily a severe test in every way he seemed to be exactly the horse i had been waiting for i became quite satisfied of his value the following morning when his former owner said to me in a voice of sadness now treat him well wont you  he shall have the best there is i replied  my partner meanwhile had rustled together three packhorses which were guaranteed to be kind and gentle and so at last we were ready to make a trial it was a beautiful day for a start sunny silent warm with great floating clouds filling the sky  we had tried our tent and it was pronounced a jimcrackerjack by all who saw it and exciting almost as much comment among the natives as my anderson packsaddles our truck was ready on the platform of the storehouse and the dealer in horses had agreed to pack the animals in order to show that they were as represented the whole town turned out to see the fun the first horse began bucking before the packsaddle was fairly on to the vast amusement of the bystanders  that will do for that beast i remarked and he was led away bring up your other candidate  the next horse seemed to be gentle enough but when one of the men took off his bandanna and began binding it round the ponys head i interrupted  thatll do i said i know that trick i dont want a horse whose eyes have to be blinded take him away  this left us as we were before with the exception of ladrone an indian standing near said to burton i have gentle horse no buck all same like dog  all right said partner with a sigh lets see him  the dam siwash proved to be more reliable than his white detractor his horses turned out to be gentle and strong and we made a bargain without noise at last it seemed we might be able to get away tomorrow morning said i to burton if nothing further intervenes we hit the trail a resounding whack  all around us similar preparations were going on halfbreeds were breaking wild ponies cowboys were packing roping and instructing the tenderfoot the stores swarmed with wouldbe miners fitting out while other outfits already supplied were crawling up the distant hill like loosely articulated canvascolored worms outfits from spokane and other southern towns began to drop down into the valley and every train from the east brought other prospectors to stand dazed and wondering before the squalid little camp each day each hour increased the general eagerness to get away     from plain to peak       from hot low sands aflame with heat       from crackling cedars dripping odorous gum     i ride to set my burning feet       on heights whence uncompagres waters hum     from rock to rock and run                 as white as wool      my panting horse sniffs on the breeze       the water smell too faint for me to know     but i can see afar the trees       which tell of grasses where the asters blow     and columbines and clover bending low                 are honeyfull      i catch the gleam of snowfields bright       as burnished shields of tempered steel     and round each sovereign lonely height       i watch the stormclouds vault and reel     heavy with hail and trailing                 veils of sleet      hurrah my faithful soon you shall plunge       your burning nostril to the bit in snow     soon you shall rest where foamwhite waters lunge       from cliff to cliff and you shall know     no more of hunger or the flame of sand                 or windless deserts heat      chapter iii  on the stage road   on the third day of may after a whole forenoon of packing and fussing we made our start and passed successfully over some fourteen miles of the road it was warm and beautiful and we felt greatly relieved to escape from the dry and dusty town with its conscienceless horse jockeys and its bibulous teamsters  as we mounted the whitehot road which climbed sharply to the northeast we could scarcely restrain a shout of exultation it was perfect weather we rode good horses we had chosen our companions and before us lay a thousand miles of trail and the mysterious gold fields of the faroff yukon for two hundred and twenty miles the road ran nearly north toward the town of quesnelle which was the trading camp for the caribou mining company this highway was filled with heavy teams and stage houses were frequent we might have gone by the river trail but as the grass was yet young many of the outfits decided to keep to the stage road  we made our first camp beside the dusty road near the stage barn in which we housed our horses a beautiful stream came down from the hills near us a little farther up the road a big and hairy californian with two halfbreed assistants was struggling with twentyfive wild cayuses two or three campfires sparkled near  there was a vivid charm in the scene the poplars were in tender leaf the moon round and brilliant was rising just above the mountains to the east as we made our bed and went to sleep with the singing of the stream in our ears  while we were cooking our breakfast the next morning the big californian sauntered by looking at our little folding stove our tent our newfangled packsaddles and our luxurious beds and remarked  i reckon you fellers are just out on a kind of little hunting trip  we resented the tone of derision in his voice and i replied  we are bound for teslin lake we shall be glad to see you any time during the coming fall  he never caught up with us again  we climbed steadily all the next day with the wind roaring over our heads in the pines it grew much colder and the snow covered the nearby hills the road was full of trampers on their way to the mines at quesnelle and stanley i will not call them tramps for every man who goes afoot in this land is entitled to a certain measure of respect we camped at night just outside the little village called clinton which was not unlike a town in vermont and was established during the caribou rush in 66 it lay in a lovely valley beside a swift clear stream the sward was deliciously green where we set our tent  thus far burton had wrestled rather unsuccessfully with the crystallized eggs and evaporated potatoes which made up a part of our outfit i dont seem to get just the right twist on em he said  youll have plenty of chance to experiment i remarked however the bacon was good and so was the graham bread which he turned out piping hot from the little oven of our folding stove  leaving clinton we entered upon a lonely region a waste of wooded ridges breaking illimitably upon the sky the air sharpened as we rose till it seemed like march instead of april and our overcoats were grateful  somewhere near the middle of the forenoon as we were jogging along i saw a deer standing just at the edge of the road and looking across it as if in fear of its blazing publicity it seemed for a moment as if he were an optical illusion so beautiful so shapely and so palpitant was he i had no desire to shoot him but turning to burton called in a low voice see that deer  he replied where is your gun  now under my knee i carried a new rifle with a quantity of smokeless cartridges steeljacketed and softnosed and yet i was disposed to argue the matter see here burton it will be bloody business if we kill that deer we couldnt eat all of it you wouldnt want to skin it i couldnt youd get your hands all bloody and the memory of that beautiful creature would not be pleasant therefore i stand for letting him go  burton looked thoughtful well we might sell it or give it away  meanwhile the deer saw us but seemed not to be apprehensive perhaps it was a thoughtreading deer and knew that we meant it no harm as burton spoke it turned silent as a shadow and running to the crest of the hill stood for a moment outlined like a figure of bronze against the sky then disappeared into the forest he was so much a part of nature that the horses gave no sign of having seen him at all  at a point a few miles beyond clinton most of the pack trains turned sharply to the left to the fraser river where the grass was reported to be much better we determined to continue on the stage road however and thereafter met but few outfits the road was by no means empty however we met from time to time great blue or red wagons drawn by four or six horses moving with pleasant jangle of bells and the crack of great whips the drivers looked down at us curiously and somewhat haughtily from their high seats as if to say we know where we are goingdo you know as much  the landscape grew ever wilder and the foliage each day springlike we were on a high hilly plateau between hat creek and the valley of lake la hache we passed lakes surrounded by ghostly dead trees which looked as though the water had poisoned them there were no ranches of any extent on these hills the trail continued to be filled with tramping miners several seemed to be without bedding or food some drove little pack animals laden with blankets and all walked like fiends pressing forward doggedly hour after hour many of them were italians and one group which we overtook went along killing robins for food they were a merry and dramatic lot making the silent forests echo with their chatter  i headed my train on ladrone who led the way with a fine stately tread his deep brown eyes alight with intelligence his sensitive ears attentive to every word he had impressed me already by his learning and gentleness but when one of my packhorses ran around him entangling me in the lead rope pulling me to the ground the final test of his quality came i expected to be kicked into shreds but ladrone stopped instantly and looking down at me inquiringly waited for me to scramble out from beneath his feet and drag the saddle up to its place  with heart filled with gratitude i patted him on the nose and said old boy if you carry me through to teslin lake i will take care of you for the rest of your days  at about noon the next day we came down off the high plateau with its cold and snow and camped in a sunny sward near a splendid ranch where lambs were at play on the green grass blackbirds were calling and we heard our first crane bugling high in the sky from the loneliness and desolation of the high country with its sparse road houses we were now surrounded by sunny fields mellow with thirty seasons ploughing  the ride was very beautiful just the sort of thing we had been hoping for all day we skirted fine lakes with grassy shores cranes ducks and geese filled every pond the voice of spring in their brazen throats  once a large flight of crane went sweeping by high in the sky a royal swift scythe reaping the clouds i called to them in their own tongue and they answered i called again and again and they began to waver and talk among themselves and at last having decided that this voice from below should be heeded they broke rank and commenced sweeping round and round in great circles seeking the lost one whose cry rose from afar baffled and angered they rearranged themselves at last in long regular lines and swept on into the north  we camped on this the sixth day beside a fine stream which came from a lake and here we encountered our first mosquitoes big black fellows they were with a lazy droning sound quite different from any i had ever heard however they froze up early and did not bother us very much  at the one hundred and fiftynine mile house which was a stage tavern we began to hear other bogie stories of the trail we were assured that horses were often poisoned by eating a certain plant and that the mud and streams were terrible flies were a never ending torment all these i regarded as the croakings of men who had never had courage to go over the trail and who exaggerated the accounts they had heard from others  we were jogging along now some fifteen or twenty miles a day thoroughly enjoying the trip the sky was radiant the aspens were putting forth transparent yellow leaves on the grassy slopes some splendid yellow flowers quite new to me waved in the warm but strong breeze on the ninth day we reached soda creek which is situated on the fraser river at a point where the muddy stream is deep sunk in the wooded hills  the town was a single row of ramshackle buildings not unlike a small missouri river town the citizens so far as visible formed a queer collection of old men addicted to rum they all came out to admire ladrone and to criticise my packsaddle and as they stood about spitting and giving wise instances they reminded me of the jurors in mark twains puddin head wilson  one old man tottered up to my side to inquire cap where you going  to teslin lake i replied  good lord think of it said he do you ever expect to get there it is a terrible trip my son a terrible trip  at this point a large number of the outfits crossed to the opposite side of the river and took the trail which kept up the west bank of the river we however kept the stage road which ran on the high ground of the eastern bank forming a most beautiful drive the river was in full view all the time with endless vista of blue hills above and the shimmering water with radiant foliage below  aside from the stage road and some few ranches on the river bottom we were now in the wilderness on our right rolled a wide wild sea of hills and forests breaking at last on the great gold range to the west a still wilder country reaching to the impassable east range on this our eighth day out we had our second sight of big game in the night i was awakened by burton calling in excited whisper theres a bear outside  it was cold i was sleepy my bed was very comfortable and i did not wish to be disturbed i merely growled let him alone  but burton putting his head out of the door of the tent grew still more interested there is a bear out there eating those mutton bones wheres the gun  i was nearly sinking off to sleep once more and i muttered dont bother me the gun is in the corner of the tent burton began snapping the lever of the gun impatiently and whispering something about not being able to put the cartridge in he was accustomed to the oldfashioned winchester but had not tried these  put it right in the top i wearily said put it right in the top  i have he replied but i cant get it in or out  meanwhile i had become sufficiently awake to take a mild interest in the matter i rose and looked out as i saw a long black lean creature muzzling at something on the ground i began to get excited myself  i guess we better let him go hadnt we said burton  well yes as the cartridge is stuck in the gun and so long as he lets us alone i think we had better let him alone especially as his hide is worth nothing at this season of the year and he is too thin to make steak  the situation was getting comic but probably it is well that the cartridge failed to go in burton stuck his head out of the tent gave a sharp yell and the huge creature vanished in the dark of the forest the whole adventure came about naturally the smell of our frying meat had gone far up over the hills to our right and off into the great wilderness alluring this lean hungry beast out of his den doubtless if burton had been able to fire a shot into his woolly hide we should have had a rare mix up of bear tent men mattresses and blankets  mosquitoes increased and strange to say they seemed to like the shade they were all of the big black lazy variety we came upon flights of hummingbirds i was rather tired of the saddle and of the slow jog jog jog but at last there came an hour which made the trouble worth while when our camp was set our fire lighted our supper eaten and we could stretch out and watch the sun go down over the hills beyond the river then the day seemed well spent at such an hour we grew reminiscent of old days and out of our talk an occasional verse naturally rose      momentous hour       a coyote wailing in the yellow dawn     a mountain land that stretches on and on     and ceases not till in the skies     vast peaks of rosy snow arise     like walls of plainsmans paradise      i cannot tell why this is so     i cannot say i do not know     why wind and wolf and yellow sky     and grassy mesa square and high     possess such power to satisfy      but so it is deep in the grass     i lie and hear the winds feet pass     and all forgot is maid and man     and hope and set ambitious plan     are lost as though they neer began     a wish       all day and many days i rode     my horses head set toward the sea     and as i rode a longing came to me     that i might keep the sunset road     riding my horse right on and on     oertake the day still lagging at the west     and so reach boyhood from the dawn     and be with all the days at rest      for then the odor of the growing wheat     the flare of sumach on the hills     the touch of grasses to my feet     would cure my brain of all its ills     would fill my heart so full of joy     that no stern lines could fret my face     there would i be forever boy     lit by the skys unfailing grace     chapter iv  in camp at quesnelle   we came into quesnelle about three oclock of the eleventh day out from a high point which overlooked the two rivers we could see great ridges rolling in waves of deep blue against the sky to the northwest over these our slender little trail ran the wind was in the south roaring up the river and green grass was springing on the slopes  quesnelle we found to be a little town on a high smooth slope above the fraser we overtook many prospectors like ourselves camped on the river bank waiting to cross  here also telegraph bulletins concerning the spanish war dated london hong kong and madrid hung on the walls of the postoffice they were very brief and left plenty of room for imagination and discussion  here i took a pony and a dogcart and jogged away toward the longfamous caribou mining district next day for the purpose of inspecting a mine belonging to some friends of mine the ride was very desolate and lonely a steady climb all the way through firedevastated forests toward the great peaks snow lay in the roadside ditches butterflies were fluttering about and in the high hills i saw many toads crawling over the snowbanks a singular sight to me they were silent perhaps from cold  strange to say this ride called up in my mind visions of the hot sands and the sunlit buttes and valleys of arizona and montana and i wrote several verses as i jogged along in the ponycart  when i returned to camp two days later i found burton ready and eager to move the town swarmed with goldseekers pausing here to rest and fill their parflêches on the opposite side of the river others could be seen in camp or already moving out over the trail which left the river and climbed at once into the high ridges dark with pines in the west  as i sat with my partner at night talking of the start the next day i began to feel not a fear but a certain respect for that narrow little path which was not an arms span in width but which was nearly eight hundred miles in length from this point burton it is business our practice march is finished  the stories of flies and mosquitoes gave me more trouble than anything else but a surveyor who had had much experience in this northwestern country recommended the use of oil of pennyroyal mixed with lard or vaseline it will keep the mosquitoes and most of the flies away he said i know for i have tried it you cant wear a net at least i never could it is too warm and then it is always in your way you are in no danger from beasts but you will curse the day you set out on this trail on account of the insects it is the worst mosquito country in the world     the gift of water           is water nigh         the plainsmen cry     as they meet and pass in the desert grass         with finger tip         across the lip     i ask the sombre navajo     the brown man smiles and answers sho1     with fingers high he signs the miles         to the desert spring     and so we pass in the dry dead grass         brothers in bond of the waters ring   footnote 1 listen your attention     mounting       i mount and mount toward the sky     the eagles heart is mine     i ride to put the clouds aby     where silver lakelets shine     the roaring streams wax white with snow     the eagles nest draws near     the blue sky widens hid peaks glow     the air is frosty clear     and so from cliff to cliff i rise     the eagles heart is mine     above me ever broadning skies     below the rivers shine     the eagle trail       from rockbuilt nest     the mother eagle with a threatning tongue     utters a warning scream her shrill voice rings     wild as the snowtopped crags she sits among     while hovering with her quivering wings     her hungry brood with eyes ablaze     she watches every shadow the water calls     far far below the suns red rays     ascend the icy iron walls     and leap beyond the mountains in the west     and over the trail and the eagles nest     the clear night falls     chapter v  the psychology of the blue rat  camp twelve   next morning as we took the boatwhich was filled with horses wild and restlessi had a moment of exultation to think we had left the way of tin cans and whiskey bottles and were now about to enter upon the actual trail the horses gave us a great deal of trouble on the boat but we managed to get across safely without damage to any part of our outfit  here began our acquaintance with the blue rat it had become evident to me during our stay in quesnelle that we needed one more horse to make sure of having provisions sufficient to carry us over the three hundred and sixty miles which lay between the fraser and our next eatingplace on the skeena horses however were very scarce and it was not until late in the day that we heard of a man who had a pony to sell the name of this man was dippy  he was a german and had a harelip and a most seductive gentleness of voice i gladly make him historical he sold me the blue rat and gave me a chance to study a new type of horse  herr dippy was not a washington irving sort of dutchman he conformed rather to the modern new york tradesman he was small candid and smooth very smooth of speech he said yes the pony is gentle he can be rode or packed but you better lead him for a day or two till he gets quiet  i had not seen the pony but my partner had crossed to the west side of the fraser river and had reported him to be a nice little pony round and fat and gentle on that i had rested mr dippy joined us at the ferry and waited around to finish the trade i presumed he intended to cross and deliver the pony which was in a corral on the west side but he lisped out a hurried excuse the ferry is not coming back for today and so  well i paid him the money on the strength of my side partners report besides it was hobsons choice  mr dippy took the twentyfive dollars eagerly and vanished into obscurity we passed to the wild side of the fraser and entered upon a long and intimate study of the blue rat he shucked out of the log stable a smooth round lithebodied little cayuse of a bluegray color he looked like a childs toy but seemed sturdy and of good condition his foretop was banged and he had the air of a mischievous resolute boy his eyes were big and black and he studied us with tranquil but inquiring gaze as we put the packsaddle on him he was very small  hes not large but hes a gentle little chap said i to ease my partner of his dismay over the ponys surprising smallness  i believe he shrunk during the night replied my partner he seemed two sizes bigger yesterday  we packed him with one hundred pounds of our food and lashed it all on with rope while the pony dozed peacefully once or twice i thought i saw his ears cross one laid back the other set forwardbad signsbut it was done so quickly i could not be sure of it  we packed the other horses while the blue pony stood resting one hind leg his eyes dreaming  i flung the canvas cover over the bay packhorse something took place i heard a bang a clatter a rattling of hoofs i peered around the bay and saw the blue pony performing some of the most finished vigorous and varied bucking it has ever been given me to witness he all but threw somersaults he stood on his upper lip he humped up his back till he looked like a lean cat on a graveyard fence he stood on his toe calks and spun like a weathervane on a livery stable and when the pack exploded and the saddle slipped under his belly he kicked it to pieces by using both hind hoofs as featly as a man would stroke his beard  after calming the other horses i faced my partner solemnly  oh by the way partner where did you get that nice quiet little blue pony of yours  partner smiled sheepishly the little divil buffalo bill ought to have that pony  well now said i restraining my laughter the thing to do is to put that pack on so that it will stay that pony will try the same thing again sure  we packed him again with great care his big innocent black eyes shining under his bang were a little more alert but they showed neither fear nor rage we roped him in every conceivable way and at last stood clear and dared him to do his prettiest  he did it all that had gone before was merely preparatory a bloodwarming so to say the real thing now took place he stood up on his hind legs and shot into the air alighting on his four feet as if to pierce the earth he whirled like a howling dervish grunting snortingunseeing and almost unseen in a nimbus of dust strap ends and flying pine needles his whirling undid him we seized the rope and just as the pack again slid under his feet we set shoulder to the rope and threw him he came to earth with a thud his legs whirling uselessly in the air he resembled a beetle in molasses we sat upon his head and discussed him  he is a wonder said my partner  we packed him again with infinite pains and when he began bucking we threw him again and tried to kill him we were getting irritated we threw him hard and drew his hind legs up to his head till he grunted when he was permitted to rise he looked meek and small and tired and we were both deeply remorseful we rearranged the packit was some encouragement to know he had not bucked it entirely offand by blindfolding him we got him started on the trail behind the train  i suppose that simplehearted dutchman is gloating over us from across the river said i to partner but no matter we are victorious  i was now quite absorbed in a study of the blue ponys psychology he was a new type of mean pony his eye did not roll nor his ears fall back he seemed neither scared nor angry he still looked like a roguish determined boy he was alert watchful but not vicious he went offprecisely like one of those mechanical mice or turtles which sidewalk venders operate once started he could not stop till he ran down he seemed not to take our stern measures in bad part he regarded it as a fair contract apparently and considered that we had won true he had lost both hair and skin by getting tangled in the rope but he laid up nothing against us and as he followed meekly along behind partner dared to say  hes all right now i presume he has been running out all winter and is a little wild hes satisfied now well have no more trouble with him  every time i looked back at the poor humbled little chap my heart tingled with pity and remorse we were too rough i said we must be more gentle  yes hes nervous and scary we must be careful not to give him a sudden start ill lead him for a while  an hour later as we were going down a steep and slippery hill the rat saw his chance he passed into another spasm opening and shutting like a selfacting jackknife he bounded into the midst of the peaceful horses scattering them to right and to left in terror  he turned and came up the hill to get another start partner took a turn on a stump and all unmindful of it the rat whirled and made a mighty spring he reached the end of the rope and his handspring became a vaulting somersault he lay unable to rise spatting the wind breathing heavily such annoying energy i have never seen we were now mad muddy and very resolute we held him down till he lay quite still any wellconsidered properly bred animal would have been ground to bone dust by such wondrous acrobatic movements he was skinned in one or two places the hair was scraped from his nose his tongue bled but all these were mere scratches when we repacked him he walked off comparatively unhurt     noon on the plain       the horned toad creeping along the sand     the rattlesnake asleep beneath the sage     have now a subtle fatal charm     in their sultry calm their love of heat     i read once more the burning page     of nature under cloudless skies     o pitiless and splendid land     mine eyelids close my lips are dry     by force of thy hot floods of light     soundless as oil the wind flows by     mine aching brain cries out for night      chapter vi  the beginning of the long trail   as we left the bank of the fraser river we put all wheel tracks behind the trail turned to the west and began to climb following an old swath which had been cut into the black pines by an adventurous telegraph company in 1865 immense sums of money were put into this venture by men who believed the ocean cable could not be laid the work was stopped midway by the success of fields wonderful plan and all along the roadway the rusted and twisted wire lay in testimony of the seriousness of the original design  the trail was a white mans road it lacked grace and charm it cut uselessly over hills and plunged senselessly into ravines it was an irritation to all of us who knew the easy swing the circumspection and the laborsaving devices of an indian trail the telegraph line was laid by compass not by the stars and the peaks it evaded nothing it saved distance not labor  my feeling of respect deepened into awe as we began to climb the great wooded divide which lies between the fraser and the blackwater the wild forest settled around us grim stern and forbidding we were done with civilization everything that was required for a home in the cold and in the heat was bound upon our five horses we must carry bed board roof food and medical stores over three hundred and sixty miles of trail through all that might intervene of flood and forest  this feeling of awe was emphasized by the coming on of the storm in which we camped that night we were forced to keep going until late in order to obtain feed and to hustle in order to get everything under cover before the rain began to fall we were only twelve miles on our way but being wet and cold and hungry we enjoyed the full sense of being in the wilderness however the robins sang from the damp woods and the loons laughed from hidden lakes  it rained all night and in the morning we were forced to get out in a cold wet dawn it was a grim start dismal and portentous bringing the realities of the trail very close to us while i rustled the horses out of the wet bush partner stirred up a capital breakfast of bacon evaporated potatoes crystallized eggs and graham bread he had discovered at last the exact amount of water to use in cooking these vegetables and they were very good the potatoes tasted not unlike mashed potatoes and together with the eggs made a very savory and wholesome dish with a cup of strong coffee and some hot graham gems we got off in very good spirits indeed  it continued muddy wet and cold i walked most of the day leading my horse upon whom i had packed a part of the outfit to relieve the other horses there was no fun in the day only worry and trouble my feet were wet my joints stiff and my brain weary of the monotonous black pine forest  there is a great deal of work on the trailcooking care of the horses together with almost ceaseless packing and unpacking and the bother of keeping the packhorses out of the mud we were busy from five oclock in the morning until nine at night there were other outfits on the trail having a full ton of supplies and this great weight had to be handled four times a day in our case the toil was much less but it was only by snatching time from my partner that i was able to work on my notes and keep my diary had the land been less empty of game and richer in color i should not have minded the toil and care taking as it was we were all looking forward to the beautiful lake country which we were told lay just beyond the blackwater  one tremendous fact soon impressed me there were no returning footsteps on this trail all toes pointed in one way toward the golden north no man knew more than his neighbor the character of the land which lay before us  the life of each outfit was practically the same at about 430 in the morning the campers awoke the clickclack of axes began and slender columns of pale blue smoke stole softly into the air then followed the noisy rustling of the horses by those set aside for that duty by the time the horses were cussed into camp the coffee was hot and the bacon and beans ready to be eaten a race in packing took place to see who should pull out first at about seven oclock in the morning the outfits began to move but here there was a difference of method most of them travelled for six or seven hours without unpacking whereas our plan was to travel for four hours rest from twelve to three and pack up and travel four hours more this difference in method resulted in our passing outfit after outfit who were unable to make the same distances by their one march  we went to bed with the robins and found it no hardship to rise with the sparrows as burton got the fire going i dressed and went out to see if all the horses were in the bunch and edged them along toward the camp i then packed up the goods struck the tent and folded it and had everything ready to sling on the horses by the time breakfast was ready  with my rifle under my knee my rain coat rolled behind my saddle my camera dangling handily my rope coiled and lashed i called out are we all set  oh i guess so burton invariably replied  with a last look at the camping ground to see that nothing of value was left we called in exactly the same way each time hike boys hike hike hyak chinook for hurry up it was a fine thing and it never failed to touch me to see them fall in one by one the eweneck just behind ladrone after him old bill and behind him groaning and taking on as if in great pain major grunt while at the rear with sharp outcry came burton riding the blue pony who was quite content as we soon learned to carry a man weighing seventy pounds more than his pack he considered himself a saddle horse not a pack animal  it was not an easy thing to keep a pack train like this running as the horses became tired of the saddle two of them were disposed to run off into the brush in an attempt to scrape their load from their backs others fell to feeding sometimes bill would attempt to pass the bay in order to walk next ladrone then they would scrouge against each other like a couple of country schoolboys to see who should get ahead it was necessary to watch the packs with worrysome care to see that nothing came loose to keep the cinches tight and to be sure that none of the horses were being galled by their burdens  we travelled for the most part alone and generally in complete silence for i was too far in advance to have any conversation with my partner  the trail continued wet muddy and full of slippery inclines but we camped on a beautiful spot on the edge of a marshy lake two or three miles in length as we threw up our tent and started our fire i heard two cranes bugling magnificently from across the marsh and with my fieldglass i could see them striding along in the edge of the water the sun was getting well toward the west all around stood the dark and mysterious forest out of which strange noises broke  in answer to the bugling of the cranes loons were wildly calling a flock of geese hidden somewhere under the level blaze of the orangecolored light of the setting sun were holding clamorous convention this is one of the compensating moments of the trail to come out of a gloomy and forbidding wood into an open and grassy bank to see the sun setting across the marsh behind the most splendid blue mountains makes up for many weary hours of toil  as i lay down to sleep i heard a coyote cry and the loons answered and out of the cold clear night the splendid voices of the cranes rang triumphantly the heavens were made as brass by their superb defiant notes     the whooping crane       at sunset from the shadowed sedge       of lonely lake among the reeds     he lifts his brazenthroated call       and the listening cat with teeth at edge     with famine hears and heeds      come one come all come all come all     is the birds challenge bravely blown     to every beast the woodlands own      my legs are long my wings are strong       i wait the answer to my threat     echoing fearless triumphant the cry       disperses through the world and yet     only the clamorous cloudless sky       and the wooded mountains make reply     the loon             at some far time           this water sprite     a brother of the coyote must have been           for when the sun is set           forth from the failing light           his harsh cries fret           the silence of the night     and the hid wolf answers with a wailing keen      chapter vii  the blackwater divide   about noon the next day we suddenly descended to the blackwater a swift stream which had been newly bridged by those ahead of us in this wild land streams were our only objective points the mountains had no names and the monotony of the forest produced a singular effect on our minds our journey at times seemed a sort of motionless progression once our tent was set and our baggage arranged about us we lost all sense of having moved at all  immediately after leaving the blackwater bridge we had a grateful touch of an indian trail the telegraph route kept to the valley flat but an old trail turned to the right and climbed the north bank by an easy and graceful grade which it was a joy to follow the top of the bench was wooded and grassy and the smooth brown trail wound away sinuous as a serpent under the splendid pine trees for more than three hours we strolled along this bank as distinguished as those who occupy boxes at the theatre below us the blackwater looped away under a sunny sky and far beyond enormous and unnamed deep blue mountains rose notching the western sky the scene was so exceedingly rich and amiable we could hardly believe it to be without farms and villages yet only an indian hut or two gave indication of human life  after following this bank for a few miles we turned to the right and began to climb the high divide which lies between the blackwater and the muddy both of which are upper waters of the fraser like all the high country through which we had passed this ridge was covered with a monotonous forest of small black pines with very little bird or animal life of any kind by contrast the valley of the blackwater shone in our memory like a jewel  after a hard drive we camped beside a small creek together with several other outfits one of them belonged to a doctor from the chilcoten country he was one of those englishmen who are natural plainsmen he was always calm cheerful and selfcontained he took all worry and danger as a matter of course and did not attempt to carry the customs of a london hotel into the camp when an englishman has this temper he makes one of the best campaigners in the world  as i came to meet the other men on the trail i found that some peculiar circumstance had led to their choice of route the doctor had a ranch in the valley of the fraser one of the manchester boys had a cousin near soda creek siwash charley wished to prospect on the headwaters of the skeena and so in almost every case some special excuse was given when the truth was known the love of adventure had led all of us to take the telegraph route most of the miners argued that they could make their entrance by horse as cheaply if not as quickly as by boat for the most part they were young hardy and temperate young men of the middle condition of american life  one of the manchester men had been a farmer in connecticut an attendant in an insane asylum in massachusetts and an engineer he was fat when he started and weighed two hundred and twenty pounds by the time we had overtaken him his trousers had begun to flap around him he was known as big bill his companion frank was a sinewy little fellow with no extra flesh at allan alert cheery and vociferous boy who made noise enough to scare all the game out of the valley neither of these men had ever saddled a horse before reaching the chilcoten but they developed at once into skilful packers and rugged trailers though they still exposed themselves unnecessarily in order to show that they were not tenderfeet  siwash charley was a montana miner who spoke chinook fluently and swore in splendid rhythms on occasion he was small alert seasoned to the trail and capable of any hardship the man from chihuahua was so called because he had been prospecting in mexico he had the best packhorses on the trail and cared for them like a mother he was small weazened hardy as oak inured to every hardship and very wise in all things he had led his fine little train of horses from chihuahua to seattle thence to the thompson river joining us at quesnelle he was the typical trailer he spoke in the missouri fashion though he was a born californian his partner was a quiet little man from snohomish flats in washington these outfits were typical of scores of others and it will be seen that they were for the most part americans the group of germans from new york city and the english doctor being the exceptions  there was little talk among us we were not merely going a journey but going as rapidly as was prudent and there was close attention to business there was something morbidly persistent in the action of these trains they pushed on resolutely grimly like blind worms following some directing force from within this peculiarity of action became more noticeable day by day we were not on the trail after all to hunt or fish or skylark we had set our eyes on a distant place and toward it our feet moved even in sleep  the muddy river which we reached late in the afternoon was silent as oil and very deep while the banks muddy and abrupt made it a hard stream to cross  as we stood considering the problem a couple of indians appeared on the opposite bank with a small raft and we struck a bargain with them to ferry our outfit they set us across in short order but our horses were forced to swim they were very much alarmed and shivered with excitement this being the first stream that called for swimming but they crossed in fine style ladrone leading his neck curving his nostrils wideblown we were forced to camp in the mud of the river bank and the gray clouds flying overhead made the land exceedingly dismal the night closed in wet and cheerless  the two indians stopped to supper with us and ate heartily i seized the opportunity to talk with them and secured from them the tragic story of the death of the blackwater indians siwash he die hyu great many hyu die chilens klootchmans women all die white man no help no send doctor siwash all die white man no care belly much  in this simple account of the wiping out of a village of harmless people by the white mans disease smallpox unaided by the white mans wonderful skill there lies one of the great tragedies of savage life very few were left on the blackwater or on the muddy though a considerable village had once made the valley cheerful with its primitive pursuits  they were profoundly impressed by our tent and gun and sat on their haunches clicking their tongues again and again in admiration saying of the tent all the same lilly little house i tried to tell them of the great world to the south and asked them a great many questions to discover how much they knew of the people or the mountains they knew nothing of the plains indians but one of them had heard of vancouver and seattle they had not the dignity and thinking power of the plains people but they seemed amiable and rather jovial  we passed next day two adventurers tramping their way to hazleton each man carried a roll of cheap quilts a skillet and a cup we came upon them as they were taking off their shoes and stockings to wade through a swift little river and i realized with a sudden pang of sympathetic pain how distressing these streams must be to such as go afoot whereas i on my fine horse had considered them entirely from an æsthetic point of view  we had been on the road from quesnelle a week and had made nearly one hundred miles jogging along some fifteen miles each day camping eating sleeping with nothing to excite usindeed the trail was quiet as a country lane a dead horse here and there warned us to be careful how we pushed our own burdenbearers we were deep in the forest with the pale blue sky filled with clouds showing only in patches overhead we passed successively from one swamp of black pine to another over ridges covered with white pine all precisely alike as soon as our camp was set and fires lighted we lost all sense of having travelled so similar were the surroundings of each camp  partridges could be heard drumming in the lowlands mosquitoes were developing by the millions and cooking had become almost impossible without protection the varments came in relays a small gray variety took hold of us while it was warm and when it became too cold for them the big black sticky fellows appeared mysteriously and hung around in the air uttering deep bass notes like lazy flies the little gray fellows were singularly ferocious and insistent in their attentions  at last as we were winding down the trail beneath the pines we came suddenly upon an indian with a gun in the hollow of his arm so still so shadowy so neutral in color was he that at first sight he seemed a part of the forest like the shaded hole of a tree he turned out to be a runner so to speak for the ferrymen at tchincut crossing and led us down to the outlet of the lake where a group of natives with their slim canoes sat waiting to set us over an hours brisk work and we rose to the fine grassy eastern slope overlooking the lake  we rose on our stirrups with shouts of joy we had reached the land of our dreams here was the trailers heaven wooded promontories around which the wavelets sparkled pushed out into the deep clear flood great mountains rose in the background lonely untouched by mans alldesolating hand while all about us lay suave slopes clothed with most beautiful peavine just beginning to ripple in the wind and beyond lay level meadows lit by little ponds filled with wildfowl there was just forest enough to lend mystery to these meadows and to shut from our eager gaze the beauties of other and still more entrancing glades the most exacting hunter or trailer could not desire more perfect conditions for camping it was gods own country after the gloomy monotony of the barren pine forest and needed only a passing deer or a band of elk to be a poem as well as a picture  all day we skirted this glorious lake and at night we camped on its shores the horses were as happy as their masters feeding in plenty on sweet herbage for the first time in long days  late in the day we passed the largest indian village we had yet seen it was situated on stony creek which came from tatchick lake and emptied into tchincut lake the shallows flickered with the passing of trout and the natives were busy catching and drying them as we rode amid the curing sheds the children raised a loud clamor and the women laughed and called from house to house oh see the white men we were a circus parade to them  their opportunities for earning money are scant and they live upon a very monotonous diet of fish and possibly dried venison and berries except at favorable points like stony creek where a small stream leads from one lake to another there are no villages because there are no fish  i shall not soon forget the shining vistas through which we rode that day nor the meadows which possessed all the allurement and mystery which the word savanna has always had with me it was like going back to the prairies of indiana illinois and iowa as they were sixty years ago except in this case the elk and the deer were absent     yet still we rode       we wallowed deep in mud and sand       we swam swift streams that roared in wrath     they stood at guard in that lone land       like dragons in the slender path      yet still we rode right on and on       and shook our clenched hands at the sky     we dared the frost at early dawn       and the dread tempest sweeping by      it was not all so dark now and again       the robin singing loud and long     made wildness tame and lit the rain       with sudden sunshine with his song      wild roses filled the air with grace       the shootingstar swung like a bell     from bended stem and all the place       was like to heaven after hell      chapter viii  we swim the nechaco   here was perfection of camping but no allurement could turn the goldseekers aside some of them remained for a day a few for two days but not one forgot for a moment that he was on his way to the klondike river sixteen hundred miles away in my enthusiasm i proposed to camp for a week but my partner who was out for gold instid o daisies guessed wed better be moving he could not bear to see any one pass us and that was the feeling of every man on the trail each seemed to fear that the gold might all be claimed before he arrived with a sigh i turned my back on this glorious region and took up the forward march  all the next day we skirted the shores of tatchick lake coming late in the afternoon to the nechaco river a deep rapid stream which rose far to our left in the snowy peaks of the coast range all day the sky to the east had a brazen glow as if a great fire were raging there but toward night the wind changed and swept it away the trail was dusty for the first time and the flies venomous late in the afternoon we pitched camp setting our tent securely expecting rain before we went to sleep the drops began to drum on the tent roof a pleasant sound after the burning dust of the trail the two trampers kept abreast of us nearly all day but they began to show fatigue and hunger and a look of almost sullen desperation had settled on their faces  as we came down next day to where the swift nechaco met the endako rushing out of fraser lake we found the most dangerous flood we had yet crossed a couple of white men were calking a large ferryboat but as it was not yet seaworthy and as they had no cable the horses must swim i dreaded to see them enter this chill gray stream for not only was it wide and swift but the two currents coming together made the landing confusing to the horses as well as to ourselves rain was at hand and we had no time to waste  the horses knew that some hard swimming was expected of them and would gladly have turned back if they could we surrounded them with furious outcry and at last ladrone sprang in and struck for the nearest point opposite with that intelligence which marks the bronco horse the others followed readily two of the poorer ones labored heavily but all touched shore in good order  the rain began to fall sharply and we were forced to camp on the opposite bank as swiftly as possible in order to get out of the storm we worked hard and long to put everything under cover and were muddy and tired at the end of it at last the tent was up the outfit covered with waterproof canvas the fire blazing and our bread baking in pitching our camp we had plenty of assistance at the hands of several indian boys from a nearby village who hung about eager to lend a hand in the hope of getting a cup of coffee and a piece of bread in payment the streaming rain seemed to have no more effect upon them than on a loon the conditions were all strangely similar to those at the muddy river  night closed in swiftly through the dark we could hear the low swish of the rising river and burton with a sly twinkle in his eye remarked for a semiarid country this is a pretty wet rain  in planning the trip i had written to him saying the trail runs for the most part though a semiarid country somewhat like eastern washington  it rained all the next day and we were forced to remain in camp which was dismal business but we made the best of it doing some mending of clothes and tackle during the long hours  we were visited by all the indians from old fort fraser which was only a mile away they sat about our blazing fire laughing and chattering like a group of girls discussing our characters minutely and trying to get at our reasons for going on such a journey  one of them who spoke a little english said after looking over my traps you boss you tyee you belly rich man why you come  this being interpreted meant you have a great many splendid things you are rich now why do you come away out here in this poor siwash country  i tried to convey to him that i wished to see the mountains and to get acquainted with the people he then asked more white men come  throwing my hands in the air and spreading my fingers many times i exclaimed hyu white man hyu whereat they all clicked their tongues and looked at each other in astonishment they could not understand why this sudden flood of white people should pour into their country this i also explained in lame chinook we go klap pilchickamin gold white man hears say hyu pilchickamin there i pointed to the north white man heap like pilchickamin so he comes  all the afternoon and early evening little boys came and went on the swift river in their canoes singing wild hauntingly musical boating songs they had no horses but assembled in their canoes racing and betting precisely as the cheyenne lads run horses at sunset in the valley of the lamedeer all about the village the grass was rich and sweet uncropped by any animal for these poor fishermen do not aspire to the wonderful wealth of owning a horse they had heard that cattle were coming over the trail and all inquired spose when moosmoos come they knew that milk and butter were good things and some of them had hopes of owning a cow sometime  they had tiny little gardens in sheltered places on the sunny slopes wherein a few potatoes were planted for the rest they hunt and fish and trap in winter and trade skins for meat and flour and coffee and so live how they endure the winters in such wretched houses it is impossible to say there was a lone white man living on the site of the old fort as agent of the hudson bay company he kept a small stock of clothing and groceries and traded for skins as the indians all call pelts they count in skins so many skins will buy a rifle so many more will secure a sack of flour  the storekeeper told me that the two trampers had arrived there a few days before without money and without food i gave em some flour and sent em on he said the siwashes will take care of them but it aint right what the cussed idiots mean by setting out on such a journey i cant understand why one tramp came in here early in the spring who couldnt speak english and who left quesnelle without even a blanket or an axe fact and yet the lord seems to take care of these fools you wouldnt believe it but that fellow picked up an axe and a blanket the first day out but hed a died only for the indians they wont let even a white man starve to death i helped him out with some flour and he went on they all rush on seems like they was just crazy to get to dawsoncouldnt sleep without dreamin of it  i was almost as eager to get on as the tramps but burton went about his work regularly as a clock i wrote yawned stirred the big campfire gazed at the clouds talked with the indians and so passed the day i began to be disturbed for i knew the power of a rain on the trail it transforms it makes it ferocious the path that has charmed and wooed becomes uncertain treacherous gloomy and engulfing creeks become rivers rivers impassable torrents and marshes bottomless abysses pits of quicksand develop in most unexpected places driven from smooth lake margins the trailers ponies are forced to climb ledges of rock and to rattle over long slides of shale in places the threadlike way itself becomes an aqueduct for a rushing overflow of water  at such times the man on the trail feels the grim power of nature she has no pity no consideration she sets mud torrents rocks cold mist to check and chill him to devour him over him he has no roof under him no pavement never for an instant is he free from the pressure of the elements sullen streams lie athwart his road like dragons and in a land like this where snowy peaks rise on all sides rain meant sudden and enormous floods of icy water  it was still drizzling on the third day but we packed and pushed on though the hills were slippery and the creeks swollen water was everywhere but the sun came out lighting the woods into radiant greens and purples robins and sparrows sang ecstatically and violets dandelions and various kinds of berries were in odorous bloom a vine with a blue flower new to me attracted my attention also a yellow blossom of the cowslip variety this latter had a form not unlike a wild sunflower  here for the first time i heard a bird singing a song quite new to me he was a thrushlike little fellow very shy and difficult to see as he sat poised on the tip of a black pine in the deep forest his note was a clear clingling like the ringing of a steel triangle chingaling chingaling one called near at hand and then farther off another answered ching ching chingalingaling with immense vim power and vociferation  burton who had spent many years in the mighty forests of washington said that little chap is familiar to me away in the pines where there is no other bird i used to hear his voice no matter how dark it was i could always tell when morning was coming by his note and on cloudy days i could always tell when the sunset was coming by hearing him call  to me his phrase was not unlike the metallic ringing cry of a sort of blackbird which i heard in the torrid plazas of mexico he was very difficult to distinguish for the reason that he sat so high in the tree and was so wary he was very shy of approach he was a plump trim little fellow of a plain brown color not unlike a small robin  there was another cheerful little bird new to me also which uttered an amusing phrase in two keys something like tee tay tee tay tee tay one note sustained high and long followed by another given on a lower key it was not unlike to the sound made by a boy with a tuning pipe this burton said was also a familiar sound in the depths of the great washington firs these two cheery birds kept us company in the gloomy blackpine forest when we sorely needed solace of some kind  fraser lake was also very charming romantic enough to be the scene of coopers best novels the water was deliciously clear and cool and from the farther shore great mountains rose in successive sweeps of dark green foothills at this time we felt well satisfied with ourselves and the trip with a gleam in his eyes burton said this is the kind of thing our folks think were doing all the time     relentless nature       she laid her rivers to snare us     she set her snows to chill     her clouds had the cunning of vultures     her plants were charged to kill     the glooms of her forests benumbed us     on the slime of her ledges we sprawled     but we set our feet to the northward     and crawled and crawled and crawled     we defied her and cursed her and shouted     to hell with your rain and your snow     our minds we have set on a journey     and despite of your anger we go      chapter ix  the first crossing of the bulkley   we were now following a chain of lakes to the source of the endako one of the chief northwest sources of the fraser and were surrounded by tumultuous ridges covered with a seamless robe of pine forests for hundreds of miles on either hand lay an absolutely untracked wilderness in a land like this the trail always follows a watercourse either ascending or descending it so for some days we followed the edges of these lakes and the banks of the connecting streams toiling over sharp hills and plunging into steep ravines over a trail bellydeep in mud and water and through a wood empty of life  these were hard days we travelled for many hours through a burntout tract filled with twisted blackened uprooted trees in the wake of fire and hurricane from this tangled desolation i received the suggestion of some verses which i call the song of the north wind the wind and the fire worked together if the wind precedes he prepares the way for his brother fire and in return the fire weakens the trees to the wind  we had settled into a dull routine and the worst feature of each days work was the drag drag of slow hours on the trail we could not hurry and we were forced to watch our horses with unremitting care in order to nurse them over the hard spots or rather the soft spots in the trail we were climbing rapidly and expected soon to pass from the watershed of the fraser into that of the skeena  we passed a horse cold in death with his head flung up as if he had been fighting the wolves in his final death agony it was a grim sight another beast stood abandoned beside the trail gazing at us reproachfully infinite pathos in his eyes he seemed not to have the energy to turn his head but stood as if propped upon his legs his ribs showing with horrible plainness a tragic dejection in every muscle and limb  the feed was fairly good our horses were feeling well and curiously enough the mosquitoes had quite left us we overtook and passed a number of outfits camped beside a splendid rushing stream  on burns lake we came suddenly upon a settlement of quite sizable indian houses with beautiful pasturage about the village contained twentyfive or thirty families of carrier indians and was musical with the plaintive boatsongs of the young people how long these native races have lived here no one can tell but their mark on the land is almost imperceptible they are not of those who mar the landscape  on the first of june we topped the divide between the two mighty watersheds behind us lay the fraser before us the skeena the majestic coast range rose like a wall of snow far away to the northwest while a nearby lake filling the foreground reflected the blue ridges of the middle distancea magnificent spread of wild landscape it made me wish to abandon the trail and push out into the unexplored  from this point we began to descend toward the bulkley which is the most easterly fork of the skeena soon after starting on our downward path we came to a fork in the trail one trail newly blazed led to the right and seemed to be the one to take we started upon it but found it dangerously muddy and so returned to the main trail which seemed to be more numerously travelled afterward we wished we had taken the other for we got one of our horses into the quicksand and worked for more than three hours in the attempt to get him out a horse is a strange animal he is counted intelligent and so he is if he happens to be a bronco or a mule but in proportion as he is a thoroughbred he seems to lose power to take care of himselfloses heart our eweneck bay had a trace of racer in him and being weakened by poor food it was his bad luck to slip over the bank into a quicksand creek having found himself helpless he instantly gave up heart and lay out with a piteous expression of resignation in his big brown eyes we tugged and lifted and rolled him around from one position to another each more dangerous than the first all to no result  while i held him up from drowning my partner brushed in around him so that he could not become submerged we tried hitching the other horses to him in order to drag him out but as they were saddlehorses and had never set shoulder to a collar in their lives they refused to pull even enough to take the proverbial setting hen off the nest  up to this time i had felt no need of company on the trail and for the most part we had travelled alone but i now developed a poignant desire to hear the tinkle of a bell on the back trail for there is no funny business about losing a packhorse in the midst of a wild country his value is not represented by the twentyfive dollars which you originally paid for him sometimes his life is worth all you can give for him  after some three hours of toil the horse getting weaker all the time i looked around once more with despairing gaze and caught sight of a bunch of horses across the valley flat in this country there were no horses except such as the goldseeker owned and this bunch of horses meant a camp of trailers leaping to my saddle i galloped across the spongy marsh to hailing distance  my cries for help brought two of the men running with spades to help us the four of us together lifted the old horse out of the pit more dead than alive we fell to and rubbed his legs to restore circulation later we blanketed him and turned him loose upon the grass in a short time he was nearly as well as ever  it was a sorrowful experience for a fallen horse is a horse in ruins and makes a most woful appeal upon ones sympathies i went to bed tired out stiff and sore from pulling on the rope my hands blistered my nerves shaken  as i was sinking off to sleep i heard a wolf howl as though he mourned the loss of a feast  we had been warned that the bulkley river was a bad stream to crossin fact the roadgang had cut a new trail in order to avoid itthat is to say they kept to the right around the sharp elbow which the river makes at this point whereas the old trail cut directly across the elbow making two crossings at the point where the new trail led to the right we held a council of war to determine whether to keep to the old trail and so save several days travel or to turn to the right and avoid the difficult crossing the new trail was reported to be exceedingly miry and that determined the matterwe concluded to make the short cut  we descended to the bulkley through clouds of mosquitoes and endless sloughs of mud the river was out of its banks and its quicksand flats were exceedingly dangerous to our pack animals although the river itself at this point was a small and sluggish stream  it took us exactly five hours of most exhausting toil to cross the river and its flat we worked like beavers we sweated like hired men wading up to our knees in water and covered with mud brushing in a road over the quicksand for the horses to walk the ewenecked bay was fairly crazy with fear of the mud and it was necessary to lead him over every foot of the way we went into camp for the first time too late to eat by daylight it became necessary for us to use a candle inside the tent at about eleven oclock  the horses were exhausted and crazy for feed it was a struggle to get them unpacked so eager were they to forage ladrone always faithful touched my heart by his patience and gentleness and his reliance upon me i again heard a gray wolf howl as i was sinking off to sleep     the gaunt gray wolf       o a shadowy beast is the gaunt gray wolf     and his feet fall soft on a carpet of spines     where the night shuts quick and the winds are cold     he haunts the deeps of the northern pines      his eyes are eager his teeth are keen     as he slips at night through the bush like a snake     crouching and cringing straight into the wind     to leap with a grin on the fawn in the brake      he falls like a cat on the mother grouse     brooding her young in the windbent weeds     or listens to heed with a start of greed     the bittern booming from river reeds      hes the symbol of hunger the whole earth through     his spectre sits at the door or cave     and the homeless hear with a thrill of fear     the sound of his windswept voice on the air     abandoned on the trail       a poor old horse with downcast mien and sad wild eyes     stood by the lonely trailand oh     he was so piteous lean     he seemed to look a mild surprise     at all mankind that we should treat him so     how hardily he struggled up the trail     and through the streams     all men should know     yet now abandoned to the wolf his waiting foe     he stood in silence as an old man dreams     and as his master left him this he seemed to say     you leave me helpless by the path     i do not curse you but i pray     defend me from the wolves wild wrath     and yet his master rode away     chapter x  down the bulkley valley   as we rose to the top of the divide which lies between the two crossings of the bulkley a magnificent view of the coast range again lightened the horizon in the foreground a lovely lake lay on the shore of this lake stood a single indian shack occupied by a halfdozen children and an old woman they were all wretchedly clothed in graceless rags and formed a bitter and depressing contrast to the magnificence of nature  one of the lads could talk a little chinook mixed with english  how far is it to the ford i asked of him  white man say mebbeso six mebbeso nine mile  knowing the indians vague idea of miles i said  how long before we reach the ford sitkum sun which is to say noon  he shook his head  klip sun come me gohyak make canoe me felly  by which he meant you will arrive at the ford by sunset i will hurry on and build a raft and ferry you over the stream  with an axe and a sack of dried fish on his back and a poor old shotgun in his arm he led the way down the trail at a slapping pace he kept with us till dinnertime however in order to get some bread and coffee  like the jicarilla apaches these people have discovered the virtues of the inner bark of the black pine all along the trail were trees from which wayfarers had lunched leaving a great strip of the white inner wood exposed  man heap drythis muckamuck heap good said the young fellow as he handed me a long strip to taste it was cool and sweet to the tongue and on a hot day would undoubtedly quench thirst the boy took it from the tree by means of a chiselshaped iron after the heavy outer bark has been hewed away by the axe  all along the trail were tree trunks whereon some loitering young siwash had delineated a human face by a few deft and powerful strokes of the axe the sculptural planes of cheeks brow and chin being indicated broadly but with truth and decision often by some old camp a tree would bear on a planed surface the rude pictographs so that those coming after could read the number size sex and success at hunting of those who had gone before there is something japanese it seems to me in this natural taste for carving among all the northwest people  all about us was now riotous june the season was incredibly warm and forward considering the latitude strawberries were in bloom birds were singing wild roses appeared in miles and in millions plum and cherry trees were white with blossomsin fact the splendor and radiance of iowa in june a beautiful lake occupied our left nearly all day  as we arrived at the second crossing of the bulkley about six oclock our young indian met us with a sorrowful face  stick go in chuck no canoe walk stick  a big cottonwood log had fallen across the stream and lay halfsubmerged and quivering in the rushing river over this log a halfdozen men were passing like ants wet with sweat bucking their outfits across the poor siwash was out of a job and exceedingly sorrowful  this is the kind of picnic we didnt expect said one of the young men as i rode up to see what progress they were making  we took our turn at crossing the tree trunk which was submerged nearly a foot deep with water running at millrace speed and resumed the trail following running water most of the way over a very good path once again we had a few hours positive enjoyment with no sense of being in a subarctic country we could hardly convince ourselves that we were in latitude 54 the only peculiarity which i never quite forgot was the extreme length of the day at 1030 at night it was still light enough to write no sooner did it get dark on one side of the hut than it began to lighten on the other the weather was gloriously cool crisp and invigorating and whenever we had sound soil under our feet we were happy  the country was getting each hour more superbly mountainous great snowy peaks rose on all sides the coast range lofty roseate dim and far loomed ever in the west but on our right a group of other giants assembled white and stern a part of the time we threaded our way through firedevastated forests of fir and then as suddenly burst out into tracts of wild roses with beautiful open spaces of waving peavine on which our horses fed ravenously  we were forced to throw up our tent at every meal so intolerable had the mosquitoes become here for the first time our horses were severely troubled by myriads of little black flies they were small but resembled our common house flies in shape and were exceedingly venomous they filled the horses ears and their sting produced minute swellings all over the necks and breasts of the poor animals had it not been for our pennyroyal and bacon grease the bay horse would have been eaten raw  we overtook the trampers again at chock lake they were thin their legs making sharp creases in their trouser legsi could see that as i neared them they were walking desperately reeling from side to side with weakness there was no more smiling on their faces one man the smaller had the countenance of a wolf pinched in round the nose his bony jaw was thrust forward resolutely the taller man was limping painfully because of a shoe which had gone to one side their packs were light but their almost incessant change of position gave evidence of pain and great weariness  i drew near to ask how they were getting along the tall man with a look of wistful sadness like that of a hungry dog said not very well  how are you off for grub  nothing left but some beans and a mere handful of flour  i invited them to a square meal a few miles farther on and in order to help them forward i took one of their packs on my horse i inferred that they would take turns at the remaining pack and so keep pace with us for we were dropping steadily nowdown down through the most beautiful savannas with fine spring brooks rushing from the mountains side flowers increased the days grew warmer it began to feel like summer the mountains grew ever mightier looming cloudlike at sunset bearing glaciers on their shoulders we were almost completely happybut alas the mosquitoes their hum silenced the songs of the birds their feet made the mountains of no avail the otherwise beautiful land became a restless hell for the unprotected man or beast it was impossible to eat or sleep without some defence and our pennyroyal salve was invaluable it enabled us to travel with some degree of comfort where others suffered martyrdom  at noon burton made up a heavy mess in expectation of the trampers who had fallen a little behind the small man came into view first for he had abandoned his fellowtraveller this angered me and i was minded to cast the little sneak out of camp but his pinched and hungry face helped me to put up with him i gave him a smart lecture and said i supposed you intended to help the other man or i wouldnt have relieved you of a pound  the other toiler turned up soon limping and staggering with weakness when dinner was ready they came to the call like a couple of starving dogs the small man had no politeness left he gorged himself like a wolf he fairly snapped the food down his throat the tall man by great effort contrived to display some knowledge of better manners as they ate i studied them they were blotched by mosquito bites and tanned to a leather brown their thin hands were like claws their doubled knees seemed about to pierce their trouser legs  yes said the taller man the mosquitoes nearly eat us up we can only sleep in the middle of the day or from about two oclock in the morning till sunrise we walk late in the eveningtill nine or tenand then sit in the smoke till it gets cold enough to drive away the mosquitoes then we try to sleep but the trouble is when it is cold enough to keep them off its too cold for us to sleep  what did you do during the late rains i inquired  oh we kept moving most of the time at night we camped under a fir tree by the trail and dried off the mosquitoes didnt bother us so much then we were wet nearly all the time  i tried to get at his point of view his justification for such senseless action but could only discover a sort of blind belief that something would help him pull through he had gone to the caribou mines to find work and failing had pushed on toward hazleton with a dim hope of working his way to teslin lake and to the klondike he started with forty pounds of provisions and three or four dollars in his pocket he was now dead broke and his provisions almost gone  meanwhile the smaller man made no sign of hearing a word he ate and ate till my friend looked at me with a comical wink we fed him staplesbeans graham bread and coffeeand he slowly but surely reached the bottom of every dish he did not fill up he simply wiped out the cooked food the tall man was not far behind him  as he talked i imagined the life they had led at first the trail was good and they were able to make twenty miles each day the weather was dry and warm and sleeping was not impossible they camped close beside the trail when they grew tiredi had seen and recognized their campingplaces all along but the rains came on and they were forced to walk all day through the wet shrubs with the water dripping from their ragged garments they camped at night beneath the firs for the ground is always dry under a fir where a fire is easily built there they hung over the flame drying their clothing and their rapidly weakening shoes the mosquitoes swarmed upon them bloodily in the shelter and warmth of the trees for they had no netting or tent their meals were composed of tea a few hastily stewed beans and a poor quality of sticky camp bread their sleep was broken and fitful they were either too hot or too cold and the mosquitoes gave way only when the frost made slumber difficult in the morning they awoke to the necessity of putting on their wet shoes and taking the muddy trail to travel as long as they could stagger forward  in addition to all this they had no maps and knew nothing of their whereabouts or how far it was to a human habitation their only comfort lay in the passing of outfits like mine from such as i they rustled food and clothing the small man did not even thank us for the meal he sat himself down for a smoke and communed with his stomach the tall man was plainly worsted his voice had a plaintive droop his shoe gnawed into his foot and his pack was visibly heavier than that of his companion  we were two weeks behind our schedule and our own flour sack was not much bigger than a sachetbag but we gave them some rice and part of our beans and oatmeal and they moved away  we were approaching sealevel following the bulkley which flows in a northwesterly direction and enters the great skeena river at right angles just below its three forks each hour the peaks seemed to assemble and uplift the days were at their maximum the sun set shortly after eight but it was light until nearly eleven at midday the sun was fairly hot but the wind swept down from the mountains cool and refreshing i shall not soon forget those radiant meadows over which the far mountains blazed in almost intolerable splendor it was too perfect to endure like the light of the sun lingering on the high peaks with most magical beauty it passed away to be seen no more  in the midst of these grandeurs we lost one of our horses whenever a horse breaks away from his fellows on the trail it is pretty safe to infer he has hit the back track as i went out to round up the horses major grunt was nowhere to be found he had strayed from the bunch and we inferred had started back over the trail we trailed him till we met one of the trampers who assured us that no horse had passed him in the night for he had been camped within six feet of the path  up to this time there had been no returning footsteps and it was easy to follow the horse so long as he kept to the trail but the trampers report was positiveno horse had passed him we turned back and began searching the thickets around the camp  we toiled all day not merely because the horse was exceedingly valuable to us but also for the reason that he had a rope attached to his neck and i was afraid he might become entangled in the fallen timber and so starve to death  the tall tramper who had been definitely abandoned by his partner was a sad spectacle he was blotched by mosquito bites thin and weak with hunger and his clothes hung in tatters he had just about reached the limit of his courage and though we were uncertain of our horses and our food was nearly exhausted we gave him all the rice we had and some fruit and sent him on his way  night came and still no signs of major grunt it began to look as though some one had ridden him away and we should be forced to go on without him this losing of a horse is one of the accidents which make the trail so uncertain we were exceedingly anxious to get on there was an oppressive warmth in the air and flies and mosquitoes were the worst we had ever seen altogether this was a dark day on our calendar  after we had secured ourselves in our tents that night the sound of the savage insects without was like the roaring of a faroff hailstorm the horses rolled in the dirt snorted wheeled madly stamped shook their heads and flung themselves again and again on the ground giving every evidence of the most terrible suffering if this is to continue i said to my partner i shall quit and either kill all my horses or ship them out of the country i will not have them eaten alive in this way  it was impossible to go outside to attend to them nothing could be done but sit in gloomy silence and listen to the drumming of their frantic feet on the turf as they battled against their invisible foes at last led by old ladrone they started off at a hobbling gallop up the trail  well we are in for it now i remarked as the footsteps died away theyve hit the back trail and well have another days hard work to catch em and bring em back however theres no use worrying the mosquitoes would eat us alive if we went out now we might just as well go to sleep and wait till morning sleep was difficult under the circumstances but we dozed off at last  as we took their trail in the cool of the next morning we found the horses had taken the back trail till they reached an open hillside and had climbed to the very edge of the timber there they were all in a bunch with the exception of major grunt of whom we had no trace  with a mind filled with distressing pictures of the lost horse entangled in his rope and lying flat on his side hidden among the fallen tree trunks there to struggle and starve i reluctantly gave orders for a start with intent to send an indian back to search for him  after two hours smart travel we came suddenly upon the little indian village of morricetown which is built beside a narrow cañon through which the bulkley rushes with tremendous speed here high on the level grassy bank we camped quite secure from mosquitoes and surrounded by the curious natives who showed us where to find wood and water and brought us the most beautiful spring salmon and potatoes so tender and fine that the skin could be rubbed from them with the thumb they were exactly like new potatoes in the states out of this it may be well understood we had a most satisfying dinner summer was in full tide pieplant was two feet high and strawberries were almost ripe  calling the men of the village around me i explained in pigeonenglish and worse chinook that i had lost a horse and that i would give five dollars to the man who would bring him to me they all listened attentively filled with joy at a chance to earn so much money at last the chief man of the village a very goodlooking fellow of twentyfive or thirty said to me all light me go me fetch um you stop here mebbeso klipsun i come bling horse  his confidence relieved us of anxiety and we had a very pleasant day of it digesting our bountiful meal of salmon and potatoes and mending up our clothing we were now pretty ragged and very brown but in excellent health  late in the afternoon a gang of roadcutters who had been sent out by the towns interested in the route came into town from hazleton and i had a talk with the boss a very decent fellow who gave a grim report of the trail beyond he said nobody knows anything about that trail jim deacon the headman of our party when we left hazleton was only about seventy miles out and cutting fallen timber like a man chopping cord wood and sending back for more help we are now going back to bridge and corduroy the places we had no time to fix as we came  morricetown was a superb spot and burton was much inclined to stay right there and prospect the nearby mountains so far as a mere casual observer could determine this country offers every inducement to prospectors it is possible to grow potatoes hay and oats together with various small fruits in this valley and if gold should ever be discovered in the rushing mountain streams it would be easy to sustain a camp and feed it well  long before sunset an indian came up to us and smilingly said you hosscome and a few minutes later the young tyee came riding into town leading major grunt well as ever but a little sullen he had taken the back trail till he came to a narrow and insecure bridge there he had turned up the stream going deeper and deeper into the stick as the siwash called the forest i paid the reward gladly and major took his place among the other horses with no sign of joy      do you fear the wind       do you fear the force of the wind     the slash of the rain     go face them and fight them     be savage again     go hungry and cold like the wolf         go wade like the crane     the palms of your hands will thicken     the skin of your cheek will tan     youll grow ragged and weary and swarthy         but youll walk like a man      chapter xi  hazleton midway on the trail   we were now but thirty miles from hazleton where our second bill of supplies was waiting for us and we were eager to push on taking the advice of the roadgang we crossed the frail suspension bridge which the indians had most ingeniously constructed out of logs and pieces of old telegraph wire and started down the west side of the river every ravine was filled by mountain streams foamwhite with speed  we descended all day and the weather grew more and more summerlike each mile ripe strawberries lured us from the warm banks for the first time we came upon great groves of red cedar under which the trail ran very muddy and very slippery by reason of the hard roots of the cedars which never decay creeks that seemed to me a good field for placer mining came down from the left but no one stopped to do more than pan a little gravel from a cut bank or a bar  at about two oclock of the second day we came to the indian village of hagellgate which stands on the high bank overhanging the roaring river just before it empties into the skeena here we got news of the tramp who had fallen in exhaustion and was being cared for by the indians  descending swiftly we came to the bank of the river which was wide tremendously swift and deep and cold rival indian ferry companies bid for our custom each man extolling his boat at the expense of the old canoeno good of his rivals  the canoes were like those to be seen all along the coast that is to say they had been hollowed from cottonwood or pine trees and afterward steamed and spread by means of hot water to meet the makers idea of the proper line of grace and speed they were really beautiful and sat the water almost as gracefully as the birchbark canoe of the chippewas at each end they rose into a sort of neck which terminated often in a head carved to resemble a deer or some fabled animal some of them had white bands encircling the throat of this figurehead their paddles were short and broad but light and strong  these canoes are very seaworthy as they were driven across the swift waters they danced on the waves like leaves and the boatmen bent to their oars with almost desperate energy and with most excited outcry  therein is expressed a mighty difference between the siwash and the plains indian the cheyenne the sioux conceal effort or fear or enthusiasm these little people chattered and whooped at each other like monkeys upon hearing them for the first time i imagined they were losing control of the boat judging from their accent they were shrieking phrases like these  quick quick dig in deep joe scratch now were going downwhoop hay now all togetherswing her doggone yeswing her now straightkeep her straight cant ye see that eddy whoop whoop let out a link or two you spindlearmed child now quick or were lost  while the other men seemed to reply in kind oh rats were a makin it head her toward that bush dont get scaredtrust meill sling her ashore  a plains indian under similar circumstances would have strained every muscle till his bones cracked before permitting himself to show effort or excitement  with all their confusion and chatter these little people were always masters of the situation they came out right no matter how savage the river and the bulkley at this point was savage every drop of water was in motion it had no eddies no slack water its momentum was terrific in crossing the boatmen were obliged to pole their canoes far up beyond the point at which they meant to land then at the word they swung into the rushing current and pulled like fiends for the opposite shore their broad paddles dipped so rapidly they resembled paddlewheels they kept the craft headon to the current and did not attempt to charge the bank directly but swungto broadside in this way they led our horses safely across and came up smiling each time  we found hazleton to be a small village composed mainly of indians with a big hudson bay post at its centre it was situated on a lovely green flat but a few feet above the skeena which was a majestic flood at this point there were some ten or fifteen outfits camped in and about the village resting and getting ready for the last half of the trail some of the wouldbe miners had come up the river in the little hudson bay steamer which makes two or three trips a year and were waiting for her next trip in order to go down again  the town was filled with gloomy stories of the trail no one knew its condition in fact it had not been travelled in seventeen years except by the indians on foot with their packs of furs the road party was ahead but toiling hard and hurrying to open a way for us  as i now reread all the advance literature of this prairie route i perceived how skilfully every detail with regard to the last half of the trail had been slurred over we had been led into a sort of sack and the string was tied behind us  the hudson bay agent said to me with perfect frankness theres no one in this village except one or two indians whos ever been over the trail or who can give you any information concerning it he furthermore said a large number of these fellows who are starting in on this trip with their poor little cayuses will never reach the stikeen river and might better stop right here  feed was scarce here as everywhere and we were forced to camp on the trail some two miles above the town in going to and from our tent we passed the indian burial ground which was very curious and interesting to me it was a veritable little city of the dead with streets of tiny gayly painted little houses in which the silent and motionless ones had been laid in their last sleep each tomb was a shelter a roof and a tomb and upon each the builder had lavished his highest skill in ornament they were all vivid with paint and carving and lattice work each builder seemed trying to outdo his neighbor in making a cheerful habitation for his dead  more curious still in each house were the things which the dead had particularly loved in one a trunk contained all of a girls muchprized clothing a complete set of dishes was visible in another while in a third i saw a washstand bowl pitcher and mirror there was something deeply touching to me in all this they are so poor their lives are so bare of comforts that the consecration of these articles to the dead seemed a greater sacrifice than we who count ourselves civilized would make each chair or table or coat or pair of shoes costs many skins the set of furniture meant many hard journeys in the cold long days of trailing trapping and packing the clothing had a high money value yet it remained undisturbed i saw one day a woman and two young girls halt to look timidly in at the window of a newly erected tomb but only for a moment and then in a panic of fear and awe they hurried away  the days which followed were cold and gloomy quite in keeping with the grim tales of the trail bodies of horses and mules drowned in the attempt to cross the skeena were reported passing the wharf at the post the wife of a retired indian agent who claimed to have been over the route many years ago was interviewed by my partner after saying that it was a terrible trail she sententiously ended with these words gentlemen you may consider yourselves explorers  i halted a very intelligent indian who came riding by our camp how far to teslin lake i asked  he mused maybe so forty days maybe so thirty days me think forty days  good feed hyu muckamuck  he looked at me in silence and his face grew a little graver halo muckamuck no feed long time no glass hyyu stick woods hyu riverall day swim  turning to burton i said here we get at the truth of it this man has no reason for lying we need another horse and we need fifty pounds more flour  one by one the outfits behind us came dropping down into hazleton in long trains of weary horses some of them in very bad condition many of the goldseekers determined to quit they sold their horses as best they could to the indians who were glad to buy them and hired canoes to take them to the coast intent to catch one of the steamers which ply to and fro between skagway and seattle  but one by one with tinkling bells and sharp outcry of drivers other outfits passed us cheerily calling good luck see you later all bound for the gold belt gloomy skies continued to fill the imaginative ones with forebodings and all day they could be seen in groups about the village discussing ways and means quarrels broke out and parties disbanded in discouragement and bitterness the road to the golden river seemed to grow longer and the precious sand more elusive from day to day here at hazleton where they had hoped to reach a gold region nothing was doing those who had visited the kisgagash mountains to the north were lukewarm in their reports and no one felt like stopping to explore the cry was on to dawson  here in hazleton i came upon the lame tramp he had secured lodging in an empty shack and was being helped to food by some citizens in the town for whom he was doing a little work seeing me pass he called to me and began to inquire about the trail  i read in the gleam of his eye an insane resolution to push forward this i set about to check if you wish to commit suicide start on this trail the four hundred miles you have been over is a summer picnic excursion compared to that which is now to follow my advice to you is to stay right where you are until the next hudson bay steamer comes by then go to the captain and tell him just how you are situated and ask him to carry you down to the coast you are insane to think for a moment of attempting the four hundred miles of unknown trail between here and glenora especially without a cent in your pocket and no grub you have no right to burden the other outfits with your needs  this plain talk seemed to affect him and he looked aggrieved but what can i do i have no money and no work  i replied in effect whatever you do you cant afford to enter upon this trail and you cant expect men who are already short of grub to feed and take care of you theres a chance for you to work your way back to the coast on the hudson bay steamer theres only starvation on the trail  as i walked away he called after me but i refused to return i had the feeling in spite of all i had said that he would attempt to rustle a little grub and make his start on the trail the whole goldseeking movement was in a way a craze he was simply an extreme development of it  it seemed necessary to break camp in order not to be eaten up by the siwash dogs whose peculiarities grew upon me daily they were indeed strange beasts they seemed to have no youth i never saw them play even the puppies were grave and sedate they were never in a hurry and were not afraid they got out of our way with the least possible exertion looking meekly reproachful or snarling threateningly at us they were ever watchful no matter how apparently deep their slumber they saw every falling crumb they knew where we had hung our fish and were ready as we turned our backs to make away with it it was impossible to leave anything eatable for a single instant nothing but the sleight of hand of a conjurer could equal the mystery of their stealing  after buying a fourth pack animal and reshoeing all our horses we got our outfit into shape for the long hard drive which lay before us every ounce of superfluous weight every tool every article not absolutely essential was discarded and its place filled with food we stripped ourselves like men going into battle and on the third day lined up for teslin lake six hundred miles to the north     siwash graves       here in their tiny gayly painted homes     they sleep these small dead people of the streams     their names unknown their deeds forgot     their bygone battles lost in dreams     a few short days and we who laugh     will be as still will lie as low     as utterly in dark as they who rot     here where the roses blow     they fought and loved and toiled and died     as all men do and all men must     of what avail we at the end     fall quite as shapelessly to dust     line up brave boys       the packs are on the cinches tight     the patient horses wait     upon the grass the frost lies white     the dawn is gray and late     the leaders cry rings sharp and clear     the campfires smoulder low     before us lies a shallow mere     beyond the mountain snow           line up billy line up boys               the east is gray with coming day               we must away we cannot stay               hyo hyak brave boys      five hundred miles behind us lie     as many more ahead     through mud and mire on mountains high     our weary feet must tread     so one by one with loyal mind     the horses swing to place     the strong in lead the weak behind     in patient plodding grace           hyo buckskin brave boy joe               the sun is high               the hid loons cry               hyakaway hyo     chapter xii  crossing the big divide   our stay at hazleton in some measure removed the charm of the first view the people were all so miserably poor and the hosts of howling hungry dogs made each day more distressing the mountains remained splendid to the last and as we made our start i looked back upon them with undiminished pleasure  we pitched tent at night just below the ford and opposite another indian village in which a most mournful medicine song was going on timed to the beating of drums dogs joined with the mourning of the people with cries of almost human anguish to which the beat of the passionless drum added solemnity and a sort of inexorable marching rhythm it seemed to announce pestilence and flood and made the beautiful earth a place of hunger and despair  i was awakened in the early dawn by a singular cry repeated again and again on the farther side of the river it seemed the voice of a woman uttering in wailing chant the most piercing agony of despairing love it ceased as the sun arose and was heard no more it was difficult to imagine such anguish in the bustle of the bright morning it seemed as though it must have been an illusiona dream of tragedy  in the course of an hours travel we came down to the sandy bottom of the river whereon a halfdozen fine canoes were beached and waiting for us the skilful natives set us across very easily although it was the maddest and wildest of all the rivers we had yet seen we crossed the main river just above the point at which the west fork enters the horses were obliged to swim nearly half a mile and some of them would not have reached the other shore had it not been for the indians who held their heads out of water from the sterns of the canoes and so landed them safely on the bar just opposite the little village called kispyox which is also the indian name of the west fork  the trail made off up the eastern bank of this river which was as charming as any stream ever imagined by a poet the water was graygreen in color swift and active it looped away in most splendid curves through opulent bottom lands filled with wild roses geranium plants and berry blooms openings alternated with beautiful woodlands and grassy meadows while over and beyond all rose the ever present mountains of the coast range deep blue and snowcapped  there was no strangeness in the floraon the contrary everything seemed familiar hazel bushes poplars pines all growth was amazingly luxuriant the trail was an indian path graceful and full of swinging curves we had passed beyond the telegraph wire of the old trail  early in the afternoon we passed some five or six outfits camped on a beautiful grassy bank overlooking the river and forming a most satisfying picture the bells on the grazing horses were tinkling and from sparkling fires thin columns of smoke arose some of the young men were bathing while others were washing their shirts in the sunny stream there was a cheerful sound of whistling and rattling of tinware mingled with the sound of axes nothing could be more jocund more typical of the young men and the trail it was one of the few pleasant camps of the long journey  it was raining when we awoke but before noon it cleared sufficiently to allow us to pack we started at one though the bushes were loaded with water and had we not been well clothed in waterproof we should have been drenched to the bone we rode for four hours over a good trail dodging wet branches in the pouring rain it lightened at five and we went into camp quite dry and comfortable  we unpacked near an indian ranch belonging to an old man and his wife who came up at once to see us they were goodlooking rugged old souls like powerful japanese they could not speak chinook and we could not get much out of them the old wife toted a monstrous big salmon up the hill to sell to us but we had more fish than we could eat and were forced to decline there was a beautiful spring just back of the cabin and the old man seemed to take pleasure in having us get our water from it neither did he object to our horses feeding about his house where there was very excellent grass it was a charming campingplace wild flowers made the trail radiant even in the midst of rain the wild roses grew in clumps of sprays as high as a horses head  just before we determined to camp we had passed three or four outfits grouped together on the sward on the left bank of the river as we rode by one of the men had called to me saying you had better camp it is thirty miles from here to feed to this i had merely nodded giving it little attention but now as we sat around our campfire burton brought the matter up again if it is thirty miles to feed we will have to get off early tomorrow morning and make as big a drive as we can while the horses are fresh and then make the latter part of the run on empty stomachs  oh i think they were just talking for our special benefit i replied  no they were in earnest one of them came out to see me he said he got his pointer from the mule train ahead of us feed is going to be very scarce and the next run is fully thirty miles  i insisted it could not be possible that we should go at once from the luxuriant peavine and bluejoint into a thirtymile stretch of country where nothing grew there must be breaks in the forest where we can graze our horses  it rained all night and in the morning it seemed as if it had settled into a weeks downpour however we were quite comfortable with plenty of fresh salmon and were not troubled except with the thought of the mud which would result from this rainstorm we were falling steadily behind our schedule each day but the horses were feeding and gaining strengthand when we hit the trail we will hit it hard i said to burton  it was sunday the day was perfectly quiet and peaceful like a rainy sunday in the states the old indian below kept to his house all day not visiting us it is probable that he was a catholic the dogs came about us occasionally strange solemn creatures that they are they had the persistence of hunger and the silence of burglars  it was raining when we awoke monday morning but we were now restless to get under way we could not afford to spend another day waiting in the rain it was gloomy business in camp and at the first sign of lightening sky we packed up and started promptly at twelve oclock  that ride was the sternest we had yet experienced it was like swimming in a sea of green water the branches sloshed us with blinding raindrops the mud spurted under our horses hoofs the sky was gray and drizzled moisture and as we rose we plunged into ever deepening forests we left behind us all hazel bushes alders wild roses and grasses moss was on every leaf and stump the forest became savage sinister and silent not a living thing but ourselves moved or uttered voice  this world grew oppressive with its unbroken clear greens its dripping branches its rotting trees its snakelike roots half buried in the earth convinced me that our warning was wellborn at last we came into upper heights where no blade of grass grew and we pushed on desperately on and on hour after hour we began to suffer with the horses being hungry and cold ourselves we plunged into bottomless mudholes slid down slippery slopes of slate and leaped innumerable fallen logs of fir the sky had no more pity than the mossy ground and the desolate forest it was a mocking land a land of green things but not a blade of grass only austere trees and noxious weeds  during the day we met an old man so loaded down i could not tell whether he was man woman or beast a sort of cap or wide cloth band went across his head concealing his forehead his huge pack loomed over his shoulders and as he walked using two paddles as canes he seemed some anomalous fourfooted beast of burden  as he saw us he threw off his pack to rest and stood erect a sturdy man of sixty with short bristling hair framing a kindly resolute face he was very lighthearted he shook hands with me saying klahowya in answer to my klahowya six which is to say how are you friend he smiled pointed to his pack and said hyu skin his season had been successful and he was going now to sell his catch a couple of dogs just behind carried each twenty pounds on their backs we were eating lunch and i invited him to sit and eat he took a seat and began to parcel out the food in two piles  he has a companion coming i said to my partner in a few moments a boy of fourteen or fifteen came up carrying a pack that would test the strength of a powerful white man he too threw off his load and at a word from the old man took a seat at the table they shared exactly alike it was evident that they were father and son  a few miles farther on we met another family two men a woman a boy and six dogs all laden in proportion they were all handsomer than the siwashes of the fraser river they came from the headwaters of the nasse they said they could speak but little chinook and no english at all when i asked in chinook how far is it to feed for our horses the woman looked first at our thin animals then at us and shook her head sorrowfully then lifting her hands in the most dramatic gesture she half whispered siah siah that is to say far very far  both these old people seemed very kind to their dogs which were fat and sleek and not related to those i had seen in hazleton when the old man spoke to them his voice was gentle and encouraging at the word they all took up the line of march and went off down the hill toward the hudson bay store there to remain during the summer we pushed on convinced by the old womans manner that our long trail was to be a gloomy one  night began to settle over us at last adding the final touches of uncertainty and horror to the gloom we pushed on with necessary cruelty forcing the tired horses to their utmost searching every ravine and every slope for a feed but only ferns and strange green poisonous plants could be seen we were angling up the side of the great ridge which separated the west fork of the skeena river from the middle fork it was evident that we must cross this high divide and descend into the valley of the middle fork before we could hope to feed our horses  however just as darkness was beginning to come on we came to an almost impassable slough in the trail where a small stream descended into a little flat marsh and morass this had been used as a campingplace by others and we decided to camp because to travel even in the twilight was dangerous to life and limb  it was a gloomy and depressing place to spend the night there was scarcely level ground enough to receive our camp the wood was soggy and green in order to reach the marsh we were forced to lead our horses one by one through a dangerous mudhole and once through this they entered upon a quaking bog out of which grew tufts of grass which had been gnawed to the roots by the animals which had preceded them only a rank bottom of dead leaves of last years growth was left for our tired horses i was deeply anxious for fear they would crowd into the central bog in their efforts to reach the uncropped green blades which grew out of reach in the edge of the water they were ravenous with hunger after eight hours of hard labor  our clothing was wet to the inner threads and we were tired and muddy also but our thoughts were on the horses rather than upon ourselves we soon had a fire going and some hot supper and by ten oclock were stretched out in our beds for the night  i have never in my life experienced a gloomier or more distressing camp on the trail my bed was dry and warm but i could not forget our tired horses grubbing about in the chilly night on that desolate marsh      a child of the sun       give me the sun and the sky     the wide sky let it blaze with light     let it burn with heati care not     the sun is the blood of my heart     the wind of the plain my breath     no woodsman am i my eyes are set     for the wide low lines the level rim     of the prairie land is mine     the semigloom of the pointed firs     the sleeping darks of the mountain spruce     are prison and poison to such as i     in the forest i long for the rose of the plain     in the dark of the firs i die     in the grass       o to lie in long grasses     o to dream of the plain     where the west wind sings as it passes     a weird and unceasing refrain     where the rank grass wallows and tosses     and the plains ring dazzles the eye     where hardly a silver cloud bosses     the flashing steel arch of the sky      to watch the gay gulls as they flutter     like snowflakes and fall down the sky     to swoop in the deeps of the hollows     where the crowsfoot tosses awry     and gnats in the lee of the thickets     are swirling like waltzers in glee     to the harsh shrill creak of the crickets     and the song of the lark and the bee      o faroff plains of my west land     o lands of winds and the free     swift deermy mistclad plain     from my bed in the heart of the forest     from the clasp and the girdle of pain     your light through my darkness passes     to your meadows in dreaming i fly     to plunge in the deeps of your grasses     to bask in the light of your sky     chapter xiii  the silent forests of the dread skeena   we were awake early and our first thought was of our horses they were quite safe and cropping away on the dry stalks with patient diligence we saddled up and pushed on for food was to be had only in the valley whose blue and white walls we could see far ahead of us after nearly six hours travel we came out of the forest out into the valley of the middle fork of the skeena into sunlight and grass in abundance where we camped till the following morning giving the horses time to recuperate  we were done with smiling valleysthat i now perceived we were coming nearer to the subarctic country grim and desolate the view was magnificent but the land seemed empty and silent except of mosquitoes of which there were uncounted millions on our right just across the river rose the white peaks of the kisgagash mountains snow was still lying in the gullies only a few rods above us  the horses fed right royally and soon forgot the dearth of the big divide as we were saddling up to move the following morning several outfits came trailing down into the valley glad as we had been of the splendid field of grass they were led by a grizzled old american who cursed the country with fine fervor  i can stand any kind of a country said he except one where theres no feed and as nears i can find out were in fer hells own time fer feed till we reach them prairies they tell about  after leaving this flat we had the kuldo a swift and powerful river to cross but we found an old indian and a girl camped on the opposite side waiting for us the daughter a comely child about sixteen years of age wore a calico dress and store shoes she was a selfcontained little creature and clearly in command of the boat and very efficient it was no childs play to put the light canoe across such a stream but the old man with much shouting and under command of the girl succeeded in crossing six times carrying us and our baggage as we were being put across for the last time it became necessary for some one to pull the canoe through the shallow water and the little girl without hesitation leaped out regardless of new shoes and tugged at the rope while the old man poled at the stern and so we were landed  as a recognition of her resolution i presented her with a dollar which i tried to make her understand was her own and not to be given to her father up to that moment she had been very shy and rather sullen but my present seemed to change her opinion of us and she became more genial at once she was short and sturdy and her little footsteps in the trail were strangely suggestive of civilization  after leaving the river we rose sharply for about three miles this brought us to the first notice on the trail which was signed by the roadgang an ambiguous scrawl to the effect that feed was to be very scarce for a long long way and that we should feed our horses before going forward the mystery of the sign lay in the fact that no feed was in sight and if it referred back to the flat then it was in the nature of an irish bull  there was a fork in the trail here and another notice informed us that the trail to the right ran to the indian village of kuldo rain threatened and as it was late and no feed promised i determined to camp turning to the right down a tremendously steep path the horses sliding on their haunches we came to an old indian fishing village built on a green shelf high above the roaring water of the skeena  the people all came rushing out to see us curious but very hospitable some of the children began plucking grasses for the horses but being unaccustomed to animals of any kind not one would approach within reach of them i tried by patting ladrone and putting his head over my shoulder to show them how gentle he was but they only smiled and laughed as much as to say yes that is all right for you but we are afraid they were all very goodlooking smiling folk but poorly dressed they seemed eager to show us where the best grass grew demanded nothing of us begged nothing and did not attempt to overcharge us there were some eight or ten families in the cañon and their houses were wretched shacks mere lodges of slabs with vents in the peak so far as they could they conformed to the ways of white men  here they dwell by this rushing river in the midst of a gloomy and trackless forest far removed from any other people of any sort they were but a handful of human souls as they spoke little chinook and almost no english it was difficult to converse with them they had lost the sign language or seemed not to use it their village was built here because the cañon below offered a capital place for fishing and trapping and the principal duty of the men was to watch the salmon trap dancing far below for the rest they hunt wild animals and sell furs to the hudson bay company at hazleton which is their metropolis  they led us to the edge of the village and showed us where the roadgang had set their tent and we soon had a fire going in our little stove which was the amazement and delight of a circle of men women and children but they were not intrusive and asked for nothing  later in the evening the old man and the girl who had helped to ferry us across the kuldo came down the hill and joined the circle of our visitors  she smiled as we greeted her and so did the father who assured me he was the tyee boss of the village which he seemed to be  after our supper we distributed some fruit among the children and among the old women some hot coffee with sugar which was a keen delight to them our desire to be friendly was deeply appreciated by these poor people and our wish to do them good was greater than our means the way was long before us and we could not afford to give away our supplies how they live in winter i cannot understand probably they go down the river to hazleton  i began to dread the dark green dripping firs which seemed to encompass us like some vast army they chilled me oppressed me moreover i was lame in every joint from the toil of crossing rivers climbing steep hills and dragging at cinches i had walked down every hill and in most cases on the sharp upward slopes in order to relieve ladrone of my weight  as we climbed back to our muddy path next day we were filled with dark forebodings of the days to come we climbed all day keeping the bench high above the river the land continued silent it was a wilderness of firs and spruce pines it was like a forest of bronze nothing but a few rose bushes and some leeklike plants rose from the mossy floor on which the sun fell weak and pale in rare places no beast or bird uttered sound save a fishing eagle swinging through the cañon above the roaring water  in the gloom the voice of the stream became a raucous roar on every side cold and white and pitiless the snowy peaks lifted above the serrate rim of the forest  life was scant here in all the mighty spread of forest between the continental divide on the east and the coast range at the west there are few living things and these few necessarily centre in the warm openings on the banks of the streams where the sunlight falls or in the high valleys above the firs there are no serpents and no insects  as we mounted day by day we crossed dozens of swift little streams cold and gray with silt our rate of speed was very low one of our horses became very weak and ill evidently poisoned and we were forced to stop often to rest him all the horses were weakening day by day  toward the middle of the third day after crossing a stream which came from the left the trail turned as if to leave the skeena behind we were mighty well pleased and climbed sharply and with great care of our horses till we reached a little meadow at the summit very tired and disheartened for the view showed only other peaks and endless waves of spruce and fir we rode on under drizzling skies and dripping trees there was little sunshine and long lines of heavily weighted gray clouds came crawling up the valley from the sea to break in cold rain over the summits  the horses again grew hungry and weak and it was necessary to use great care in crossing the streams we were lame and sore with the toil of the day and what was more depressing found ourselves once more upon the banks of the skeena where only an occasional bunch of bluejoint could be found the constant strain of watching the horses and guiding them through the mud began to tell on us both there was now no moment of ease no hour of enjoyment we had set ourselves grimly to the task of bringing our horses through alive we no longer rode we toiled in silence leading our saddlehorses on which we had packed a part of our outfit to relieve the sick and starving packhorses  on the fourth day we took a westward shoot from the river and following the course of a small stream again climbed heavily up the slope our horses were now so weak we could only climb a few rods at a time without rest but at last just as night began to fall we came upon a splendid patch of bluejoint kneedeep and rich it was high on the mountain side on a slope so steep that the horses could not lie down so steep that it was almost impossible to set our tent we could not persuade ourselves to pass it however and so made the best of it everywhere we could see white mountains to the south to the west to the east  now we have left the skeena valley said burton  yes we have seen the last of the skeena i replied and im glad of it i never want to see that graygreen flood again  a part of the time that evening we spent in picking the thorns of devilsclub out of our hands this strange plant i had not seen before and do not care to see it again in plunging through the mudholes we spasmodically clutched these spiny things ladrone nipped steadily at the bunch of leaves which grew at the top of the twisted stalk again we plunged down into the cold green forest following a stream whose current ran to the northeast this brought us once again to the bank of the dreaded skeena the trail was punishing and the horses plunged and lunged all day through the mud over logs stones and roots our nerves quivered with the torture of piloting our mistrusted desperate horses through these awful pitfalls we were still in the region of ferns and devilsclub  we allowed no feed to escape us at any hour of the day whenever we found a bunch of grass no matter if it were not bigger than a broom we stopped for the horses to graze it and so we kept them on their feet  at five oclock in the afternoon we climbed to a low marshy lake where an indian hunter was camped he said we would find feed on another lake some miles up and we pushed on wallowing through mud and water of innumerable streams each moment in danger of leaving a horse behind i walked nearly all day for it was torture to me as well as to ladrone to ride him over such a trail three of our horses now showed signs of poisoning two of them walked with a sprawling action of the fore legs their eyes big and glassy one was too weak to carry anything more than his packsaddle and our going had a sort of sullen desperation in it our camps were on the muddy ground without comfort or convenience  next morning as i swung into the saddle and started at the head of my train ladrone threw out his nose with a sharp indrawn squeal of pain at first i paid little attention to it but it came againand then i noticed a weakness in his limbs i dismounted and examined him carefully he too was poisoned and attacked by spasms it was a sorrowful thing to see my proud gray reduced to this condition his eyes were dilated and glassy and his joints were weak we could not stop we could not wait we must push on to feed and open ground and so leading him carefully i resumed our slow march  but at last just when it seemed as though we could not go any farther with our suffering animals we came out of the poisonous forest upon a broad grassy bottom where a stream was flowing to the northwest we raised a shout of joy for it seemed this must be a branch of the nasse if so we were surely out of the clutches of the skeena this bottom was the first dry and level ground we had seen since leaving the west fork and the sun shone old man the worst of our trail is over i shouted to my partner the land looks more open to the north were coming to that plateau they told us of  oh how sweet fine and sunny the short dry grass seemed to us after our long toilsome stay in the subaqueous gloom of the skeena forests we seemed about to return to the birds and the flowers  ladrone was very ill but i fed him some salt mixed with lard and after a doze in the sun he began to nibble grass with the others and at last stretched out on the warm dry sward to let the glorious sun soak into his blood it was a joyous thing to us to see the faithful ones revelling in the healing sunlight their stomachs filled at last with sweet rich forage we were dirty ragged and lame and our hands were calloused and seamed with dirt but we were strong and hearty  we were high in the mountains here those little marshy lakes and slow streams showed that we were on a divide and to our minds could be no other than the headwaters of the nasse which has a watershed of its own to the sea we believed the worst of our trip to be over     the faithful broncos       they go to certain deathto freeze     to grope their way through blinding snow     to starve beneath the northern trees     their curse on us who made them go     they trust and we betray the trust     they humbly look to us for keep     the rifle crumbles them to dust     and wehave hardly grace to weep     as they line up to die     the whistling marmot       on mountains cold and bold and high     where only golden eagles fly     he builds his home against the sky      above the clouds he sits and whines     the morning sun about him shines     rivers loop below in shining lines      no wolf or cat may find him there     that winged corsair of the air     the eagle is his only care      he sees the pink snows slide away     he sees his little ones at play     and peace fills out each summer day      in winter safe within his nest     he eats his winter store with zest     and takes his young ones to his breast     chapter xiv  the great stikeen divide   at about eight oclock the next morning as we were about to line up for our journey two men came romping down the trail carrying packs on their backs and taking long strides they were hitting the high places in the scenery and seemed to be entirely absorbed in the work i hailed them and they turned out to be two young men from duluth minnesota they were without hats very brown very hairy and very much disgusted with the country  for an hour we discussed the situation they were the first white men we had met on the entire journey almost the only returning footsteps and were able to give us a little information of the trail but only for a distance of about forty miles beyond this they had not ventured  we left our outfits back here on a little lakemaybe you saw our indian guideand struck out ahead to see if we could find those splendid prairies they were telling us about where the caribou and the moose were so thick you couldnt miss em weve been forty miles up the trail its all a climb and the very worst yet youll come finally to a high snowy divide with nothing but mountains on every side there is no prairie its all a lie and were going back to hazleton to go around by way of skagway have you any idea where we are  why certainly were in british columbia  but where on what stream  oh that is a detail i replied i consider the little camp on which we are camped one of the headwaters of the nasse but were not on the telegraph trail at all were more nearly in line with the old dease lake trail  why is it do you suppose that the roadgang ahead of us havent left a single sign not even a word as to where we are  maybe they cant write said my partner  perhaps they dont know where they are at themselves said i  well thats exactly the way it looks to me  are there any outfits ahead of us  yes old bob borlans about two days up the slope with his train of mules working like a slave to get through theyre all getting short of grub and losing a good many horses youll have to work your way through with great care or youll lose a horse or two in getting from here to the divide  well this wont do solong boys said one of the young fellows and they started off with immense vigor followed by their handsome dogs and we lined up once more with stern faces knowing now that a terrible trail for at least one hundred miles was before us there was no thought of retreat however we had set our feet to this journey and we determined to go  after a few hours travel we came upon the grassy shore of another little lake where the bells of several outfits were tinkling merrily on the bank of a swift little river setting out of the lake a couple of tents stood and shirts were flapping from the limbs of nearby willows the owners were the man from chihuahua his partner the blacksmith and the two young men from manchester new hampshire who had started from ashcroft as markedly tenderfoot as any men could be they had been lambasted and worried into perfect efficiency as packers and trailers and were entitled to respecteven the respect of the man from chihuahua  they greeted us with jovial outcry  hullo strangers where ye think youre goin  goin crazy replied burton  you look it said bill  by god we was all sure crazy when we started on this damn trail remarked the old man he was in bad humor on account of his horses two of which were suffering from poisoning when anything touched his horses he was plum irritable  he came up to me very soberly have you any idee where were at  yeswere on the headwaters of the nasse  are we on the telegraph trail  no as near as i can make out were away to the right of the telegraph crossing  thereupon we compared maps its mighty little use to look at mapstheyre all drew by guessanby god anyway said the old fellow as he ran his grimy forefinger over the red line which represented the trail weve been a slantin hellwards ever since we crossed the skeenyi figure it were on the old dease lake trail  to this we all agreed at last but our course thereafter was by no means clear  if we took the old dease lake trail were three hundred miles from telegraph creek yitan somebodys goin to be hungry before we get in said the old trailer id like to camp here for a few days and feed up my horses but it aint safewe got o keep movin weve been on this damn trail long enough and besides grub is gittin lighter all the time  what do you think of the trail asked burton  ive been on the trail all my life he replied an i never was in such a pizen empty nocount country in my life wasnt that big divide hell did ye ever see the beat of that fer a barren no more grass than a cellar might as well camp in a cistern i wish i could lay hands on the feller that called this the prairie routetheyd sure be a dogfight right here  the old man expressed the feeling of those of us who were too shy and delicate of speech to do it justice and we led him on to most satisfying blasphemy of the land and the roadgang  yes theres that roadgang sent out to put this trail into shapewhat have they done youd think they couldnt read or writenot a word to help us out  partner and i remained in camp all the afternoon and all the next day although our travelling companions packed up and moved out the next morning we felt the need of a days freedom from worry and our horses needed feed and sunshine  oh the splendor of the sun the fresh green grass the rippling water of the river the beautiful lake and what joy it was to see our horses feed and sleep they looked distressingly thin and poor without their saddles ladrone was still weak in the ankle joints and the arch had gone out of his neck while faithful bill who never murmured or complained had a glassy stare in his eyes the lingering effects of poisoning the wind rose in the afternoon bringing to us a sound of moaning treetops and somehow it seemed to be an augury of better thingsseemed to prophesy a fairer and dryer country to the north of us the singing of the leaves went to my heart with a hint of home and i remembered with a start how absolutely windless the sullen forest of the skeena had been  near by a dam was built across the river and a fishing trap made out of willows was set in the current piles of caribou hair showed that the indians found game in the autumn we took time to explore some old fishing huts filled with curious thingsskins toboggans dogcollars cedar ropes and many other traps of small value to anybody most curious of all we found some flintlock muskets made exactly on the models of one hundred years ago but dated 1883 it seemed impossible that guns of such ancient models should be manufactured up to the present date but there they were all carefully marked london 1883  it was a long day of rest and regeneration we took a bath in the clear cold waters of the stream washed our clothing and hung it up to dry beat the mud out of our towels and so made ready for the onward march we should have stayed longer but the ebbing away of our grub pile made us apprehensive to return was impossible     the clouds       circling the mountains the gray clouds go     heavy with storms as a mother with child     seeking release from their burden of snow     with calm slow motion they cross the wild     stately and sombre they catch and cling     to the barren crags of the peaks in the west     weary with waiting and mad for rest     the great stikeen divide       a land of mountains based in hills of fir     empty lone and cold a land of streams     whose roaring voices drown the whirr     of aspen leaves and fill the heart with dreams     of dearth and death the peaks are stern and white     the skies above are grim and gray     and the rivers cleave their sounding way     through endless forests dark as night     toward the oceans faroff line of spray     chapter xv  in the cold green mountains   the nasse river like the skeena and the stikeen rises in the interior mountains and flows in a southwesterly direction breaking through the coast range into the pacific ocean not far from the mouth of the stikeen  it is a much smaller stream than the skeena which is moreover immensely larger than the maps show we believed we were about to pass from the watershed of the nasse to the east fork of the iskoot on which those farshining prairies were said to lie with their flowery meadows rippling under the west wind if we could only reach that mystical plateau our horses would be safe from all disease  we crossed the cheweax a branch of the nasse and after climbing briskly to the northeast along the main branch we swung around over a high wooded hogback and made off up the valley along the north and lesser fork we climbed all day both of us walking leading our horses with all our goods distributed with great care over the six horses it was a beautiful day overheadthat was the only compensation we were sweaty eaten by flies and mosquitoes and covered with mud all day we sprawled over roots rocks and logs plunging into bogholes and slopping along in the running water which in places had turned the trail into an aqueduct the men from duluth had told no lie  after crawling upward for nearly eight hours we came upon a little patch of bluejoint on the high side of the hill and there camped in the gloom of the mossy and poisonous forest by hard and persistent work we ticked off nearly fifteen miles and judging from the stream which grew ever swifter we should come to a divide in the course of fifteen or twenty miles  the horses being packed light went along fairly well although it was a constant struggle to get them to go through the mud old ladrone walking behind me groaned with dismay every time we came to one of those terrible sloughs he seemed to plead with me oh my master dont send me into that dreadful hole  but there was no other way it must be done and so burtons sharp cry would ring out behind and our little train would go in one after the other plunging splashing groaning struggling through ladrone seeing me walk a log by the side of the trail would sometimes follow me as deftly as a cat he seemed to think his right to avoid the mud as good as mine but as there was always danger of his slipping off and injuring himself i forced him to wallow in the mud which was as distressing to me as to him  the next day we started with the determination to reach the divide there is no hope of grass so long as we remain in this forest said burton we must get above timber where the sun shines to get any feed for our horses it is cruel but we must push them today just as long as they can stand up or until we reach the grass  nothing seemed to appall or disturb my partner he was always ready to proceed his voice ringing out with inflexible resolution  it was one of the most laborious days of all our hard journey hour after hour we climbed steadily up beside the roaring graywhite little stream up toward the farshining snowfields which blazed back the sun like mirrors the trees grew smaller the river bed seemed to approach us until we slumped along in the running water at last we burst out into the light above timber line around us porcupines galloped and whistling marmots signalled with shrill vehemence we were weak with fatigue and wet with icy water to the knees but we pushed on doggedly until we came to a little mound of short delicious green grass from which the snow had melted on this we stopped to let the horses graze the view was magnificent and something wild and splendid came on the wind over the snowy peaks and smooth grassy mounds  we were now in the region of great snowfields under which roared swift streams from still higher altitudes there were thousands of marmots which seemed to utter the most intense astonishment at the inexplicable coming of these strange creatures the snow in the gullies had a curious bloody line which i could not account for a little bird high up here uttered a sweet little whistle so sad so full of pleading it almost brought tears to my eyes in form it resembled a horned lark but was smaller and kept very close to the ground  we reached the summit at sunset there to find only other mountains and other enormous gulches leading downward into far blue cañons it was the wildest land i have ever seen a country unmapped unsurveyed and unprospected a region which had known only an occasional indian hunter or trapper with his load of furs on his way down to the river and his canoe desolate without life green and white and flashing illimitably the gray old peaks aligned themselves rank on rank until lost in the mists of still wilder regions  from this high point we could see our friends the manchester boys on the north slope two or three miles below us at timber line weak in the knees cold and wet and hungry as we were we determined to push down the trail over the snowfields down to grass and water not much more than forty minutes later we came out upon a comparatively level spot of earth where grass was fairly good and where the windtwisted stunted pines grew in clumps large enough to furnish wood for our fires and a pole for our tent the land was meshed with roaring rills of melting snow and all around went on the incessant signalling of the marmotsthe only cheerful sound in all the wide green land  we had made about twentythree miles that day notwithstanding tremendous steeps and endless mudholes midleg deep it was the greatest test of endurance of our trip  we had the good luck to scare up a ptarmigan a sort of piebald mountain grouse and though nearly fainting with hunger we held ourselves in check until we had that bird roasted to a turn i shall never experience greater relief or sweeter relaxation of rest than that i felt as i stretched out in my down sleeping bag for twelve hours slumber  i considered that we were about one hundred and ninety miles from hazleton and that this must certainly be the divide between the skeena and the stikeen the manchester boys reported finding some very good pieces of quartz on the hills and they were all out with spade and pick prospecting though it seemed to me they showed but very little enthusiasm in the search  i blieve theres gold here said chihuahua but whos goin to stay here and look fer it in the first place you couldnt work fer morn bout three months in the year and it ud take ye the other nine months fer to git yer grub in them hills look to me to be mineralized but i aint honin to camp here  this seemed to be the general feeling of all the other prospectors and i did not hear that any one else went so far even as to dig a hole  as near as i could judge there seemed to be three varieties of varmints galloping around over the grassy slopes of this high country the largest of these a gray and brown creature with a tawny bristling mane i took to be a porcupine next in size were the giant whistlers who sat up like old men and signalled like one boy to another and last and least and more numerous than all were the smaller chucks resembling prairie dogs these animals together with the ptarmigan made up the inhabitants of these lofty slopes  i searched every green place on the mountains far and near with my fieldglasses but saw no sheep caribou or moose although one or two were reported to have been killed by others on the trail the ptarmigan lived in the matted patches of willow there were a great many of them and they helped out our monotonous diet very opportunely they moved about in pairs the cock very loyal to the hen in time of danger but not even this loyalty could save him hunger such as ours considered itself very humane in stopping short of the slaughter of the mother bird the cock was easily distinguished by reason of his partycolored plumage and his pink eyes  we spent the next forenoon in camp to let our horses feed up and incidentally to rest our own weary bones all the forenoon great gray clouds crushed against the divide behind us flinging themselves in rage against the rocks like hungry vultures baffled in their chase we exulted over their impotence we are done with you you storms of the skeenawere out of your reach at last  we were confirmed in this belief as we rode down the trail which was fairly pleasant except for short periods when the clouds leaped the snowy walls behind and scattered drizzles of rain over us later the clouds thickened the sky became completely overcast and my exultation changed to dismay and we camped at night as desolate as ever in the rain and by the side of a little marsh on which the horses could feed only by wading fetlock deep in the water we were wet to the skin and muddy and tired  i could no longer deceive myself our journey had become a grim race with the wolf our food grew each day scantier and we were forced to move each day and every day no matter what the sky or trail might be going over our food carefully that night we calculated that we had enough to last us ten days and if we were within one hundred and fifty miles of the skeena and if no accident befell us we would be able to pull in without great suffering  but accidents on the trail are common it is so easy to lose a couple of horses we were liable to delay and to accident and the chances were against us rather than in our favor it seemed as though the trail would never mend we were dropping rapidly down through dwarf pines down into endless forests of gloom again we had splashed slipped and tumbled down the trail to this point with three horses weak and sick the rain had increased and all the brightness of the morning on the high mountain had passed away for hours we had walked without a word except to our horses and now night was falling in thick cold rain as i plodded along i saw in vision and with great longing the plains whose heat and light seemed paradise by contrast  the next day was the fourth of july and such a day it rained all the forenoon cold persistent drizzling rain we hung around the campfire waiting for some letup to the incessant downpour we discussed the situation i said now if the stream in the cañon below us runs to the left it will be the east fork of the iskoot and we will then be within about one hundred miles of glenora if it runs to the right heaven only knows where we are  the horses chilled with the rain came off the sloppy marsh to stand under the trees and old ladrone edged close to the big fire to share its warmth this caused us to bring in the other horses and put them close to the fire under the big branches of the fir tree it was deeply pathetic to watch the poor worn animals all life and spirit gone out of them standing about the fire with drooping heads and halfclosed eyes perhaps they dreamed like us of the beautiful warm grassy hills of the south     the ute lover       beneath the burning brazen sky     the yellowed tepes stand     not far away a singing river     sets through the sand     within the shadow of a lonely elm tree     the tired ponies keep     the wild land throbbing with the suns hot magic     is rapt as sleep      from out a clump of scanty willows     a low wail floats     the endless repetition of a lovers     melancholy notes     so sad so sweet so elemental     all lovers pain     seems borne upon its sobbing cadence     the lovesong of the plain     from frenzied cry forever falling     to the winds wild moan     it seems the voice of anguish calling     alone alone      caught from the winds forever moaning     on the plain     wrought from the agonies of woman     in maternal pain     it holds within its simple measure     all death of joy     breathed though it be by smiling maiden     or lithe

path to sky and sun     in the cold green mountains       in the cold green mountains where the savage torrents roared     and the clouds were gray above us     and the fishing eagle soared     where no grass waved where no robins cried     there our horses starved and died     in the cold green mountains      in the cold green mountains     nothing grew but moss and trees     water dripped and sludgy streamlets     trapped our horses by the knees     where we slipped slid and lunged     mired down and wildly plunged     toward the cold green mountains     chapter xvi  the passing of the beans   at noon the rain slacking a little we determined to pack up and with such cheer as we could called out line up boysline up starting on our way down the trail  after making about eight miles we came upon a number of outfits camped on the bank of the river as i rode along on my gray horse for the trail there allowed me to ride i passed a man seated gloomily at the mouth of his tent to him i called with an assumption of jocularity i did not feel stranger where are you bound for  he replied the north pole  do you expect to get there  sure he replied  riding on i met others beside the trail and all wore a similar look of almost sullen gravity they were not disposed to joke with me and perceiving something to be wrong i passed on without further remark  when we came down to the bank of the stream behold it ran to the right and i could have sat me down and blasphemed with the rest i now understood the gloom of the others we were still in the valley of the inexorable skeena it could be nothing else this tremendous stream running to our right could be no other than the headwaters of that ferocious flood which no surveyor has located it is immensely larger and longer than any map shows  we crossed the branch without much trouble and found some beautiful bluejointgrass on the opposite bank into which we joyfully turned our horses when they had filled their stomachs we packed up and pushed on about two miles overtaking the manchester boys on the sidehill in a tract of dead burnedout timber a cheerless spot  in speaking about the surly answer i had received from the man on the banks of the river i said i wonder why those men are camped there they must have been there for several days  partner replied they are all out of grub and are waiting for some one to come by to whackup with em one of the fellows came out and talked with me and said he had nothing left but beans and tried to buy some flour of me  this opened up an entirely new line of thought i understood now that what i had taken for sullenness was the dejection of despair the way was growing gloomy and dark to them they too were racing with the wolf  we had one short moment of relief next day as we entered a lovely little meadow and camped for noon the sun shone warm the grass was thick and sweet it was like late april in the central westcool fragrant silent aisles of peaks stretched behind us and before us we were still high in the mountains and the country was less wooded and more open but we left this beautiful spot and entered again on a morass it was a day of torture to man and beast the land continued silent there were no toads no butterflies no insects of any kind except a few mosquitoes no crickets no singing thing i have never seen a land so empty of life we had left even the whistling marmots entirely behind us  we travelled now four outfits together with some twentyfive horses part of the time i led with ladrone part of the time the man from chihuahua took the lead with his fine strong bays if a horse got down we all swarmed around and lifted him out and when any question of the trail came up we held conferences of the powers  we continued for the most part up a wide mossy and grassy river bottom covered with water we waded for miles in water to our ankles crossing hundreds of deep little rivulets occasionally a horse went down into a hole and had to be snailed out and we were wet and covered with mud all day it was a new sort of trail and a terror the mountains on each side were very stately and impressive but we could pay little attention to views when our horses were miring down at every step  we could not agree about the river some were inclined to the belief that it was a branch of the stikeen the old man was sure it was skeeny we were troubled by a new sort of fly a little orangecolored fellow whose habits were similar to those of the little black fiends of the bulkley valley they were very poisonous indeed and made our ears swell up enormouslythe itching and burning was wellnigh intolerable we saw no life at all save one grouse hen guarding her young a paradise for game it seemed but no game a beautiful grassy marshy and empty land we passed over one low divide after another with immense snowy peaks thickening all around us for the first time in over two hundred miles we were all able to ride whistling marmots and grouse again abounded we had a bird at every meal the wind was cool and the sky was magnificent and for the first time in many days we were able to take off our hats and face the wind in exultation  toward night however mosquitoes became troublesome in their assaults covering the horses in solid masses strange to say none of them not even ladrone seemed to mind them in the least we felt sure now of having left the skeena forever one day we passed over a beautiful little spot of dry ground which filled us with delight it seemed as though we had reached the prairies of the pamphlets we camped there for noon and though the mosquitoes were terrific we were all chortling with joy the horses found grass in plenty and plucked up spirits amazingly we were deceived in half an hour we were in the mud again  the whole country for miles and miles in every direction was a series of high open valleys almost entirely above timber line these valleys formed the startingpoints of innumerable small streams which fell away into the iskoot on the left the stikeen on the north the skeena on the east and south these valleys were covered with grass and moss intermingled and vast tracts were flooded with water from four to eight inches deep through which we were forced to slop hour after hour and riding was practically impossible  as we were plodding along silently one day a dainty white gull came lilting through the air and was greeted with cries of joy by the weary drivers more than one of them could smell the salt water in imagination they saw this bird following the steamer up the stikeen to the first south fork thence to meet us it seemed only a short ride down the valley to the city of glenora and the postoffice  each day we drove above timber line and at noon were forced to rustle the dead dwarf pine for fire the marshes were green and filled with exquisite flowers and mosses little white and purple bells some of them the most beautiful turquoisegreen rising from tufts of verdure like mignonette i observed also a sort of crocus and some cheery little buttercups the ride would have been magnificent had it not been for the spongy sloppy marsh through which our horses toiled as it was we felt a certain breadth and grandeur in it surpassing anything we had hitherto seen our three outfits with some score of horses went winding through the wide green treeless valleys with tinkle of bells and sharp cry of drivers the trail was difficult to follow because in the open ground each man before us had to take his own course and there were few signs to mark the line the roadgang had taken  it was impossible to tell where we were but i was certain we were upon the headwaters of some one of the many forks of the great stikeen river marmots and a sort of little prairie dog continued plentiful but there was no other life the days were bright and cool resplendent with sun and rich in grass  some of the goldseekers fired a salute with shotted guns when poised on the mountain side they looked down upon a stream flowing to the northwest but the joy was shortlived the descent of this mountains side was by all odds the most terrible piece of trail we had yet found it led down the north slope and was oozy and slippery with the melting snow it dropped in short zigzags down through a grove of tangled gnarled and savage cedars and pines whose roots were like iron and filled with spurs that were sharp as chisels the horses sliding upon their haunches and unable to turn themselves in the mud crashed into the tangled pines and were in danger of being torn to pieces for more than an hour we slid and slewed through this horrible jungle of savage trees and when we came out below we had two horses badly snagged in the feet but ladrone was uninjured  we now crossed and recrossed the little stream which dropped into a deep cañon running still to the northwest after descending for some hours we took a trail which branched sharply to the northeast and climbed heavily to a most beautiful campingspot between the peaks with good grass and water and wood all around us  we were still uncertain of our whereabouts but all the boys were fairly jubilant this would be a splendid camp for a few weeks said partner  that night as the sun set in incommunicable splendor over the snowy peaks to the west the empty land seemed left behind we went to sleep with the sound of a nearby mountain stream in our ears and the voice of an eagle sounding somewhere on the high cliffs  the next day we crossed another divide and entered another valley running north being confident that this was the stikeen we camped early and put our little house up it was raining a little we had descended again to the aspens and clumps of wild roses it was good to see their lovely faces once more after our long stay in the wild cold valleys of the upper lands the whole country seemed drier and the vegetation quite different indeed it resembled some of the colorado valleys but was less barren on the bottoms there were still no insects no crickets no bugs and very few birds of any kind  all along the way on the white surface of the blazed trees were messages left by those who had gone before us some of them were profane assaults upon the roadgang others were pathetic inquiries where in hell are wehow is this for a prairie routewhat river is this anyhow to these pencillings others had added facetious replies there were also warnings and signs to help us keep out of the mud  we followed the same stream all day whether the iskoot or not we did not know the signs of lower altitude thickened wild roses met us again and strawberry blossoms starred the sunny slopes the grass was dry and ripe and the horses did not relish it after their long stay in the juicy meadows above we had been wet every day for nearly three weeks and did not mind moisture now but my shoes were rapidly going to pieces and my last pair of trousers was frazzled to the knees  nearly every outfit had lame horses like our old bay hobbling along bravely our grub was getting very light which was a good thing for the horses but we had an occasional grouse to fry and so as long as our flour held out we were well fed  it became warmer each day and some little weazened berries appeared on the hillsides the first we had seen and they tasted mighty good after months of bacon and beans we were taking some pleasure in the trip again and had it not been for the sores on our horses feet and our scant larder we should have been quite at ease our course now lay parallel to a range of peaks on our right which we figured to be the hotailub mountains this settled the question of our position on the mapwe were on the third and not the first south fork of the stikeen and were a long way still from telegraph creek     the long trail       we tunnelled miles of silent pines       dark forests where the stillness was so deep     the scared wind walked a tiptoe on the spines       and the restless aspen seemed to sleep      we threaded aisles of dripping fir       we climbed toward mountains dim and far     where snow forever shines and shines       and only winds and waters are      red streams came down from hillsides crissed and crossed       with fallen firs but on a sudden lo     a silver lakelet bound and barred       with sunsets clouds reflected far below      these lakes so lonely were so still and cool       they burned as bright as burnished steel     the shadowed pine branch in the pool       was no less vivid than the real      we crossed the great divide and saw       the sunlit valleys far below us wind     before us opened cloudless sky the raw       gray rain swept close behind      we saw great glaciers grind themselves to foam       we trod the mooses lofty home     and heard high on the yellow hills       the wildcat clamor of his ills      the way grew grimmer day by day       the weeks to months stretched on and on     and hunger kept not far away       a never failing watch at dawn      we lost all reckoning of season and of time       sometimes it seemed the bitter breeze     of icy march brought fog and rain       and next november tempests shook the trees      it was a wild and lonely ride       save the hid loons mocking cry     or marmot on the mountain side       the earth was silent as the sky      all day through sunless forest aisles       on cold dark moss our horses trod     it was so lonely there for miles and miles       the land seemed lost to god      our horses cut by rocks by brambles torn       staggered onward stiff and sore     or broken bruised and saddleworn       fell in the sloughs to rise no more      yet still we rode right on and on       and shook our clenched hands at the clouds     daring the winds of early dawn       and the dread torrent roaring loud      so long we rode so hard so far       we seemed condemned by stern decree     to ride until the morning star       should sink forever in the sea      yet now when all is past i dream       of every mountains shining cap     i long to hear again the stream       roar through the foamwhite granite gap      the pains recede the joys draw near       the splendors of great natures face     make me forget all need all fear       and the long journey grows in grace     the greeting of the roses       we had been long in mountain snow     in valleys bleak and broad and bare     where only moss and willows grow     and no bird wings the silent air     and so when on our downward way     wild roses met us we were glad     they were so girlish fair so gay     it seemed the sun had made them mad      chapter xvii  the wolves and the vultures assemble   about noon of the fiftieth day out we came down to the bank of a tremendously swift stream which we called the third south fork on a broken paddle stuck in the sand we found this notice the trail crosses here swim horses from the bar it is supposed to be about ninety miles to telegraph creeksigned the mules  we were bitterly disappointed to find ourselves so far from our destination and began once more to calculate on the length of time it would take us to get out of the wilderness  partner showed me the floursack which he held in one brawny fist i believe the dern thing leaks said he and together we went over our store of food we found ourselves with an extra supply of sugar condensed cream and other things which our friends the manchester boys needed while they were able to spare us a little flour there was a tacit agreement that we should travel together and stand together accordingly we began to plan for the crossing of this swift and dangerous stream a couple of canoes were found cached in the bushes and these would enable us to set our goods across while we forced our horses to swim from a big bar in the stream above  while we were discussing these thing around our fires at night another tramper thin and weak came into camp he was a little man with a curly red beard and was exceedingly chipper and jocular for one in his condition he had been out of food for some days and had been living on squirrels groundhogs and such other small deer as he could kill and roast along his way he brought word of considerable suffering among the outfits behind us reporting the dutchman to be entirely out of beans and flour while others had lost so many of their horses that all were in danger of starving to death in the mountains  as he warmed up on coffee and beans he became very amusing  he was hairy and ragged but neat and his face showed a certain delicacy of physique he too was a marked example of the craze to get somewhere where gold is he broke off suddenly in the midst of his story to exclaim with great energy i want to do two things go back and get my boy away from my wife and break the back of my brotherinlaw he made all the trouble  once and again he said im going to find the gold up here or lay my bones on the hills  in the midst of these intense phrases he whistled gayly or broke off to attend to his cooking he told of his hard experiences with pride and joy and said isnt it lucky i caught you just here and seemed willing to talk all night  in the morning i went over to the campfire to see if he were still with us he was sitting in his scanty bed before the fire mending his trousers ive just got to put a patch on right now or my kneell be through he explained he had a neat little kit of materials and everything was in order i havent time to turn the edges of the patch under he went on it ought to be doneyou cant make a durable patch unless you do this housewife my wife made me when we was first married i was peddlin then in eastern oregon if it hadnt been for her brotheroh ill smash his face in some dayhe held up the other trouser leg see that patch aint that a daisythats the way i ought to do say looks like i ought to rustle enough grub out of all these outfits to last me into glenora dont it  we came down gracefullywe could not withstand such prattle the blacksmith turned in some beans the boys from manchester divided their scanty store of flour and bacon i brought some salt some sugar and some oatmeal and as the small man put it away he chirped and chuckled like a cricket his thanks were mere words his voice was calm he accepted our aid as a matter of course no perfectly reasonable man would ever take such frightful chances as this absurd little ass set his face to without fear he hummed a little tune as he packed his outfit into his shoulderstraps i ought to rattle into glenora on this grub hadnt i he said  at last he was ready to be ferried across the river which was swift and dangerous burton set him across and as he was about to depart i gave him a letter to post and a halfdollar to pay postage my name was written on the corner of the envelope he knew me then and said ive a good mind to stay right with you im something of a writer myself  i hastened to say that he could reach glenora two or three days in advance of us for the reason that we were bothered with a lame horse in reality we were getting very short of provisions and were even then on rations i think youll overtake the borland outfit i said if you dont and you need help camp by the road till we come up and well all share as long as theres anything to share but you are in good trim and have as much grub as we have so youd better spin along  he hit the trail with a hearty joy that promised well and i never saw him again his cheery smile and unshrinking cheek carried him through a journey that appalled old packers with tents plenty of grub and good horses to me he was simply a strongly accentuated type of the goldseekerinsanely persistent blind to all danger deaf to all warning and doomed to failure at the start  the next day opened cold and foggy but we entered upon a hard days work burton became the chief canoeman while one of the manchester boys stripped to the undershirt sat in the bow to pull at the paddle all same siwash burtons skill and good judgment enabled us to cross without losing so much as a buckle some of our poor lame horses had a hard struggle in the icy current at about 4 pm we were able to line up in the trail on the opposite side we pressed on up to the higher valleys in hopes of finding better feed and camped in the rain about two miles from the ford the wind came from the northwest with a suggestion of autumn in its uneasy movement the boys were now exceedingly anxious to get into the gold country they began to feel most acutely the passing of the summer in the camp at night the talk was upon the condition of telegraph creek and the teslin lake trail  rain rain rain it seemed as though no day could pass without rain and as i woke i heard the patter of fine drops on our tent roof the old man cursed the weather most eloquently expressing the general feeling of the whole company however we saddled up and pushed on much delayed by the lame horses  at about twelve oclock i missed my partners voice and looking about saw only two of the packhorses following hitching those beside the trail i returned to find burton seated beside the lame horse which could not cross the slough i examined the horses foot and found a thin stream of arterial blood spouting out  that ends it burton i said i had hoped to bring all my horses through but this old fellow is out of the race it is a question now either of leaving him beside the trail with a notice to have him brought forward or of shooting him out of hand  to this partner gravely agreed but said its going to be pretty hard lines to shoot that faithful old chap  yes i replied i confess i havent the courage to face him with a rifle after all these weeks of faithful service but it must be done you remember that horse back there with a hole in his flank and his head flung up we mustnt leave this old fellow to be a prey to the wolves now if youll kill him you can set your price on the service anything at all i will pay did you ever kill a horse  partner was honest yes once he was old and sick and i believed it better to put him out of his suffering than to let him drag on  that settles it partner said i your hands are already imbued with goreit must be done  he rose with a sigh all right lead him out into the thicket  i handed him the gun into which i had shoved two steeljacketed bullets the kind that will kill a grizzly bear and took the old horse by the halter come boy i said its hard but its the only merciful thing the old horse looked at me with such serene trust and confidence my courage almost failed me his big brown eyes were so full of sorrow and patient endurance with some urging he followed me into the thicket a little aside from the trail turning away i mounted ladrone in order that i might not see what happened there was a crack of a rifle in the bushthe sound of a heavy body falling and a moment later burton returned with a coiled rope in his hand and a look of trouble on his face the horses lined up again with one empty place and an extra saddle topping the ponys pack it was a sorrowful thing to do but there was no better way as i rode on looking back occasionally to see that my train was following my heart ached to think of the toil the poor old horse had undergoneonly to meet death in the bush at the hands of his master  relieved of our wounded horse we made good time and repassed before nine oclock several outfits that had overhauled us during our trouble we rose higher and higher and came at last into a grassy country and to a series of small lakes which were undoubtedly the source of the second fork of the stikeen but as we had lost so much time during the day we pushed on with all our vigor for a couple of hours and camped about nine oclock of a beautiful evening with a magnificent sky arching us as if with a prophecy of better times ahead  the horses were now travelling very light and our food supply was reduced to a few pounds of flour and breadwe had no game and no berries beans were all gone and our bacon reduced to the last shred we had come to expect rain every day of our lives and were feeling a little the effects of our scanty diet of bread and baconhillclimbing was coming to be laborious however the way led downward most of the time and we were able to rack along at a very good pace even on an empty stomach  during the latter part of the second day the trail led along a high ridge a sort of hogback overlooking a small river valley on our left and bringing into view an immense blue cañon far ahead of us there lies the stikeen i called to burton were on the second south fork which we follow to the stikeen thence to the left to telegraph creek i began to compose doggerel verses to express our exultation  we were very tired and glad when we reached a campingplace we could not stop on this high ridge for lack of water although the feed was very good we were forced to plod on and on until we at last descended into the valley of a little stream which crossed our path the ground had been much trampled but as rain was falling and darkness coming on there was nothing to do but camp  out of our last bit of bacon grease and bread and tea we made our supper while we were camping the wild dutchman a stalwart young fellow we had seen once or twice on the trail came by with a very sour visage he went into camp near and came over to see us he said i haint had no pread for more dan a veek ive nuttin put peans if you can let me haf a biscuit by gott how goot dat vould taste  i yielded up a small loaf and encouraged him as best i could as i figure it we are within thirtyfive miles of telegraph creek ive kept a careful diary of our travel if weve passed over the dease lake trail which is probably about four hundred miles from hazleton to glenora we must be now within thirtyfive miles of telegraph creek  i was not half so sure of this as i made him think but it gave him a great deal of comfort and he went off very much enlivened  sunday and no sun it was raining when we awoke and the mosquitoes were stickier than ever our grub was nearly gone our horses thin and weak and the journey uncertain all ill things seemed to assemble like vultures to do us harm the world was a grim place that day it was a question whether we were not still on the third south fork instead of the second south fork in which case we were at least one hundred miles from our supplies if we were forced to cross the main stikeen and go down on the other side it might be even farther  the men behind us were all suffering and some of them were sure to have a hard time if such weather continued at the same time i felt comparatively sure of our ground  we were ragged dirty lame unshaven and unshornwe were fighting from morning till night the trail became more discouraging each moment that the rain continued to fall there was little conversation even between partner and myself for many days we had moved in perfect silence for the most part though no gloom or sullenness appeared in burtons face we were now lined up once more taking the trail without a word save the sharp outcry of the drivers hurrying the horses forward or the tinkle of the bells on the lead horse of the train     the vulture       he wings a slow and watchful flight     his neck is bare his eyes are bright     his plumage fits the starless night      he sits at feast where cattle lie     withering in ashen alkali     and gorges till he scarce can fly      but he is kingly on the breeze     on rigid wing in careless ease     a soundless bark on viewless seas     piercing the purple storm cloud he makes     the sun his neighbor and shakes     his wrinkled neck in mock dismay     and swings his slow contemptuous way     above the hot red lightnings play      monarch of cloudlandyet a ghoul of prey     campfires   1 popple      a river curves like a bended bow     and over it

a loveless childless man     before the morning light began     chapter xviii  at last the stikeen   about the middle of the afternoon of the fiftyeighth day we topped a low divide and came in sight of the stikeen river our hearts thrilled with pleasure as we looked far over the deep blue and purplegreen spread of valley dim with mist in which a little silver ribbon of water could be seen  after weeks of rain as if to make amend for useless severity the sun came out a fresh westerly breeze sprang up and the sky filled with glowing clouds flooded with tender light the bloom of fireweed almost concealed the devastation of flame in the fallen firs and the grim forest seemed a royal road over which we could pass as over a carpetwinter seemed far away  but all this was delusion beneath us lay a thousand quagmires the forest was filled with impenetrable jungles and hidden streams ridges sullen and silent were to be crossed and the snow was close at hand across this valley an eagle might sweep with joy but the pack trains must crawl in mud and mire through long hours of torture we spent but a moment here and then with grim resolution called out line up boys line up and struck down upon the last two days of our long journey  on the following noon we topped another rise and came unmistakably in sight of the stikeen river lying deep in its rocky cañon we had ridden all the morning in a pelting rain slashed by wet trees plunging through bogs and sliding down ravines and when we saw the valley just before us we raised a cheer it seemed we could hear the hotel bells ringing far below  but when we had tumbled down into the big cañon near the waters edge we found ourselves in scarcely better condition than before we were trapped with no feed for our horses and no way to cross the river which was roaring mad by reason of the heavy rains a swift and terrible flood impossible to swim men were camped all along the bank out of food like ourselves and ragged and worn and weary they had formed a little street of camps borland the leader of the big mule train was there calm and efficient as ever the wilson outfit the man from chihuahua throwmefeet and the manchester boys were also included in the group the dutchman came sliding down just behind us  after a scanty dinner of bacon grease and bread we turned our horses out on the flat by the river and joined the little village borland said weve been here for a day and a half tryin to induce that damn ferryman to come over and now were waitin for reënforcements lets try it again numbers will bring em  thereupon we marched out solemnly upon the bank some ten or fifteen of us and howled like a pack of wolves  for two hours we clamored alternating the ute warwhoop with the swiss yodel it was truly cacophonous but it produced results minute figures came to the brow of the hill opposite and looked at us like cautious cockroaches and then went away at last two shadowy beetles crawled down the zigzag trail to the ferryboat and began bailing her out ultimately three men sweating scared and tremulous swung a clumsy scow upon the sand at our feet it was no childs play to cross that stream together with one of the little dutchmen and a representation from the mule outfit i stepped into the boat and it was swung off into the savage swirl of gray water we failed of landing the first time i did not wonder at the ferrymans nervousness as i felt the heave and rush of the whirling savage flood  at the ratty little town of telegraph creek we purchased beans at fifteen cents a pound bacon at thirtyfive cents and flour at ten cents and laden with these necessaries hurried back to the hungry hordes on the opposite side of the river that night the little dutchman did nothing but cook and eat to make up for lost time every face wore a smile  the next morning burton and one or two other men from the outfits took the horses back up the trail to find feed while the rest of us remained in camp to be ready for the boats late in the afternoon we heard far down the river a steamer whistling for telegraph creek and everybody began packing truck down to the river where the boat was expected to land word was sent back over the trail to the boys herding the horses and every man was in a tremor of apprehension lest the herders should not hear the boat and bring the horses down in time to get off on it  it was punishing work packing our stuff down the sloppy path to the river bank but we buckled to it hard and in the course of a couple of hours had all snug and ready for embarkation  there was great excitement among the outfits and every man was hurrying and worrying to get away it was known that charges would be high and each of us felt in his pocket to see how many dollars he had left the steamboat company had us between fire and water and could charge whatever it pleased some of the poor prospectors gave up their last dollar to cross this river toward which they had journeyed so long  the boys came sliding down the trail wildly excited driving the horses before them and by 530 we were all packed on the boat one hundred and twenty horses and some two dozen men we were a seedy and careworn lot in vivid contrast with the smartly uniformed purser of the boat the rates were exorbitant but there was nothing to do but to pay them however borland and i acting as committee brought such pressure to bear upon the purser that he threw in a dinner and there was a joyous rush for the table when this good news was announced for the first time in nearly three months we were able to sit down to a fairly good meal with clean nice tableware with pie and pudding to end the meal it seemed as though we had reached civilization the boat was handsomely built and quite new and capacious too for it held our horses without serious crowding i was especially anxious about ladrone but was able to get him into a very nice place away from the engines and in no danger of being kicked by a vicious mule  we drifted down the river past telegraph creek without stopping and late at night laid by at glenora and unloaded in the crisp cool dusk as we came off the boat with our horses we were met by a crowd of cynical loafers who called to us out of the dark what in hell you fellows think youre doing we were regarded as wildly insane for having come over so long and tedious a route  we erected our tents and went into camp beside our horses on the bank near the dock it was too late to move farther that night we fed our beasts upon hay at five cents a poundpoor hay at thatand they were forced to stand exposed to the searching river wind  as for ourselves we were filled with dismay by the hopeless dulness of the town instead of being the hustling rushing gold camp we had expected to find it came to light as a little town of tents and shanties filled with men who had practically given up the teslin lake route as a bad job the government trail was incomplete the wagon road only built halfway and the railroadof which we had heard so much talkhad been abandoned altogether  as i slipped the saddle and bridle from ladrone next day and turned him out upon the river bottom for a two weeks rest my heart was very light the long trail was over no more mud rocks stumps and roots for ladrone away the other poor animals streamed down the trail many of them lame all of them poor and weak and some of them still crazed by the poisonous plants of the cold green mountains through which they had passed  this ended the worst of the toil the torment of the trail it had no dangers but it abounded in worriments and disappointments as i look back upon it now i suffer because i see my horses standing ankledeep in water on barren marshes or crowding round the fire chilled and weak in endless rain if our faces looked haggard and worn it was because of the never ending anxiety concerning the faithful animals who trusted in us to find them food and shelter otherwise we suffered little slept perfectly dry and warm every night and ate three meals each day true the meals grew scanty and monotonous but we did not go hungry  the trail was a disappointment to me not because it was long and crossed mountains but because it ran through a barren monotonous silent gloomy and rainy country it ceased to interest me it had almost no wild animal life which i love to hear and see its lakes and rivers were for the most part cold and sullen and its forests sombre and depressing the only pleasant places after leaving hazleton were the high valleys above timber line they were magnificent although wet and marshy to traverse  as a route to reach the gold fields of teslin lake and the yukon it is absurd and foolish it will never be used again for that purpose should mines develop on the high divides between the skeena iskoot and stikeen it may possibly be used again from hazleton otherwise it will be given back to the indians and their dogs     the footstep in the desert       a man put love forth from his heart       and rode across the desert far away     woman shall have no place nor part       in my lone life men heard him say     he rode right on the level rim       of the barren plain grew low and wide     it seemed to taunt and beckon him       to ride right on and fiercely ride      one day he rode a wellworn path       and lo even in that far land     he saw and cursed in gusty wrath       a womans footprint in the sand     sharply he drew the swinging rein       and hanging from his saddle bow     gazed long and silentlycursed again       then turned as if to go      for love will seize you at the end       fear lonelinessfear sickness too     for they will teach you wisdom friend       yet he rode on as madmen do     he built a cabin by a sounding stream       he digged in cañons dark and deep     and ever the waters caused a dream       and the face of woman broke his sleep      it was a slender little mark       and the man had lived alone so long     within the cañons noise and dark       the footprint moved him like a song     it spoke to him of women in the east       of girls in silken robes with shining hair     and talked of those who sat at feast       while sweeteyed laughter filled the air      and more a hundred visions rose       he saw his mothers knotted hands     ply round thickknitted homely hose       her thoughts with him in desert lands     a smiling wife in bib and cap       moved busily from chair to chair     or sat with apples in her lap       content with sweet domestic care      all these his curse had put away       all these were his no more to hold     he had his cañon cold and gray       he had his little heaps of gold      chapter xix  the goldseekers camp at glenora   glenora like telegraph creek was a village of tents and shacks previous to the opening of the year it had been an old hudson bay tradingpost at the head of navigation on the stikeen river but during april and may it had been turned into a swarming camp of goldseekers on their way to teslin lake by way of the muchadvertised stikeen route to the yukon  a couple of months before our arrival nearly five thousand people had been encamped on the river flat but one disappointment had followed another the government road had been abandoned the pack trail had proved a menace and as a result the camp had thinned away and when we of the long trail began to drop into town glenora contained less than five hundred people including tradesmen and mechanics  the journey of those who accompanied me on the long trail was by no means ended it was indeed only half done there remained more than one hundred and seventy miles of pack trail before the head of navigation on the yukon could be reached i turned aside my partner went on  in order to enter the headwaters of the pelly it was necessary to traverse four hundred miles of trail over which a years provision for each man must be carried food was reported to be a dollar a pound at teslin lake and winter was coming on to set face toward any of these regions meant the most careful preparation or certain death  the weather was cold and bleak and each night the boys assembled around the big campfire to discuss the situation they reported the country full of people eager to get away everybody seemed studying the problem of what to do and how to do it some were for going to the headwaters of the pelly others advocated the nisutlin and others still thought it a good plan to prospect on the headwaters of the tooya from which excellent reports were coming in  hour after hour they debated argued and agreed in the midst of it all burton remained cool and unhurried sitting in our tent which flapped and quivered in the sounding southern wind we discussed the question of future action i determined to leave him here with four of the horses and a thousand pounds of grub with which to enter the gold country for my partner was a miner not a literary man  it had been my intention to go with him to teslin lake there to build a boat and float down the river to dawson but i was six weeks behind my schedule the trail was reported to be bad and the water in the hotalinqua very low making boating slow and hazardous therefore i concluded to join the stream of goldseekers who were pushing down toward the coast to go in by way of skagway  there was a feeling in the air on the third day after going into camp which suggested the coming of autumn some of the boys began to dread the desolate north out of which the snows would soon begin to sweep it took courage to set face into that wild land with winter coming on and yet many of them were ready to do it the manchester boys and burton formed a sidepartnership and faced a year of bacon and beans without visible sign of dismay  the ominous cold deepened a little every night it seemed like october as the sun went down around us on every side the mountain peaks cut the sky keen as the edge of a sword and the wind howled up the river gusty and wild  a little group of tents sprang up around our own and every day was full of quiet enjoyment we were all living very high with plenty of berries and an occasional piece of fresh beef steelhead salmon were running and were a drug in the market  the talk of the pelly river grew excited as a report came in detailing a strike and all sorts of outfits began to sift out along the trail toward teslin lake the rain ceased at last and the days grew very pleasant with the wind again in the south roaring up the river all day long with great power reminding me of the equatorial currents which sweep over illinois and wisconsin in september we had nothing now to trouble us but the question of moving out into the gold country  one by one the other misguided ones of the long trail came dropping into camp to meet the general depression and stagnation they were brown ragged longhaired and for the most part silent with dismay some of them celebrated their escape by getting drunk but mainly they were too seriousminded to waste time or substance some of them had expended their last dollar on the trail and were forced to sell their horses for money to take them out of the country some of the partnerships went to pieces for other causes longsmouldering dissensions burst into flame the swedes divided and so did the dutchman the more resolute of them keeping on the main trail while others took the trail to the coast or returned to the states  meanwhile ladrone and his fellows were rejoicing like ourselves in fairly abundant food and in continuous rest the old gray began to look a little more like his own proud self as i went out to see him he came up to me to be curried and nosed about me begging for salt his trust in me made him doubly dear and i took great joy in thinking that he at least was not doomed to freeze or starve in this savage country which has no mercy and no hope for horses  there was great excitement on the first sunday following our going into camp when the whistle of a steamer announced the coming of the mail it produced as much movement as an election or a bear fight we all ran to the bank to see her struggle with the current gaining headway only inch by inch she was a small sternwheeler not unlike the boats which run on the upper missouri we all followed her down to the hudson bay post like a lot of small boys at a circus to see her unload this was excitement enough for one day and we returned to camp feeling that we were once more in touch with civilization  among the first of those who met us on our arrival was a german who was watching some horses and some supplies in a big tent close by the river bank while pitching my tent on that first day he came over to see me and after a few words of greeting said quietly but with feeling i am glad youve come it was so lonesome here we were very busy but i think we were reasonably kind to him in the days that followed he often came over of an evening and stood about the fire and although i did not seek to entertain him i am glad to say i answered him civilly burton was even social  i recall these things with a certain degree of feeling because not less than a week later this poor fellow was discovered by one of our company swinging from the crosstree of the tent a ghastly corpse there was something inexplicable in the deed no one could account for it he seemed not to be a man of deep feeling and one of the last things he uttered in my hearing was a coarse jest which i did not like and to which i made no reply  in his pocket the coroner found a letter wherein he had written bury me right here where i failed here on the bank of the river it contained also a message to his wife and children in the states there were tragic splashes of red on the trail murder and violent death by animals and by swift waters now here at the end of the trail was a suicide      so this is the end of the trail to him     to swing at the tail of a rope and die     making a chapter gray and grim     adding a ghost to the midnight sky     he toiled for days on the icy way     he slept at night on the windswept snow     now here he hangs in the mornings gray     a grisly shape by the rivers flow  it was just two weeks later when i put the bridle and saddle on ladrone and rode him down the trail his heart was light as mine and he had gained some part of his firm proud leaping walk he had confidence in the earth once more this was the first firm stretch of road he had trod for many weeks he was now to take the boat for the outside world  there was an element of sadness in the parting between ladrone and the train he had led for so many miles as we saddled up for the last time he stood waiting the horses had fared together for ninety days they had lined up nearly two hundred times and now for the last time i called out line up boys line up heke heke  ladrone swung into the trail behind him came barney next major then sturdy bay bill and lastly nibbles the pony for the last time they were to follow their swift gray leader who was going south to live at ease while they must begin again the ascent of the trail  ladrone whinnied piteously for his mates as i led him aboard the steamer but they did not answer they were patiently waiting their masters signal never again would they set eyes on the stately gray leader who was bound to most adventurous things never again would they see the green grass come on the hills  i had a feeling that i could go on living this way leading a pack train across the country indefinitely it seemed somehow as though this way of life this routine must continue i had a deep interest in the four horses and it was not without a feeling of guilt that i saw them move away on their last trail at bottom the end of every horse is tragic death comes sooner or later but death here in this country so cold and bleak and pitiless to all animals seems somehow closer more inevitable more cruel and flings over every animal the shadow of immediate tragedy there was something approaching crime in bringing a horse over that trail for a thousand miles only to turn him loose at the end or to sell him to some man who would work him to the point of death and then shoot him or turn him out to freeze  as the time came when i must return to the south and to the tame the settled the quiet i experienced a profound feeling of regret of longing for the wild and lonely i looked up at the shining green and white mountains and they allured me still notwithstanding all the toil and discomfort of the journey just completed the wind from the south damp and cool the great river gliding with rushing roar to meet the sea had a distinct and wonderful charm from which i rent myself with distinct effort     the toil of the trail       what have i gained by the toil of the trail     i know and know well     i have found once again the lore i had lost     in the loud citys hell      i have broadened my hand to the cinch and the axe     i have laid my flesh to the rain     i was hunter and trailer and guide     i have touched the most primitive wildness again      i have threaded the wild with the stealth of the deer     no eagle is freer than i     no mountain can thwart me no torrent appall     i defy the stern sky     so long as i live these joys will remain     i have touched the most primitive wildness again      chapter xx  great news at wrangell   boat after boat had come up stopped for a night and dropped down the river again carrying from ten to twenty of the goldseekers who had determined to quit or to try some other way in and at last the time had come for me to say goodby to burton and all those who had determined to keep on to teslin lake i had helped them buy and sack and weigh their supplies and they were ready to line up once more  as i led ladrone down toward the boat he called again for his fellows but only strangers made reply after stowing him safely away and giving him feed i returned to the deck in order to wave my hat to burton  in accordance with his peculiar undemonstrative temperament he stood for a few moments in silence with his hands folded behind his back then with a final wave of the hand turned on his heel and returned to his work  farewells and advice more or less jocular rang across the rail of the boat between some ten or fifteen of us who had hit the new trail and those on shore  goodby boys see you at dawson  well beat you in yet called bill dont overwork  let us know if you strike it shouted frank  all right you do the same i replied  as the boat swung out into the stream and the little group on the bank faded swiftly away i confess to a little dimness of the eyes i thought of the hardships toward which my uncomplaining partner was headed and it seemed to me nature was conspiring to crush him  the trip down the river was exceedingly interesting the stream grew narrower as we approached the coast range and became at last very dangerous for a heavy boat such as the strathcona was we were forced to lay by at last some fifty miles down on account of the terrific wind which roared in through the gap making the steering of the big boat through the cañon very difficult  at the point where we lay for the night a small creek came in steelheaded salmon were running and the creek was literally lined with bear tracks of great size as far up as we penetrated these bears are said to be a sort of brown fishing bear of enormous bulk as large as polar bears and when the salmon are spawning in the upper waters of the coast rivers they become so fat they can hardly move certainly i have never been in a country where bear signs were so plentiful the wood was an almost impassable tangle of vines and undergrowth and the thought of really finding a bear was appalling  the stikeen breaks directly through the coast range at right angles like a batteringram immense glaciers were on either side one tremendous river of ice came down on our right presenting a face wall apparently hundreds of feet in height and some miles in width i should have enjoyed exploring this glacier which is said to be one of the greatest on the coast  the next day our captain a bold and reckless man carried us through to wrangell by walking his boat over the sand bars on its paddlewheel i was exceedingly nervous because if for any reason we had become stuck in mid river it would have been impossible to feed ladrone or to take him ashore except by means of another steamer however all things worked together to bring us safely through and in the afternoon of the second day we entered an utterly different worldthe warm wet coast country the air was moist the grasses and tall ferns were luxuriant and the forest trees immense out into a sunbright bay we swept with a feeling of being in safe waters once more and roundedto about sunset at a point on the island just above a frowzy little town this was wrangell island and the town was fort wrangell one of the oldest stations on the coast  i had placed my horse under bond intending to send him through to vancouver to be taken care of by the hudson bay company he was still a canadian horse and so must remain upon the wharf over night as he was very restless and uneasy i camped down beside him on the planks  i lay for a long time listening to the waters flowing under me and looking at the grayblue sky across which stars shot like distant rockets dying out in the deeps of the heavens in silence an odious smell rose from the bay as the tide went out a seal bawled in the distance fishes flopped about in the pools beneath me and a man playing a violin somewhere in the village added a melancholy note i could hear the boys crying all about the war and ladrone continued restless and eager several times in the night when he woke me with his trampling i called to him and hearing my voice he became quiet  i took breakfast at a twentyfive cent joint where i washed out of a tin basin in an illsmelling area after breakfast i grappled with the customs man and secured the papers which made ladrone an american horse free to eat grass wherever it could be found under the stars and stripes i started immediately to lead him to pasture and this was an interesting and memorable experience  there are no streets that is to say no roads in wrangell there are no carriages and no horses not even donkeys therefore it was necessary for ladrone to walk the perilous wooden sidewalks after me this he did with all the dignity of a county judge and at last we came upon grass knee deep rich and juicy  our passage through the street created a great sensation little children ran to the gates to look upon us there goes a horsie they shouted an old man stopped me on the street and asked me where i was taking told orse i told him i had already ridden him over a thousand miles and now he was travelling with me back to gods country he looked at me in amazement and walked off tapping his forehead as a sign that i must certainly have wheels  as i watched ladrone at his feed an old indian woman came along and smiled with amiable interest at last she said pointing to the other side of the village over there muckamuck hyu muckamuck she wished to see the horse eating the best grass there was to be had on the island  a little later three or four native children came down the hill and were so amazed and so alarmed at the sight of this great beast feeding beside the walk that they burst into loud outcry and ran desperately away they were not accustomed to horses to them he was quite as savage in appearance as a polar bear  in a short time everybody in the town knew of the old gray horse and his owner i furnished a splendid topic for humorous conversation during the dull hours of the day  here again i came upon other gaunt and rustycoated men from the long trail they could be recognized at a glance by reason of their sombre faces and their undecided action they could scarcely bring themselves to such ignominious return from a fruitless trip on which they had started with so much elation and yet they hesitated about attempting any further adventure to the north mainly because their horses had sold for so little and their expenses had been so great many of them were nearly broken in the days that followed they discussed the matter in subdued voices sitting in the sun on the great wharf sombrely looking out upon the bay  on the third day a steamer came in from the north buzzing with the news of another great strike not far from skagway juneau dyea as well as skagway itself were said to be almost deserted men were leaving the white pass railway in hundreds and a number of the hands on the steamer herself had deserted under the excitement mingling with the passengers we eagerly extracted every drop of information possible no one knew much about it but they said all they knew and a good part of what they had heard and when the boat swung round and disappeared in the moonlight she left the goldseekers exultant and tremulous on the wharf  they were now aflame with desire to take part in this new stampede which seemed to be within their slender means and i being one of them and eager to see such a stampede took a final session with the customs collector and prepared to board the next boat  i arranged with duncan mckinnon to have my old horse taken care of in his lot i dug wells for him so that he should not lack for water and treated him to a dish of salt and just at sunset said goodby to him with another twinge of sadness and turned toward the wharf he looked very lonely and sad standing there with drooping head in the midst of the stumps of his pasture lot however there was plenty of feed and half a dozen men volunteered to keep an eye on him  dont worry mon said donald mclane hell be gettin fat and strong on the juicy grass whilst youre aheavin out the golddust  there were about ten of us who lined up to the pursers window of the little steamer which came along that night and purchased secondclass passage the boat was very properly named the utopia and was so crowded with other goldseekers from down the coast that we of the long trail were forced to put our beds on the floor of the little saloon in the stern of the boat which was called the social room we were all secondclass and we all lay down in rows on the carpet covering every foot of space each man rolled up in his own blankets and i was the object of considerable remark by reason of my mattress which gave me as good a bed as the vessel afforded  there was a great deal of noise on the boat and its passengers both men and women were not of the highest type there were several stowaways and some of the women were not very nice as to their actions and rightly or wrongly were treated with scant respect by the men who were loud and vulgar for the most part sleep was difficult in the turmoil  though secondclass passengers strange to say we came first at table and were very well fed the boat ran entirely inside a long row of islands and the water was smooth as a river the mountains grew each moment more splendid as we neared skagway and the ride was most enjoyable whales and sharks interested us on the way the women came to light next day and on the whole were much better than i had inferred from the two or three who were the source of disturbance the night before the men were not of much interest they seemed petty and without character for the most part  at juneau we came into a still more mountainous country and for the rest of the way the scenery was magnificent vast rivers of ice came curving down absolutely out of the clouds which hid the summits of the mountainscame curving in splendid lines down to the very waters edge the sea was chill and gray and as we entered the mouth of lynn canal a raw swift wind swept by making us shiver with cold the grim bronzegreen mountains sides formed a most impressive but forbidding scene  it was nine oclock the next morning as we swung to and unloaded ourselves upon one of the long wharves which run out from the town of skagway toward the deep water we found the town exceedingly quiet half the men had gone to the new strike stores were being tended by women some small shops were closed entirely and nearly every business firm had sent representatives into the new gold fields which we now found to be on atlin lake  it was difficult to believe that this wharf a few months before had been the scene of a bloody tragedy which involved the shooting of soapy smith the renowned robber and desperado on the contrary it seemed quite like any other town of its size in the states the air was warm and delightful in midday but toward night the piercing wind swept down from the high mountains making an overcoat necessary  a few men had returned from this new district and were full of enthusiasm concerning the prospects their reports increased the almost universal desire to have a part in the stampede the iowa boys from the long trail wasted no time but set about their own plans for getting in they expected to reach the creek by sheer force and awkwardness  they had determined to try the cutoff which left the wagon road and took off up the east fork of the skagway river nearly three hundred people had already set out on this trail and the boys felt sure of making it all rightall right though it led over a great glacier and into an unmapped region of swift streams after the telegraph trail said doc were not easily scared  it seemed to me a desperate chance and i was not ready to enter upon such a trip with only such grub and clothing as could be carried upon my back but it was the last throw of the dice for these young fellows they had very little money left and could not afford to hire pack trains but by making a swift dash into the country each hoped to get a claim how they expected to hold it or use it after they got it they were unable to say but as they were out for gold and here was a chance even though it were but the slightest chance in the world to secure a location they accepted it with the sublime audacity of youth and ignorance they saddled themselves with their packs and with a cheery wave of the hand said goodby and good luck and marched away in single file  just a week later i went round to see if any news of them had returned to their bunk house i found their names on the register they had failed one of them set forth their condition of purse and mind by writing dave walters boone iowa busted and going home     the goldseekers       i saw these dreamers of dreams go by     i trod in their footsteps a space     each marched with his eyes on the sky     each passed with a light on his face      they came from the hopeless and sad     they faced the future and gold     some the tooth of wants wolf had made mad     and some at the forge had grown old      behind them these serfs of the tool     the rags of their service had flung     no longer of fortune the fool     this word from each bearded lip rung      once more im a man i am free     no man is my master i say     tomorrow i fail it may be     no matter im freeman today      they go to a toil that is sure     to despair and hunger and cold     their sickness no warning can cure     they are mad with a longing for gold      the light will fade from each eye     the smile from each face     they will curse the impassible sky     and the earth when the snow torrents race      some will sink by the way and be laid     in the frost of the desolate earth     and some will return to a maid     empty of hand as at birth      but this out of all will remain     they have lived and have tossed     so much in the game will be gain     though the gold of the dice has been lost     chapter xxi  the rush to atlin lake   it took me longer to get under way for i had determined to take at least thirty days provisions for myself and a newspaper man who joined me here our supplies together with tent tools and clothing made a considerable outfit however in a few days we were ready to move and when i again took my place at the head of a little pack train it seemed quite in the natural order of things  we left late in the day with intent to camp at the little village of white pass which was the end of the wagon road and some twelve miles away we moved out of town along a road lined with refuse campbottoms ruined cabins tin cans and broken bottlesall the unsightly debris of the rush of may and june a part of the way had been corduroyed for which i was exceedingly grateful for the skagway river roared savagely under our feet while on either side of the roadway at other points i could see abysses of mud which in the growing darkness were sufficiently menacing  our course was a northerly one we were ascending the ever narrowing cañon of the river at a gentle grade with snowy mountains in vista we arrived at white pass at about ten oclock at night a little town is springing up there confident of being an important station on the railroad which was already built to that point  thus far the journey had been easy and simple but immediately after leaving white pass we entered upon an exceedingly stony road filled with sharp rock which had been blasted from the railway above us upon reaching the end of the wagon road and entering upon the trail we came upon the way of death the waters reeked with carrion the breeze was the breath of carrion and all nature was made indecent and disgusting by the presence of carcasses within the distance of fifteen miles we passed more than two thousand dead horses it was a cruel land a land filled with the record of mens merciless greed nature herself was cold majestic and grand the trail rough hard and rocky the horses labored hard under their heavy burdens though the floor they trod was always firm  just at the summit in the gray mist where a bulbous granite ridge cut blackly and lonesomely against the sky we overtook a flock of turkeys being driven by a onearmed man with a singularly appropriate scotch cap on his head the birds sat on the bleak gray rocks in the gathering dusk with the suggestion of being utterly at the end of the world their feathers were blown awry by the merciless wind and they looked weary disconsolate and bewildered their faint sad gobbling was like the talk of sick people lost in a desert they were on their way to dawson city to their death and they seemed to know it  we camped at the halfway house a big tent surrounded by the most diabolical landscape of high peaks lost in mist with nearby slopes of gray rocks scantily covered with yellowgreen grass all was bare wild desolate and drear the wind continued to whirl down over the divide carrying torn gray masses of vapor which cast a gloomy half light across the gruesome little meadow covered with rotting carcasses and crates of bones which filled the air with odor of disease and death  within the tent which flopped and creaked in the wind we huddled about the cookstove in the light of a lantern listening to the loud talk of a couple of packers who were discussing their business with enormous enthusiasm happily they grew sleepy at last and peace settled upon us i unrolled my sleeping bag and slept dreamlessly until the russian nobleman who did the cooking waked me  morning broke bleak and desolate mysterious clouds which hid the peaks were still streaming wildly down the cañon we got away at last leaving behind us that sad little meadow and its gruesome lakes and began the slow and toilsome descent over slippery ledges of rock among endless rows of rotting carcasses over poisonous streams and through desolate firemarked and ghastly forests of small pines everywhere were the traces of the furious flood of humankind that had broken over this height in the early spring wreckage of sleighs abandoned tackle heaps of camp refuse clothing and most eloquent of all the pathway itself worn into the pitiless iron ledges made it possible for me to realize something of the scene  down there in the gully on the sullen drift of snow the winter trail could still be seen like an unclean ribbon and here where the shrivelled hides of horses lay thick wound the summer pathway up yonder summit lockstepped like a file of convicts with tongues protruding and breath roaring from their distended throats thousands of men had climbed with killing burdens on their backs mad to reach the great inland river and the gold belt like the men of the long trail they too had no time to find the gold under their feet  it was terrible to see how on every slippery ledge the ranks of horses had broken like waves to fall in heaps like rows of seaweed tumbled contorted and grinning their dried skins had taken on the color of the soil so that i sometimes set foot upon them without realizing what they were many of them had saddles on and nearly all had leadropes some of them had even been tied to trees and left to starve  in all this could be read the merciless greed and impracticability of these goldseekers men who had never driven a horse in their lives and had no idea what an animal could do or what he required to eat loaded their outfits upon some poor patient beast and drove him without feed until weakened and insecure of foot he slipped and fell on some one of these cruel ledges of flinty rock  the business of packing however had at last fallen into less cruel or at least more judicial hands and though the trail was filled with long pack trains going and coming they were for the most part well taken care of we met many long trains of packhorses returning empty from bennett lake they were followed by shouting drivers who clattered along on packhorses wherever the trail would permit  one train carried four immense trunksjust behind the trunks mounted astride of one of the best horses rode a boldfaced handsome white woman followed by a huge negress the white woman had made her pile by dancing a shameless dance in the dissolute dens of dawson city and was on her way to paris or new york for a good time the reports of the hotel keepers made her out to be unspeakably vile the negress was quite decent by contrast  at log cabin we came in sight of the british flag which marks the boundary line of united states territory where a camp of mounted police and the british customs officer are located it was a drear season even in midsummer a land of naked ledges and cold white peaks a few small pine trees furnished logs for the cabins and wood for their fires the government offices were located in tents  i found the officers most courteous and the customs fair the treatment given me at log cabin was in marked contrast with the exactions of my own government at wrangell all goods were unloaded before the inspectors tent and quickly examined the miner suffered very little delay  a number of badly maimed packhorses were running about on the american side i was told that the police had stopped them by reason of their sore backs if a man came to the line with horses overloaded or suffering he was made to strip the saddles from their backs  you cant cross this line with animals like that was the stern sentence in many cases this humanity as unexpected as it was pleasing deserves the best word of praise of which i am capable  at last we left behind us all these wrecks of horseflesh these poisonous streams and came down upon lake bennett where the water was considered safe to drink and where the eye could see something besides deathspotted ledges of savage rocks  the town was a double row of tents and log huts set close to the beach whereon boats were building and saws and hammers were uttering a cheerful chorus long trains of packhorses filled the streets the wharfs swarmed with men loading chickens pigs vegetables furniture boxes of drygoods stoves and every other conceivable domestic utensil into big square barges which were rigged with tall strong masts bearing most primitive sails it was a busy scene but of course very quiet as compared with the activity of may june and july  these barges appealed to me very strongly they were in some cases floating homes a combination of movers wagon and river boat many of them contained women and children with accompanying cats and canary birds in every face was a look of exultant faith in the venture they were bound for dawson city the men for atlin were setting forth in rowboats or were waiting for the little steamers which had begun to ply between bennett city and the new gold fields  i set my little tent which was about as big as a dog kennel and crawled into it early in order to be shielded from the winds which grew keen as sword blades as the sun sank behind the western mountains the sky was like november and i wondered where burton was encamped i would have given a great deal to have had him with me on this trip      the coast range of alaska       the wind roars up from the angry sea     with a message of warning and haste to me     it bids me go where the asters blow     and the sunflower waves in the sunset glow     from the granite mountains the glaciers crawl     in snowwhite spray the waters fall     the bay is white with the crested waves     and ever the sea wind ramps and raves      i hate this cold bleak northern land     i fear its snowflecked harborless strand     i fly to the south as a homing dove     back to the land of corn i love     and never again shall i set my feet     where the snow and the sea and the mountains meet      chapter xxii  atlin lake and the gold fields   there is nothing drearier than camping on the edge of civilization like this where one is surrounded by ill smells invaded by streams of foul dust and deprived of wood and clear water i was exceedingly eager to get away especially as the wind continued cold and very searching it was a long dull day of waiting  at last the boat came in and we trooped aboarda queer mixture of men and bundles the boat itself was a mere scow with an upright engine in the centre and a sternwheel tacked on the outside there were no staterooms of course and almost no bunks the interior resembled a lumbermans shanty  we moved off towing a big scow laden with police supplies for tagish house the wind was very high and pushed steadily behind or we would not have gone faster than a walk we had some eight or ten passengers all bound for the new gold fields and these together with their baggage and tools filled the boat to the utmost corner the feeling of elation among these men reminded me of the great land boom of dakota in 1883 in which i took a part there was something fine and free and primitive in it all  we cooked our supper on the boats stove furnishing our own food from the supplies we were taking in with us the ride promised to be very fine we made off down the narrow lake which lies between two walls of high bleak mountains but far in the distance more alluring ranges arose there was no sign of mineral in the nearby peaks  late in the afternoon the wind became so high and the captain of our boat so timid we were forced to lay by for the night and so swung around under a point seeking shelter from the wind which became each moment more furious i made my bed down on the roof of the boat and went to sleep looking at the drifting clouds overhead once or twice during the night when i awoke i heard the howling blast sweeping by with increasing power  all the next day we loitered on bennett lakethe wind roaring without ceasing and the whitecaps running like hares we drifted at last into a cove and there lay in shelter till six oclock at night the sky was clear and the few clouds were gloriously bright and cool and fleecy  we met several canoes of goldseekers on their return who shouted doleful warnings at us and cursed the worthlessness of the district to which we were bound they all looked exceedingly dirty ragged and sour of visage at the same time however boat after boat went sailing down past us on their way to atlin and dawson they drove straight before the wind and for the most part experienced little danger all of which seemed to us to emphasize the unnecessary timidity of our own captain  there was a charm in this wild spot but we were too impatient to enjoy it there were men on board who felt that they were being cheated of a chance to get a gold mine and when the wind began to fall we fired up and started down the lake as deep night came on i made my bed on the roof again and went to sleep with the flying sparks lining the sky overhead i was in some danger of being set on fire but i preferred sleeping there to sleeping on the floor inside the boat where the reek of tobacco smoke was sickening  when i awoke we were driving straight up tagish lake a beautiful clear green and blue spread of rippling water with lofty and boldly outlined peaks on each side the lake ran from southeast to northwest and was much larger than any map shows we drove steadily for ten hours up this magnificent water with ever increasing splendor of scenery arriving about sunset at taku city which we found to be a little group of tents at the head of taku arm  innumerable boats of every design fringed the shore men were coming and men were going producing a bewildering clash of opinions with respect to the value of the mines a few of these to whom we spoke said its all a fake and others were equally certain it was all right  a short portage was necessary to reach atlin lake and taking a part of our baggage upon our shoulders we hired the remainder packed on horses and within an hour were moving up the smooth path under the small black pines across the low ridge which separates the two lakes at the top of this ridge we were able to look out over the magnificent spread of atlin lake which was more beautiful in every way than tagish or taku it is in fact one of the most beautiful lakes i have ever seen  far to the southeast it spread until it was lost to view among the bases of the gigantic glacierladen mountains of the coast range to the leftthat is to the northit seemed to divide enclosing a splendid domeshaped solitary mountain one fork moving to the east the other to the west its end could not be determined by the eye in either direction its width was approximately about ten miles  at the end of the trail we found an enterprising canadian with a naphtha launch ready to ferry us across to atlin city but were forced to wait for some one who had gone back to taku for a second load  while we were waiting the engineer who was a roundfaced and rather green boy fell under the influences of a large plump and very talkative lady who made the portage just behind us she so absorbed and fascinated the lad that he let the engine run itself into some cramp of piston or wheel there was a sudden crunching sound and the propeller stopped the boy minimized the accident but the captain upon arrival told us it would be necessary to unload from the boat while the engine was being repaired  it was now getting dark and as it was pretty evident that the repairs on the boat would take a large part of the night we camped where we were the talkative lady whom the irreverent called the glass front occupied a tent which belonged to the captain of the launch and the rest of us made our beds down under the big trees  a big fire was built and around this we sat doing more or less talking there was an old tennesseean in the party from dawson who talked interminably he told us of his troubles trials and victories in dawson how he had been successful how he had fallen ill and how his life had been saved by a good old miner who gave him an opportunity to work over his dump sick as he was he was able in a few days to find gold enough to take him out of the country to a doctor he was now on his way back to his claim and professed to be very sceptical of atlin and every other country except dawson  the plump lady developed exceedingly kittenish manners late in the evening and invited the whole company to share her tent a singular type of woman capable of most ladylike manners and having astonishingly sensible moments but inexpressibly silly most of the time she was really a powerful selfconfident and shrewd woman but preferred to seem young and helpless altogether the company was sufficiently curious there was a young civil engineer from new york city a land boomer from skagway an irishman from juneau a representative of a new york paper one or two nondescripts from the states and one or two prospectors from quebec the night was cold and beautiful and my partner and i by going sufficiently far away from the old tennesseean and the plump lady were able to sleep soundly until sunrise  the next morning we hired a large unpainted skiff and by working very hard ourselves in addition to paying full fare we reached camp at about ten oclock in the morning atlin city was also a clump of tents half hidden in the trees on the beach of the lake near the mouth of pine creek the lake was surpassingly beautiful under the morning sun  a crowd of sullen profane and grimy men were lounging around cursing the commissioners and the police the beach was fringed with rowboats and canoes like a new england fishing village and all day long men were loading themselves into these boats hungry tired and weary hastening back to skagway or the coast while others fresh buoyant and hopeful came gliding in  to those who came the sullen and disappointed ones who were about to go uttered approbrious cries see the damn fools come what dyou think youre doin on a fishin excursion  we went into camp on the water front and hour after hour men laden with packs tramped ceaselessly to and fro along the pathway just below our door i was now chief cook and bottle washer my partner who was entirely unaccustomed to work of this kind having the status of a boarder  the lake was a constant joy to us as the sun sank the glacial mountains to the southwest became most royal in their robes of purple and silver the sky filled with crimson and saffron clouds which the lake reflected like a mirror the little rocky islands drowsed in the mist like some strange monsters sleeping on the bosom of the water the men were filthy and profane for the most part and made enjoyment of nature almost impossible many of them were of the rudest and most uninteresting types nomadsalmost tramps they had nothing of the epic qualities which belong to the mountaineers and natural miners of the rocky mountains many of them were loafers and neerdowells from skagway and other towns of the coast  we had a gold pan a spade and a pick therefore early the next morning we flung a little pack of grub over our shoulders and set forth to test the claims which were situated upon pine creek a stream which entered lake atlin near the camp it was said to be eighteen miles long and discovery claim was some eight miles up  we traced our way up the creek as far as discovery and back panning dirt at various places with resulting colors in some cases the trail was full of men racking to and fro with heavy loads on their backs they moved in little trains of four or five or six men some going out of the country others coming inabout an equal number each way everything along the creek was staked and our test work resulted in nothing more than gaining information with regard to what was going on  the camps on the hills at night swarmed with men in hot debate the majority believed the camps to be a failure and loud discussions resounded from the trees as partner and i sat at supper the townsite men were very nervous the camps were decreasing in population and the tone was one of general foreboding  the campfires flamed all along the lake walk and the talk of each group could be overheard by any one who listened altercations went on with clangorous fury almost every party was in division some enthusiastic individual had made a find or had seen some one else who had his cackle reached other groups and out of the dark hulking figures loomed to listen or to throw in hot missiles of profanity phrases multiplied mingling inextricably  morgan claims thirty cents to the pan  good creek claim  his sluice is about ready  a cleanup last night  i dont believe it no sir i wouldnt give a hundred dollars for the whole damn moose pasture well its good enough for me i tell you its rotten the whole damn cheese youve got to stand in with the police or you cant get and so on and on unendingly without coherence i went to sleep only when the sound of the wordy warfare died away  i permitted myself a day of rest borrowing a boat next day we went out upon the water and up to the mouth of pine creek where we panned some dirt to amuse ourselves the lake was like liquid glass the bottom visible at an enormous depth it made me think of the marvellous water of mcdonald lake in the kalispels i steered the boat with a longhandled spade and so was able to look about me and absorb at ease the wonderful beauty of this unbroken and unhewn wilderness the clouds were resplendent and in every direction the lake vistas were ideally beautiful and constantly changing  toward night the sky grew thick and heavy with clouds the water of the lake was like molten jewels ruby and amethyst the boat seemed floating in some strange ethereal substance hitherto unknown to mantranslucent and iridescent the mountains loomed like dim purple pillars at the western gate of the world and the rays of the halfhidden sun plunging athwart these sentinels sank deep into the shining flood later the sky cleared and the inverted mountains in the lake were scarcely less vivid than those which rose into the sky  the next day i spent with gold pan and camera working my way up spruce creek a branch of pine i found men cheerily at work getting out sluice boxes and digging ditches i panned everywhere but did not get much in the way of colors but the creek seemed to grow better as i went up and promised very rich returns i came back rushing making five miles just inside an hour hungry and tired  the crowded camp thinned out the fainthearted ones who had no courage to sweat for gold sailed away others went out upon their claims to build cabins and lay sluices i found them whipsawing lumber building cabins and digging ditches each day the news grew more encouraging each day brought the discovery of a new creek or a lake men came back in swarms and reporting finds on lake surprise a newly discovered big body of water and at last came the report of surprising discoveries in the benches high above the creek  in the camp one night i heard a couple of men talking around a campfire near me one of them said why you know old sperry was digging on the ridge just above discovery and i came along and see him up there and i said hullo uncle what you doin diggin your grave and the old feller said you just wait a few minutes and ill show ye well sir he filled up a sack o dirt and toted it down to the creek and i went along with him to see him wash it out and say he took 325 out of one pan of that dirt and 185 out of the other pan well that knocked me i says uncle youre all right and then i made tracks for a bench claim next him well about that time everybody began to hustle for bench claims and now you cant get one anywhere near him  at another camp a packer was telling of an immense nugget that had been discovered somewhere on the upper waters of birch creek and say fellers you know there is another lake up there pretty near as big as atlin they are calling it lake surprise i heard a feller say a few days ago there was a big lake up there and i thought he meant a lake six or eight miles long on the very high ground next to birch you can look down over that lake and i bet its sixty miles long it must reach nearly to teslin lake there was something pretty fine in the thought of being in a country where lakes sixty miles long were being discovered and set forth on the maps of the world up to this time atlin lake itself was unmapped to an unpractical man like myself it was reward enough to feel the thrill of excitement which comes with such discoveries  however i was not a goldseeker and when i determined to give up any further pursuit of mining and to delegate it entirely to my partner i experienced a feeling of relief i determined to stick to my last notwithstanding the fascination which i felt in the sight of placer gold quartz mining has never had the slightest attraction for me but to see the gold washed out of the sand to see it appear bright and shining in the black sand in the bottom of the pan is really worth while it is firsthand contact with natures stores of wealth  i went up to discovery for the last time with my camera slung over my shoulder and my notebook in hand to take a final survey of the miners and to hear for the last time their exultant talk i found them exceedingly cheerful even buoyant  the men who had gone in with ten days provisions the tenderfoot miners the men with a cigarette and a sandwich had gone out those who remained were men who knew their business and were resolute and selfsustaining  there was a crowd of such men around the landoffice tents and many filings were made nearly every man had his little phial of gold to show no one was loud but every one seemed to be quietly confident and replied to my questions in a low voice well you can safely say the country is all right  the day was fine like september in wisconsin the lake as i walked back to it was very alluring my mind returned again and again to the things i had left behind for so long my correspondence my books my friends all the literary interests of my life began to reassert their dominion over me for some time i had realized that this was almost an ideal spot for camping or mining just over in the wild country toward teslin lake herds of caribou were grazing moose and bear were being killed daily rich and unknown streams were waiting for the gold pan the pick and the shovel butit was not for me i was ready to returneager to return     the freeman of the hills       i have no master but the wind       my only liege the sun       all bonds and ties i leave behind     free as the wolf i run     my master wind is passionless       he neither chides nor charms     he fans me or he freezes me       and helps are quick as harms      he never turns to injure me       and when his voice is high     i crouch behind a rock and see       his storm of snows go by     he too is subject of the sun       as all things earthly are     whereer he flies whereer i run       we know our kingly star     the voice of the maple tree       i am worn with the dullgreen spires of fir     i am tired of endless talk of gold     i long for the crickets cheery whirr     and the song that the maples sang of old     o the beauty and learning and light     that lie in the leaves of the level lands     they shake my heart in the deep of the night     they call me and bless me with calm cool hands        sing o leaves of the maple tree       i hear your voice by the savage sea       hear and hasten to home and thee     chapter xxiii  the end of the trail   the day on which i crossed the lake to taku city was most glorious a september haze lay on the mountains whose high slopes orange ruby and goldengreen allured with almost irresistible attraction although the clouds were gathering in the east the sunset was superb taku arm seemed a river of gold sweeping between gates of purple as the darkness came on a long creeping line of fire crept up a nearby mountains side and from time to time as it reached some great pine it flamed to the clouds like a mighty geyser of redhot lava it was splendid but terrible to witness  the next day was a long long wait for the steamer i now had in my pocket just twelve dollars but possessed a return ticket on one of the boats this ticket was not good on any other boat and naturally i felt considerable anxiety for fear it would not turn up my dinner consisted of moose steak potatoes and bread and was most thoroughly enjoyed  at last the steamer came but it was not the one on which i had secured passage and as it took almost my last dollar to pay for deck passage thereon i lived on some small cakes of my own baking which i carried in a bag i was now in a sad predicament unless i should connect at lake bennett with some one who would carry my outfit back to skagway on credit i ate my stale cakes and drank lake water and thus fooled the little jap steward out of two dollars it was a sad business but unavoidable  the lake being smooth the trip consumed but thirteen hours and we arrived at bennett lake late at night hoisting my bed and luggage to my shoulder i went up on the sidehill like a stray dog and made my bed down on the sand beside a cart near a shack the wind cold and damp swept over the mountains with a roar i was afraid the owners of the cart might discover me there and order me to seek a bed elsewhere dogs sniffed around me during the night but on the whole i slept very well i could feel the sand blowing over me in the wild gusts of wind which relented not in all my stay at bennett city  i spent literally the last cent i had on a scanty breakfast and then in company with doctor g a fellow prospector started on my return to the coast over the farfamed chilcoot pass  at 9 am we took the little ferry for the head of lindernan lake the doctor paid my fare the boat a wabbly craft was crowded with returning klondikers many of whom were full of importance and talk of their wealth while others sick and worn with a wistful gleam in their eyes seemed eager to get back to civilization and medical care there were some women also who had made a fortune in dancehouses and were now bound for new york and paris where dresses could be had in the latest styles and in any quantities  my travelling mate the doctor was a tall and vigorous man from winnipeg accustomed to a plainsmans life hardy and resolute he said we ought to make dyea today i said in reply very well we can try  it was ten oclock when we left the little boat and hit the trail which was thirty miles long and passed over the summit three thousand six hundred feet above the sea the doctors pace was tremendous and we soon left every one else behind  i carried my big coat and camera which hindered me not a little for the first part of the journey the doctor preceded me his broad shoulders keeping off the powerful wind and driving mist which grew thicker as we rose among the ragged cliffs beside a roaring stream  that walk was a grim experience until two oclock we climbed resolutely along a rough rocky and wooded trail with the heavy mist driving into our faces the road led up a rugged cañon and over a fairly good wagon road until somewhere about twelve oclock then the foot trail deflected to the left and climbed sharply over slippery ledges along banks of ancient snows in which carcasses of horses lay embedded and across many rushing little streams the way grew grimmer each step at last we came to crater lake and from that point on it was a singular and sinister land of grassless crags swathed in mist nothing could be seen at this point but a desolate flat expanse of barren sands over which graygreen streams wandered in confusion coming from darkness and vanishing in obscurity strange shapes showed in the gray dusk of the crater it was like a landscape in hell it seemed to be the end of the earth where no life had ever been or could long exist  across this flat to its farther wall we took our way facing the roaring wind now heavy with clouds of rain at last we stood in the mighty notch of the summit through which the wind rushed as though hurrying to some faroff deephidden vacuum in the world the peaks of the mountains were lost in clouds out of which water fell in vicious slashes  the mist set the imagination free the pinnacles around us were like those which top the valley of desolation we seemed each moment about to plunge into ladderless abysses nothing ever imagined by poe or doré could be more singular more sinister than these summits in such a light in such a storm it might serve as the scene for an exiled devil the picture of beelzebub perched on one of those gray dimly seen crags his form outlined in the mist would shake the heart i thought of peer gynt wandering in the high home of the trolls crags beetled beyond crags and nothing could be heard but the wild waters roaring in the obscure depths beneath our feet there was no sky no level place no growing thing no bird or beastonly crates of bones to show where some heartless master had pushed a faithful horse up these terrible heights to his death  and herejust here in a world of crags and misti heard a shout of laughter and then bursting upon my sight stronglimbed erect and fullbosomed appeared a girl her face was like a rainwet rosea splendid unexpected flower set in this dim and gray and desolate place fearlessly she fronted me to ask the way a laugh upon her lips her big gray eyes confident of mans chivalry modest and sincere i had been so long among rude men and their coarse consorts that this fair woman lit the mist as if with sudden sunshinejust a moment and was gone there were others with her but they passed unnoticed there in the gloom like a stately pink rose i set the girl of the mist  sheep camp was the end of the worst portion of the trail i had now crossed both the famed passes much improved of course they are no longer dangerous a woman in good health can cross them easily but they are grim and grievous ways they reek of cruelty and every association that is coarse and hard they possess a peculiar value to me in that they throw into fadeless splendor the wealth the calm the golden sunlight which lay upon the proud beauty of atlin lake  the last hours of the trip formed a supreme test of endurance at sheep camp a wet and desolate shanty town eight miles from dyea we came upon stages just starting over our road but as they were all open carriages and we were both wet with perspiration and rain and hungry and tired we refused to book passage  to ride eight miles in an open wagon would mean a case of pneumonia to me i said  quite right said the doctor and we pulled out down the road at a smart clip  the rain had ceased but the air was raw and the sky gray and i was very tired and those eight miles stretched out like a rubber string night fell before we had passed over half the road which lay for the most part down the flat along the chilcoot river in fact we crossed this stream again and again in places there were bridges but most of the crossings were fords where it was necessary to wade through the icy water above our shoe tops our legs numb and weary threw off this chill with greater pain each time as the night fell we could only see the footpath by the dim shine of its surface patted smooth by the moccasined feet of the indian packers at last i walked with a sort of mechanical action which was dependent on my subconscious will there was nothing else to do but to go through the doctor was a better walker than i his long legs had more reach as well as greater endurance nevertheless he admitted being about as tired as ever in his life  at last when it seemed as though i could not wade any more of those icy streams and continue to walk we came in sight of the electric lights on the wharfs of dyea sparkling like jewels against the gray night their radiant promise helped over the last mile miraculously we were wet to the knees and covered with mud as we entered upon the straggling street of the decaying town we stopped in at the first restaurant to get something hot to eat but found ourselves almost too tired to enjoy even pea soup but it warmed us up a little and keeping on down the street we came at last to a hotel of very comfortable accommodations we ordered a fire built to dry our clothing and staggered up the stairs  that ended the goldseekers trail for me henceforward i intended to ridenevertheless i was pleased to think i could still walk thirty miles in eleven hours through a rain storm and over a summit three thousand six hundred feet in height the city had not entirely eaten the heart out of my body  we arose from a dreamless sleep somewhat sore but in amazingly good trim considering our condition the night before and made our way into our muddy clothing with grim resolution after breakfast we took a small steamer which ran to skagway where we spent the day arranging to take the steamer to the south we felt quite at home in skagway now and chicago seemed not very far away having made connection with my bankers i stretched out in my twentyfive cent bunk with the assurance of a gold king  here the long trail took a turn i had been among the miners and hunters for four months i had been one of them i had lived the essentials of their lives and had been able to catch from them some hint of their outlook on life they were a disappointment to me in some ways they seemed like mechanisms they moved as if drawn by some great magnet whose centre was dawson city they appeared to drift on and in toward that human maelstrom going irresolutely to their ruin they did not seem to me strong menon the contrary they seemed weak menor men strong with one insane purpose they set their faces toward the golden north and went on and on through every obstacle like men dreaming like somnambulistsbending their backs to the most crushing burdens their faces distorted with effort on to dawson to the klondike that was all they knew  i overtook them in the fraser river valley i found them in hazleton they were setting sail at bennett tugging oars on the hotalinqua and hundreds of them were landing every day at dawson there to stand with lax jaws waiting for something to turn uplost among thousands of their kind swarming in with the same insane purpose  skagway was to me a sad place on either side rose green mountains covered with crawling glaciers between these stern walls a cold and violent wind roared ceaselessly from the sea gates through which the ships drive hurriedly all these grim presences depressed me i longed for release from them i waited with impatience the coming of the steamer which was to rescue me from the merciless beach  at last it came and its hoarse boom thrilled the heart of many a homesick man like myself we had not much to put aboard and when i climbed the gangplank it was with a feeling of fortunate escape     a girl on the trail       a flutter of skirts in the dapple of leaves on the trees     the sound of a small happy voice on the breeze     the print of a slim little foot on the trail     and the miners rejoice as they hammer with picks in     the vale      for fairer than gold is the face of a maid     and sovereign as stars the light of her eyes     for women alone were the long trenches laid     for women alone they defy the stern skies      these toilers are grimy and hairy and dun     with the wear of the wind the scorch of the sun     but their picks fall slack their foul tongues are mute     as the maiden goes by these earthworms salute      chapter xxiv  homeward bound   the steamer was crowded with men who had also made the turn at the end of the trail there were groups of prospectors disappointed and sour from copper river where neither copper nor gold had been found there were miners sick and broken who had failed on the tanana and others emaciated and eagereyed from dawson city going out with a part of the proceeds of the years work to see their wives and children there were a few who considered themselves great capitalists and were on their way to spend the winter in luxury in the eastern cities and there were grub stakers who had squandered their employers money in drink and gaming  none of them interested me very greatly i was worn out with the filth and greed and foolishness of many of these men they were commonplace citizens turned into stampeders without experience or skill  one of the most successful men on the boat had been a truckman in the streets of tacoma and was now the silly possessor of a onethird interest in some great mines on the klondike river he told every one of his great deeds and what he was worth he let us know how big his house was and how much he paid for his piano he was not a bad man he was merely a cheap man and was followed about by a gang of heelers to whom drink was luxury and vice an entertainment these parasites slapped the teamster on the shoulder and listened to every empty phrase he uttered as though his gold had made of him something sacred and omniscient  i had no interest in him till being persuaded to play the fiddle he sat in the social room and sawed away on honest john the devils dream haste to the wedding and the fishers hornpipe he lost all sense of being a millionnaire and returned to his simple unsophisticated self the others cheered him because he had gold i cheered him because he was a good old corduroy fiddler  again we passed between the lofty blueblack and bronzegreen walls of lynn canal the sea was cold placid and gray the mist cut the mountains at the shoulder vast glaciers came sweeping down from the dread mystery of the upper heights lower still lines of running water white as silver came leaping down from cliff to cliffslender broken of line nearly perpendicularto fall at last into the gray hell of the sea  it was a sullen land which menaced as with lowering brows and clenched fists a landscape without delicacy of detail or warmth or variety of colora land demanding young cheerful men it was no place for the old or for women  as we neared wrangell the next afternoon i tackled the purser about carrying my horse he had no room so i left the boat in order to wait for another with better accommodations for ladrone  almost the first man i met on the wharf was donald  hows the horse i queried  gudefat and sassy theres no a fence in a the town can hold him he jumped into colonel crittendons garden patch and theres a dollar to pay for the cauliflower he ate and he broke down a fence by the church yeve to fix that upbut hes in gude trim himsel  tell m to send in their bills i replied with vast relief has he been much trouble to you  verra leetle except to drive into the lot at night i had but to go down where he was feeding and soon as he heard me comin he made for the lothe knew quite as well as i did what was wanted of him hes a canny old boy  as i walked out to find the horse i discovered his paths everywhere he had made himself entirely at home he owned the village and was able to walk any sidewalk in town everybody knew his habits he drank in a certain place and walked a certain round of daily feeding the children all cried out at me goin to find the horsie hes over by the church a darky woman smiled from the door of a cabin and said you ole hoss lookin mighty fine dese days  when i came to him i was delighted and amused he had taken on some fat and a great deal of dirt he had also acquired an aldermanic paunch which quite destroyed his natural symmetry of body but he was well and strong and lively he seemed to recognize me and as i put the rope about his neck and fell to in the effort to make him clean once more he seemed glad of my presence  that day began my attempt to get away i carted out my feed and saddles and when all was ready i sat on the pier and watched the burnished water of the bay for the dim speck which a steamer makes in rounding the distant island at last the cry arose a steamer from the north i hurried for ladrone and as i passed with the horse the citizens smiled incredulously and asked goin to take the horse with you eh  the boys and girls came out to say goodby to the horse on whose back they had ridden ladrone followed me most trustfully looking straight ahead his feet clumping loudly on the boards of the walk hitching him on the wharf i lugged and heaved and got everything in readiness  in vain the steamer had no place for my horse and i was forced to walk him back and turn him loose once more upon the grass i renewed my watching the next steamer did not touch at the same wharf therefore i carted all my goods feed hay and general plunder around to the other wharf as i toiled to and fro the citizens began to smile very broadly i worked like a hired man in harvest at last horse feed and baggage were once more ready when the next boat came in i timidly approached the purser  no he had no place for me but would take my horse once more i led ladrone back to pasture and the citizens laughed most unconcealedly they laid bets on my next attempt in mckinnons store i was greeted as a permanent citizen of fort wrangell i began to grow nervous on my own account was i to remain forever in wrangell the bay was most beautiful but the town was wretched it became each day more unendurable to me i searched the waters of the bay thereafter with gaze that grew really anxious i sat for hours late at night holding my horse and glaring out into the night in the hope to see the lights of a steamer appear round the high hills of the coast  at last the forallen a great barnyard of a ship came in i met the captain i paid my fare i got my contract and ticket and leading ladrone into the hoisting box i stepped aside  the old boy was quiet while i stood near but when the whistle sounded and the sling rose in air leaving me below his big eyes flashed with fear and dismay he struggled furiously for a moment and then was quiet a moment later he dropped into the hold and was safe he thought himself in a barn once more and when i came hurrying down the stairway he whinnied he seized the hay i put before him and thereafter was quite at home  the steamer had a score of mules and work horses on board but they occupied stalls on the upper deck leaving ladrone aristocratically alone in his big wellventilated barn and there three times each day i went to feed and water him i rubbed him with hay till his coat began to glimmer in the light and planned what i could do to help him through a storm fortunately the ocean was perfectly smooth even across the entrance to queen charlottes sound where the open sea enters and the big swells are sometimes felt ladrone never knew he was moving at all  the mate of the boat took unusual interest in the horse because of his deeds and my care of him  meanwhile i was hearing from time to time of my fellowsufferers on the long trail it was reported in wrangell that some of the unfortunates were still on the snowy divide between the skeena and the stikeen that terrible trail will not soon be forgotten by any one who traversed it  on the fifth day we entered seattle and once more the slingbox opened its doors for ladrone this time he struggled not at all he seemed to say i know this thing i tried it once and it didnt hurt meim not afraid  now this horse belongs to the wild country he was born on the bunchgrass hills of british columbia and he had never seen a streetcar in his life engines he knew something about but not much steamboats and ferries he knew a great deal about but all the strange monsters and diabolical noises of a city street were new to him and it was with some apprehension that i took his rein to lead him down to the freight depot and his car  again this wonderful horse amazed me he pointed his alert and quivering ears at me and followed with never so much as a single start or shying bound he seemed to reason that as i had led him through many dangers safely i could still be trusted around us huge trucks rattled electric cars clanged railway engines whizzed and screamed but ladrone never so much as tightened the rein and when in the dark of the chute which led to the door of the car he put his soft nose against me to make sure i was still with him my heart grew so tender that i would not have left him behind for a thousand dollars  i put him in a roomy boxcar and bedded him kneedeep in clean yellow straw i padded the hitching pole with his blanket moistened his hay and put some bran before him then i nailed him in and took my leave of him with some nervous dread for the worst part of his journey was before him he must cross three great mountain ranges and ride eight days over more than two thousand miles of railway i could not well go with him but i planned to overhaul him at spokane and see how he was coming on  i did not sleep much that night i recalled how the great forest trees were blazing last year when i rode over this same track i thought of the sparks flying from the engine and how easy it would be for a single cinder to fall in the door and set all that dry straw ablaze i was tired and my mind conjured up such dire images as men dream of after indigestible dinners      o the fierce delight       o the fierce delight the passion       that comes from the wild     where the rains and the snows go over       and man is a child      go set your face to the open       and lay your breast to the blast     when the pines are rocking and groaning       and the rent clouds tumble past      go swim the streams of the mountains       where the graywhite waters are mad     go set your foot on the summit       and shout and be glad      chapter xxv  ladrone travels in state   with a little leisure to walk about and talk with the citizens of seattle i became aware of a great change since the year before the boom of the goldseeker was over the talk was more upon the spanish war the business of outfitting was no longer paramount the reckless hurrah the splendid exultation were gone men were sailing to the north but they embarked methodically in business fashion  it is safe to say that the north will never again witness such a furious rush of men as that which took place between august 97 and june 98 gold is still there and it will continue to be sought but the attention of the people is directed elsewhere in seattle as all along the line the talk a year ago had been almost entirely on gold hunting every storekeeper advertised klondike goods but these signs were now rusty and faded the fever was over the reign of the humdrum was restored  taking the train next day i passed ladrone in the night somewhere and as i looked from my window at the great fires blazing in the forest my fear of his burning came upon me again at spokane i waited with great anxiety for him to arrive at last the train drew in and i hurried to his car the door was closed and as i nervously forced it open he whinnied with that glad chuckling a gentle horse uses toward his master he had plenty of hay but was hot and thirsty and i hurried at risk of life and limb to bring him cool water his eyes seemed to shine with delight as he saw me coming with the big bucket of cool drink leaving him a tub of water i bade him goodby once more and started him for helena five hundred miles away  at missoula the following evening i rushed into the ticket office and shouted where is 54  the clerk knew me and smilingly extended his hand  how de do she has just pulled out the horse is all ok we gave him fresh water and feed  i thanked him and returned to my train  reaching livingston in the early morning i was forced to wait nearly all day for the train this was no hardship however for it enabled me to return once more to the plain all the old familiar presences were there the splendid sweep of brown smooth hills the glory of clear sky the crisp exhilarating air appealed to me with great power after my long stay in the cold green mountains of the north  i walked out a few miles from the town over the grass brittle and hot from which the clapping grasshoppers rose in swarms and dropping down on the point of a mesa i relived again in drowse the joys of other days it was plain to me that goldseeking in the rocky mountains was marvellously simple and easy compared to even the best sections of the northwest and the long journey of the fortyniners was not only incredibly more splendid and dramatic but had the allurement of a land of eternal summer beyond the final great range the long trail i had just passed was not only grim and monotonous but led toward an ever increasing ferocity of cold and darkness to the arctic circle and the silence of death  when the train came crawling down the pink and purple slopes of the hills at sunset that night i was ready for my horse bridle in hand i raced after the big car while it was being drawn up into the freight yards as i galloped i held excited controversy with the head brakeman i asked that the car be sent to the platform he objected i insisted and the car was thrown in i entered and while ladrone whinnied glad welcome i knocked out some bars bridled him and said come boy now for a gambol he followed me without the slightest hesitation out on the platform and down the steep slope to the ground there i mounted him without waiting for saddle and away we flew  he was gay as a bird his neck arched and his eyes and ears were quick as squirrels we galloped down to the yellowstone river and once more he thrust his dusty nozzle deep into the clear mountain water then away he raced until our fifteen minutes were up i was glad to quit he was too active for me to enjoy riding without a saddle right up to the door of the car he trotted seeming to understand that his journey was not yet finished he entered unhesitatingly and took his place i battened down the bars nailed the doors into place filled his tub with cold water mixed him a bran mash and once more he rolled away i sent him on this time however with perfect confidence he was actually getting fat on his prison fare and was too wise to allow himself to be bruised by the jolting of the cars  the bystanders seeing a horse travelling in such splendid loneliness asked runnin horse and i to cover my folly replied evasively he can run a little for good money this satisfied every one that he was a sprinter and quite explained his private car  at bismarck i found myself once more ahead of 54 and waited all day for the horse to appear as the time of the train drew near i borrowed a huge water pail and tugged a supply of water out beside the track and there sat for three hours expecting the train each moment at last it came but ladrone was not there his car was missing i rushed into the office of the operator wheres the horse in 13238 i asked  i dont know answered the agent in the tone of one who didnt care  visions of ladrone sidetracked somewhere and perishing for want of air and water filled my mind i waxed warm  that horse must be found at once i said the clerks and operators wearily looked out of the window the idea of any one being so concerned about a horse was to them insanity or worse i insisted i banged my fist on the table at last one of the young men yawned languidly looked at me with dim eyes and as one braincell coalesced with another seemed to mature an idea he said  rheinhart had a horse this morning on his extra  did hemaybe thats the one they discussed this probability with lazy indifference at last they condescended to include me in their conversation  i insisted on their telegraphing till they found that horse and with an air of distress and saintlike patience the agent wrote out a telegram and sent it thereafter he could not see me nevertheless i persisted i returned to the office each quarter of an hour to ask if an answer had come to the telegram at last it came ladrone was ahead and would arrive in st paul nearly twelve hours before me i then telegraphed the officers of the road to see that he did not suffer and composed myself as well as i could for the long wait  at st paul i hurried to the freight office and found the horse had been put in a stable i sought the stable and there among the big dray horses looking small and trim as a racer was the lost horse eating merrily on some good minnesota timothy he was just as much at ease there as in the car or the boat or on the marshes of the skeena valley but he was still a halfdays ride from his final home  i bustled about filling up another car again for the last time i sweated and tugged getting feed water and bedding again the railway hands marvelled and looked askance again some one said does it pay to bring a horse like that so far  pay i shouted thoroughly disgusted does it pay to feed a dog for ten years does it pay to ride a bicycle does it pay to bring up a child payno it does not pay im amusing myself you drink beer because you like to you use tobaccoi squander my money on a horse i said a good deal more than the case demanded being hot and dusty and tired andi had broken loose the clerk escaped through a side door  once more i closed the bars on the gray and saw him wheeled out into the grinding jolting tangle of cars where the engines cried out like some untamable flesheating monsters the light was falling the smoke thickening and it was easy to imagine a tragic fate for the patient and lonely horse  delay in getting the car made me lose my train and i was obliged to take a late train which did not stop at my home i was still paying for my horse out of my own bone and sinew at last the luscious green hills the thick grasses the tall cornshocks and the portly haystacks of my native valley came in view and they never looked so abundant so generous so entirely sufficing to man and beast as now in returning from a land of cold green forests sparse grass and icy streams  at ten oclock another huge freight train rolled in ladrones car was sidetracked and sent to the chute for the last time he felt the jolt of the car in a few minutes i had his car opened and a plank laid  come boy i called this is home  he followed me as before so readily so trustingly my heart responded to his affection i swung to the saddle with neck arched high and with a proud and lofty stride he left the door of his prison behind him his fame had spread through the village on every corner stood the citizens to see him pass  as i opened the door to the barn i said to him  enter your days of thirst of hunger of cruel exposure to rain and snow are over here is food that shall not fail and he seemed to understand  it might seem absurd if i were to give expression to the relief and deep pleasure it gave me to put that horse into that familiar stall he had been with me more than four thousand miles he had carried me through hundreds of icy streams and over snow fields he had responded to every word and obeyed every command he had suffered from cold and hunger and poison he had walked logs and wallowed through quicksands he had helped me up enormous mountains and i had guided him down dangerous declivities his faithful heart had never failed even in days of direst need and now he shall live amid plenty and have no care so long as he lives it does not paythat is surebut after all what does pay     the lure of the desert       i lie in my blanket alone alone     hearing the voice of the roaring rain     and my heart is moved by the winds low moan     to wander the wastes of the windworn plain     searching for somethingi cannot tell     the face of a woman the love of a child     or only the rainwet prairie swell     or the savage woodland wide and wild      i must go awayi know not where     lured by voices that cry and cry     drawn by fingers that clutch my hair     called to the mountains bleak and high     led to the mesas hot and bare     o god how my hearts blood wakes and thrills     to the cry of the wind the lure of the hills     ill follow you follow you far     ye voices of winds and

sweep     chapter xxvi  the goldseekers reach the golden river   the goldseekers are still seeking i withdrew but they went on in the warmth and security of my study surrounded by the peace and comfort of my native coolly i thought of them as they went toiling over the trail still toward the north it was easy for me to imagine their daily life the manchester boys and burton my partner left glenora with ten horses and more than two thousand pounds of supplies  twice each day this immense load had to be handled sometimes in order to rest and graze the ponies every sack and box had to be taken down and lifted up to their lashings again four times each day this meant toil it meant also constant worry and care while the train was in motion three times each day a campfire was built and coffee and beans prepared  however the weather continued fair my partner wrote me and they arrived at teslin lake in september after being a month on the road and there set about building a boat to carry them down the river  here the horses were sold and i know it must have been a sad moment for burton to say goodby to his faithful brutes but there was no help for it there was no more thought of going to the headwaters of the pelly and no more use for the horses indeed the goldhunters abandoned all thought of the nisutlin and the hotalinqua they were fairly in the grasp of the tremendous current which seemed to get ever swifter as it approached the mouth of the klondike river they were mad to reach the pool wherein all the rest of the world was fishing nothing less would satisfy them  at last they cast loose from the shore and started down the river straight into the north each hour each mile became a menace day by day they drifted while the spitting snows fell hissing into the cold water and ice formed around the keel of the boat at night they passed men camped and panning dirt but continued resolute halting only to pass the good word  it grew cold with appalling rapidity and the sun fell away to the south with desolating speed the skies darkened and lowered as the days shortened all signs of life except those of other argonauts disappeared the river filled with drifting ice and each night landing became more difficult  at last the winter came the river closed up like an iron trap and before they knew it they were caught in the jam of ice and fighting for their lives they landed on a wooded island after a desperate struggle and went into camp with the thermometer thirty below zero but what of that they were now in the gold belt after six months of incessant toil of hope deferred they were at last on the spot toward which they had struggled  all around them was the overflow from the klondike their desire to go farther was checked they had reached the counter currentthe backwaterand were satisfied  leaving to others the task of building a permanent camp my sturdy partner a couple of days later started prospecting in company with two others whom he had selected to represent the other outfit the thermometer was fiftysix degrees below zero and yet for seven days with less than six hours sleep without a tent those devoted idiots hunted the sands of a nearby creek for gold and really staked claims  on the way back one of the men grew sleepy and would have lain down to die except for the vigorous treatment of burton who mauled him and dragged him about and rubbed him with snow until his blood began to circulate once more in attempting to walk on the river which was again in motion burton fell through wetting one leg above the knee it was still more than thirty degrees below zero but what of that he merely kept going  they reached the bank opposite the camp late on the seventh day but were unable to cross the moving ice for the eighth night they danced around the fire as usual not daring to sleep for fear of freezing they literally frosted on one side while scorching at the fire on the other turning like so many roasting pigs before the blaze the river solidified during the night and they crossed to the camp to eat and sleep in safety  a couple of weeks later they determined to move down the river to a new stampede in thistle creek once more these indomitable souls left their warm cabin took up their beds and nearly two thousand pounds of outfit and toiled down the river still farther into the terrible north the chronicle of this trip by burton is of mathematical brevity on 20th concluded to move took four days very cold ther down to 45 below froze one toe got claimnow building cabin expect to begin singeing in a few days  the toil the suffering the monotonous food the lack of fire he did not dwell upon but singeing that is to say burning down through the eternally frozen ground was to begin at once to singe a hole into the soil ten or fifteen feet deep in the midst of the sunless seventy of the arctic circle is no light task but these men will do it if hardihood and honest toil are of any avail they will all share in the precious sand whose shine has lured them through all the dark days of the long trail calling with such power that nothing could stay them or turn them aside  if they fail well      this out of all will remain     they have lived and have tossed     so much of the game will be gain     though the gold of the dice has been lost     here the trail ends       here the
