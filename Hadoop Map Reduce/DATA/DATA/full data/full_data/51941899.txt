51941899	sentimental tommy                          the story of his boyhood                              by j m barrie          author of the little minister a window in thrums etc                                    1896     sentimental tommy  the story of his boyhood     chapter i  tommy contrives to keep one out   the celebrated tommy first comes into view on a dirty london stair and he was in sexless garments which were all he had and he was five and so though we are looking at him we must do it sideways lest he sit down hurriedly to hide them that inscrutable face which made the clubmen of his later days uneasy and even puzzled the ladies while he was making love to them was already his except when he smiled at one of his pretty thoughts or stopped at an open door to sniff a potful on his way up and down the stair he often paused to sniff but he never asked for anything his mother had warned him against it and he carried out her injunction with almost unnecessary spirit declining offers before they were made as when passing a room whence came the smell of fried fish he might call in i dont not want none of your fish or my mother says i dont not want the littlest bit or wistfully i aint hungry or more wistfully still my mother says i aint hungry his mother heard of this and was angry crying that he had let the neighbors know something she was anxious to conceal but what he had revealed to them tommy could not make out and when he questioned her artlessly she took him with sudden passion to her flat breast and often after that she looked at him long and woefully and wrung her hands  the only other pleasant smell known to tommy was when the watercarts passed the mouth of his little street his street which ended in a dead wall was near the river but on the doleful south side of it opening off a longer street where the cabs of waterloo station sometimes found themselves when they took the wrong turning his home was at the top of a house of four floors each with accommodation for at least two families and here he had lived with his mother since his fathers death six months ago there was oilcloth on the stair as far as the second floor there had been oilcloth between the second floor and the thirdtommy could point out pieces of it still adhering to the wood like remnants of a plaster  this stair was nursery to all the children whose homes opened on it not so safe as nurseries in the part of london that is chiefly inhabited by boys in sailor suits but preferable as a centre of adventure and here on an afternoon sat two they were very busy boasting but only the smaller had imagination and as he used it recklessly their positions soon changed sexless garments was now prone on a step breeches sitting on him  shovel a man of seven had said none on your lip you werent never at thrums yourself  tommys reply was aint my mother a thrums woman  shovel who had but one eye and that bloodshot fixed it on him threateningly  the thames is in london he said  cos they wouldnt not have it in thrums replied tommy  amstead eaths in london i tell yer shovel said  the cemetery is in thrums said tommy  there aint no queens in thrums anyhow  theres the auld licht minister  well then if you jest seed trafalgar square  if you jest seed the thrums townhouse  st pauls aint in thrums  it would like to be  after reflecting shovel said in desperation well then my father were once at a hanging  tommy replied instantly it were my father what was hanged  there was no possible answer to this save a knockdown blow but though tommy was vanquished in body his spirit remained stanch he raised his head and gasped you should see how they knock down in thrums it was then that shovel sat on him  such was their position when an odd figure in that house a gentleman passed them without a word so desirous was he to make a breath taken at the foot of the close stair last him to the top tommy merely gaped after this fine sight but shovel had experience and its a kid or a coffin he said sharply knowing that only birth or death brought a doctor here  watching the doctors ascent the two boys strained their necks over the rickety banisters which had been polished black by trousers of the past and sometimes they lost him and then they saw his legs again  hello its your old woman cried shovel is she a deader he asked brightening for funerals made a pleasant stir on the stair  the question had no meaning for bewildered tommy but he saw that if his mother was a deader whatever that might be he had grown great in his companions eye so he hoped she was a deader  if its only a kid shovel began with such scorn that tommy at once screamed it aint and crossexamined he swore eagerly that his mother was in bed when he left her in the morning that she was still in bed at dinnertime also that the sheet was over her face also that she was cold  then she was a deader and had attained distinction in the only way possible in that street shovel did not shake tommys hand warmly the forms of congratulation varying in different parts of london but he looked his admiration so plainly that tommys head waggled proudly evidently whatever his mother had done redounded to his glory as well as to hers and somehow he had become a boy of mark he said from his elevation that he hoped shovel would believe his tales about thrums now and shovel who had often cuffed tommy for sticking to him so closely cringed in the most snobbish manner craving permission to be seen in his company for the next three days tommy the upstart did not see his way to grant this favor for nothing and shovel offered a knife but did not have it with him it was his sister ameliars knife and he would take it from her help his davy tommy would wait there till shovel fetched it shovel baffled wanted to know what tommy was putting on hairs for tommy smiled and asked whose mother was a deader then shovel collapsed and his wind passed into tommy  the reign of thomas sandys nevertheless was among the shortest for with this question was he overthrown how did yer know she were cold  because replied tommy triumphantly she tell me herself  shovel only looked at him but one eye can be so much more terrible than two that plop plop plop came the balloon softly down the steps of the throne and at the foot shrank pitifully as if with ameliars knife in it  its only a kid arter all screamed shovel furiously disappointment gave him eloquence and tommy cowered under his sneers not understanding them but they seemed to amount to this that in having a baby he had disgraced the house  but i think he said with diffidence i think i were once one  then all shovel could say was that he had better keep it dark on that stair  tommy squeezed his fist into one eye and the tears came out at the other a goodnatured impulse was about to make shovel say that though kids are undoubtedly humiliations mothers and boys get used to them in time and go on as brazenly as before but it was checked by tommys unfortunate question shovel when will it come  shovel speaking from local experience replied truthfully that they usually came very soon after the doctor and at times before him  it aint come before him tommy said confidently  how do yer know  cos it werent there at dinnertime and i been here since dinnertime  the words meant that tommy thought it could only enter by way of the stair and shovel quivered with delight hst he cried dramatically and to his joy tommy looked anxiously down the stair instead of up it  did you hear it tommy whispered  before he could control himself shovel blurted out do you think as they come on their feet  how then demanded tommy but shovel had exhausted his knowledge of the subject tommy who had begun to descend to hold the door turned and climbed upwards and his tears were now but the drop left in a cup too hurriedly dried where was he off to shovel called after him and he answered in a determined whisper to shove of it out if it tries to come in at the winder  this was enough for the more knowing urchin now so full of good things that with another added he must spill and away he ran for an audience which could also help him to bait tommy that being a game most sportive when there are several to fling at once at the door he knocked over and was done with a laughing little girl who had strayed from a more fashionable street she rose solemnly and kissing her muff to reassure it if it had got a fright toddled in at the first open door to be out of the way of unmannerly boys  tommy climbing courageously heard the door slam and looking down he sawa strange child he climbed no higher it had come  after a long time he was one flight of stairs nearer it it was making itself at home on the bottom step resting doubtless before it came hopping up another dozen steps andit was beautifully dressed in one piece of yellow and brown that reached almost to its feet with a bit left at the top to form a hood out of which its pert face peeped impudently oho so they came in their sunday clothes he drew so near that he could hear it cooing thought itself as good as upstairs did it  he bounced upon her sharply thinking to carry all with a high hand out you go he cried with the action of one heaving coals  she whisked round and oo boy or oo girl she inquired puzzled by his dress  none of your cheek roared insulted manhood  oo boy she said decisively  with the effrontery of them when they are young she made room for him on her step but he declined the invitation knowing that her design was to skip up the stair the moment he was off his guard  you dont neednt think as well have you he announced firmly you had best go away togo to his imagination failed him you had best go back he said  she did not budge however and his next attempt was craftier my mother he assured her aint living here now but mother was a new word to the girl and she asked gleefully oo have mother expecting him to produce it from his pocket to coax him to give her a sight of it she said plaintively me no have mother  you wont not get mine replied tommy doggedly  she pretended not to understand what was troubling him and it passed through his head that she had to wait there till the doctor came down for her he might come at any moment  a boy does not put his hand into his pocket until every other means of gaining his end has failed but to that extremity had tommy now come for months his only splendid possession had been a penny despised by trade because of a large round hole in it as if to quote shovel some previous owner had cut a farthing out of it to tell the escapades of this penny there are no adventurers like coin of the realm would be one way of exhibiting tommy to the curious but it would be a hardhearted way at present the penny was doubly dear to him having been long lost and lately found in a noble moment he had dropped it into a charity box hanging forlorn against the wall of a shop where it lay very lonely by itself so that when tommy was that way he could hear it respond if he shook the box as acquaintances give each other the time of day in passing thus at comparatively small outlay did he spread his benevolence over weeks and feel a glow therefrom until the glow went when he and shovel recaptured the penny with a thread and a bent pin  this treasure he sadly presented to the girl and she accepted it with glee putting it on her finger as if it were a ring but instead of saying that she would go now she asked him coolly  oo know tories  stories he exclaimed illill tell you about thrums and was about to do it for love but stopped in time this aint a good stair for stories he said cunningly i cant not tell stories on this stair but ii know a good stair for stories  the ninny of a girl was completely hoodwinked and see there they go each with a hand in the muff the one leering oh so triumphantly the other trusting and gleeful there was an exuberance of vitality about her as if she lived too quickly in her gladness which you may remember in some child who visited the earth for but a little while  how superbly tommy had done it it had been another keen brain pitted against his and at first he was not winning then up came thrums andbut the thing has happened before in a word blücher nevertheless tommy just managed it for he got the girl out of the street and on to another stair no more than in time to escape a ragged rabble headed by shovel who finding their quarry gone turned on their leader viciously and had gloomy views of life till his cap was kicked down a sewer which made the world bright again  of the tales told by tommy that day in words scotch and cockney of thrums home of heroes and the arts where the lamps are lit by a magician called leerieleerielichtthelamps but he is also friendly and you can fling stones at him and the merest children are allowed to set the spinningwheels awhirling and dagont is the swear and the stairs are so fine that the houses wear them outside for show and you drop a pail at the end of a rope down a hole and sometimes it comes up full of water and sometimes full of fairiesof these and other wonders if you would know ask not a dull historian nor even go to thrums but to those rather who have been boys and girls there and now are exiles such a one tommy knows an unhappy woman foolish not very lovable flung like a stone out of the red quarry upon a land where it cannot grip and tearing her heart for a sight of the home she shall see no more from her tommy had his pictures and he colored them rarely  never before had he such a listener oh dagont dagont he would cry in ecstasy over these fair scenes and she awed or gurgling with mirth according to the nature of the last demanded nother nother whereat he remembered who and what she was and showing her a morsel of the new one drew her to more distant parts until they were so far from his street that he thought she would never be able to find the way back  his intention had been on reaching such a spot to desert her promptly but she gave him her hand in the muff so confidingly that against his judgment he fell apitying the trustful mite who was wandering the world in search of a mother and so easily diddled on the whole that the chances were against her finding one before morning almost unconsciously he began to look about him for a suitable one  they were now in a street much nearer to his own home than the spurts from spot to spot had led him to suppose it was new to him but he recognized it as the acme of fashion by those two sure signs railings with most of their spikes in place and cards scored with the word apartments he had discovered such streets as this before when in shovels company and they had watched the toffs go out and in and it was a lordly sight for first the toff waggled a rail that was loose at the top and then a girl called the servant peeped at him from below and then he pulled the rail again and then the door opened from the inside and you had a glimpse of wonderland with a place for hanging hats on he had not contemplated doing anything so handsome for the girl as this but why should he not establish her here there were many possible mothers in view and thrilling with a sense of his generosity he had almost fixed on one but mistrusted the glint in her eye and on another when she saved herself by tripping and showing an undarned heel  he was still of an open mind when the girl of a sudden cried gleefully mama mama and pointed with her muff across the street the word was as meaningless to tommy as mother had been to her but he saw that she was drawing his attention to a woman some thirty yards away  manman he echoed chiding her ignorance no no you blether that aint a man thats a woman thats womanwoman  oomanooman the girl repeated docilely but when she looked again mama mama she insisted and this was tommys first lesson that however young you catch them they will never listen to reason  she seemed of a mind to trip off to this woman and as long as his own mother was safe it did not greatly matter to tommy whom she chose but if it was this one she was going the wrong way about it you cannot snap them up in the street  the proper course was to track her to her house which he proceeded to do and his quarry who was looking about her anxiously as if she had lost something gave him but a short chase in the next street to the one in which they had first seen her a street so like it that tommy might have admired her for knowing the difference she opened the door with a key and entered shutting the door behind her odd to tell the child had pointed to this door as the one she would stop at which surprised tommy very much  on the steps he gave her his final instructions and she dimpled and gurgled obviously full of admiration for him which was a thing he approved of but he would have liked to see her a little more serious  that is the door well then ill waggle the rail as makes the bell ring and then ill run  that was all and he wished she had not giggled most of the time she was sniggering as if she thought him a very funny boy even when he rang the bell and bolted  from a safe place he watched the opening of the door and saw the frivolous thing lose a valuable second in waving the muff to him in you go he screamed beneath his breath then she entered and the door closed he waited an hour or two minutes or thereabout and she had not been ejected triumph  with a drum beating inside him tommy strutted home where alas a boy was waiting to put his foot through it     chapter ii  but the other gets in   to tommy a swaggerer came shovel sourvisaged having now no cap of his own he exchanged with tommy would also have bled the blooming mouth of him but knew of a revenge that saves the knuckles announced with jeers and offensive finger exercise that it had come  shovel was a liar if he only knowed what tommy knowed  if tommy only heard what shovel had heard  tommy was of opinion that shovel hadnt not heard anything  shovel believed as tommy didnt know nuthin  tommy wouldnt listen to what shovel had heard  neither would shovel listen to what tommy knew  if shovel would tell what he had heard tommy would tell what he knew  well then shovel had listened at the door and heard it mewling  tommy knowed it well and it never mewled  how could tommy know it  cos he had been with it a long time  gosh why it had only comed a minute ago  this made tommy uneasy and he asked a leading question cunningly a boy wasnt it  no shovels old woman had been up helping to hold it and she said it were a girl  shutting his mouth tightly which was never natural to him the startled tommy mounted the stair listened and was convinced he did not enter his dishonored home he had no intention of ever entering it again with one salt tear he renounceda child a mother  on his way downstairs he was received by shovel and party who planted their arrows neatly kids cried steadily he was told for the first year a boy one was bad enough but a girl one was oh lawks he must never again expect to get playing with blokes like what they was already she had got round his old gal who would care for him no more what would they say about this in thrums  shovel even insisted on returning him his cap and for some queer reason this cut deepest tommy about to charge with his head down now walked away so quietly that shovel who could not help liking the funny little cuss felt a twinge of remorse and nearly followed him with a magnanimous offer to treat him as if he were still respectable  tommy lay down on a distant stair one of the very stairs where she had sat with him ladies dont you dare to pity him now for he wont stand it rage was what he felt and a man in a rage as you may know if you are married is only to be soothed by the sight of all womankind in terror of him but you may look upon your handiwork and gloat an you will on the wreck you have made a young gentleman trusted one of you behold the result o o o o now do you understand why we men cannot abide you  if she had told him flat that his mother and his alone she would have and so there was an end of it ah catch them taking a straight road but to put on those airs of helplessness to wave him that gay goodby and then the moment his back was turned to be off through the air onperhaps on her muff to the home he had thought to lure her from in a word to be diddled by a girl when one flatters himself he is diddling sdeath a dashing fellow finds it hard to bear nevertheless he has to bear it for oh tommy tommy tis the common lot of man  his hand sought his pocket for the penny that had brought him comfort in dark hours before now but alack she had deprived him even of it never again should his pinkie finger go through that warm hole and at the thought a sense of his forlornness choked him and he cried you may pity him a little now  darkness came and hid him even from himself he is not found again until a time of the night that is not marked on ornamental clocks but has an hour to itself on the watch which a hundred thousand or so of london women carry in their breasts the hour when men steal homewards trickling at the mouth and drawing back from their own shadows to the wives they once went amaying with or the mothers who had such travail at the bearing of them as if for great ends out of this the drunkards hour rose the wan face of tommy who had waked up somewhere clammy cold and quaking and he was a very little boy so he ran to his mother  such a shabby dark room it was but it was home such a weary worn woman in the bed but he was her son and she had been wringing her hands because he was so long in coming and do you think he hurt her when he pressed his head on her poor breast and do you think she grudged the heat his cold hands drew from her warm face he squeezed her with a violence that put more heat into her blood than he took out of it  and he was very considerate too not a word of reproach in him though he knew very well what that bundle in the back of the bed was  she guessed that he had heard the news and stayed away through jealousy of his sister and by and by she said with a faint smile i have a present for you laddie in the great world without she used few thrums words now you would have known she was scotch by her accent only but when she and tommy were together in that room with the door shut she always spoke as if her window still looked out on the bonny marywellbrae it is not really bonny it is gey an mean an bleak and you must not come to see it it is just a steep windswept street old and wrinkled like your mothers face  she had a present for him she said and tommy replied i knows with averted face  such a bonny thing  bonny enough he said bitterly  look at her laddie  but he shrank from the ordeal crying no no keep her covered up  the little traitor seemed to be asleep and so he ventured to say eagerly it wouldnt not take long to carry all our things to another house would it me and shovel could near do it ourselves  and thats gods truth the woman said with a look round the room but what for should we do that  do you no see mother he whispered excitedly then you and me could slip away andand leave herin the press  the feeble smile with which his mother received this he interpreted thus wherever we god to she would be there before us  the little besom he cried helplessly  his mother saw that mischievous boys had been mounting him on his horse which needed only one slap to make it go a mile but she was a spiritless woman and replied indifferently youre a funny litlin  presently a dry sob broke from her and thinking the child was the cause softhearted tommy said it cant not be helped mother dont cry mother im fond on yer yet mother ii took her away i found another womanbut she would come  shes gods gift man his mother said but she added in a different tone ay but he hasna sent her keep  gods gift tommy shuddered but he said sourly i wish he would take her back do you wish that too mother  the weary woman almost said she did but her armsthey gripped the baby as if frightened that he had sent for it jealous tommy suddenly deprived of his mothers hand cried its true what shovel says you dont not love me never again you jest loves that little limmer  na na the mother answered passionate at last she can never be to me what you hae been my laddie for you came to me when my hame was in hell and we tholed it thegither you and me  this bewildered though it comforted him he thought his mother might be speaking about the room in which they had lived until six months ago when his father was put into the black box but when he asked her if this were so she told him to sleep for she was dogtired she always evaded him in this way when he questioned her about his past but at times his mind would wander backwards unbidden to those distant days and then he saw flitting dimly through them the elusive form of a child he knew it was himself and for moments he could see it clearly but when he moved a step nearer it was not there so does the child we once were play hide and seek with us among the mists of infancy until one day he trips and falls into the daylight then we seize him and with that touch we two are one it is the birth of selfconsciousness  hitherto he had slept at the back of his mothers bed but tonight she could not have him there the place being occupied and rather sulkily he consented to lie crosswise at her feet undressing by the feeble fire and taking care as he got into bed not to look at the usurper his mother watched him furtively and was relieved to read in his face that he had no recollection of ever having slept at the foot of a bed before but soon after he fell asleep he awoke and was afraid to move lest his father should kick him he opened his eyes stealthily and this was neither the room nor the bed he had expected to see  the floor was bare save for a sheepskin beside the bed tommy always stood on the sheepskin while he was dressing because it was warm to the feet though risky as your toes sometimes caught in knots in it there was a deal table in the middle of the floor with some dirty crockery on it and a kettle that would leave a mark but they had been left there by shovels old girl for mrs sandys usually kept her house clean the chairs were of the commonest and the press door would not remain shut unless you stuck a knife between its halves but there was a gay blue wardrobe spotted white where tommys mother had scraped off the mud that had once bespattered it during a lengthy sojourn at the door of a shop and on the mantelpiece was a clock in a little brown and yellow house and on the clock a bible that had been in thrums but what tommy was proudest of was his mothers kist to which the chests of londoners are not to be compared though like it in appearance on the inside of the lid of this kist was pasted after a thrums custom something that his mother called her marriage lines which she forced shovels mother to come up and look at one day when that lady had made an innuendo tommy did not understand and shovels mother had looked and though she could not read was convinced knowing them by the shape  tommy lay at the foot of the bed looking at this room which was his home now and trying to think of the other one and by and by the fire helped him by falling to ashes when darkness came in and packing the furniture in grotesque cloths removed it piece by piece all but the clock then the room took a new shape the fireplace was over there instead of here the torn yellow blind gave way to one made of spars of green wood that were bunched up at one side like a lady out for a walk on a round table there was a beautiful blue cloth with very few gravy marks and here a man ate beef when a woman and a boy ate bread and near the fire was the mans big soft chair out of which you could pull hairs just as if it were shovels sister  of this man who was his father he could get no hold he could feel his presence but never see him yet he had a face it sometimes pressed tommys face against it in order to hurt him which it could do being all short needles at the chin  once in those days tommy and his mother ran away and hid from some one he did not know from whom nor for how long though it was but for a week and it left only two impressions on his mind the one that he often asked is this starving now mother the other that before turning a corner she always peered round it fearfully then they went back again to the man and he laughed when he saw them but did not take his feet off the mantelpiece there came a time when the man was always in bed but still tommy could not see his face what he did see was the mans clothes lying on the large chair just as he had placed them there when he undressed for the last time the black coat and worsted waistcoat which he could take off together were on the seat and the light trousers hung over the side the legs on the hearthrug with the red socks still sticking in them a man without a body  but the boy had one vivid recollection of how his mother received the news of his fathers death an old man with a white beard and gentle ways who often came to give the invalid physic was standing at the bedside and tommy and his mother were sitting on the fender the old man came to her and said it is all over and put her softly into the big chair she covered her face with her hands and he must have thought she was crying for he tried to comfort her but as soon as he was gone she rose with such a queer face and went on tiptoe to the bed and looked intently at her husband and then she clapped her hands joyously three times  at last tommy fell asleep with his mouth open which is the most important thing that has been told of him as yet and while he slept day came and restored the furniture that night had stolen but when the boy woke he did not even notice the change his brain traversed the hours it had lost since he lay down as quickly as you may put on a stopped clock and with his first tick he was thinking of nothing but the deceiver in the back of the bed he raised his head but could only see that she had crawled under the coverlet to escape his wrath his mother was asleep tommy sat up and peeped over the edge of the bed then he let his eyes wander round the room he was looking for the girls clothes but they were nowhere to be seen it is distressing to have to tell that what was in his mind was merely the recovery of his penny perhaps as they were sunday clothes she had hung them up in the wardrobe he slipped on to the floor and crossed to the wardrobe but not even the muff could he find had she been tired and gone to bed in them very softly he crawled over his mother and pulling the coverlet off the childs face got the great shock of his childhood  it was another one     chapter iii  showing how tommy was suddenly transformed into a young gentleman   it would have fared ill with mrs sandys now had her standoffishness to her neighbors been repaid in the same coin but they were full of sympathy especially shovels old girl from whom she had often drawn back offensively on the stair but who nevertheless waddled up several times a day with savory messes explaining when mrs sandys sniffed that it was not the tapiocar but merely the cup that smelt of gin when tommy returned the cups she noticed not only that they were suspiciously clean but that minute particles of the mess were adhering to his nose and chin perched there like shipwrecked mariners on a rock just out of reach of the devouring element and after this discovery she brought two cupfuls at a time she was an irish woman who could have led the house of commons and in walking she seldom raised her carpet shoes from the ground perhaps because of her weight for she had an expansive figure that bulged in all directions and there were always bits of her here and there that she had forgotten to lace round the corner was a delightful eatinghouse through whose window you were allowed to gaze at the great sweating dumplings and tommy thought shovels mother was rather like a dumpling that had not been a complete success if he ever knew her name he forgot it shovel who probably had another name also called her his old girl or his old woman or his old lady and it was a sight to see her chasing him across the street when she was in liquor and boastful was shovel of the way she could lay on and he was partial to her too and once when she was giving it to him pretty strong with the tongs his father who followed many professions among them that of finding lost dogs had struck her and told her to drop it and then shovel sauced his father for interfering saying she should lick him as long as she blooming well liked which made his father go for him with a dogcollar and that was how shovel lost his eye  for reasons less unselfish than his old girls shovel also was willing to make up to tommy at this humiliating time it might be said of these two boys that shovel knew everything but tommy knew other things and as the other things are best worth hearing of shovel liked to listen to them even when they were about thrums as they usually were the very first time tommy told him of the wondrous spot shovel had drawn a great breath and said thoughtfully  i allers knowed as there were sich a beauty place but i didnt jest know its name  how could yer know tommy asked jealously  i aint sure said shovel praps i dreamed on it  thats it tommy cried i tell yer everybody dreams on it and tommy was right everybody dreams of it though not all call it thrums  on the whole then the coming of the kid who turned out to be called elspeth did not ostracize tommy but he wished that he had let the other girl in for he never doubted that her admittance would have kept this one out he told neither his mother nor his friend of the other girl fearing that his mother would be angry with him when she learned what she had missed and that shovel would crow over his blundering but occasionally he took a side glance at the victorious infant and a poorer affair he thought he had never set eyes on sometimes it was she who looked at him and then her chuckle of triumph was hard to bear as long as his mother was there however he endured in silence but the first day she went out in a vain search for work it is about as difficult to get washing as to get into the cabinet he gave the infant a piece of his mind poking up her head with a stick so that she was bound to listen  you thinks as it was clever on you does yer oh if i had been on the stair  you neednt not try to get round me i likes the other one five times better yes three times better  thievey thievey thief thats her place you is lying in what  if you puts out your tongue at me again what do yer say  she was twice bigger than you you aint got no hair nor yet no teeth youre the littlest i ever seed eh dont not speak then sulks  prudence had kept him away from the other girl but he was feeling a great want someone to applaud him when we grow older we call it sympathy how reddy as he called her because she had beautiful redbrown hair had appreciated him she had a way he liked of opening her eyes very wide when she looked at him oh what a difference from that thing in the back of the bed  not the mere selfish desire to see her again however would take him in quest of reddy he was one of those superior characters was tommy who got his pleasure in giving it and therefore gave it now reddy was a worthy girl in suspecting her of overreaching him he had maligned her she had taken what he offered and been thankful it was fitting that he should give her a treat let her see him again  his mother was at last reengaged by her old employers her supplanter having proved unsatisfactory and as the work lay in a distant street she usually took the kid with her thus leaving no one to spy on tammys movements reddys reward for not playing him false however did not reach her as soon as doubtless she would have liked because the first two or three times he saw her she was walking with the lady of his choice and of course he was not such a fool as to show himself but he walked behind them and noted with satisfaction that the lady seemed to be reconciled to her lot and inclined to let bygones be bygones when at length reddy and her patron met tommy thought this a good sign too that mama as she would call the lady had told her not to go farther away than the lamppost lest she should get lost again so evidently she had got lost once already and the lady had been sorry he asked reddy many shrewd questions about how mama treated her and if she got the top of the sunday egg and had the licking of the pan and wore flannel underneath and slept at the back and the more he inquired the more clearly he saw that he had got her one of the right kind  tommy arranged with her that she should always be on the outlook for him at the window and he would come sometimes and after that they met frequently and she proved a credit to him gurgling with mirth at his tales of thrums and pinching him when he had finished to make sure that he was really made just like common human beings he was a thin pale boy while she looked like a baby rose full blown in a night because her time was short and his movements were sluggish but if she was not walking she must be dancing and sometimes when there were few people in the street the little armful of delight that she was jumped up and down like a ball while tommy kept the time singing thrummy thrummy thrum thrum thrummy they must have seemed a quaint pair to the lady as she sat at her window watching them and beckoning to tommy to come in  one day he went in but only because she had come up behind and taken his hand before he could run then did tommy quake for he knew from reddy how the day after the mothermaking episode mama and she had sought in vain for his door and he saw that the object had been to call down curses on his head so that head was hanging limply now  you think that tommy is to be worsted at last but dont be too sure you just wait and see mama and reddy who was clucking rather heartlessly first took him into a room prettier even than the one he had lived in long ago but there was no bed in it and then because someone they were in search of was not there into another room without a bed where on earth did they sleep whose walls were lined with books never having seen rows of books before except on sale in the streets tommy at once looked about him for the barrow the table was strewn with sheets of paper of the size that they roll a quarter of butter in and it was an amazing thick table a solid square of wood save for a narrow lane down the centre for the man to put his legs inif he had legs which unfortunately there was reason to doubt he was a formidable man whose beard licked the table while he wrote and he wore something like a brown blanket with a rope tied round it at the middle even more uncanny than himself were three busts on a shelf which tommy took to be deaders and he feared the blanket might blow open and show that the man also ended at the waist but he did not for presently he turned round to see who had come in the seat of his chair turning with him in the most startling way and then tommy was relieved to notice two big feet far away at the end of him  this is the boy dear the lady said i had to bring him in by force  tommy raised his arm instinctively to protect his face this being the kind of man who could hit hard but presently he was confused and also alas leering a little you may remember that reddy had told him she must not go beyond the lamppost lest she should be lost again she had given him no details of the adventure but he learned now from mama and papa the mans name was papa that she had strayed when mama was in a shop and that some good kind boy had found her and brought her home and what do you say to this they thought tommy was that boy in his amazement he very nearly blurted out that he was the other boy but just then the lady asked papa if he had a shilling and this abruptly closed tommys mouth ever afterwards he remembered papa as the man that was not sure whether he had a shilling until he felt his pocketsa new kind of mortal to tommy who grabbed the shilling when it was offered to him and then looked at reddy imploringly he was so afraid she would tell but she behaved splendidly and never even shook her head at him after this as hardly need be told his one desire was to get out of the house with his shilling before they discovered their mistake and it was well that they were unsuspicious people for he was making strange hissing sounds in his throat the result of trying hard to keep his sniggers under control  there were many ways in which tommy could have disposed of his shilling he might have been a good boy and returned it next day to papa he might have given reddy half of it for not telling it could have carried him over the winter he might have stalked with it into the shop where the greasy puddings were and come rolling out hours afterwards some of these schemes did cross his little mind but he decided to spend the whole shilling on a present to his mother and it was to be something useful he devoted much thought to what she was most in need of and at last he bought her a colored picture of lord byron swimming the hellespont  he told her that he got his shilling from two toffs for playing with a little girl and the explanation satisfied her but she could have cried at the waste of the money which would have been such a godsend to her he cried altogether however at sight of her face having expected it to look so pleased and then she told him with caresses that the picture was the one thing she had been longing for ever since she came to london how had he known this she asked and he clapped his hands gleefully and said he just knowed when he saw it in the shop window  it was noble of you she said to spend all your siller on me  wasnt it mother he crowed im thinking there aint many as noble as i is  he did not say why he had been so good to her but it was because she had written no letters to thrums since the intrusion of elspeth a strange reason for a boy whose greatest glory at one time had been to sit on the fender and exultingly watch his mother write down words that would be read aloud in the wonderful place she was a long time in writing a letter but that only made the whole evening romantic and he found an arduous employment in keeping his tongue wet in preparation for the licking of the stamp  but she could not write to the thrums folk now without telling them of elspeth who was at present sleeping the sleep of the shameless in the hollow of the bed and so for his sake tommy thought she meant to write no more for his sake mark you not for her own she had often told him that some day he should go to thrums but not with her she would be far away from him then in a dark place she was awid to be lying in thus it seemed to tommy that she denied herself the pleasure of writing to thrums lest the sorry news of elspeths advent should spoil his reception when he went north  so grateful tommy gave her the picture hoping that it would fill the void but it did not she put it on the mantelpiece so that she might just sit and look at it she said and he grinned at it from every part of the room but when he returned to her he saw that she was neither looking at it nor thinking of it she was looking straight before her and sometimes her lips twitched and then she drew them into her mouth to keep them still it is a kind of dry weeping that sometimes comes to miserable ones when their minds stray into the happy past and tommy sat and watched her silently for a long time never doubting that the cause of all her woe was that she could not write to thrums  he had seldom seen tears on his mothers face but he saw one now they had been reluctant to come for many a day and this one formed itself beneath her eye and sat there like a blob of blood  his own began to come more freely but she neednt not expect him to tell her to write nor to say that he didnt care what thrums thought of him so long as she was happy  the tear rolled down his mothers thin cheek and fell on the grey shawl that had come from thrums  she did not hear her boy as he dragged a chair to the press and standing on it got something down from the top shelf she had forgotten him and she started when presently the pen was slipped into her hand and tommy said you can do it mother i wants yer to do it mother i wont not greet mother  when she saw what he wanted her to do she patted his face approvingly but without realizing the extent of his sacrifice she knew that he had some maggot in his head that made him regard elspeth as a sore on the family honor but ascribing his views to jealousy she had never tried seriously to change them her main reason for sending no news to thrums of late had been but the cost of the stamp though she was also a little consciencestricken at the kind of letters she wrote and the sight of the materials lying ready for her proved sufficient to draw her to the table  is it to your grandmother you is writing the letter tommy asked for her grandmother had brought mrs sandys up and was her only surviving relative this was all tommy knew of his mothers life in thrums though she had told him much about other thrums folk and not till long afterwards did he see that there must be something queer about herself which she was hiding from him  this letter was not for her granny however and tommy asked next is it to aaron latta which so startled her that she dropped the pen  whaur heard you that name she said sharply i never spoke it to you  ive heard you saying it when you was sleeping mother  did i say onything but the name quick tell me  you said oh aaron latta oh aaron little did we think aaron and things like that are you angry with me mother  no she said relieved but it was some time before the desire to write came back to her then she told him the letter is to a woman that was gey cruel to me adding with a complacent pursing of her lips the curious remark thats the kind i like to write to best  the pen went scrape scrape but tommy did not weary though he often sighed because his mother would never read aloud to him what she wrote the thrums people never answered her letters for the reason she said that those she wrote to could not write which seemed to simple tommy to be a sufficient explanation so he had never heard the inside of a letter talking though a postman lived in the house and even shovels old girl got letters once when her uncle died she got a telegram which shovel proudly wheeled up and down the street in a barrow other blokes keeping guard at the side to give a letter to a woman who had been cruel to you struck tommy as the height of nobility  shell be uplifted when she gets it he cried  shell be mad when she gets it answered his mother without looking up  this was the letter  my dear estheri send you these few scrapes to let you see i have not forgot you though my way is now grand by yours a spleet new black silk esther being the second in a twelvemonth as im a living woman the other is no none tashed yet but my gudeman fair insisted on

land namely tapiocas and sherry wine tell aaron latta that  i pity you from the bottom of my heart esther for having to bide in thrums but you have never seen no better your man having neither the

companion which is a young gentleman of ladylike manners as bides in our terrace so no more at present for my man is sitting ganting for my society and i daresay yours is crying to you to darn his old socks mind and tell aaron latta  this letter was posted next day by tommy with the assistance of shovel who seems to have been the young gentleman of ladylike manners referred to in the text     chapter iv  the end of an idyll   tommy never saw reddy again owing to a fright he got about this time for which she was really to blame though a woman who lived in his house was the instrument  it is perhaps idle to attempt a summary of those who lived in that house as one at least will be off and another in his place while we are giving them a line apiece they were usually this kind who lived through the wall from mrs sandys but beneath her were the two rooms of hankey the postman and his lodger the dreariest of middleaged clerks except when telling wistfully of his ambition which was to get out of the tea department into the coffee department where there is an easier way of counting up the figures shovel and family were also on this floor and in the rooms under them was a newly married couple when the husband was away at his work his wife would make some change in the furniture taking the picture from this wall for instance and hanging it on that wall or wheeling the funny chair she had lain in before she could walk without a crutch to the other side of the fireplace or putting a skirt of yellow paper round the flower pot and when he returned he always jumped back in wonder and exclaimed what an immense improvement these two were so fond of one another that tommy asked them the reason and they gave it by pointing to the chair with the wheels which seemed to him to be no reason at all what was this young husbands trade tommy never knew but he was the only prettily dressed man in the house and he could be heard roaring in his sleep and the next article the meanest looking man lived next door to him every morning this man put on a clean white shirt which sounds like a splendid beginning but his other clothes were of the seediest and he came and went shivering raising his shoulders to his ears and spreading his hands over his chest as if anxious to hide his shirt rather than to display it he and the happy husband were nicknamed before and after they were so like the pictorial advertisement of man before and after he has tried someones lozenges but it is rash to judge by outsides tommy and shovel one day tracked before to his place of business and it proved to be a palatial eatinghouse long narrow padded with red cushions through the door they saw the once despised now in beautiful black clothes the waistcoat a mere nothing as if to give his shirt a chance at last a towel over his arm and to and fro he darted saying yessirquitesosir to the toffs on the seats shouting twovegonebeefonebeeronetartinahurry to someone invisible and pocketing twopences all day long just like a lord on the same floor as before and after lived the large family of little pikes who quarrelled at night for the middle place in the bed and then chips of ceiling fell into the room below tenant jim ricketts and parents lodger the young woman we have been trying all these doors for her the police snapped up on a charge that made tommy want to hide himselfchilddesertion  shovel was the person best worth listening to on the subject observe him the centre of half a dozen boys and at first he was for the defence being a great stickler for the rights of mothers but when the case against the girl leaked out she need not look to him for help the police had found the child in a basket down an area and being knowing ones they pinched it to make it cry and then they pretended to go away soon the mother who was watching hard by to see if it fell into kind hands stole to her baby to comfort it and just as she were a kissing on it and blubbering the perlice copped her  the slut said disgusted shovel what did she hang about for and in answer to a trembling question from tommy he replied decisively six months hard  next case was probably called immediately but tommy vanished as if he had been sentenced and removed to the cells  never again unless he wanted six months hard must he go near reddys home and so he now frequently accompanied his mother to the place where she worked the little room had a funny fireplace called a stove on which his mother made tea and the girls roasted chestnuts and it had no other ordinary furniture except a long form but the walls were mysterious three of them were covered with long white cloths which went to the side when you tugged them and then you could see on rails dozens of garments that looked like nightgowns beneath the form were scores of little shoes most of them white or brown in this house tommys mother spent eight hours daily but not all of them in this room when she arrived the first thing she did was to put elspeth on the floor because you cannot fall off a floor then she went upstairs with a bucket and a broom to a large bare room where she stayed so long that tommy nearly forgot what she was like  while his mother was upstairs tommy would give elspeth two or three shoes to eat to keep her quiet and then he played with the others pretending to be able to count them arranging them in designs shooting them swimming among them saying bowwow at them and then turning sharply to see who had said it soon elspeth dropped her shoes and gazed in admiration at him but more often than not she laughed in the wrong place and then he said ironically oh in course i cant do nothin jest lets see you doing of it then cocky  by the time the girls began to arrive singly or in twos and threes his mother was back in the little room making tea for herself or sewing bits of them that had been torn as they stepped out of a cab or helping them to put on the nightgowns or pretending to listen pleasantly to their chatter and hating them all the time there was every kind of them gorgeous ones and shabby ones old tired ones and dashing young ones but whether they were the honorable mrs something or only jane anything they all came to that room for the same purpose to get a little gown and a pair of shoes then they went upstairs and danced to a stout little lady called the sylph who bobbed about like a ball at the end of a piece of elastic what tommy never forgot was that while they danced the sylph kept saying one two three four one two three four which they did not seem to mind but when she said one two three four picture they all stopped and stood motionless though it might be with one foot as high as their head and their arms stretched out toward the floor as if they had suddenly seen a halfpenny there  in the waitingroom how they joked and pirouetted and gossiped and hugged and scorned each other and what slang they spoke and how pretty they often looked next moment and how they denounced the one that had just gone out as a cat with whom you could not get in a word edgeways and oh how prompt they were to give a slice of their earnings to any cat who was hard up but still they said she had talent but no genius how they pitied people without genius  have you ever tasted an encore or a reception tommy never had his teeth in one but he heard much about them in that room and concluded that they were some sort of cake it was not the girls who danced in groups but those who danced alone that spoke of their encores and receptions and sometimes they had got them last night sometimes years ago two girls met in the room one of whom had stolen the others reception andbut it was too dreadful to write about most of them carried newspaper cuttings in their purses and read them aloud to the others who would not listen tommy listened however and as it was all about how one house had risen at the girls and they had brought another down he thought they led the most adventurous lives  occasionally they sent him out to buy newspapers or chestnuts and then he had to keep a sharp eye on the police lest they knew about reddy it was a point of honor with all the boys he knew to pretend that the policeman was after them to gull the policeman into thinking all was well they blackened their faces and wore their jackets inside out their occupation was a constant state of readiness to fly from him and when he tramped out of sight unconscious of their existence they emerged from dark places and spoke in exultant whispers tommy had been proud to join them but he now resented their going on in this way he felt that he alone had the right to fly from the law and once at least while he was flying something happened to him that he was to remember better far better than his mothers face  what set him running on this occasion he had been sent out to get one of the girls shoes soled was the grandest sight to be seen in londonan endless row of policemen walking in single file all with the right leg in the air at the same time then the left leg seeing at once that they were after him tommy ran ran ran until in turning a corner he found himself wedged between two legs he was of just sufficient size to fill the aperture but after a momentary look he squeezed through and they proved to be the gate into an enchanted land  the magic began at once dagont you sacket cried some wizard  a policemans hand on his shoulder could not have taken the wind out of tommy more quickly in the act of starting arunning again he brought down his hind foot with a thud and stood stock still can any one wonder it was the thrums tongue and this the first time he had heard it except from his mother  it was a dull day and all the walls were dripping wet this being the part of london where the fogs are kept many men and women were passing to and fro and tommy with a wild exultation in his breast peered up at the face of this one and that but no they were only ordinary people and he played rubadub with his feet on the pavement so furious was he with them for moving on as if nothing had happened draw up ye carters pedestrians stand still london silence for a moment and let tommy sandys listen  being but a frail plant in the way of a flood tommy was rooted up and borne onward but he did not feel the buffeting in a passion of grief he dug his fists in his eyes for the glory had been his for but a moment it can be compared to nothing save the parcel attached to a concealed string which shovel and he once placed on the stair for billy hankey to find and then whipped away from him just as he had got it under his arm but so near the crying tommy did not cry for even while the tears were rushing to his aid he tripped on the step of a shop and immediately as if that had rung the magic bell again a voice a womans voice this time said shrilly threepence hapenny and them jimply as big as a bantams na na but ill gie you five bawbees  tommy sat down flop on the step feeling queer in the head was itwas itwas it thrums he knew he had been running a long time  the woman or fairy or whatever you choose to call her came out of the shop and had to push tommy aside to get past oh what a sweet foot to be kicked by at the time he thought she was dressed not unlike the women of his own stair but this defect in his vision he mended afterward as you may hear of course he rose and trotted by her side like a dog looking up at her as if she were a cathedral but she mistook his awe for impudence and sent him sprawling with the words tak that you glowering partan  do you think tommy resented this on the contrary he screamed from where he lay say it again say it again  she was gone however but only as it were to let a window open from which came the cry davit have you seen my man  a male fairy roared back from some invisible place he has gone yont to peteys wi the dambrod  ill dambrod him said the female fairy and the window shut  tommy was now staggering like one intoxicated but he had still some sense left him and he walked up and down in front of this house as if to take care of it in the middle of the street some boys were very busy at a game carts and lorries passing over them occasionally they came to the pavement to play marbles and then tommy noticed that one of them wore what was probably a glengarry bonnet could he be a thrums boy  at first he played in the stupid london way but by and by he had to make a new ring and he did it by whirling round on one foot tommy knew from his mother that it is only done in this way in thrums oho oho  by this time he was prancing round his discovery saying im one tooso am idagont does yer hear dagont which so alarmed the boy that he picked up his marble and fled tommy of course after him alas he must have been some mischievous sprite for he lured his pursuer back into london and then vanished and tommy searching in vain for the enchanted street found his own door instead  his mother poohpoohed his tale though he described the street exactly as it struck him on reflection and it bore a curious resemblance to the palace of aladdin that reddy had told him about leaving his imagination to fill in the details which it promptly did with a square a townhouse some outside stairs and an auld licht kirk there was no such street however his mother assured him he had been dreaming but if this were so why was she so anxious to make him promise never to look for the place again  he did go in search of it again daily for a time always keeping a lookout for bowlegs and the moment he saw them he dived recklessly between hoping to come out into fairyland on the other side for though he had lost the street he knew that this was the way in  shovel had never heard of the street nor had bob but bob gave him something that almost made him forget it for a time bob was his favorite among the dancing girls and sheor should it be he the odd thing about these girls was that a number of them were really boysor at least were boys at christmastime which seemed to tommy to be even stranger than if they had been boys all the year round a friend of bobs remarked to her one day you are to be a girl next winter aint you bob and bob shook her head scornfully  do you see any green in my eye my dear she inquired  her friend did not look but tommy looked and there was none he assured her of this so earnestly that bob fell in love with him on the spot and chucked him under the chin first with her thumb and then with her toe which feat was duly reported to shovel who could do it by the end of the week  did tommy bob wanted to know still think her a mere woman  no he withdrew the charge butbutshe was wearing her outdoor garments and he pointed to them why does yer wear them then he demanded  for the matter of that she replied pointing at his frock why do you wear them whereupon tommy began to cry  i aint not got no right ones he blubbered harumscarum bob who was a trump had him in her motherly arms immediately and the upshot of it was that a blue suit she had worn when she was sam something changed owners mrs sandys made it up and that is how tommy got into trousers  many contingencies were considered in the making but the suit would fit tommy by and by if he grew or it shrunk and they did not pass each other in the night when proud tommy first put on his suit the most unexpected shyness overcame him and having set off vaingloriously he stuck on the stair and wanted to hide shovel who had been having an argument with his old girl came all boastful bumps to him and tommy just stood still with a selfconscious simper on his face and shovel who could have damped him considerably behaved in the most honorable manner initiating him gravely into the higher life much as you show the new member round your club  it was very risky to go back to reddy whom he had not seen for many weeks but in trousers he could not help it he only meant to walk up and down her street so that she might see him from the window and know that this splendid thing was he but though he went several times into the street reddy never came to the window  the reason he had to wait in vain at reddys door was that she was dead she had been dead for quite a long time when tommy came back to look for her you mothers who have lost your babies i should be a sorry knave were i to ask you to cry now over the death of another womans child reddy had been lent to two people for a very little while just as your babies were and when the time was up she blew a kiss to them and ran gleefully back to god just as your babies did the gates of heaven are so easily found when we are little and they are always standing open to let children wander in  but though reddy was gone away forever mamma still lived in that house and on a day she opened the door to come out tommy was standing thereshe saw him there waiting for reddy dryeyed this sorrowful woman had heard the sentence pronounced dry eyed she had followed the little coffin to its grave tears had not come even when waking from illusive dreams she put out her hand in bed to a child who was not there but when she saw tommy waiting at the door for reddy who had been dead for a month her bosom moved and she could cry again  those tears were sweet to her husband and it was he who took tommy on his knee in the room where the books were and told him that there was no reddy now when tommy knew that reddy was a deader he cried bitterly and the man said very gently i am glad you were so fond of her  t aint that tommy answered with a knuckle in his eye t aint that as makes me cry he looked down at his trousers and in a fresh outburst of childish grief he wailed its them  papa did not understand but the boy explained she cant not never see them now he sobbed and i wants her to see them and they has pockets  it had come to the man unexpectedly he put tommy down almost roughly and raised his hand to his head as if he felt a sudden pain there  but tommy you know was only a little boy     chapter v  the girl with two mothers   elspeth at last did something to win tommys respect she fell ill of an ailment called in thrums the croop when tommy first heard his mother call it croop he thought she was merely humoring elspeth and that it was nothing more distinguished than london whoopingcough but on learning that it was genuine croop he began to survey the ambitious little creature with a new interest  this was well for elspeth as she had now to spend most of the day at home with him their mother whose health was failing through frequent attacks of bronchitis being no longer able to carry her through the streets of course elspeth took to repaying his attentions by loving him and he soon suspected it and then gloomily admitted it to himself but never to shovel being but an englishman shovel saw no reason why relatives should conceal their affection for each other but he played on this scottish weakness of tommys with cruel enjoyment  shes fond on yer he would say severely  yous a liar  gar long i believe as youre fond on her  you jest take care shovel  aint yer  nao  will yer swear  so i will swear  lets hear yer  dagont  so for a time the truth was kept hidden and shovel retired casting aspersions and offering to eat all the hair on elspeths head for a penny  this hair was white at present which made tommy uneasy about her future but on the whole he thought he might make something of her if she was only longer sometimes he stretched her on the floor pulling her legs out straight for she had a silly way of doubling them up and then he measured her carefully with his mothers old boots her growth proved to be distressingly irregular as one day she seemed to have grown an inch since last night and then next day she had shrunk two inches  after her days work mrs sandys was now so listless that had not tommy interfered elspeth would have been a backward child reddy had been able to walk from the first day and so of course had he but this little slowcoachs legs wobbled at the joints like the blade of a knife without a spring the question of questions was how to keep her on end  tommy sat on the fender revolving this problem his head resting on his hand that favorite position of mighty intellects when about to be photographed elspeth lay on her stomach on the floor gazing earnestly at him as if she knew she was in his thoughts for some stupendous purpose thus the apple may have looked at newton before it fell  hankey the postman compelled the flowers in his window to stand erect by tying them to sticks so tommy took two sticks from a bundle of firewood and splicing elspeths legs to them held her upright against the door with one hand all he asked of her today was to remain in this position after he said one two three four picture and withdrew his hand but down she flopped every time and he said with scorn  you aint got no genius you has just talent  but he had her in bed with the scratches nicely covered up before his mother came home  he tried another plan with more success lost dogs it may be remembered had a habit of following shovels father and he not only took the wanderers in but taught them how to beg and shake hands and walk on two legs tommy had sometimes been present at these agreeable exercises and being an inventive boy hebut as elspeth was a nice girl let it suffice to pause here and add shyly that in time she could walk  he also taught her to speak and if you need to be told with what luscious word he enticed her into language you are sentenced to reread the first pages of his life  thrums he would say persuasively thrums thrums you opens your mouth like this and shuts it like this and thats it yet when he had coaxed her thus for many days what does she do but break her long silence with the word tommy the recoil knocked her over  soon afterward she brought down a bigger bird no londoner can say auld licht and tommy had often crowed over shovels ol likt when the testing of elspeth could be deferred no longer he eyed her with the look a hen gives the green egg on which she has been sitting twenty days but elspeth triumphed saying the words modestly even as if nothing inside her told her she had that day done something which would have baffled shakespeare not to speak of most of the gentlemen who sit for scotch constituencies  reddy couldnt say it tommy cried exultantly and from that great hour he had no more fears for elspeth  next the alphabet knocked for admission and entered first m and p which had prominence in the only poster visible from the window mrs sandys had taught tommy his letters but he had got into words by studying posters  elspeth being able now to make the perilous descent of the stairs tommy guided her through the streets letting go hurriedly if shovel hove in sight and here she bagged new letters daily with catlings something which is the best she got into capital cs ys are found easily when you know where to look for them they hang on behind ns are never found singly but often three at a time q is so aristocratic that even tommy had only heard of it doubtless it was there but indistinguishable among the masses like a celebrity in a crowd on the other hand big a and little e were so dirt cheap that these two scholars passed them with something very like a sneer  the printingpress is either the greatest blessing or the greatest curse of modern times one sometimes forgets which elspeths faith in it was absolute and as it only spoke to her from placards here was her religion at the age of four  pray without ceasing happy are they who needing know the painless porous plaster  of religion tommy had said many fine things to her embellishments on the simple doctrine taught him by his mother before the miseries of this world made her indifferent to the next but the meaning of pray without ceasing elspeth who was gods child always seemed to find out for herself and it cured all her troubles she prayed promptly for every one she saw doing wrong including shovel who occasionally had words with tommy on the subject and she not only prayed for her mother but proposed to tommy that they should buy her a porous plaster mrs sandys had been down with bronchitis again  tommy raised the monetary difficulty  elspeth knew where there was some money and it was her very own  tommy knew where there was money and it was his very own  elspeth would not tell how much she had and it was twopence halfpenny  neither would tommy tell and it was twopence  tommy would get a surprise on his birthday  so would elspeth get a surprise on her birthday  elspeth would not tell what the surprise was to be and it was to be a gun  tommy also must remain mute and it was to be a box of dominoes  elspeth did not want dominoes  tommy knew that but he wanted them  elspeth discovered that guns cost fourpence and dominoes threepence halfpenny it seemed to her therefore that tommy was defrauding her of a halfpenny  tommy liked her cheek you got the dominoes for threepence halfpenny but the price on the box is fivepence so that elspeth would really owe him a penny  this led to an agonizing scene in which elspeth wept while tommy told her sternly about reddy it had become his custom to tell the tale of reddy when elspeth was obstreperous  then followed a scene in which tommy called himself a scoundrel for frightening his dear elspeth and swore that he loved none but her result reconciliation and agreed that instead of a gun and dominoes they should buy a porous plaster you know the shops where the plasters are to be obtained by great colored bottles in their windows and as it was advisable to find the very best shop tommy and elspeth in their wanderings came under the influence of the bottles red yellow green and blue and color entered into their lives giving them many delicious thrills these bottles are the first poem known to the london child and you chemists who are beginning to do without them in your windows should be told that it is a shame  in the glamour then of the romantic battles walked tommy and elspeth hand in hand meeting so many novelties that they might have spared a tear for the unfortunate children who sit in nurseries surrounded by all they ask for and if the adventures of these two frequently ended in the middle they had probably begun another while the sailorsuit boy was still holding up his leg to let the nurse put on his little sock while they wandered they drew near unwittingly to the enchanted street to which the bottles are a colored way and at last they were in it but tommy recognized it not he did not even feel that he was near it for there were no outside stairs no fairies strolling about it was a short street as shabby as his own  but someone had shouted dinna haver lassie youre blethering  tommy whispered to elspeth be still dont speak and he gripped her hand tighter and stared at the speaker he was a boy of ten dressed like a londoner and his companion had disappeared tommy never doubting but that he was the sprite of long ago gripped him by the sleeve all the savings of elspeth and himself were in his pocket and yielding to impulse as was his way he thrust the fivepence halfpenny into james gloags hand the new millionaire gaped but not at his patron for the why and wherefore of this gift were trifles to james beside the tremendous fact that he had fivepence halfpenny almichty me he cried and bolted presently he returned having deposited his money in a safe place and his first remark was perhaps the meanest on record he held out his hand and said greedily have you ony mair  this you feel certain must have been the most important event of that evening but strange to say it was not before tommy could answer jamess question a woman in a shawl had pounced upon him and hurried him and elspeth out of the street she had been standing at a corner looking wistfully at the window blinds behind which folk from thrums passed to and fro hiding her face from people in the street but gazing eagerly after them it was tommys mother whose first free act on coming to london had been to find out that street and many a time since them site had skulked through it or watched it from dark places never daring to disclose herself but sometimes recognizing familiar faces sometimes hearing a few words in the old tongue that is harsh and ungracious to you but was so sweet to her and bearing them away with her beneath her shawl as if they were something warm to lay over her cold heart  for a time she upbraided tommy passionately for not keeping away from this street but soon her hunger for news of thrums overcame her prudence and she consented to let him go back if he promised never to tell that his mother came from thrums and if onybody wants to ken your name say its tommy but dinna let on that its tommy sandys  elspeth tommy whispered that night im near sure theres something queer about my mother and me and you but he did not trouble himself with wondering what the something queer might be so engrossed was he in the new and exciting life that had suddenly opened to him     chapter vi  the enchanted street   in thrums street as it ought to have been called herded at least onehalf of the thrums folk in london and they formed a colony of which the grocer at the corner sometimes said wrathfully that not a member would give sixpence for anything except bibles or whiskey in the streets one could only tell they were not londoners by their walk the flagstones having no grip for their feet or if they had come south late in life by their backs which they carried at the angle on which webs are most easily supported when mixing with the world they talked the english tongue which came out of them as broad as if it had been squeezed through a mangle but when the days work was done it was only a few of the giddier striplings that remained londoners for the majority there was no raking the streets after diversion they spent the hour or two before bedtime in reproducing the life of thrums few of them knew much of london except the nearest way between this street and their work and their most interesting visitor was a presbyterian minister most of whose congregation lived in much more fashionable parts but they were almost exclusively servant girls and when descending areasteps to visit them he had been challenged often and jocularly by policemen which perhaps was what gave him a subdued and furtive appearance  the rooms were furnished mainly with articles bought in london but these became as like thrums dressers and seats as their owners could make them old petey for instance cutting the back off a chair because he felt most at home on stools drawers were used as bakingboards pails turned into saltbuckets floors were sanded and hearthstones camed and the popular supper consisted of porter hot water and soaked bread after every spoonful of which they groaned pleasantly and stretched their legs sometimes they played at the dambrod but more often they pulled down the blinds on london and talked of thrums in their mother tongue nevertheless few of them wanted to return to it and their favorite joke was the case of james gloags father who being homesick flung up his situation and took train for thrums but he was back in london in three weeks  tommy soon had the entry to these homes and his first news of the inmates was unexpected it was that they were always sleeping in broad daylight he had seen thrums men asleep on beds and he was somewhat ashamed of them until he heard the excuse a number of the men from thrums were bakers the first emigrant of this trade having drawn others after him and they slept great part of the day to be able to work all night in a cellar making nice rolls for rich people baker lumsden who became a friend of tommy had got his place in the cellar when his brother died and the brother had succeeded matthew croall when he died  they die very soon tommy learned from lumsden generally when they are eight and thirty lumsden was thirtysix and when he died his nephew was to get the place the wages are good  then there were several masons one of whom like the first baker had found work for all the others and there were men who had drifted into trades strange to their birthplace and there was usually one at least who had come to london to better himself and had not done it as yet the family tommy liked best was the whamonds and especially he liked old petey and young petey whamond they were a large family of women and men all of whom earned their living in other streets except the old man who kept house and was a famous knitter of stockings as probably his father had been before him he was a great one too at telling what they would be doing at that moment in thrums every corner of which was as familiar to him as the ins and outs of the family hose young petey got fourteen shillings a week from a hatter and one of his duties was to carry as many as twenty bandboxes at a time through fashionable streets it is a matter for elation that dukes and statesmen had often to take the curbstone because young petey was coming nevertheless young petey was not satisfied and never would be such is the thrums nature until he became a salesman in the shop to which he acted at present as fetch and carry and he used to tell tommy that this position would be his as soon as he could sneer sufficiently at the old hats when gentlemen come into the shop and buy a new hat he explained they put it on meaning to tell you to send the old one to their address and the art of being a fashionable hatter lies in this you must be able to curl your lips so contemptuously at the old hat that they tell you guiltily to keep it as they have no further use for it then they retire ashamed of their want of moral courage and you have made an extra halfguinea  but i aye snort young petey admitted and it should be done without a sound when he graduated he was to marry martha spens who was waiting for him at tillyloss there was a london seamstress whom he preferred and she was willing but it is safest to stick to thrums  when tommy was among his new friends a scotch word or phrase often escaped his lips but old petey and the others thought he had picked it up from them and would have been content to accept him as a london waif who lived somewhere round the corner to trick people so simply however is not agreeable to an artist and he told them his name was tommy shovel and that his old girl walloped him and his father found dogs all which inventions thrums street accepted as true what is much more noteworthy is that as he gave them birth tommy half believed them also being already the best kind of actor  not all the talking was done by tommy when he came home with news for he seldom mentioned a thrums name of which his mother could not tell him something more but sometimes she did not choose to tell as when he announced that a certain elspeth lindsay of the marywellbrae was dead after this she ceased to listen for old elspeth had been her grandmother and she had now no kin in thrums  tell me about the painted lady tommy said to her is it true shes a witch but mrs sandys had never heard of any woman so called the painted lady must have gone to thrums after her time  there aint no witches now said elspeth tremulously shovels mother had told her so  not in london replied tommy with contempt and this is all that was said of the painted lady then it is the first mention of her in these pages  the people mrs sandys wanted to hear of chiefly were aaron latta and jean myles and soon tommy brought news of them but at the same time he had heard of the den and he said first  oh mother i thought as you had told me about all the beauty places in thrums and you aint never told me about the den  his mother heaved a quick breath its the only place i hinna telled you o she said  had you forget it mother  forget the den ah no tommy your mother had not forgotten the den  and listen elspeth in the den theres a bonny spring of water called the cuttle well had you forgot the cuttle well mother  no no when jean myles forgot the names of her children she would still remember the cuttle well regardless now of the whispering between tommy and elspeth she sat long over the fire and it is not difficult to fathom her thoughts they were of the den and the cuttle well  into the life of every man and no woman there comes a moment when he learns suddenly that he is held eligible for marriage a girl gives him the jag and it brings out the perspiration of the issue elsewhere of this stab with a bodkin let others speak in thrums its commonest effect is to make the callants body take a right angle to his legs for he has been touched in the fifth button and he backs away brokenwinded by and by however he is at his workamong the turnipshoots sayguffawing and clapping his corduroys with pauses for uneasy meditation and there he ripens with the swedes so that by the backend of the year he has discovered and exults to know that the reward of manhood is neither more nor less than this sensation at the ribs soon thereafter or at worst sooner or later for by holding out he only puts the womens dander up he is led captive to the cuttle well this well has the reputation of being the place where it is most easily said  the wooded ravine called the den is in thrums rather than on its western edge but is so craftily hidden away that when within a stones throw you may give up the search for it it is also so deep that larks rise from the bottom and carol overhead thinking themselves high in the heavens before they are on a level with nether drumleys farmland in shape it is almost a semicircle but its size depends on you and the maid if she be with you the den is so large that you must rest here and there if you are after her boldly you can dash to the cuttle well which was the trystingplace in the time a stout man takes to lace his boots if you are of those selfconscious ones who look behind to see whether jeering blades are following you may crouch and wriggle your way onward and not be with her in half an hour  old petey had told tommy that on the whole the greatest pleasure in life on a saturday evening is to put your back against a stile that leads into the den and rally the sweethearts as they go by the lads when they see you want to go round by the other stile but the lasses like it and often the sport ends spiritedly with their giving you a clout on the head  through the den runs a tiny burn and by its side is a pink path dyed this pretty color perhaps by the blushes the ladies leave behind them the burn as it passes the cuttle well which stands higher and just out of sight leaps in vain to see who is making that cooing noise and the well taking the spray for kisses laughs all day at romeo who cannot get up well is a name it must have given itself for it is only a spring in the bottom of a basinful of water where it makes about as much stir in the world as a minnow jumping at a fly they say that if a boy by making a bowl of his hands should suddenly carry off all the water a quick girl could thread her needle at the spring but it is a spring that will not wait a moment  men who have been lads in thrums sometimes go back to it from london or from across the seas to look again at some battered little house and feel the blasts of their bairnhood playing through the old wynds and they may take with them a foreign wife they show her everything except the cuttle well they often go there alone the well is sacred to the memory of first love you may walk from the well to the round cemetery in ten minutes it is a common walk for those who go back  first love is but a boy and girl playing at the cuttle well with a birds egg they blow it on one summer evening in the long grass and on the next it is borne away on a coarse laugh or it breaks beneath the burden of a tear and yeti once saw an aged woman a widow of many years cry softly at mention of the cuttle well john was a good man to you i said for john had been her husband he was a leal man to me she answered with wistful eyes ay he was a leal man to mebut it wasna john i was thinking o you dinna ken what makes me greet so sair she added presently and though i thought i knew now i was wrong its because i canna mind his name she said  so the cuttle well has its sad memories and its bright ones and many of the bright memories have become sad with age as so often happens to beautiful things but the most mournful of all is the story of aaron latta and jean myles beside the well there stood for long a great pink stone called the shoaging stone because it could be rocked like a cradle and on it lovers used to cut their names often aaron latta and jean myles sat together on the shoaging stone and then there came a time when it bore these words cut by aaron latta  here lies the manhood of aaron latta a fond son a faithful friend and a true lover who violated the feelings of sex on this spot and is now the scunner of god and man  tommys mother now heard these words for the first time aaron having cut them on the stone after she left thrums and her head sank at each line as if someone had struck four blows at her  the stone was no longer at the cuttle well as the easiest way of obliterating the words the minister had ordered it to be broken and of the pieces another mason had made stands for watches one of which was now in thrums street  aaron latta aint a mason now tommy rattled on he is a warper because he can warp in his own house without looking on mankind or speaking to mankind auld petey said he minded the day when aaron latta was a merry loon and then andrew mcvittie said god behears to think that aaron latta was ever a merry man and baker lumsden said curse her  his mother shrank in her chair but said nothing and tommy explained it was jean myles he was cursing did you ken her mother she ruined aaron lattas life  ay and wha ruined jean myless life his mother cried passionately  tommy did not know but he thought that young petey might know for young petey had said if i had been jean myles i would have spat in aarons face rather than marry him  mrs sandys seemed pleased to hear this  they wouldna tell me what it were she did tommy went on they said it was ower ugly a story but she were a bad one for they stoned her out of thrums i dinna know where she is now but she were stoned out of thrums  no alane  there was a man with her and his name wasit was  his mother clasped her hands nervously while tommy tried to remember the name his name was magerful tam he said at length  ay said his mother knitting her teeth that was his name  i dinna mind any more tommy concluded yes i mind they aye called aaron latta poor aaron latta  did they i warrant though there wasna one as said poor jean myles  she began the question in a hard voice but as she said poor jean myles something caught in her throat and she sobbed painful dry sobs  how could they pity her when she were such a bad one tommy answered briskly  is there none to pity bad ones said his sorrowful mother  elspeth plucked her by the skirt theres god aint there she said inquiringly and getting no answer she flopped upon her knees to say a babyish prayer that would sound comic to anybody except to him to whom it was addressed  you aint praying for a woman as was a disgrace to thrums tommy cried jealously and he was about to raise her by force when his mother stayed his hand  let her alane she said with a twitching mouth and filmy eyes let her alane let my bairn pray for jean myles     chapter vii  comic overture to a tragedy   jean myles bides in london was the next remarkable news brought by tommy from thrums street and that aint all magerful tam is her man and that aint all she has a laddie called tommy and that aint all petey and the rest has never seen her in london but she writes letters to thrums folks and they writes to petey and tells him what she said that aint all neither they canna find out what street she bides in but its on the bonny side of london and its grand and she wears silk clothes and her tommy has velvet trousers and they have a servant as calls him sir oh i would just like to kick him they often looks for her in the grand streets but theyre angry at her getting on so well and martha scrymgeour said it were enough to make good women like her stop going reglar to the kirk  martha said that exclaimed his mother highly pleased heard you anything of a woman called esther auld her man does the orra work at the tappit hen public in thrums  hes head man at the tappit hen public now answered tommy and she wishes she could find out where jean myles bides so as she could write and tell her that she is grand too and has six hairbottomed chairs  shell never get the satisfaction said his mother triumphantly tell me more about her  she has a laddie called francie and he has yellow curls and she nearly greets because she canna tell jean myles that he goes to a school for the children of gentlemen only she is so mad when she gets a letter from jean myles that she takes to her bed  yea yea said mrs sandys cheerily  but they think jean myles has been brought low at last continued tommy because she hasna wrote for a long time to thrums and esther auld said that if she knowed for certain as jean myles had been brought low she would put a threepenny bit in the kirk plate  im glad youve telled me that laddie said mrs sandys and next day unknown to her children she wrote another letter she knew she ran a risk of discovery yet it was probable that tommy would only hear her referred to in thrums street by her maiden name which he had never heard from her and as for her husband he had been magerful tam to everyone the risk was great but the pleasure  unsuspicious tommy soon had news of another letter from jean myles which had sent esther auld to bed again  instead of being brought low he announced jean myles is grander than ever her tommy has a governess  that would be a doush of water in esthers face his mother said smiling  she wrote to martha scrymgeour said tommy that it aint no pleasure to her now to boast as her laddie is at a school for gentlemens children only but what made her maddest was a bit in jean myless letter about chairs jean myles has give all her hairbottomed chairs to a poor woman and buyed a new kind because hairbottomed ones aint fashionable now so esther auld cant not bear the sight of her chairs now though she were windy of them till the letter went to thrums  poor esther said mrs sandys gaily  oh and i forgot this mother jean myless reason for not telling where she bides in london is that shes so grand that she thinks if auld petey and the rest knowed where the place was they would visit her and boast as they was her friends auld petey stamped wi rage when he heard that and martha scrymgeour said oh the pridefu limmer  ay martha muttered mrs sandys you and jean myles is evens now  but the passage that had made them all wince the most was one giving jeans reasons for making no calls in thrums street you can break it to martha scrymgeours father and mither the letter said and to petey whamonds sisters and the rest as has friends in london that i have seen no thrums faces here the low part where they bide not being for the like of me to file my feet in forby that i could not let my son mix with their bairns for fear they should teach him the vulgar thrums words and clarty his bluevelvet suit im thinking you have to dress your laddie in corduroy esther but you see that would not do for mine so no more at present and we all join in compliments and my little velvets says he wishes i would send some of his toys to your little corduroys and so maybe i will esther if youll tell aaron latta how rich and happy i am and if youre feared to say it to his face tell it to the roaring farmer of double dykes and hell pass it on  did you ever hear of such a woman tommy said indignantly when he had repeated as much of this insult to thrums as he could remember  but it was information his mother wanted  what said they to that bit she asked  at first it appears they limited their comments to losh losh keeps a it cows my eertie ay ay sal tal dagont the meaning of which is obvious but by and by they recovered their breath and then baker lamsden said wonderingly  wha that was at her marriage could have thought it would turn out so weel it was an eerie marriage that petey  ay man you may say so old petey answered i was there i was one o them as went in ahint aaron latta and im no likely to forget it  i wasna there said the baker but i was standing at the door and i saw the hearse drive up  what did they mean mother tommy asked but she shuddered and replied evasively did martha scrymgeour say anything  she said such a lot he had to confess that i dinna mind none on it but i mind what her father in thrums wrote to her he wrote to her that if she saw a carriage go by she was to keep her eyes on the ground for likely as not jean myles would be in it and she thought as they was all dirt beneath her feet but kirsty rosswho is she  shes marthas mother what about her  she wrote at the end of the letter that martha was to hang on ahint the carriage and find out where jean myles bides  laddie that was like kirsty heard you what the roaring farmer o double dykes said  no tommy had not heard him mentioned and indeed the roaring farmer of double dykes had said nothing he was already lying very quiet on the south side of the cemetery  tommys mothers next question cost her a painful effort did you hear she asked whether they telled aaron latta about the letter  yes they telled him tommy replied and he said a queer thing he said jean myles is dead i was at her coffining thats what he aye says when they tell him theres another letter i wonder what he means mother  i wonder she echoed faintly the only pleasure left her was to raise the envy of those who had hooted her from thrums but she paid a price for it many a stab she had got from the unwitting tommy as he repeated the gossip of his new friends and she only won their envy at the cost of their increased illwill they thought she was lording it in london and so they were merciless had they known how poor she was and how ill they would have forgotten everything save that she was a thrummy like themselves and there were few but would have shared their all with her but she did not believe this and therefore you may pity her for the hour was drawing near and she knew it when she must appeal to some one for her childrens sake not for her own  no not for her own when tommy was wandering the pretty parts of london with james gloag and other boys from thrums street in search of jean myles whom they were to know by her carriage and her silk dress and her son in blue velvet his mother was in bed with bronchitis in the wretched room we know of or creeping to the dancing school coughing all the way  some of the fits of coughing were very near being her last but she wrestled with her trouble seeming at times to stifle it and then for weeks she managed to go to her work which was still hers because shovels old girl did it for her when the bronchitis would not be defied shovels old slattern gave this service unasked and without payment if she was thanked it was ungraciously but she continued to do all she could when there was need she smelled of gin but she continued to do all she could  the wardrobe had been put upon its back on the floor and so converted into a bed for tommy and elspeth who were sometimes wakened in the night by a loud noise which alarmed them until they learned that it was only the man in the next room knocking angrily on the wall because their mothers cough kept him from sleeping  tommy knew what death was now and elspeth knew its name and both were vaguely aware that it was looking for their mother but if she could only hold out till hogmanay tommy said they would fleg it out of the house hogmanay is the mighty winter festival of thrums and when it came round these two were to give their mother a present that would make her strong it was not to be a porous plaster tommy knew now of something better than that  and i knows too elspeth gurgled and i has threepence aready i has  whisht said tommy in an agony of dread she hears you and shell guess we aint speaking of nothing to give to you at hogmanay he said to his mother with great cunning then he winked at elspeth and said with his hand over his mouth i hinna twopence and elspeth about to cry in fright have you spended it saw the joke and crowed instead nor yet has i threepence  they smirked together until tommy saw a change come over elspeths face which made him run her outside the door  you was agoing to pray he said severely  cos it was a lie tommy i does have threepence  well you aint agoing to get praying about it she would hear yer  i would do it low tommy  she would see yer  oh tommy let me god is angry with me  tommy looked down the stair and no one was in sight ill let yer pray here he whispered and you can say i have twopence but be quick and do it standing  perhaps mrs sandys had been thinking that when hogmanay came her children might have no mother to bring presents to for on their return to the room her eyes followed them woefully and a shudder of apprehension shook her torn frame tommy gave elspeth a look that meant im sure theres something queer about her  there was also something queer about himself which at this time had the strangest gallop it began one day with a series of morning calls from shovel who suddenly popped his head over the top of the door he was standing on the handle roared roastbeef in the manner of a railway porter announcing the name of a station and then at once withdrew  he returned presently to say that vain must be all attempts to wheedle his secret from him and yet again to ask irritably why tommy was not coming out to hear all about it then did tommy desert elspeth and on the stair shovel showed him a yellow card with this printed on it srjcsupper ticket and written beneath in a ladys hand admit joseph salt the letters shovel explained meant society for the somethink of juvenile criminals and the toffs what ran it got hold of you when you came out of quod then if you was willing to repent they wrote down your name and the place what you lived at in a book and one of them came to see yer and give yer a ticket for the blowout night this was blowout night and that were shovels ticket he had bought it from hump salt for fourpence what you get at the blowout was roastbeef plumduff and an orange but when hump saw the fourpence he could not wait  a favor was asked of tommy shovel had been told by hump that it was the custom of the toffs to sit beside you and question you about your crimes and lacking the imagination that made tommy such an ornament to the house the chances were that he would flounder in his answers and be ejected hump had pointed this out to him after pocketing the fourpence would tommy therefore make up things for him to say reward the orange  this was a proud moment for tommy as shovels knowledge of crime was much more extensive than his own though they had both studied it in the pictures of a lively newspaper subscribed to by shovel senior he became patronizing at once and rejected the orange as insufficient  then suppose after he got into the hall shovel dropped his ticket out at the window tommy could pick it up and then it would admit him also  tommy liked this but foresaw a danger the ticket might be taken from shovel at the door just as they took them from you at that singing thing in the church he had attended with young petey  so help shovels davy there was no fear of this they were superior toffs what trusted to your honor  would shovel swear to this  he would  but would he swear dagont  he swore dagont and then tommy had him as he was so sure of it he could not object to tommys being the one who dropped the ticket out at the window  shovel did object for a time but after a wrangle he gave up the ticket intending to take it from tommy when primed with the necessary tale so they parted until evening and tommy returned to elspeth secretive but elated for the rest of the day he was in thought now waggling his head smugly over some dark unutterable design and again looking a little scared in growing alarm she watched his face and at last she slipped upon her knees but he had her up at once and said reproachfully  it were me as teached yer to pray and now yer prays for me thats fine treatment  nevertheless after his mothers return just before he stole out to join shovel he took elspeth aside and whispered to her nervously  you can pray for me if you like for oh elspeth im thinking as ill need it sore and sore he needed it before the night was out     chapter viii  the boy with two mothers   i love my dear father and my dear mother and all the dear little kids at ome you are a kind laidy or gentleman i love yer i will never do it again so help me bob amen  this was what shovel muttered to himself again and again as the two boys made their way across the lamplit hungerford bridge and tommy asked him what it meant  my old gal learned me that shes deep shovel said wiping the words off his mouth with his sleeve  but you got no kids at ome remonstrated tommy ameliar was now in service  shovel turned on him with the fury of a mother protecting her young dont you try for to knock none on it out he cried and again fell amumbling  said tommy scornfully if you says it all out at one bang youll be done at the start  shovel sighed  and you should blubber when yer says it added tommy who could laugh or cry merely because other people were laughing or crying or even with less reason and so naturally that he found it more difficult to stop than to begin shovel was the taller by half a head and irresistible with his fists but tonight tommy was master  you jest stick to me shovel he said airily keep a grip on my hand same as if yer was elspeth  but what was we copped for tommy entreated humble shovel  tommy asked him if he knew what a butler was and shovel remembered confusedly that there had been a portrait of a butler in his fathers newssheet  well then said tommy inspired by this same source theres a room a butler has and it is a pantry so you and me we crawled through the winder and we opened the door to the gang you and me was copped they catched you below the table and me stabbing the butler  it was me what stabbed the butler shovel interposed jealously  how could you do it shovel  with a knife i tell yer  why you didnt have no knife said tommy impatiently  this crushed shovel but he growled sulkily  well i bit him in the leg  not you said selfish tommy you forgets about repenting and if i let yer bite him you would brag about it its safer without shovel  perhaps it was how long did i get in quod then tommy  fourteen days  so did you shovel said with quick anxiety  i got a month replied tommy firmly  shovel roared a word that would never have admitted him to the hall then im as game as you and gamer he whined  but im better at repenting i tell yer ill cry when im repenting tommys face lit up and shovel could not help saying with a curious look at it  youyou aint like any other cove i knows to which tommy replied also in an awestruck voice  im so queer shovel that when i thinks bout myself imim sometimes near feared  what makes your face for to shine like that is it thinking about the blowout  no it was hardly that but tommy could not tell what it was he and the saying about art for arts sake were in the streets that night looking for each other  the splendor of the brightly lighted hall which was situated in one of the meanest streets of perhaps the most densely populated quarter in london broke upon the two boys suddenly and hit each in his vital part tapping an invitation on tommys brainpan and taking shovel coquettishly in the stomach now was the moment when shovel meant to strip tommy of the ticket but the spectacle in front dazed him and he stopped to tell a vegetable barrow how he loved his dear father and his dear mother and all the dear kids at home then tommy darted forward and was immediately lost in the crowd surging round the steps of the hall  several gentlemen in evening dress stood framed in the lighted doorway shouting have your tickets in your hands and give them up as you pass in they were fine fellows helping in a splendid work and their society did much good though it was not so well organized as others that have followed in its steps but shovel you may believe was in no mood to attend to them he had but one thought that the traitor tommy was doubtless at that moment boring his way toward them underground as it were and holding his ticket in his hand shovel dived into the rabble and was flung back upside down falling with his arms round a fullgrown man he immediately ran up him as if he had been a lamppost and was aloft just sufficiently long to see tommy give up the ticket and saunter into the hall  the crowd tried at intervals to rush the door it was mainly composed of ragged boys but here and there were men women and girls who came into view for a moment under the lights as the mob heaved and went round and round like a boiling potful two policemen joined the ticketcollectors and though it was a goodhumored gathering the air was thick with such cries as these  i lorst my ticket aint i telling yer gar on guvnor lemme in  oh crumpets look at jimmy jimmy never done nothink your honor hes a himposter  im the boy what kicked the peeler hie you toff with the choker aint i to step up  tell yer im a genooine criminal i am if yer dont lemme in ill have the lawr on you  let a poor cove in as

see the cuss what runs  jest keeping on me out cos i aint done nothin ho this is a encouragement to honesty i dont think  mighty in tongue and knee and elbow was an unknown knight ever conspicuous it might be but by a leg waving for one brief moment in the air he did not want to go in would not go in though they went on their blooming knees to him he was after a viper of the name of tommy half an hour had not tired him and he was leading another assault when a magnificent lady such as you see in waxworks appeared in the vestibule and made some remark to a policeman who then shouted  if so there be hany lad here called shovel he can step forrard  a dozen lads stepped forward at once but a flail drove them right and left and the unknown knight had mounted the parapet amid a shower of execrations if you are the real shovel the lady said to him you can tell me how this proceeds i love my dear father and my dear mother go on  shovel obeyed tremblingly and all the dear little kids at ome you are a kind laidy or gentleman i love yer i will never do it again so help me bob amen  charming chirped the lady and down pleasantsmelling aisles she led him pausing to drop an observation about tommy to a clergyman so glad i came i have discovered the most delightful little monster called tommy the clergyman looked after her half in sadness half sarcastically he was thinking that he had discovered a monster also  at present the body of the hall was empty but its sides were lively with gorging boys among whom ladies moved carrying platefuls of good things most of them were sweet women fighting bravely for these boys and not at all like shovels patroness who had come for a sensation tommy falling into her hands she got it  tommy who had a corner to himself was lolling in it like a little king and he not only ordered roastbeef for the awestruck shovel but sent the lady back for salt then he whispered exultantly quick shovel feel my pocket it bulged with two oranges now the inside pocket plumduff now my waistcoat pocket threepence look in my mouth chocolates  when shovel found speech he began excitedly i love my dear father and my dear  gach said tommy interrupting him contemptuously repenting aint no go shovel look at them other coves none of them has got no money nor full pockets and i tell you its cos they has repented  gar on  its true i tells you that lady as is my one shes called her ladyship and she dont care a cuss for boys as has repented which of course was a libel her ladyship being celebrated wherever paragraphs penetrate for having knitted a pair of stockings for the deserving poor  when i saw that tommy continued brazenly i bragged stead of repenting and the wuss i says i am she jest says you little monster and gives me another orange  then im done for shovel moaned for i rolled off that bout loving my dear father and my dear mother blast em soon as i seen her  he need not let that depress him tommy had told her he would say it but that it was all flam  shovel thought the ideal arrangement would be for him to eat and leave the torking to tommy tommy nodded im full at any rate he said struggling with his waistcoat oh shovel i am full  her ladyship returned and the boys held by their contract but of the dark character tommy seems to have been let not these pages bear the record do you wonder that her ladyship believed him on this point we must fight for our tommy you would have believed him even shovel who knew between the bites that it was all whoppers listened as to his father reading aloud this was because another boy present half believed it for the moment also when he described the eerie darkness of the butlers pantry he shivered involuntarily and he shut his eyes onceughthat was because he saw the blood spouting out of the butler he was turning up his trousers to show the mark of the butlers boot on his leg when the lady was called away and then shovel shook him saying darn yer doesnt yer know as its all your eye which brought tommy to his senses with a jerk  sures death shovel he whispered in awe i was thinking i done it every bit  had her ladyship come back she would have found him a different boy he remembered now that elspeth for whom he had filled his pockets was praying for him he could see her on her knees saying oh god ise praying for tommy and remorse took hold of him and shook him on his seat he broke into one hysterical laugh and then immediately began to sob this was the moment when shovel should have got him quietly out of the hall  members of the society discussing him afterwards with bated breath said that never till they died could they forget her ladyships face while he did it but did you notice the boys own face it was positively angelic angelic indeed the little horror was intoxicated no there was a doctor present and according to him it was the meal that had gone to the boys head he looked half starved as for the clergyman he only said we shall lose her subscription i am glad of it  yes tommy was intoxicated but with a beverage not recognized by the faculty what happened was this supper being finished the time had come for what shovel called the jawing and the boys were now mustered in the body of the hall the limited audience had gone to the gallery and unluckily all eyes except shovels were turned to the platform shovel was apprehensive about tommy who was not exactly sobbing now but strange uncontrollable sounds not unlike the winding up of a clock proceeded from his throat his face had flushed there was a purposeful look in his usually unreadable eye his fingers were fidgeting on the board in front of him and he seemed to keep his seat with difficulty  the personage who was to address the boys sat on the platform with clergymen members of committee and some ladies one of them tommys patroness her ladyship saw tommy and smiled to him but obtained no response she had taken a front seat a choice that she must have regretted presently  the chairman rose and announced that the rev mr would open the proceedings with prayer the rev mr  rose to pray in a loud voice for the waifs in the body of the hall at the same moment rose tommy and began to pray in a squeaky voice for the people on the platform  he had many biblical phrases mostly picked up in thrums street and what he said was distinctly heard in the stillness the clergyman being suddenly bereft of speech oh he cried look down on them ones there for oh they are unworthy of thy mercy and oh the worst sinner is her ladyship her sitting there so brazen in the black frock with yellow stripes and the worse i said i were the better pleased were she oh make her think shame for tempting of a poor boy for getting suffer little children oh why cumbereth she the ground oh  he was in full swing before any one could act shovel having failed to hold him in his seat had done what was perhaps the next best thing got beneath it himself the arm of the petrified clergyman was still extended as if blessing his brothers remarks the chairman seemed to be trying to fling his right hand at the culprit but her ladyship after the first stab never moved a muscle thus for nearly half a minute when the officials woke up and squeezing past many knees seized tommy by the neck and ran him out of the building all down the aisle he prayed hysterically and for some time afterwards to shovel who had been cast forth along with him  at an hour of that night when their mother was asleep and it is to be hoped they were the only two children awake in london tommy sat up softly in the wardrobe to discover whether elspeth was still praying for him he knew that she was on the floor in a nightgown some twelve sizes too large for her but the room was as silent and black as the world he had just left by taking his fingers from his ears and the blankets off his face  i see you he said mendaciously and in a guarded voice so as not to waken his mother from whom he had kept his escapade this had not the desired effect of drawing a reply from elspeth and he tried bluster  you needna think as ill repent you brat so there what  i wish i hadna told you about it indeed he had endeavored not to do so but pride in his achievement had eventually conquered prudence  reddy would have laughed she would and said as i was a wonder reddy was the kind i like what  you ate up the oranges quick and the plumduff too so you should pray for yoursel as well as for me its easy to say as you didna know how i got them till after you eated them but you should have found out what  do you think it was for my own self as i done it i jest done it to get the oranges and plumduff to you i did and the threepence too eh speak you little besom  i tell you as i did repent in the hall i was greeting and i never knowed i put up that prayer till shovel told me on it we was sitting in the street by that time  this was true on leaving the hall tommy had soon dropped to the cold ground and squatted there till he came to when he remembered nothing of what had led to his expulsion like a stream that has run into a pond and only finds itself again when it gets out he was but a continuation of the boy who when last conscious of himself was in the corner crying remorsefully over his misdeed and in this humility he would have returned to elspeth had no one told him of his prayer shovel however was at hand not only to tell him all about it but to applaud and home strutted tommy chuckling  i am sleeping he next said to elspeth so you may as well come to your bed  he imitated the breathing of a sleeper but it was the only sound to be heard in london and he desisted fearfully come away elspeth he said coaxingly for he was very fond of her and could not sleep while she was cold and miserable  still getting no response he pulled his body inch by inch out of the bedclothes and holding his breath found the floor with his feet stealthily as if to cheat the wardrobe into thinking that he was still in it but his reason was to discover whether elspeth had fallen asleep on her knees without her learning that he cared to know almost noiselessly he worked himself along the floor but when he stopped to bring his face nearer hers there was such a creaking of his joints that if elspeth did not hear it sheshe must be dead his knees played whack on the floor  elspeth only gasped once but he heard and remained beside her for a minute so that she might hug him if such was her desire and she put out her hand in the darkness so that his should not have far to travel alone if it chanced to be on the way to her thus they sat on their knees each aghast at the hardheartedness of the other  tommy put the blankets over the kneeling figure and presently announced from the wardrobe that if he died of cold before repenting the blame of keeping him out of heaven would be elspeths but the last word was muffled for the blankets were tucked about him as he spoke and two motherly little arms gave him the embrace they wanted to withhold foiled again he kicked off the bedclothes and said i tell yer i wants to die  this terrified both of them and he added quickly  oh god if i was sure i were to die tonight i would repent at once it is the commonest prayer in all languages but down on her knees slipped elspeth again and tommy who felt that it had done him good said indignantly surely that is religion what  he lay on his face until he was frightened by a noise louder than thunder in the daytimethe scraping of his eyelashes on the pillow then he sat up in the wardrobe and fired his three last shots  elspeth sandys im done with yer forever i am ill take care on yer but ill never kiss yer no more  when yer boasts as im your brother ill say you aint ill tell my mother about reddy the morn and syne shell put you to the door smart  when you are a grown woman ill buy a house to yer but youll have jest to bide in it by your lonely self and ill come once a year to speir how you are but i wont come in i wontill jest cry up the stair  the effect of this was even greater than he had expected for now two were in tears instead of one and tommys grief was the more heartrending he was so much better at everything than elspeth he jumped out of the wardrobe and ran to her calling her name and he put his arms round her cold body and the dear mite forgetting how cruelly he had used her cried oh tighter tommy tighter you didnt not mean it did yer oh you is terrible fond on me aint yer and you wont not tell my mother bout reddy will yer and you is no done wi me forever is yer and you wont not put me in a house by myself will yer oh tommy is that the tightest you can do  and tommy made it tighter vowing i never meant it i was a bad un to say it if reddy were to come back wanting for to squeeze you out i would send her packing quick i would i tell yer what ill kiss you with folk looking on i will and no be ashamed to do it and if shovel is one of them what sees me and he puts his finger to his nose ill blood the mouth of him i will dagont  then he prayed for forgiveness and he could always pray more beautifully than elspeth even she was satisfied with the way he did it and so alack was he  but you forgot to tell she said fondly when once more they were in the wardrobe togetheryou forgot to tell as you filled your pockets wif things to me  i didnt forget tommy replied modestly i missed it out on purpose i did cos i was sure god knows on it without my telling him and i thought he would be pleased if i didnt let on as i knowed it was good of me  oh tommy cried elspeth worshipping him i couldnt have doned that i couldnt she was barely six and easily taken in but she would save him from himself if she could     chapter ix  auld lang syne   what to do with her ladyships threepence tommy finally decided to drop it into the charitybox that had once contained his penny they held it over the slit together elspeth almost in tears because it was such a large sum to give away but tommy looking noble he was so proud of himself and when he said three they let go  there followed days of excitement centred round their moneybox shovel introduced tommy to a boy what said as after a bit you forget how much money was in your box and then when you opened it oh lor there is more than you thought so he and elspeth gave this plan a weeks trial affecting not to know how much they had gathered but when they unlocked it the sum was still only eightpence so then tommy told the liar to come on and they fought while the horrified elspeth prayed and tommy licked him a result due to one of the famous thrums lefthanders then on exhibition in that street for the first time as taught the victor by petey whamond the younger late of tillyloss  the money did come in once in spate twopence from bob in twentyfour hours but usually so slowly that they saw it resting on the way and then when they listened intently they could hear the thud of hogmanay the last halfpenny was a special aggravation strolling about just out of reach with all the swagger of sixpence but at last elspeth had it and after that the sooner hogmanay came the better  they concealed their excitement under too many wrappings but their mother suspected nothing when she was dressing on the morning of hogmanay her stockings happened to be at the other side of the room and they were such a long way off that she rested on the way to them at the meagre breakfast she said what a heavy teapot that was and tommy thought this funny but the salt had gone from the joke when he remembered it afterwards and when she was ready to go off to her work she hesitated at the door looking at her bed and from it to her children as if in two minds and then went quietly downstairs  the distance seems greater than ever today poor woman and you stop longer at the corners where rude men jeer at you scarcely can you push open the door of the dancingschool or lift the pail the fire has gone out you must again go on your knees before it and again the smoke makes you cough gaunt slattern fighting to bring up the phlegm was it really you for whom another woman gave her life and thought it a rich reward to get dressing you once in your long clothes when she called you her beautiful and smiled and smiling died well well but take courage jean myles the long road still lies straight up hill but your climbing is near an end shrink from the rude men no more they are soon to forget you so soon it is a heavy door but soon you will have pushed it open for the last time the girls will babble still but not to you not of you cheer up the work is nearly done her beautiful come beautiful strength for a few more days and then you can leave the key of the leaden door behind you and on your way home you may kiss your hand joyously to the weary streets for you are going to die  tommy and elspeth had been to the foot of the stair many times to look for her before their mother came back that evening yet when she reentered her home behold they were sitting calmly on the fender as if this were a day like yesterday or tomorrow as if tommy had not been on a business visit to thrums street as if the hump on the bed did not mean that a glorious something was hidden under the coverlet true elspeth would look at tommy imploringly every few minutes meaning that she could not keep it in much longer and then tommy would mutter the one word bell to remind her that it was against the rules to begin before the thrums eightoclock bell rang they also wiled away the time of waiting by inviting each other to conferences at the window where these whispers passed  she aint got a notion tommy  dinna look so often at the bed  if i could jest get one more peep at it  no no but you can put your hand on the top of it as you go by  the artfulness of tommy lured his unsuspecting mother into telling how they would be holding hogmanay in thrums tonight how cartloads of kebbock cheeses had been rolling into the town all the livelong day do you hear them elspeth and in dark closes the children were already gathering with smeared faces and in eccentric dress to sally forth as guisers at the clap of eight when the ringing of a bell lets hogmanay loose you see elspeth inside the houses men and women were preparing though not by fasting which would have been such a good way that it is surprising no one ever thought of it for a series of visits at every one of which they would be offered a dram and kebbock and bannock and in the grander houses bridies which are a sublime kind of pie  tommy had the audacity to ask what bridies were like and he could not dress up and be a guiser could he mother for the guisers sang a song and he did not know the words what a pity they could not get bridies to buy in london and learn the song and sing it but of course they could not elspeth if you tumble off the fender again shell guess  such is a sample of tommy but elspeth was sly also if in a smaller way and it was she who said there aint nothin in the bed is there tommy this duplicity made her uneasy and she added behind her teeth maybe there is and then o god i knows as there is  but as the great moment drew near there were no more questions two children were staring at the clock and listening intently for the peal of a bell nearly five hundred miles away  the clock struck whisht its time elspeth theyve begun come on  a few minutes afterwards mrs sandys was roused by a knock at the door followed by the entrance of two mysterious figures the female wore a boys jacket turned outside in the male a womans bonnet and a shawl and to make his disguise the more impenetrable he carried a poker in his right hand they stopped in the middle of the floor and began to recite rather tremulously  get up good wife and binna sweir and deal your bread to them thats here for the time will come when youll be dead and then youll need neither ale nor bread  mrs sandys had started and then turned piteously from them but when they were done she tried to smile and said with forced gayety that she saw they were guisers and it was a fine night and would they take a chair the male stranger did so at once but the female said rather anxiously you are sure as you dont know who we is their hostess shook her head and then he of the poker offered her three guesses a daring thing to do but all went well for her first guess was shovel and his old girl second guess before and after third guess napoleon buonaparte and the auld licht minister at each guess the smaller of the intruders clapped her hands gleefully but when with the third she was unmuzzled she putted with her head at mrs sandys and hugged her screaming it aint none on them its jest me mother its elspeth and even while their astounded hostess was asking could it be true the male conspirator dropped his poker noisily to draw attention to himself and stood revealed as thomas sandys  wasnt it just like thrums wasnt it just the very very same ah it was wonderful their mother said but alas there was one thing wanting she had no hogmanay to give the guisers  had she not what a pity elspeth what a pity tommy what might that be in the bed elspeth it couldnt not be their hogmanay could it tommy if tommy was his mother he would look and see if elspeth was her mother she would look and see  her curiosity thus cunningly aroused mrs sandys raised the coverlet of the bed andthere were three bridies an oatmeal cake and a hunk of kebbock and they comed from thrums cried elspeth while tommy cried petey and the others got a lot sent from thrums and i bought the bridies from them and they gave me the bannock and the kebbock for nuthin their mother did not utter the cry of rapture which tommy expected so confidently that he could have done it for her instead she pulled her two children toward her and the great moment was like to be a tearful rather than an ecstatic one for elspeth had begun to whimper and even tommybut by a supreme effort he shouldered reality to the door  is this my hogmanay guidwife he asked in the nick of time and the situation thus being saved the luscious feast was partaken of the guisers listening solemnly as each bite went down they also took care to address their hostess as guidwife or mistress affecting not to have met her lately and inquiring genially after the health of herself and family how many have you was tommys masterpiece and she answered in the proper spirit but all the time she was hiding great part of her bridie beneath her apron hogmanay having come too late for her  everything was to be done exactly as they were doing it in thrums street and so presently tommy made a speech it was the speech of old petey who had rehearsed it several times before him heres a toast said tommy standing up and waving his arms heres a toast that well drink in silence one that maun have sad thoughts at the back ot to some of us but one my friends that keeps the hearts of thrums folk green and ties us all thegither like as it were wi twine its to all them wherever they may be the night wha have sat as lads and lasses at the cuttle well  to one of the listeners it was such an unexpected ending that a faint cry broke from her which startled the children and they sat in silence looking at her she had turned her face from them but her arm was extended as if entreating tommy to stop  that was the end he said at length in a tone of expostulation its auld peteys speech  are you sure his mother asked wistfully that petey was to say all them as have sat at the cuttle well he made no exception did he  tommy did not know what exception was but he assured her that he had repeated the speech word for word for the remainder of the evening she sat apart by the fire while her children gambled for cracknuts young petey having made a teetotum for tommy and taught him what the letters on it meant their mirth rang faintly in her ear and they scarcely heard her fits of coughing she was as much engrossed in her own thoughts as they in theirs but hers were sad and theirs were jocundhogmanay like all festivals being but a bank from which we can only draw what we put in so an hour or more passed after which tommy whispered to elspeth nows the time theyre at it now and each took a hand of their mother and she woke from her reverie to find that they had pulled her from her chair and were jumping up and down shouting excitedly for auld lang syne my dear for auld lang syne auld lang syne my dear auld lang syne she tried to sing the words with her children tried to dance round with them tried to smile but  it was tommy who dropped her hand first mother he cried your face is wet youre greeting sair and you said you had forgot the way  i mind it now man i mind it now she said standing helplessly in the middle of the room  elspeth nestled against her crying my mother was thinking about thrums wasnt she tommy  i was thinking about the part ot im most awid to be in the poor woman said sinking back into her chair  its the den tommy told elspeth  its the square elspeth told tommy  no its monypenny  no its the commonty  but it was none of these places its the cemetery the woman said its the hamely quiet cemetery on the hillside oh theres mony a bonny place in my nain bonny toon but theres nain so hamely like as the cemetery she sat shaking in the chair and they thought she was to say no more but presently she rose excitedly and with a vehemence that made them shrink from her she cried i winna lie in london tell aaron latta that i winna lie in london  for a few more days she trudged to her work and after that she seldom left her bed she had no longer strength to coax up the phlegm and a doctor brought in by shovels mother warned her that her days were near an end then she wrote her last letter to thrums tommy and elspeth standing by to pick up the pen when it fell from her feeble hand and in the intervals she told them that she was jean myles  and if i die and aaron hasna come she said you maun just gang to auld petey and tell him wha you are  but how can you be jean myles asked astounded tommy you aint a grand lady and  his mother looked at elspeth no afore her she besought him but before he set off to post the letter she said come canny into my bed the night when elspeth s sleeping and syne ill tell you all there is to tell about jean myles  tell me now whether the letter is to aaron latta  its for him she said but its no to him im feared he might burn it without opening it if he saw my write on the cover so ive wrote it to a friend of his wha will read it to him  and whats inside mother the boy begged inquisitively it must be queer things if theyll bring aaron latta all the way from thrums  theres but little in it man she said pressing her hand hard upon her chest its no muckle mair than auld lang syne my dear for auld lang syne     chapter x  the favorite of the ladies   that night the excited boy was wakened by a taptap as of someone knocking for admittance and stealing to his mothers side he cried aaron latta has come hearken to him chapping at the door  it was only the man through the wall but mrs sandys took tommy into bed with her and while elspeth slept told him the story of her life she coughed feebly now but the panting of the dying is a sound that no walls can cage and the man continued to remonstrate at intervals tommy never recalled his mothers story without seeming through the darkness in which it was told to hear elspeths peaceful breathing and the angry taptap on the wall  im sweer to tell it to you she began but tell i maun for though its just a warning to you and elspeth no to be like them that brought you into the world its all i have to leave you ay and theres another reason you may soon be among folk wha ken but half the story and put a waur face on it than i deserve  she had spoken calmly but her next words were passionate  they thought i was fond ohim she cried oh they were blind blind frae the first i could never thole the sight o him  maybe thats no true she had to add i aye kent he was a black but yet i couldna put him out o my head he took sudden grips o me like an evil thought i aye ran frae him and yet i sair doubt that i went looking for him too  was it aaron latta tommy asked  no it was your father the first i ever saw of him was at cullew four lang miles frae thrums there was a ball after the market and esther auld and me went to it we went in a cart and i was wearing a pink print wi a white bonnet and blue ribbons that tied aneath the chin i had a shawl abune no to file them there wasna a more innocent lassie in thrums man no nor a happier one for aaron lattaaaron came half the way wi us and he was hauding my hand aneath the shawl he hadna speired me at that time but i just kent  it was an auld custom to choose a queen of beauty at the ball but that night the men couldna gree wha should be judge and in the tailend they went out thegither to look for one determined to mak judge o the first man they met though they should have to tear him off a horse and bring him in by force you wouldna believe to look at me now man that i could have had any thait o being made queen but i was fell bonny and i was as keen as the rest how simple we were all pretending to one another that we didna want to be chosen esther auld said she would hod ahint the tent till a queen was picked and at the very time she said it she was in a palsy through no being able to decide whether she looked better in her shell necklace or wanting it she put it on in the end and syne when we heard the tramp o the men her mind misgave her and she cried for the love o mercy keep them out till i get it off again so we were a laughing when they came in  laddie it was your father and elspeths that they brought wi them and he was a stranger to us though we kent something about him afore the night was out he was finely put on wi a gold chain and a free wy of looking at women and if you mind o him ava you ken that he was fair and buirdly wi a full face and aye a laugh ahint it i tell ye man that when our een met and i saw that triumphing laugh ahint his face i took a fear of him as if i had guessed the end  for years and years after that night i dreamed it ower again and aye i heard mysel crying to god to keep that man awa frae me but i doubt i put up no sic prayer at the time his masterful look fleid me and yet it drew me against my will and i was trembling wi pride as well as fear when he made me queen we danced thegither and fought thegither a through the ball and my will was no match for his and the worst ot was i had a kind o secret pleasure in being mastered  man he kissed me lads had kissed me afore that night but never since first i went wi aaron latta to the cuttle well aaron hadna done it but i was never to let none do it again except him so when your father did it i struck him but ahint the redness that came ower his face i saw his triumphing laugh and he whispered that he liked me for the blow he said i prefer the sweer anes and the more you struggle my beauty the better pleased ill be almost his hinmost words to me was ive been hearing of your aaron and that pleases me too i fired up at that and telled him what i thought of him but he said if you canna abide me what made you dance wi me so often and oh laddie thats a question that has sung in my head since syne  ive telled you that we found out wha he was and deed he made no secret of it up to the time he was twal year auld he had been a kent face in that part for his mither was a cullew woman called mag sandys ay and a single woman she was a hard ane too for when he was twelve year auld he flung out o the house saying he would neer come back and she said he shouldna run awa wi thae new boots on so she took the boots off him and let him go  he was a grown man when more was heard o him and syne stories came saying he was at redlintie playing queer games wi his father his father was gauger there thats exciseman a mr cray wha got his wife out o thrums and even when he was courting her so they say had the heart to be ower chief wi this other woman weel magerful tam as he was called through being so masterful cast up at redlintie frae none kent where gey desperate for siller but wi a black coat on his back and he said that all he wanted was to be owned as the gaugers son mr cray said there was no proof that he was his son and syne the queer sport began your father had noticed he was like mr cray except in the beard and so he had his beard clippit the same and he got hand o some weelkent claethes o the gaugers that had been presented to a poor body and he learned up a the gaugers tricks of speech and walking especially a droll wy he had o taking snuff and syne flinging back his head they were as like as buckies after that and soon there was a town about it for one day ladies would find that they had been bowing to the son thinking he was the father and the next they wouldna speak to the father mistaking him for the son and a report spread to the head office o the excise that the gauger of redlintie spent his evenings at a public house singing the deils awa wi the exciseman tam drank nows and nans and it gae mr cray a turn to see him come rolling yont the street just as if it was himsel in a lookingglass he was a sedateliving man now but chiefly because his wife kept him in good control and this sight brought back auld times so vive to him that he a kind of mistook which ane he was and took to dropping forgetfullike into publichouses again it was high time tam should be got out of the place and they did manage to bribe him into leaving though no easily for it had been fine sport to him and to make a sensation was what he valued above all things we heard that he went back to redlintie a curran years after but both the gauger and his wife were dead and i ken that he didna trouble the twa daughters they were miss ailie and miss kitty and as they werena left as well off as was expected they came to thrums which had been their mothers town and started a school for the gentry there i dinna doubt but what its the school that esther aulds laddie is at  so after being long lost sight o he turned up at cullew wi what looked to simple folk a fortune in his pouches and half a dozen untrue stories about how he made it he had come to make a show o himsel afore his mither and i dare say to give her some gold for he was aye ready to give when he had ill say that for him but she had flitted to some unkent place and so he bade on some weeks at the cullew public he caredna whether the folk praised or blamed him so long as they wondered at him and queer stories about his doings was aye on the road to thrums one was that he gave wild suppers to whaever would come another that he went to the kirk just for the glory of flinging a sovereign into the plate wi a clatter another that when he lay sleeping on twa chairs gold and silver dribbled out o his trouser pouches to the floor  there was an ugly story too about a lassie that led to his leaving the place and coming to thrums after he had near killed the cullew smith in a fight the first i heard o his being in thrums was when aaron latta walked into my grannys house and said there was a strange man at the tappit hen public standing drink to any that would tak and boasting that he had but to waggle his finger to make me give aaron up i went wi aaron and looked in at the window but i kent wha it was afore i looked if aaron had just gone in and struck him all decent women laddie has a horror of being fought about im no sure but what thats just the difference atween guid ones and ill ones but this man had a power ower me and if aaron had just struck him instead o meddling he turned white and i couldna help contrasting them and thinking how masterful your father looked fine i kent he was a brute and yet i couldna help admiring him for looking so magerful  he bade on at the tappit hen flinging his siller about in the way that made him a king at cullew but no molesting miss ailie and miss kitty which all but me thought was what he had come to thrums to do aaron and me was cried for the first time the sabbath after he came and the next sabbath for the second time but afore that he was aye getting in my road and speaking to me but i ran frae him and hod frae him when i could and he said the reason i did that was because i kent his will was stronger than mine he was aye saying things that made me think he saw down to the bottom o my soul what i didna understand was that in mastering other women he had been learning to master me ay but though i thought ower muckle about him never did i speak him fair i looed aaron wi all my heart and your father kent it and that i doubt was what made him so keen for oh but he was vain  and now weve come to the night im so sweer to speak about she was a good happy lassie that went into the den that moonlight night wi aarons arm round her but it was another woman that came out we thought we had the den to oursels and as we sat on the shoaging stane at the cuttle well aaron wrote wi a stick on the ground jean latta and prigged wi me to look at it but i spread my hands ower my face and he didna ken that i was keeking at it through my fingers all the time we was so taen up with oursels that we saw nobody coming and all at once there was your father by the side o us youve written the wrong name aaron he said jeering and pointing with his foot at the letters it should be jean sandys  aaron said not a word but i had a presentiment of ill and i cried dinna let him change the name aaron your father had been to change it himsel but at that he had a new thait and he said no ill no do it your brave aaron shall do it for me  laddie it doesna do for a man to be a coward afore a woman thats fond o him a woman will thole a mans being anything except like hersel when i was sure aaron was a coward i stood still as death waiting to ken whas i was to be  aaron did it he was loath but your father crushed him to the ground and said do it he should and warned him too that if he did it he would lose me bantering him and cowing him and advising him no to shame me all in a breath he kent so weel you see what was in my mind and aye there was that triumphing laugh ahint his face if aaron had fought and been beaten even if he had just lain there and let the man strike away if he had done anything except what he was bidden he would have won for it would have broken your fathers power ower me but to write the word it was like dishonoring me to save his ain skin and your father took good care he should ken it youve heard me crying to aaron in my sleep but it wasna for him i cried it was for his fireside all the love i had for him and it was muckle was skailed forever that night at the cuttle well without a look ahint me away i went wi my master and i had no more will to resist himand oh man man when i came to mysel next morning i wished i had never been born  the men folk saw that aaron had shamed them and they werena quite so set agin me as the women wha had guessed the truth though they couldna be sure ot sair i pitied mysel and sair i grat but only when none was looking the mair they miscalled me the higher i held my head and i hung on your fathers arm as if i adored him and i boasted about his office and his clerk in london till they believed what i didna believe a word o myself  but though i put sic a brave face ont i was near demented in case he shouldna marry me and he kent that and jokit me about it dinna think i was fond o him i hated him now and dinna think his masterfulness had any more power ower me his power was broken forever when i woke up that weary morning but that was ower late and to wait on by mysel in thrums for what might happen and me a single womani daredna so i flattered at him and flattered at him till i got the fool side o him and he married me  my granny let the marriage take place in her house and he sent in so muckle meat and drink that some folk was willing to come one came that wasna wanted in the middle o the marriage aaron latta wha had refused to speak to anybody since that night walked in wearing his blacks wi crape on them as if it was a funeral and all he said was that he had come to see jean myles coffined he went away quietly as soon as we was married but the crowd outside had fathomed his meaning and abune the ministers words i could hear them crying ay its mair like a burial than a marriage  my heart was near breaking wi woe but oh i was awid they shouldna ken it and the bravest thing i ever did was to sit through the supper that night making muckle o your father looking fondlike at him laughing at his coarse jokes and secretly hating him down to my very marrow a the time the crowd got word o the ongoings and they took a cruel revenge a carriage had been ordered for nine oclock to take us to tilliedrum where we should get the train to london and when we heard it as we thought drive up to the door out we went me on your fathers arm laughing but wi my teeth set but aarons words had put an idea into their heads though he didna intend it and they had got out the hearse it was the hearse they had brought to the door instead of a carriage  we got awa in a carriage in the tailend and the stanes hitting it was all the good luck flung after me it had just one horse and i mind how i cried to esther auld wha had been the first to throw that when i came back it would be in a carriage and pair  ay i had pride in the carriage your father telled me as a joke that he had got away without paying the supper and that about all the money he had now forby what was to pay our tickets to london was the halfsovereign on his watchchain but i was determined to have thrums think i had married grand and as i had three pound six on me the savings o all my days i gave two pound of it to malcolm crabb the driver unbeknown to your father but pretending it was frae him and telled him to pay for the supper and the carriage with it he said it was far ower muckle but i just laughed and said wealthy gentlemen like mr sandys couldna be bothered to take back change so malcolm could keep what was ower malcolm was the man esther auld had just married and i counted on this maddening her and on malcolms spreading the story through the town laddie ive kent since syne what it is to be without bite or sup but ive never grudged that siller  the poor woman had halted many times in her tale and she was glad to make an end youve forgotten what a life he led me in london she said and it could do you no good to hear it though it might be a lesson to thae lassies at the dancingschool wha think so much o masterful men it was by betting at horseraces that your father made a living and whiles he was large o siller but that didna last and i question whether he would have stuck to me if i hadna got work well hes gone and the thrums folkll soon ken the truth about jean myles now  she paused and then cried with extraordinary vehemence oh man how i wish i could keep it frae them for ever and ever  but presently she was calm again and she said what ive been telling you you can understand little o the now but some of it will come back to you when youre a grown man and if youre magerful and have some lassie in your grip maybe for the memory of her that bore you youll let the poor thing awa  and she asked him to add this to his nightly prayer o god keep me from being a magerful man and to teach this other prayer to elspeth o god whatever is to be my fate may i never be one of them that bow the knee to magerful men and if i was born like that and canna help it oh take me up to heaven afore im filt  the wardrobe was invisible in the darkness but they could still hear elspeths breathing as she slept and the exhausted woman listened long to it as if she would fain carry away with her to the other world the memory of that sweet sound  if you gang to thrums she said at last you may hear my story frae some that winna spare me in the telling but should elspeth be wi you at sic times dinna answer back just slip quietly away wi her shes so young that shell soon forget all about her life in london and all about me and thatll be best for her i would like her lassiehood to be bright and free frae cares as if there had never been sic a woman as me but laddie oh my laddie dinna you forget me you and me had him to thole thegither dinna you forget me watch ower your little sister by day and hap her by night and when the time comes that a man wants herif he be magerful tell her my story at once but gin she loves one that is her ain true love dinna rub off the bloom laddie with a word about me let her and him gang to the cuttle well as aaron and me went kenning no guile and thinking none and with their arms round one anothers waists but when her weddingday comes round  her words broke in a sob and she cried i see them i see them standing up thegither afore the minister oh you lad you lad thats to be married on my elspeth turn your face and let me see that youre no a magerful man  but the lad did not turn his face and when she spoke next it was to tommy  in the bottom o my kist theres a little silver teapot its no real silver but its fell bonny i bought it for elspeth twa or three months back when i saw i couldna last the winter i bought it to her for a marriage present shes no to see it till her weddingday comes round syne youre to give it to her man and say its with her mothers love tell her all about me for it canna harm her then tell her of the fool lies i sent to thrums but dinna forget what a bonny place i thought it all the time nor how i stood on many a driech night at the corner of that street looking so waeful at the lighted windows and hungering for the wring of a thrums hand or the sound of the thrums word and all the time the shrewd blasts cutting through my thin trails of claithes tell her man how you and me spent this night and how i fought to keep my hoast down so as no to waken her mind that whatever i have been i was aye fond o my bairns and slaved for them till i dropped shell have long forgotten what i was like and its just as well but yetlook at me tommy look long long so as youll be able to call up my face as it was on the farback night when i telled you my mournful story na you canna see in the dark but haud my hand haud it tight so that when you tell elspeth youll mind how hot it was and the skin loose on it and put your hand on my cheeks man and feel how wet they are wi sorrowful tears and lay it on my breast so that you can tell her how i was shrunk awa and if she greets for her mother a whiley let her greet  the sobbing boy hugged his mother do you think im an auld woman she said to him  youre gey auld are you no he answered  ay she said im gey auld im nine and twenty i was seventeen on the day when aaron latta went halfroad in the cart wi me to cullew hauding my hand aneath my shawl he hadna spiered me but i just kent  tommy remained in his mothers bed for the rest of the night and so many things were buzzing in his brain that not for an hour did he think it time to repeat his new prayer at last he said reverently o god keep me from being a magerful man then he opened his eyes to let god see that his prayer was ended and added to himself but i think i would fell like it     chapter xi  aaron latta   the airlie post had dropped the letters for outlying farms at the monypenny smithy and trudged on the smith having wiped his hand on his hair made a row of them without looking at the addresses on his windowsill where happening to be seven in number they were almost a model of monypenny which is within hail of thrums but round the corner from it and so has ways of its own with the next clang on the anvil the middle letter fell flat and now the likeness to monypenny was absolute  again all the sound in the land was the melancholy sweet kink kink kink of the smiths hammer  across the road sat dite deuchars the molecatcher a solitary figure taking his pleasure on the dyke behind him was the flourmillers field and beyond it the den of which only some treetops were visible he looked wearily east the road but no one emerged from thrums he looked wearily west the road which doubled out of sight at aaron lattas cottage little more than a stones throw distant on the inside of aarons window an endless procession seemed to be passing but it was only the warping mill going round it was an empty day but dite the accursed was used to them nothing ever happened where he was but many things as soon as he had gone  he yawned and looked at the houses opposite they were all of one story the smiths had a rusty plough stowed away on its roof under a window stood a pew and bookboard bought at the roup of an old church and thus transformed into a gardenseat there were many of them in thrums that year all the doors except that of the smithy were shut until one of them blew ajar when dite knew at once from the smell which crossed the road that blinder was in the bunk pulling the teeth of his potatoes may ann irons the blind mans niece came out at this door to beat the cistern with a bass and she gave dite a wag of her head he was to be married to her if she could get nothing better  by and by the painted lady came along the road she was a little woman brightly dressed so fragile that a collie might have knocked her over with his tail and she had a beautiful whiteandpink face the white ending of a sudden in the middle of her neck where it met skin of a duller color as she tripped along with mincing gait she was speaking confidentially to herself but when she saw dite grinning she seemed first afraid and then sorry for herself and then she tried to carry it off with a giggle cocking her head impudently at him even then she looked childish and a faded guilelessness with many pretty airs and graces still lingered about her like innocent birds loath to be gone from the spot where their nest has been when she had passed monotony again reigned and dite crossed to the smithy window though none of the letters could be for him he could read the addresses on six of them but the seventh lay on its back and every time he rose on his tiptoes to squint down at it the spout pushed his bonnet over his eyes  smith he cried in at the door to gang hame afore i ken wha that letters to is more than i can do  the smith goodnaturedly brought the letter to him and then glancing at the address was dumfounded god behears he exclaimed with a sudden look at the distant cemetery its to double dykes  dite also shot a look at the cemetery hell never get it he said with mighty conviction  the two men gazed at the cemetery for some time and at last dite muttered ay ay double dykes you was aye fond o your joke  what has that to do wi t rapped out the smith uncomfortably  dite shuddered man he said does that letter no bring double dykes back terrible vive again if we was to see him climbing the cemetery dyke the now and coming stepping down the fields in his moleskin waistcoat wi the pearl buttons  auchterlonie stopped him with a nervous gesture  but it couldna be the pearl buttons dite added thoughtfully for betty finlayson has been wearing them to the kirk this four year ay ay double dykes that puts you farther awa again  the smith took the letter to a neighbors house to ask the advice of old irons the blind tailor who when he lost his sight had given himself the name of blinder for bairns to play with  make your mind easy smith was blinders counsel the letter is meant for the painted lady whats double dykes its but the name of a farm and we gave it to sanders because he was the farmer hes dead and them thats in the house now become double dykes in his place  but the painted lady only had the house objected dite nether drumgley was farming the land and so he was the real double dykes true she might have pretended to her friends that she had the land also  she had no friends the smith said and since she came to double dykes from no one could find out where though they knew her furniture was bought in tilliedrum she had never got a letter often though as she passed his window she had keeked sideways at the letters as bairns might look at parlys if he made a tinkle with his hammer at such times off she went at once for she was as easily flichtered as a field of crows that take wing if you tap your pipe on the loof of your hand it was true she had spoken to him once when he suddenly saw her standing at his smiddy door the surprise near made him fall over his brot she looked so neat and ladylike that he gave his hair a respectful pull before he remembered the kind of woman she was  and what was it she said to him dite asked eagerly  she had pointed to the letters on the windowsill and said she oh the dear loves it was a queer say but she had a bonny english word the english word was no doubt prideful but it melted in the mouth like a lick of sirup she offered him sixpence for a letter any letter he liked but of course he refused it then she prigged with him just to let her hold one in her hands for said she bairnlike i used to get one every day it so happened that one of the letters was to mysy bobbie and mysy was of so little importance that he thought there would be no harm in letting the painted lady hold her letter so he gave it to her and you should have seen her dawting it with her hand and holding it to her breast like a lassie with a pigeon isnt it sweet she said and before he could stop her she kissed it she forgot it was no letter of hers and made to open it and then she fell atrembling and saying she durst not read it for you never knew whether the first words might not break your heart the envelope was red where her lips had touched it and yet she had an innocent look beneath the paint when he took the letter from her though she called him a low vulgar fellow for presuming to address a lady she worked herself into a fury and said far worse than that a perfect guller of clarty language came pouring out of her he had heard women curse many a time without turning a hair but he felt wae when she did it for she just spoke it like a bairn that had been in ill company  the smiths wife suphy who had joined the company thought that men were easily taken in especially smiths she offered however to convey the letter to double dykes she was anxious to see the inside of the painted ladys house and this would be a good opportunity she admitted that she had crawled to the east window of it before now but that dour bairn of the painted ladys had seen her head and whipped down the blind  unfortunate suphy she could not try the window this time as it was broad daylight and the painted lady took the letter from her at the door she returned crestfallen and for an hour nothing happened the molecatcher went off to the square saying despondently that nothing would happen until he was round the corner no sooner had he rounded the corner than something did happen  a girl who had left double dykes with a letter was walking quickly toward monypenny she wore a white pinafore over a magenta frock and no one could tell her whether she was seven or eight for she was only the painted ladys child some boys her natural enemies were behind they had just emerged from the den and she heard them before they saw her and at once her little heart jumped and ran off with her but the halloo that told her she was discovered checked her running her teeth went into her underlip now her head was erect after her came the rabble with a rush flinging stones that had no mark and epithets that hit grizel disdained to look over her shoulder little hunted child where was succor to come from if she could not fight for herself  though under the torture she would not cry out whats a father was their favorite jeer because she had once innocently asked this question of a false friend one tried to snatch the letter from her but she flashed him a look that sent him to the other side of the dyke where he said did she think he was afraid of her another strutted by her side mimicking her in such diverting manner that presently the others had to pick him out of the ditch thus grizel moved onward defiantly until she reached monypenny where she tossed the letter in at the smithy door and immediately returned home it was the letter that had been sent to her mother now sent back because it was meant for the dead farmer after all  the smith read jean myless last letter with a face of growing gravity dear double dykes it said i send you these few scrapes to say i am dying and you and aaron latta was seldom sindry so i charge you to go to him and say to him aaron latta its all lies jean myles wrote to thrums about her grandeur and her man died mony year back and it was the only kindness he ever did her and if she doesna die quick her and her starving bairns will be flung out into the streets if that doesna move him say aaron latta do you mind yon day at inverquharity and the cushie doos likewise aaron latta do you mind yon day at the kaims of airlie likewise aaron latta do you mind that jean myles was ower heavy for you to lift oh aaron you could lift me so pitiful easy now and syne says you solemnly three times aaron latta jean myles is lying dying all alone in a foreign land aaron latta jean myles is lying dying all alone in a foreign land aaron latta jean myles is lying dying all alone in a foreign land and if hes sweer to come just say oh aaron man you micht oh aaron oh aaron are you coming  the smith had often denounced this woman but he never said a word against her again he stood long reflecting and then took the letter to blinder and read it to him  she doesna say oh aaron latta do you mind the cuttle well was the blind mans first comment  she was thinking about it said auchterlonie  ay and hes thinking about it said blinder night and day night and day what a town therell be about that letter smith  there will but im to take it to aaron afore the news spreads hell never gang to london though  i think he will smith  i ken him well  maybe i ken him better  you canna see the ugly mark it left on his brow  i can see the uglier marks it has left in his breast  well ill take the letter i can do no more  when the smith opened the door of aarons house he let out a draught of hot air that was glad to be gone from the warpers restless home the usual hallan or passage divided the but from the ben and in the ben a great revolving thing the warpingmill half filled the room between it and a pile of webs that obscured the light a little silent man was sitting on a box turning a handle his shoulders were almost as high as his ears as if he had been caught forever in a storm and though he was barely five and thirty he had the tattered dishonored beard of black and white that comes to none till the glory of life has gone  suddenly the smith appeared round the webs aaron he said awkwardly do you mind jean myles  the warper did not for a moment take his eyes off a contrivance with pirns in it that was climbing up and down the whirring mill  shes dead he answered  shes dying said the smith  a thread broke and aaron had to rise to mend it  stop the mill and listen auchterlonie begged him but the warper returned to his seat and the mill again revolved  this is her dying words to you continued the smith did you speak  i didna but i wish you would take your arm off the haik  shes loath to die without seeing you do you hear man you shall listen to me i tell you  i am listening smith the warper replied without rancour its but right that you should come here to take your pleasure on a shamed man his calmness gave him a kind of dignity  did i ever say you was a shamed man aaron  am i not the warper asked quietly and auchterlonie hung his head  aaron continued still turning the handle youre truthful and you canna deny it nor will you deny that i shamed you and every other mothers son that night you try to hod it out o pity smith but even as you look at me now does the man in you no rise up against me  if so the smith answered reluctantly if so its against my will  it is so said aaron in the same measured voice and its right that it should be so a man may thieve or debauch or murder and yet no be so very different frae his fellowmen but theres one thing he shall not do without their wanting to spit him out o their mouths and that is violate the feelings of sex  the strange words in which the warper described his fall had always an uncomfortable effect on those who heard him use them and auchterlonie could only answer in distress maybe thats what it is  thats what it is i have had twal lang years sitting on this box to think it out i blame none but mysel  then youll have pity on jean in her sair need said the smith he read slowly the first part of the letter but aaron made no comment and the mill had not stopped for a moment  she says the smith proceeded doggedlyshe says to say to you aaron latta do you mind yon day at inverquharity and the cushie doos  only the monotonous whirr of the mill replied  she says aaron latta do you mind that jean myles was ower heavy for you to lift oh aaron you could lift me so pitiful easy now  another thread broke and the warper rose with sudden fury  now that youve eased your conscience smith he said fiercely make your feet your friend  ill do so auchterlonie answered laying the letter on the webs but i leave this ahint me  wap it in the fire  if thats to be done you do it yoursel aaron she treated you ill but  theres the door smith  the smith walked away and had only gone a few steps when he heard the whirr of the mill again he went back to the door  shes dying man he cried  let her die answered aaron  in an hour the sensational news was through half of thrums of which monypenny may be regarded as a broken piece left behind like the dot of quicksilver in the tube to show how high the town once rose some could only rejoice at first in the downcome of jean myles but most blamed the smith and himself among them for not taking note of her address so that thrums street could be informed of it and sent to her relief for blinder alone believed that aaron would be softened  it was twa threads the smith saw him break the blind man said and aarons good at his work hell go to london i tell you  you forget blinders that he was warping afore i was a dozen steps frae the door  ay and that just proves he hadna burned the letter for he hadna time if he didna do it at the first impulse hell no do it now  every little while the boys were sent along the road to look in at aarons end window and report  at seven in the evening aaron had not left his box and the blind mans reputation for seeing farther than those with eyes was fallen low  its a good sign he insisted nevertheless it shows his minds troubled for he usually louses at six  by eight the news was that aaron had left his mill and was sitting staring at his kitchen fire  hes thinking o inverquharity and the cushie doos said blinder  more likely said dite deuchars hes thinking o the cuttle well  corp shiach clattered along the road about nine to say that aaron latta was putting on his blacks as if for a journey  at once the blind mans reputation rose on stilts it fell flat however before the tenoclock bell rang when three of the auchterlonie children each pulling the others back that he might arrive first announced that aaron had put on his corduroys again and was back at the mill  that settles it was everyones goodnight to blinder but he only answered thoughtfully theres a fierce fight going on my billies  next morning when his niece was shaving the blind man the razor had to travel over a triumphant smirk which would not explain itself to womankind blinder being a man who could bide his time the time came when the smith looked in to say should i gang yont to aarons and see if hell give me the puir womans address  no i wouldna advise that answered blinder cleverly concealing his elation for aaron lattas awa to london  what how can you ken  i heard him go by in the night  its no possible  i kent his foot  youre sure it was aaron  blinder did not consider the question worth answering his sharpness at recognizing friends by their tread being proved sometimes he may have carried his pretensions too far many granted that he could tell when a doctor went by when a lawyer when a thatcher when a herd and this is conceivable for all callings have their walk but he was regarded as uncanny when he claimed not only to know ministers in this way but to be able to distinguish between the steps of the different denominations  he had made no mistake about the warper however aaron was gone and ten days elapsed before he was again seen in thrums     chapter xii  a childs tragedy   no one in thrums ever got a word from aaron latta about how he spent those ten days and tommy and elspeth whom he brought back with him also tried to be reticent but some of the women were too clever for them jean and aaron did not meet again her first intimation that he had come she got from shovel who said that a little highshouldered man in black had been inquiring if she was dead and was now walking up and down the street like one waiting she sent her children out to him but he would not come up he had answered tommy roughly but when elspeth slipped her hand into his he let it stay there and he instructed her to tell jean myles that he would bury her in the thrums cemetery and bring up her bairns jean managed once to go to the window and look down at him and by and by he looked up and saw her they looked long at each other and then he turned away his head and began to walk up and down again  at tilliedrum the coffin was put into a hearse and thus conveyed to monypenny aaron and the two children sitting on the boxseat someone said jean myles boasted that when she came back to thrums it would be in her carriage and pair and she has kept her word and the saying is still preserved in that bible for weekdays of which all little places have their unwritten copy one of the wisest of books but nearly every text in it has cost a life  about a score of men put on their blacks and followed the hearse from the warpers house to the grave elspeth wanted to accompany tommy but aaron held her back saying quietly in this part its only men that go to burials so you and me maun bide at name and then she cried no one understood why except tommy it was because he would see thrums first but he whispered to her i promise to keep my eyes shut and no look once and so faithfully did he keep his promise on the whole that the smith held him by the hand most of the way under the impression that he was blind  but he had opened his eyes at the grave when a cord was put into his hand and then he wept passionately and on his way back to monypenny whether his eyes were open or shut what he saw was his mother being shut up in a black hole and trying for ever and ever to get out he ran to elspeth for comfort but in the meantime she had learned from blinders niece that graves are dark and cold and so he found her sobbing even like himself tommy could never bear to see elspeth crying and he revealed his true self in his way of drying her tears  it will be so cold in that hole she sobbed  no he said its warm  it will be dark  no its clear  she would like to get out  no she was terrible pleased to get in  it was characteristic of him that he soon had elspeth happy by arguments not one of which he believed himself characteristic also that his own grief was soothed by the sound of them aaron who was in the garret preparing their bed had told the children that they must remain indoors today out of respect to their mothers memory tomorrow morning they could explore thrums but there were many things in that kitchen for them to look at and exult over it had no commonplace ceiling the couples or rafters being covered with the loose flooring of a romantic garret and in the rafters were several great hooks from one of which hung a ham and tommy remembered with a thrill which he communicated to elspeth that it is the right of thrums children to snip off the ham as much as they can remove with their fingernails and roast it on the ribs of the fire the chief pieces of furniture were a dresser a corner cupboard with diamond panes two tables one of which stood beneath the other but would have to come out if aaron tried to bake and a bed with a door these two did not know it but the room was full of memories of jean myles the corner cupboard had been bought by aaron at a roup because she said she would like to have one it was she who had chosen the six cups and saucers with the blue spots on them a razorstrop now hard as iron hung on a nail on the wall it had not been used since the last time aaron strutted through the den with his sweetheart one day later he had opened the door of the birdcage which still stood in the window and let the yellow yite go many things were where no woman would have left them clothes on the floor with the nail they had torn from the wall on a chair a tin basin soapy water and a flannel rag in it horn spoons with whistles at the end of them were anywhereon the mantelpiece beneath the bed there were drawers that could not be opened because their handles were inside perhaps the windows were closed hopelessly also but this must be left doubtful no one had ever tried to open them  the garret where tommy and elspeth were to sleep was reached by a ladder from the hallan when you were near the top of the ladder your head hit a trapdoor and pushed it open at one end of the garret was the bed and at the other end were piled sticks for firewood and curious darkcolored slabs whose smell the children disliked until tommy said excitedly peat and then they sniffed reverently  it was tommy too who discovered the treetops of the den and elspeth seeing him gazing in a transport out at the window cried what is it tommy quick  promise no to scream he replied warningly well then elspeth sandys thats where the den is  elspeth blinked with awe and anon said wistfully tommy do you see that there thats where the den is  it were me what told you cried tommy jealously  but let me tell you tommy  well then you can tell me  that there is the den tommy  dagont  oh that tomorrow were here oh that shovel could see these two tomorrow  here is another splendid game t sandys inventor the girl goes into the bed the boy shuts the door on her and imitates the sound of a train in motion he opens the door and cries tickets please the girl says what is the name of this place the boy replies its thrums there is more to follow but the only two who have played the game always roared so joyously at this point that they could get no farther  oh tomorrow come quick quick  oh poor shovel  tomorrow came and with it two eager little figures rose and gulped their porridge and set off to see thrums they were dressed in the black clothes aaron latta had bought for them in london and they had agreed just to walk but when they reached the door and saw the treetops of the den theythey ran would you not like to hold them back it is a childs tragedy  they went first into the den and the rocks were dripping wet all the trees save the firs were bare and the mud round a tiny spring pulled off one of elspeths boots  tommy she cried quaking that narsty puddle cant not be the cuttle well can it  no it aint said tommy quickly but he feared it was  its cccolder here than london elspeth said shivering and tommy was shivering too but he answered imimim warm  the den was strangely small and soon they were on a shabby brae where women in short gowns came to their doors and men in nightcaps sat down on the shafts of their barrows to look at jean myless bairns  what does yer think elspeth whispered very doubtfully  theyre beauties tommy answered determinedly  presently elspeth cried oh tommy what a ugly stair where is the beauty stairs as is wore outside for show  this was one of them and tommy knew it wait till you see the west town end he said bravely its grand but when they were in the west town end and he had to admit it wait till you see the square he said and when they were in the square wait he said huskily till you see the townhouse alas this was the townhouse facing them and when they knew it he said hurriedly wait till you see the auld licht kirk  they stood long in front of the auld licht kirk which he had sworn was bigger and lovelier than st pauls butwell it is a different style of architecture and had elspeth not been there with tears in waiting tommy would have blubbered itsits littler than i thought he said desperately butthe minister oh what a wonderful big man he is  are you sure elspeth squeaked  i swear he is  the church door opened and a gentleman came out a little man boyish in the back with the eager face of those who live too quickly but it was not at him that tommy pointed reassuringly it was at the monster church key half of which protruded from his tail pocket and waggled like the hilt of a sword  speaking like an old residenter tommy explained that he had brought his sister to see the church shes taen aback he said picking out scotch words carefully because its littler than the london kirks but i telled heri telled her that the preaching is better  this seemed to please the stranger for he patted tommy on the head while inquiring how do you know that the preaching is better  tell him elspeth replied tommy modestly  there aint nuthin as tommy dont know elspeth explained he knows what the minister is like too  hes a noble sight said tommy  he can get anything from god he likes said elspeth  hes a terrible big man said tommy  this seemed to please the little gentleman less big he exclaimed irritably why should he be big  he is big elspeth almost screamed for the minister was her last hope  nonsense said the little gentleman he iswell i am the minister  you roared tommy wrathfully  oh oh oh sobbed elspeth  for a moment the rev mr dishart looked as if he would like to knock two little heads together but he walked away without doing it  never mind tommy whispered hoarsely to elspeth never mind elspeth you have me yet  this consolation seldom failed to gladden her but her disappointment was so sharp today that she would not even look up  come away to the cemetery its grand he said but still she would not be comforted  and ill let you hold my handas soon as were past the houses he added  ill let you hold it now he said eventually but even then elspeth cried dismally and her sobs were hurting him more than her  he knew all the ways of getting round elspeth and when next he spoke it was with a sorrowful dignity i didna think he said as yer wanted me never to be able to speak again no i didna think it elspeth  she took her hands from her face and looked at him inquiringly  one of the stories mamma telled me and reddy he said were about a man what saw such a beauty thing that he was struck dumb with admiration struck dumb is never to be able to speak again and i wish i had been struck dumb when you wanted it  but i didnt want it elspeth cried  if thrums had been one little bit beautier than it is he went on solemnly it would have struck me dumb it would have hurt me sore but what about that if it pleased you  then did elspeth see what a wicked girl she had been and when next the two were observed by the curious it was on the cemetery road they were once more looking cheerful at the smallest provocation they exchanged notes of admiration such as oh tommy what a bonny barrel or oh elspeth i tell yer thats a dyke and theres just walls in london but sometimes elspeth would stoop hastily pretending that she wanted to tie her bootlace but really to brush away a tear and there were moments when tommy hung very limp each was trying to deceive the other for the others sake and one of them was never good at deception they saw through each other yet kept up the chilly game because they could think of nothing better and perhaps the game was worth playing for love invented it  they sat down on their mothers grave no stone was ever erected to the memory of jean myles but it is enough for her that she lies at home that comfort will last her to the judgment day  the man who had dug the grave sent them away and they wandered to the hill and thence down the roods where there were so many outside stairs not put there for show that it was well elspeth remembered how susceptible tommy was to being struck dumb for her sake he said theyre bonny and for his sake she replied im glad they aint bonnier  when within one turn of monypenny they came suddenly upon some boys playing at capeydykey a game with marbles that is only known in thrums there are thirtyfive ways of playing marbles but this is the best way and elspeth knew that tommy was hungering to look on but without her lest he should be accused of sweethearting so she offered to remain in the background  was she sure she shouldnt mind  she said falteringly that of course she would mind a little but  then tommy was irritated and said he knew she would mind but if she just pretended she didnt mind he could leave her without feeling that he was mean  so elspeth affected not to mind and then he deserted her conscience at rest which was his nature but he should have remained with her the players only gave him the side of their eye and a horrid fear grew on him that they did not know he was a thrums boy dagont he cried to put them right on that point but though they paused in their game it was only to laugh at him uproariously let the historian use an oath for once dagont tommy had said the swear in the wrong place  how fond he had been of that word many a time he had fired it in the face of londoners and the flash had often blinded them and always him now he had brought it home and thrums would have none of it it was as if these boys were jeering at their own flag he tottered away from them until he came to a trance or passage where he put his face to the wall and forgot even elspeth  he had not noticed a girl pass the mouth of the trance trying not very successfully to conceal a brandybottle beneath her pinafore but presently he heard shouts and looking out he saw grizel the painted ladys child in the hands of her tormentors she was unknown to him of course but she hit back so courageously that he watched her with interest untiluntil suddenly he retreated farther into the trance he had seen elspeth go on her knees obviously to ask god to stay the hands and tongues of these cruel boys  elspeth had disgraced him he felt he was done with her forever if they struck her serve her right  struck her struck little elspeth his imagination painted the picture with one sweep of its brush take care you boys tommy is scudding back  they had not molested elspeth as yet when they saw and heard her praying they had bent forward agape as if struck suddenly in the stomach then one of them francie crabb the goldenhaired son of esther auld recovered and began to knead grizels back with his fists less in viciousness than to show that the prayer was futile into this scene sprang tommy and he thought that elspeth was the kneaded one had he taken time to reflect he would probably have used the thrums feint and then in with a lefthander which is not very efficacious in its own country but being in a hurry he let out with shovels favorite and down went francie crabb  would you said tommy threatening when francie attempted to rise  he saw now that elspeth was untouched that he had rescued an unknown girl and it cannot be pretended of him that he was the boy to squire all ladies in distress in ordinary circumstances he might have left grizel to her fate but having struck for her he felt that he would like to go on striking he had also the days disappointments to avenge it is startling to reflect that the little ministers height for instance put an extra kick in him  so he stood stridelegs over francie who whimpered i wouldna have struck this one if that one hadna prayed for me it wasna likely i would stand that  you shall stand it replied tommy and turning to elspeth who had risen from her knees he said pray away elspeth  elspeth refused feeling that there would be something wrong in praying from triumph and tommy about to be very angry with her had a glorious inspiration pray for yourself he said to francie and do it out loud  the other boys saw that a novelty promised and now francie need expect no aid from them at first he refused to pray but he succumbed when tommy had explained the consequences and illustrated them  tommy dictated oh god i am a sinner go on  francie not only said it but looked it  and i pray to you to repent me though i aint worthy continued tommy  and i pray to you to repent me though i aint worthy growled francie it was the arrival of aint in thrums  tommy considered and then i thank thee o god he said for telling this girlthis lassieto pray for me  two gentle taps helped to knock this out of francie  being an artist tommy had kept his best for the end and made it up first and lastly he said i thank this boy for thrashing mei mean this here laddie oh may he allus be near to thrash me when i strike this other lassie again amen  when it was all over tommy looked around triumphantly and though he liked the expression on several faces grizels pleased him best it aint no wonder you would like to be me lassie he said in an ecstasy  i dont want to be you you conceited boy retorted the painted ladys child hotly and her heat was the greater because the clever little wretch had read her thoughts aright but it was her sweet voice that surprised him  youre english he cried  so are you broke in a boy offensively and then tommy said to grizel loftily run away ill not let none on them touch you  i am not afraid of them she rejoined with scorn and i shall not let you help me and i wont run and run she did not she walked off leisurely with her head in the air and her dignity was beautiful except once when she made the mistake of turning round to put out her tongue  but alas in the end someone ran if only they had not called him english in vain he fired a volley of scotch they pretended not to understand it then he screamed that he and shovel could fight the lot of them who was shovel they asked derisively he replied that shovel was a bloke who could lick any two of themand with one hand tied behind his back  no sooner had he made this proud boast than he went white and soon two disgraceful tears rolled down his cheeks the boys saw that for some reason unknown his courage was gone and even francie crabb began to turn up his sleeves and spit upon his hands  elspeth was as bewildered as the others but she slipped her hand into his and away they ran ingloriously the foe too much astounded to jeer she sought to comfort him by saying and it brought her a step nearer womanhood you wasnt feared for yourself you wasnt you was just feared they would hurt me  but tommy sobbed in reply that aint it i bounced so much about the thrums folk to shovel and now the first day im here i heard myself bouncing about shovel to thrums folk and it were that what made me cry oh elspeth itsits not the same what i thought it would be  nor was it the same to elspeth so they sat down by the roadside and cried with their arms round each other and any passerby could look who had the heart but when night came and they were in their garret bed tommy was once more seeking to comfort elspeth with arguments he disbelieved and again he succeeded as usual too the makebelieve made him happy also  have you forgot he whispered that my mother said as she would come and see us every night in our bed if yer cries shell see as were terrible unhappy and that will make her unhappy too  oh tommy is she here now  whisht shes here but they dont like living ones to let on as they knows it  elspeth kept closer to tommy and with their heads beneath the blankets so as to stifle the sound he explained to her how they could cheat their mother when she understood he took the blankets off their faces and said in the darkness in a loud voice  its a grand place thrums  elspeth replied in a similar voice aint the townhouse just big  said tommy almost chuckling oh the bonny bonny auld licht kirk  said elspeth oh the beauty outside stairs  said tommy the minister is so long  said elspeth the folk is so kind  said tommy especially the laddies  oh i is so happy cried elspeth  me too cried tommy  my mother would be so chirpy if she could jest see us elspeth said quite archly  but she canna replied tommy slyly pinching elspeth in the rib  then they dived beneath the blankets and the whispering was resumed  did she hear does yer think asked elspeth  every word tommy replied elspeth weve done her     chapter xiii  shows how tommy took care of elspeth   thus the first day passed and others followed in which women who had known jean myles did her children kindnesses but could not do all they would have done for aaron forbade them to enter his home except on business though it was begging for a housewife all day had elspeth at the age of six now settled down to domestic duties she would not have been the youngest housekeeper ever known in thrums but she was never very good at doing things only at loving and being loved and the observant neighbors thought her a backward girl they forgot like most people that service is not necessarily a handicraft tommy discovered what they were saying and to shield elspeth he took to housewifery with the blind down but aaron entering the kitchen unexpectedly took the besom from him saying  its an ill thing for men folk to ken ower muckle about womens work  you do it yoursel tommy argued  i said men folk replied aaron quietly  the children knew that remarks of this sort had reference to their mother of whom he never spoke more directly indeed he seldom spoke to them at all and save when he was cooking or giving the kitchen a slovenly cleaning they saw little of him monypenny had predicted that their presence must make a new man of him but he was still unsociable and morose and sat as long as ever at the warpingmill of which he seemed to have become the silent wheel tommy and elspeth always dropped their voices when they spoke of him and sometimes when his mill stopped he heard one of them say to the other whisht hes coming though he seldom spoke sharply to them his face did not lose its loneliness at sight of them elspeth was his favorite somewhat to the indignation of both they found this out without his telling them or even showing it markedly and when they wanted to ask anything of him she was deputed to do it but she did it quavering and after drawing farther away from him instead of going nearer a dreary life would have lain before them had they not been sent to school  there were at this time three schools in thrums the chief of them ruled over by the terrible cathro called knuckly when you were a street away from him it was a famous school from which a band of three or four or even six marched every autumn to the universities as determined after bursaries as ever were highlandmen to lift cattle and for the same reason that they could not do without  a very different kind of dominie was cursing ballingall who had been dropped at thrums by a travelling circus and first became familiar to the town as carrying two carpet shoes two books a pillow and a saucepan which were all his belongings he wandered from manse to manse offering to write sermons for the ministers at circus prices that scheme failing he was next seen looking in at windows in search of a canny calling and eventually he cut one of his braces into a pair of tawse thus with a single stroke of the knife making himself a schoolmaster and lopsided for life his fee was but a penny a week with a bit o the swine when your father kills and sometimes there were so many pupils on a form that they could only rise as one during the first half of the scholastic day ballingalls shouts and pounces were for parents to listen to but after his dinner of crowdy which is raw meal and hot water served in a cogie or wooden bowl languor overcame him and he would sleep having first given out a sum in arithmetic and announced  the one as finds out the answer first ill give him his licks  last comes the hanky school which was for the genteel and for the common who contemplated soaring you were not admitted to it in corduroys or barefooted nor did you pay weekly no your father called four times a year with the money in an envelope he was shown into the blueandwhite room and there after business had been transacted very nervously on miss ailies part she offered him his choice between ginger wine and what she falteringly called whwhwhiskey he partook in the polite national manner which is thus  you will take something mr cortachy  no i thank you maam  a little ginger wine  it agrees ill with me  then a little whwhwhiskey  you are ower kind  then may i  i am not heeding  perhaps though you dont take  i can take it or want it  is that enough  it will do perfectly  shall i fill it up  as you please maam  miss ailies relationship to the magerful man may be remembered she shuddered to think of it herself for in middleage she retained the mind of a young girl but when duty seemed to call this schoolmistress could be brave and she offered to give elspeth her schooling free of charge like the other two hers was a mixed school but she did not want tommy because she had seen him in the square one day and there was a leer on his face that reminded her of his father  another woman was less particular this was mrs crabb of the tappit hen the esther auld whom jean myless letters had so frequently sent to bed her francie was still a pupil of miss ailie and still he wore the golden hair which despite all advice she would not crop it was so beautiful that no common boys could see it without wanting to give it a tug in passing and partly to prevent this partly to show how high she had risen in the social scale esther usually sent him to school under the charge of her servant lass she now proposed to aaron that this duty should devolve on tommy and for the service she would pay his fees at the hanky school  we maun all lend a hand to poor jeans bairns she said with a gleam in her eye it would have been well for her aaron if she had married you  is that all you have to say asked the warper who had let her enter no farther than the hallan  i would expect him to lift francie ower the pools in wet weather and it might be as well if he called him master francie  is that all  ay i ask no more for we maun all help jeans bairns if she could only look down aaron and see her little velvets as she called him lifting my little corduroys ower the pools  aaron flung open the door munt he said and he looked so dangerous that she retired at once he sent tommy to ballingalls and accepted miss ailies offer for elspeth but this was an impossible arrangement for it was known to the two persons primarily concerned that elspeth would die if she was not where tommy was the few boys he had already begun to know were at cathros or ballingalls and as they called miss ailies a lassie school he had no desire to attend it but where he was there also must elspeth be daily he escaped from ballingalls and hid near the dovecot as miss ailies house was called and every little while he gave vent to shovels whistle so that elspeth might know of his proximity and be cheered thrice was he carried back kicking to ballingalls by urchins sent in pursuit stern ministers of justice on the first two occasions but on the third they made him an offer if he would hide in couthies henhouse they were willing to look for him everywhere else for two hours  tommys behavior seemed beautiful to the impressionable miss ailie but it infuriated aaron and on the fourth day he set off for the parish school meaning to put the truant in the hands of cathro from whom there was no escape vainly had elspeth implored him to let tommy come to the dovecot and vainly apparently was she trotting at his side now looking up appealingly in his face but when they reached the gate of the parish schoolyard he walked past it because she was tugging him and always when he seemed about to turn she took his hand again and he seemed to have lost the power to resist jean myless bairn so they came to the dovecot and miss ailie gained a pupil who had been meant for cathro tommys arms were stronger than elspeths but they could not hare done as much for him that day  thus did the two children enter upon the genteel career to the indignation of the other boys and girls of monypenny all of whom were commoners     chapter xiv  the hanky school   the dovecot was a prim little cottage standing back from the steepest brae in thrums and hidden by high garden walls to the top of which another boys shoulders were for applelovers but one step up jargonelle trees grew against the house stretching their arms round it as if to measure its girth and it was also remarkable for several dumb windows with the most artful blinds painted on them miss ailies fruit was famous but she loved her flowers best and for long a notice board in her garden said appealingly persons who come to steal the fruit are requested not to walk on the flowerbeds it was that old bachelor dr mcqueen who suggested this inscription to her and she could never understand why he chuckled every time he read it  there were seven rooms in the house but only two were of public note the schoolroom which was downstairs and the blueandwhite room above the schoolroom was so long that it looked very low in the ceiling and it had a carpet and on the walls were texts as well as maps miss ailies desk was in the middle of the room and there was another desk in the corner a cloth had been hung over it as one covers a cage to send the bird to sleep perhaps miss ailie thought that a bird had once sung there for this had been the desk of her sister miss kitty who died years before tommy came to thrums dainty miss kitty miss kitty with the roguish curls it is strange to think that you are dead and that only miss ailie hears you singing now at your desk in the corner miss kitty never sang there but the playful ringlets were once the bright thing in the room and miss ailie sees them still and they are a song to her  the pupils had to bring handkerchiefs to the dovecot which led to its being called the hanky school and in time these handkerchiefs may be said to have assumed a religious character though their purpose was merely to protect miss ailies carpet she opened each scholastic day by reading fifteen verses from the bible and then she said sternly hankies whereupon her pupils whipped out their handkerchiefs spread them on the floor and kneeled on them while miss ailie repeated the lords prayer school closed at four oclock again with hankies  only on great occasions were the boys and girls admitted to the blueandwhite room when they were given shortbread but had to eat it with their heads flung back so that no crumbs should fall nearly everything in this room was blue or white or both there were white blinds and blue curtains a blue tablecover and a white crumbcloth a white sheepskin with a blue footstool on it blue chairs dotted with white buttons only white flowers came into this room where there were blue vases for them not a book was to be seen without a blue alpaca cover here miss ailie received visitors in her white with the blue braid and enrolled new pupils in blue ink with a white pen some laughed at her others remembered that she must have something to love after miss kitty died  miss ailie had her romance as you may hear by and by but you would not have thought it as she came forward to meet you in the blueandwhite room trembling lest your feet had brought in mud but too much a lady to ask you to stand on a newspaper as she would have liked dearly to do she was somewhat beyond middleage and stoutly even squarely built which gave her a masculine appearance but she had grown so timid since miss kittys death that when she spoke you felt that either her figure or her manner must have been intended for someone else in conversation she had a way of ending a sentence in the middle which gave her a reputation of being throither though an artificial tooth was the cause it was slightly loose and had she not at times shut her mouth suddenly and then done something with her tongue an accident might have happened this tooth fascinated tommy and once when she was talking he cried excitedly quick its coming whereupon her mouth snapped close and she turned pink in the blueandwhite room  nevertheless tommy became her favorite and as he had taught himself to read after a fashion in london where his lessonbooks were chiefly placards and the journal subscribed to by shovels father she often invited him after school hours to the blueandwhite room where he sat on a kitchen chair with his boots off and read aloud very slowly while miss ailie knitted the volume was from the thrums book club of which miss ailie was one of the twelve members each member contributed a book every year and as their tastes in literature differed all sorts of books came into the club and there was one member who invariably gave a rororomance he was doublechinned and forty but the schoolmistress called him the dashing young banker and for months she avoided his dangerous contribution but always there came a black day when a desire to read the novel seized her and she hurried home with it beneath her rokelay this year the dashing bankers choice was a ladys novel called i love my love with an a and it was a frivolous tale those being before the days of the new fiction with its grand discovery that women have an equal right with men to grow beards the hero had such a way with him and was so young miss ailie could not stand them a day more than twenty that the schoolmistress was enraptured and scared at every page but she fondly hoped that tommy did not understand however he discovered one day what something printed thus dn meant and he immediately said the word with such unction that miss ailie let fall her knitting she would have ended the readings then had not agatha been at that point in the arms of an officer who miss ailie felt almost certain had a wife in india and so how could she rest till she knew for certain to track the officer by herself was not to be thought of to read without knitting being such shameless waste of time and it was decided to resume the readings on a revised plan tommy to say stroke in place of the dns and word we have no concern with instead of darling and little one  miss ailie was not the only person at the dovecot who admired tommy though in duty bound as young patriots to jeer at him for having been born in the wrong place the pupils of his own age could not resist the charm of his reminiscences even gav dishart a son of the manse listened attentively to him his great topic was his birthplace and whatever happened in thrums he instantly made contemptible by citing something of the same kind but on a larger scale that had happened in london he turned up his nose almost farther than was safe when they said catlaw was a stiff mountain to climb oh gav if you just saw the london mountains snow why they didnt know what snow was in thrums if they could only see st pauls or hyde park or shovel he couldnt help laughing at thrums he couldntlarfing he said at first but in a short time his scotch was better than theirs though less unconscious his english was better also of course and you had to speak in a kind of english when inside the hanky school you got your revenge at minutes on the whole tommy irritated his fellowpupils a good deal but they found it difficult to keep away from him  he also contrived to enrage the less genteel boys of monypenny their leader was corp shiach three years tommys senior who had never been inside a school except once when he broke hopefully into ballingalls because of a stirring rumor nothing in it that the dominie had hangit himself with his remaining brace then in order of merit came birkie fleemister then perhaps the smiths family called the haggertytaggertys they were such slovens when school was over tommy frequently stepped out of his boots and stockings so that he no longer looked offensively genteel and then monypenny was willing to let him join in spyo smuggle bools kickbonnety peeries the preens suckers pilly or whatever game was in season even to the baiting of the painted lady but they would not have elspeth who should have been content to play dumps with the female haggertytaggertys but could enjoy no game of which tommy was not the larger half many times he deserted her for manlier joys but though she was out of sight he could not forget her longing face and soon he sneaked off to her he upbraided her but he stayed with her they bore with him for a time but when they discovered that she had persuaded him after prayer to put back the spugs eggs which he had brought home in triumph then they drove him from their company and for a long time afterwards his deadly enemy was the hardhitting corp shiach  elspeth was not invited to attend the readings of i love my love with an a perhaps because there were so many words in it that she had no concern with but she knew they ended as the eightoclock bell began to ring and it was her custom to meet tommy a few yards from aarons door farther she durst not venture in the gloaming through fear of the painted lady for aarons house was not far from the fearsome lane that led to double dykes and even the big boys who made faces at this woman by day ran from her in the dusk creepy tales were told of what happened to those on whom she cast a blighting eye before they could touch cold iron and tommy was one of many who kept a bit of cold iron from the smithy handy in his pocket on his way home from the readings he never had occasion to use it but at these times he sometimes met grizel who liked to do her shopping in the evenings when her persecutors were more easily eluded and he forced her to speak to him not her loneliness appealed to him but that look of admiration she had given him when he was astride of francie crabb for such a look he could pardon many rebuffs without it no praise greatly pleased him he was always on the outlook for it  i warrant he said to her one evening you want to have some manbody to take care of you the way i take care of elspeth  no i dont she replied promptly  would you no like somebody to love you  do you mean kissing she asked  theres better things in it than that he said guardedly but if you want kissing iielspethll kiss you  will she want to do it inquired grizel a little wistfully  ill make her do it tommy said  i dont want her to do it cried grizel and he could not draw another word from her however he was sure she thought him a wonder and when next they met he challenged her with it  do you not now  i wont tell you answered grizel who was never known to lie  you think im a wonder tommy persisted but you dinna want me to know you think it  grizel rocked her arms a quaint way she had when excited and she blurted out how do you know  the look he liked had come back to her face but he had no time to enjoy it for just then elspeth appeared and elspeths jealousy was easily aroused  i dinna ken you lassie he said coolly to grizel and left her stamping her foot at him she decided never to speak to tommy again but the next time they met he took her into the den and taught her how to fight  it is painful to have to tell that miss ailie was the person who provided him with the opportunity in the readings they arrived one evening at the scene in the conservatory which has not a single stroke in it but is so full of words we have no concern with that tommy reeled home blinking and next day so disgracefully did he flounder in his lessons that the gentle schoolmistress cast up her arms in despair  i dont know what to say to you she exclaimed  fine i know what you want to say he retorted and unfortunately she asked what  stroke he replied leering horridly  i love my love with an a was returned to the club forthwith whether he really did have a wife in india miss ailie never knew and judd on the shorter catechism took its place but mark the result the readings ended at a quarter to eight now at twenty to eight at halfpast seven and so tommy could loiter on the way home without arousing elspeths suspicion one evening he saw grizel cutting her way through the haggertytaggerty group and he offered to come to her aid if she would say help me but she refused  when however the haggertytaggertys were gone she condescended to say i shall never never ask you to help me butif you likeyou can show me how to hit without biting my tongue  ill learn you shovels curly ones replied tommy cordially and he adjourned with her to the den for that purpose he said he chose the den so that corp shiach and the others might not interrupt them but it was elspeth he was thinking of  you are like miss ailie with her cane when she is pandying he told grizel you begin well but you slacken just when you are going to hit  it is because my hand opens grizel said  and then it ends in a shove said her mentor severely you should close your fists like this with the thumbs inside and then play dab this way that way yon way thats what shovel calls you want it take it youve got it  thus did the hunted girl get her first lesson in scientific warfare in the den and neither she nor tommy saw the pathos of it other lessons followed and during the rests grizel told tommy all that she knew about herself he had won her confidence at last byby swearing dagont that he was english also     chapter xv  the man who never came   is it true that your mothers a bonny swearer  tommy wanted to find out all about the painted lady and the best way was to ask  she does not always swear grizel said eagerly she sometimes says sweet sweet things  what kind of things  i wont tell you  tell me one  well then beloved  word we have no concern with murmured tommy he was shocked but still curious does she say beloved to you he inquired  no she says it to him  him wha is he tommy thought he was at the beginning of a discovery but she answered uncomfortably  i dont know  but youve seen him  no hehe is not there  not there how can she speak to him if hes no there  she thinks he is there hehe comes on a horse  what is the horse like  there is no horse  but you said  she just thinks there is a horse she hears it  do you ever hear it  no  the girl was looking imploringly into tommys face as if begging it to say that these things need not terrify her but what he wanted was information  what does the painted lady do he asked when she thinks she hears the horse  she blows kisses and thenthen she goes to the den  what to do  she walks up and down the den talking to the man  and him no there cried tommy scared  no there is no one there  and syne what do you do  i wont tell you  tommy reflected and then he said shes daft  she is not always daft cried grizel there are whole weeks when she is just sweet  then what do you make of her being so queer in the den  i am not sure but i thinki think there was once a place like the den at her own home in england where she used to meet the man long ago and sometimes she forgets that it is not long ago now  i wonder wha the man was  i think he was my father  i thought you didna ken what a father was  i know now i think my father was a scotsman  what makes you think that  i heard a thrums woman say it would account for my being called grizel and i think we came to scotland to look for him but it is so long long ago  how long  i dont know we have lived here four years but we were looking for him before that it was not in this part of scotland we looked for him we gave up looking for him before we came here  what made the painted lady take a house here then  i think it was because the den is so like the place she used to meet him in long ago  what was his name  i dont know  does the painted lady no tell you about yoursel  no she is angry if i ask  her name is mary ive heard  mary gray is her name butbut i dont think it is her real name  how does she no use her real name  because she wants her own mamma to think she is dead  what makes her want that  i am not sure but i think it is because there is me i think it was naughty of me to be born can you help being born  tommy would have liked to tell her about reddy but forbore because he still believed that he had acted criminally in that affair and so for the time being the inquisition ended but though he had already discovered all that grizel knew about her mother and nearly all that curious thrums ever ferreted out he returned to the subject at the next meeting in the den  where does the painted lady get her money  oh said grizel that is easy she just goes into that house called the bank and asks for some and they give her as much as she likes  ay ive heard that but  the remainder of the question was never uttered instead  hod ahint a tree cried tommy hastily and he got behind one himself but he was too late elspeth was upon them she had caught them together at last  tommy showed great cunning pretend you have eggs in your hand he whispered to grizel and then in a loud voice he said think shame of yoursel lassie for harrying birds nests its a good thing i saw you and brought you here to force you to put them back is that you elspeth i catched this limmer wi eggs in her hands and the poor birds sic bonny singers too and so i was forcing her to  but it would not do grizel was ablaze with indignation you are a horrid storyteller she said and if i had known you were ashamed of being seen with me i should never have spoken to you take him she cried giving tommy a push toward elspeth i dont want the mean little storyteller  hes not mean retorted elspeth  nor yet little roared tommy  yes he is insisted grizel and i was not harrying nests he came with me here because he wanted to  just for the once he said hastily  this is the sixth time said grizel and then she marched out of the den tommy and elspeth followed slowly and not a word did either say until they were in front of aarons house then by the light in the window tommy saw that elspeth was crying softly and he felt miserable  i was just teaching her to fight he said humbly  you looked like it she replied with the scorn that comes occasionally to the sweetest lady  he tried to comfort her in various tender ways but none of them sufficed this time youll marry her as soon as youre a man she insisted and she would not let this tragic picture go it was a case for his biggest efforts and he opened his mouth to threaten instant selfdestruction unless she became happy at once but he had threatened this too frequently of late even shown himself drawing the knife across his throat  as usual the right idea came to him at the right moment if you just kent how i did it for your sake he said with gentle dignity you wouldna blame me you would think me noble  she would not help him with a question and after waiting for it he proceeded if you just kent wha she is and i thought she was dead what a start it gave me when i found out it was her  wha is she cried elspeth with a sudden shiver  i was trying to keep it frae you replied tommy sadly  she seized his arm is it reddy she gasped for the story of reddy had been a terror to her all her days  she doesna ken i was the laddie that diddled her in london he said and i promise you never to let on elspeth ii just went to the den with her to say things that would put her off the scent if i hadna done that she might have found out and taen your place here and tried to pack you off to the painted ladys  elspeth stared at him the other grief already forgotten and he thought he was getting on excellently when she cried with passion i dont believe as it is reddy and ran into the house  dinna believe it then disappointed tommy shouted and now he was in such a rage with himself that his heart hardened against her he sought the company of old blinder  unfortunately elspeth had believed it and her woe was the more pitiful because she saw at once what had never struck tommy that it would be wicked to keep grizel out of her rights ill no win to heaven now she said despairingly to herself for to offer to change places with grizel was beyond her courage and she tried some childish ways of getting round god such as going on her knees and saying im so little and i hinna no mother that was not a bad way  another way was to give grizel everything she had except tommy she collected all her treasures the bottle with the brass top that she had got from shovels old girl the housewife that was a present from miss ailie the teetotum the pretty buttons tommy had won for her at the game of buttony the witchy marble the twopence she had already saved for the muckley these and some other precious trifles she made a little bundle of and set off for double dykes with them intending to leave them at the door this was elspeth who in ordinary circumstances would not have ventured near that mysterious dwelling even in daylight and in tommys company there was no room for vulgar fear in her bursting little heart tonight  tommy went home anon meaning to be whatever kind of boy she seemed most in need of but she was not in the house she was not in the garden he called her name and it was only birkie fleemister mimicking her who answered oh tommy come to me but birkie had news for him  sure as death he said in some awe i saw elspeth ganging yont the double dykes and i cried to her that the painted lady would do her a mischief but she just ran on  elspeth in the double dykesaloneand at night oh how tommy would have liked to strike himself now she must have believed his wicked lie after all and being so religious she had gone tohe gave himself no time to finish the thought the vital thing was that she was in peril he seemed to hear her calling to him oh tommy come quick oh tommy oh tommy and in an agony of apprehension he ran after her but by the time he got to the beginning of the double dykes he knew that she must be at the end of them and in the painted ladys maw unless their repute by night had blown her back he paused on the coffin brig which is one long narrow stone and along the funnel of the double dykes he sent the lonely whisper elspeth are you there he tried to shout it but no boy could shout there after nightfall in the painted ladys time and when the words had travelled only a little way along the double dykes they came whining back to him like a dog despatched on uncanny work he heard no other sound save the burn stealing on tiptoe from an evil place and the uneasy rustling of treetops and his own breathing  the coffin brig remains but the double dykes have fallen bit by bit into the burn and the path they made safe is again as naked as when the kingoldrum jacobites filed along it and sweer they were to the support of the pretender it traverses a ridge and is streaked with slippery beechroots which like to fling you off your feet on the one side into a black burn twenty feet below on the other down a pleasant slope the double dykes were built by a farmer fond of his dram to stop the tongue of a waterkelpie which lived in a pool below and gave him a turn every night he staggered home by shouting drunk again peewitbrae and announcing with a smack of the lips that it had a bed ready for him in the burn so peewitbrae built two parallel dykes two feet apart and two feet high between which he could walk home like a straight man his cunning took the heart out of the brute and waterkelpies have not been seen near thrums since about that time  by day even girls played at palaulays here and it was a favorite resort of boys who knew that you were a man when you could stand on both dykes at once they also stripped boldly to the skin and then looked doubtfully at the water but at night to test your nerves you walked alone between the double dykes and the popular practice was to start off whistling which keeps up the courage at the point where you turned to run back the painted lady after you or so you thought you dropped a marked stone which told next day how far you had ventured corp shiach long held the championship and his stone was ostentatiously fixed in one of the dykes with lime tommy had suffered at his hands for saying that shovels mark was thirty yards farther on  with head bent to the level of the dykes though it was almost a mirk night beneath the trees and one arm outstretched before him straight as an elvint tommy faced this fearful passage sometimes stopping to touch cold iron but on the whole hanging back little for elspeth was in peril soon he reached the paling that was not needed to keep boys out of the painted ladys garden one of the prettiest and besttended flowergardens in thrums and crawling through where some spars had fallen he approached the door as noiseless as an indian brave after scalps there he crouched with a heart that was going like a shuttle on a loom and listened for elspeths voice  on a night he had come nearly as far as this before but in the tail of big fellows with a turnip lantern into the woodwork of the east window they had thrust a pin to which a button was tied and the button was also attached to a long string they hunkered afar off and pulled this string and then the button tapped the deathrap on the window and the sport was successful for the painted lady screamed but suddenly the door opened and they were put to flight by the fierce barking of a dog one said that the brute nabbed him in the leg another saw the vive tongue of it a third played lick at it with the lantern this was before they discovered that the dog had been grizel imitating one brave grizel always ready to protect her mother and never allowed to cherish the childish fears that were hers by birthright  tommy could not hear a sound from within but he had startling proof that elspeth was near his foot struck against something at the door and stooping he saw that it was a little bundle of the treasures she valued most so she had indeed come to stay with the painted lady if grizel proved merciless oh what a black he had been  though originally a farmhouse the cottage was no larger than aarons and of its two front windows only one showed a light and that through a blind tommy sidled round the house in the hope that the small east window would be more hospitable and just as he saw that it was blindless something that had been crouching rose between him and it  let go he cried feeling the painted ladys talons in his neck  tommy was the answer  its you elspeth  is it you tommy  of course whisht  but say it is  it is  oh tommy im so fleid  he drew her farther from the window and told her it had all been a wicked lie and she was so glad that she forgot to chide him but he denounced himself and he was better than elspeth even at that however when he learned what had brought her here he dried his eyes and skulked to the door again and brought back her belongings and then she wanted him to come away at once but the window fascinated him he knew he should never find courage to come here again and he glided toward it signing to elspeth to accompany him they were now too near double dykes for speaking to be safe but he tapped his head as a warning to her to remove her hat for a womans headgear always reaches a window in front of its wearer and he touched his cold iron and passed it to her as if it were a snuffmull thus fortified they approached the window fearfully holding hands and stepping high like a couple in a minuet     chapter xvi  the painted lady   it had been the ordinary dwelling room of the unknown poor the mean little endah no no the noblest chamber in the annals of the scottish nation here on a hard anvil has its character been fashioned and its history made at rushlights and its god ever most prominent always within reach of hands which trembled with reverence as they turned its broad page could be found the book that is compensation for all things and that was never more at home than on bare dressers and wormeaten looms if you were brought up in that place and have forgotten it there is no more hope for you  but though still recalling its past the kitchen into which tommy and elspeth peered was trying successfully to be something else the platerack had been a fixture and the coffinbed and the wooden bole or board in the wall with its round hole through which you thrust your hand when you wanted salt and instead of a real mantelpiece there was a quaint imitation one painted over the fireplace there were some pieces of furniture too such as were usual in rooms of the kind but most of them perhaps in ignorance had been put to novel uses like the platerack where the painted lady kept her many pretty shoes instead of her crockery gossip said she had a lookingglass of such prodigious size that it stood on the floor and tommy nudged elspeth to signify there it is other nudges called her attention to the carpet the spinet a chair that rocked like a cradle and some smaller oddities of which the queerest was a monster velvet glove hanging on the nail that by rights belonged to the bellows the painted lady always put on this glove before she would touch the coals which diverted tommy who knew that common folk lift coals with their bare hands while society uses the fringe of its second petticoat  it might have been a boudoir through which a kitchen and bedroom had wandered spilling by the way but though the effect was tawdry everything had been rubbed clean by that passionate housewife grizel she was on her knees at present caming the hearthstone a beautiful blue and sometimes looking round to address her mother who was busy among her plants and cut flowers surely they were knownothings who called this woman silly and blind who said she painted it was a little face all of one color dingy pale not chubby but retaining the soft contours of a childs face and the features were singularly delicate she was clad in a soft gray and her figure was of the smallest there was such an air of youth about her that tommy thought she could become a girl again by merely shortening her frock not such a girl as gaunt grizel though who would have looked a little woman had she let her frock down in appearance indeed the painted lady resembled her plain daughter not at all but in manner in a score of ways as when she rocked her arms joyously at sight of a fresh bud or tossed her brown hair from her brows with a pretty gesture that ought god knows to have been for some man to love the watchers could not hear what she and grizel said but evidently it was pleasant converse and mother and child happy in each others company presented a picture as sweet as it is common though some might have complained that they were doing each others work but the painted ladys delight in flowers was a scandal in thrums where she would stand her ground if the roughest boy approached her with roses in his hand and she gave money for them which was one reason why the people thought her daft she was tending her flowers now with experienced eye smelling them daintily and every time she touched them it was a caress  the watchers retired into the field to compare impressions and elspeth said emphatically i like her tommy im not none fleid at her  tommy had liked her also but being a man he said you forget that shes an ill one  she looks as if she didna ken that hersel answered elspeth and these words of a child are the best picture we can hope to get of the painted lady  on their return to the window they saw that grizel had finished her caming and was now sitting on the floor nursing a doll tommy had not thought her the kind to shut her eyes to the truth about dolls but she was hugging this one passionately without its clothes it was of the ninepin formation and the painted eyes and mouth had been incorporated long since in loving grizels system but it became just sweet as she swaddled it in a long yellow frock and slipped its bullet head into a duck of a pink bonnet these articles of attire and the others that you begin with had all been made by grizel herself out of the colored tissuepaper that shopkeepers wrap round brandy bottles the dolls name was griselda and it was exactly six months old and grizel had found it two years ago lying near the coffin brig naked and almost dead  it was making the usual fuss at having its clothes put on and grizel had to tell it frequently that of all the babieswhich shamed it now and again but kept her so occupied that she forgot her mother the painted lady had sunk into the rockingchair and for a time she amused herself with it but by and by it ceased to rock and as she sat looking straight before her a change came over her face elspeths hand tightened its clutch on tommys the painted lady had begun to talk to herself  she was not speaking aloud for evidently grizel whose back was toward her heard nothing but her lips moved and she nodded her head and smiled and beckoned apparently to the wall and the childish face rapidly became vacant and foolish this mood passed and now she was sitting very still only her head moving as she looked in apprehension and perplexity this way and that like one who no longer knew where she was nor who was the child by the fire when at last grizel turned and observed the change she may have sighed but there was no fear in her face the fear was on the face of her mother who shrank from her in unmistakable terror and would have screamed at a harsh word or a hasty movement grizel seemed to know this for she remained where she was and first she nodded and smiled reassuringly to her mother and then leaning forward took her hand and stroked it softly and began to talk she had laid aside her doll and with the act become a woman again  the painted lady was soothed but her bewildered look came and went as if she only caught at some explanation grizel was making to lose it in a moment yet she seemed most eager to be persuaded the little watchers at this queer play saw that grizel was saying things to her which she repeated docilely and clung to and lost hold of often grizel illustrated her words by a sort of pantomime as when she sat down on a chair and placed the doll in her lap then sat down on her mothers lap and when she had done this several times tommy took elspeth into the field to say to her  do you no see she means as she is the painted ladys bairn just the same as the doll is her bairn  if the painted lady needed to be told this every minute she was daft indeed and elspeth could peer no longer at the eerie spectacle to leave tommy however was equally difficult so she crouched at his feet when he returned to the window drawn there hastily by the sound of music  the painted lady could play on the spinet beautifully but grizel could not play though it was she who was trying to play now she was running her fingers over the notes producing noises from them while she swayed grotesquely on her seat and made comic faces her object was to capture her mothers mind and she succeeded for a short time but soon it floated away from all control and the painted lady fell ashaking violently then grizel seemed to be alarmed and her arms rocked despairingly but she went to her mother and took loving hold of her and the woman clung to her child in a way pitiful to see she was on grizels knee now but she still shivered as if in a deadly chill and her feet rattled on the floor and her arms against the sides of the chair grizel pinned the trembling arms with her own and twisted her legs round her mothers and still the painted ladys tremors shook them both so that to tommy they were as two people wrestling  the shivering slowly lessened and at last ceased but this seemed to make grizel no less unhappy to her vehement attempt to draw her mothers attention she got no response the painted lady was hearkening intently for some sound other than grizels voice and only once did she look at her child then it was with cruel ugly eyes and at the same moment she shoved grizel aside so viciously that it was almost a blow grizel sat down sorrowfully beside her doll like one aware that she could do no more and her mother at once forgot her what was she listening for so eagerly was it for the gallop of a horse tommy strained his ears  elspethspeak lowdo you hear anything  no im ower fleid to listen  whisht do you no hear a horse  no everythings terrible still do you hear a horse  ii think i do but far awa  his imagination was on fire did he hear a distant galloping or did he only make himself hear it he had bent his head and elspeth looking affrighted into his face whispered i hear it too oh tommy so do i  and the painted lady had heard it she kissed her hand toward the den several times and each time tommy seemed to hear that distant galloping all the sweetness had returned to her face now and with it a surging joy and she rocked her arms exultantly but quickly controlled them lest grizel should see for evidently grizel must be cheated and so the painted lady became very sly she slipped off her shoes to be able to make her preparations noiselessly and though at all other times her face expressed the rapture of love when she glanced at her child it was suspiciously and with a gleam of hatred her preparations were for going out she was long at the famous mirror and when she left it her hair was elaborately dressed and her face so transformed that first tommy exclaimed bonny and then corrected himself with a scornful paint on her feet she put a foolish little pair of red shoes on her head a hat too gay with flowers and across her shoulders a flimsy white shawl at which the night air of thrums would laugh her every movement was light and cautious and accompanied by sideglances at grizel who occasionally looked at her when the painted lady immediately pretended to be tending her plants again she spoke to grizel sweetly to deceive her and shot baleful glances at her next moment tommy saw that grizel had taken up her doll once more and was squeezing it to her breast she knew very well what was going on behind her back  suddenly tommy took to his heels elspeth after him he had seen the painted lady coming on her tiptoes to the window they saw the window open and a figure in a white shawl creep out of it as she had doubtless escaped long ago by another window when the door was barred they lost sight of her at once  what will grizel do now tommy whispered and he would have returned to his watching place but elspeth pointed to the window grizel was there closing it and next moment the lamp was extinguished they heard a key turn in the lock and presently grizel carrying warm wraps passed very near them and proceeded along the double dykes not anxious apparently to keep her mother in view but slowly as if she knew where to find her she went into the den where tommy dared not follow her but he listened at the stile and in the awful silence he fancied he heard the neighing of a horse  the next time he met grizel he was yearning to ask her how she spent that night but he knew she would not answer it would be a long time before she gave him her confidence again he offered her his piece of cold iron however and explained why he carried it whereupon she flung it across the road crying you horrid boy do you think i am frightened at my mamma but when he was out of sight she came back and slipped the cold iron into her pocket     chapter xvii  in which tommy solves the woman problem   pity made elspeth want to like the painted ladys child now but her own rules of life were all from a book never opened by grizel who made her religion for herself and thought god a swear she also despised elspeth for being so dependent on tommy and elspeth knew it the two great subjects being barred thus it was not likely that either girl despite some attempts on elspeths part should find out the best that was in the other without which friendship has no meaning and they would have gone different ways had not tommy given an arm to each he indeed had as little in common with grizel for most conspicuous of his traits was the faculty of stepping into other peoples shoes and remaining there until he became someone else his individuality consisted in having none while she could only be herself and was without tolerance for those who were different he had at no time in his life the least desire to make other persons like himself but if they were not like grizel she rocked her arms and cried why why why which is the mark of the womanly woman but his tendency to be anyone he was interested in implied enormous sympathy for the time being and though grizel spurned his overtures this only fired his pride of conquest we can all get whatever we want if we are quite determined to have it though it be a kings daughter and in the end tommy vanquished grizel how by offering to let her come into aarons house and wash it and dust it and cam it just as if you were our mother an invitation she could not resist to you this may seem an easy way but consider the penetration he showed in thinking of it it came to him one day when he saw her lift the smiths baby out of the gutter and hug it with a passionate delight in babies  shes so awid to do it he said basely to elspeth that we needna let on how much we want it done and he also mentioned her eagerness to aaron as a reason why she should be allowed to do it for nothing  for aaron to hold out against her admittance would have been to defraud himself for she transformed his house when she saw the brass lining of the jellypan discolored and that the stockings hanging from the string beneath the mantelpiece had given way where the wearers were hardest on them when she found dripping adhering to a cold fryingpan instead of in a pig and the pitcher leaking and the carrotgrater stoppedwhen these and similar discoveries were made by grizel was it a squeal of horror she gave that such things should be or a cry of rapture because to her had fallen the task of setting them right  she just made a jump for the besom was tommys graphic description of how it all began  you should have seen grizel on the hoddytable knocking nails into the wall the hoddytable is so called because it goes beneath the larger one at night like a chicken under its mother and grizel with the nails in her mouth used them up so quickly that you would have sworn she swallowed half of them yet she rocked her arms because she could not be at all four walls at once she rushed about the room until she was dizzy and tommy knew the moment to cry grip her shell tumble when he and elspeth seized her and put her on a stool  it is on the hoddytable that you bake and iron theres not a bakingboard in the house elspeth explained there is cried grizel there and then converting a drawer into one  between her big bannocks she made baby ones for no better reason than that she was so fond of babies and she kissed the baby ones and said oh the loves they are just sweet and she felt for them when tommy took a bite she could go so quickly between the board and the girdle that she was always at one end of the course or the other but never gave you time to say at which end and on the limited space round the fire she could balance such a number of bannocks that they were as much a wonder as the lords prayer written on a sixpence such a vigilant eye she kept on them too that they dared not fall yet she had never been taught to bake a goodnatured neighbor had now and again allowed her to look on  then her ironing even aaron opened his mouth on this subject blinder being his confidant i thought there was a smell o burning he said and so i went butt the house but man as soon as my een lighted on her i minded of my mother at the same job the crittur was so busy with her work that she looked as if though the last trumpet had blawn she would just have cried i canna come till my ironings done ay i went ben without a word  but best of all was to see grizel redding up on a saturday afternoon where were tommy and elspeth then they were shut up in the coffinbed to be out of the way and could scarce have told whether they fled thither or were wrapped into it by her energetic arms even aaron dared not cross the floor until it was sanded i believe he said trying to jest you would like to shut me up in the bed too i should just love it she cried eagerly will you go it is an inferior woman who has a sense of humor when there is a besom in her hand  thus began great days to grizel sweet she called them for she had many of her mothers words and a pretty way of emphasizing them with her plain face that turned them all into superlatives but though tommy and elspeth were her friends now her mouth shut obstinately the moment they mentioned the painted lady she regretted ever having given tommy her confidence on that subject and was determined not to do so again he did not dare tell her that he had once been at the east window of her home but often he and elspeth spoke to each other of that adventure and sometimes they woke in their garret bed thinking they heard the horseman galloping by then they crept closer to each other and wondered whether grizel was cosey in her bed or stalking an eerie figure in the den  aaron said little but he was drawn to the girl who had not the selfconsciousness of tommy and elspeth in his presence and sometimes he slipped a penny into her hand the pennies were not spent they were hoarded for the fair or muckle friday or muckley great day of the year in thrums if you would know how tommy was making ready for this mighty festival listen  one of his sources of income was the mentor a famous london weekly paper which seemed to visitors to be taken in by every person of position in thrums it was to be seen not only in parlors but on the armchair at the jute bank in the gaugers gig in the spittal factors dogcart on a shoemakers form protruding from dr mcqueens tail pocket and from mr duthies oxter pocket on cathros schooldesk in the rev mr disharts study in half a dozen farms miss ailie compelled her little servant gavinia to read the mentor and stood over her while she did it the phrase this weeks meant this weeks mentor yet the secret must be told only one copy of the paper came to thrums weekly it was subscribed for by the whole reading public between them and by miss ailies influence tommy had become the boy who carried it from house to house  this brought him a penny a week but so heavy were his incidental expenses that he could have saved little for the muckley had not another organization given him a better chance it was a society newly started for helping the deserving poor they had to subscribe not less than a penny weekly to it and at the end of the year each subscriber was to be given fuel etc to the value of double what he or she had put in the three ps was a nickname given to the society by dr mcqueen because it claimed to distribute peats and potatoes with propriety but he was one of its heartiest supporters nevertheless the history of this society in the first months of its existence not only shows how tommy became a moneyed man but gives a glimpse into the character of those it benefited  miss ailie was treasurer and the pennies were to be brought to her on monday evenings between the hours of seven and eight the first monday evening found her ready in the schoolroom in her hand the famous pencil that wrote red with the one end and blue with the other by her side her assistant mr t sandys a pen balanced on his ear for a whole hour did they wait but though many of the worthiest poor had been enrolled as members the few who appeared with their pennies were notoriously riffraff at eight miss ailie disconsolately sent tommy home but he was back in five minutes  theres a mask of them he told her excitedly hanging about but feared to come in because the others would see them theyre ashamed to have it kent that they belong to a charity society and meggy robbie is wandering round the dovecot wi her penny wrapped in a paper and watty rattray and ronnyon is walking up and down the brae pretending they dinna ken one another and auld connachers jeanie ann says she has been four times round the town waiting for kitty elshioner to go away and theres a oneleggit man hodding in the ditch and tibbie birse is out wi a lantern counting them  miss ailie did not know what to do heres jeanie anns penny tommy continued opening his hand and this is three bawbees frae kitty elshioner and you and me is no to tell a soul theyve joined  a furtive tapping was heard at the door it was ronnyon who had skulked forward with twopence but gavinia answered his knock so he just said ay gavinia its yoursel well ill be stepping and would have retired had not miss ailie caught him even then he said three bawbees is to you to lay by and one bawbee to gavinia no to tell  to next monday evening miss ailie now looked with apprehension but tommy lay awake that night until to use a favorite crow of his he found a way he borrowed the schoolmistresss blueandred pencil and sought the houses of the sensitive poor with the following effect one sample will suffice take him at the door of meggy robbie in the west muir which he flung open with the effrontery of a taxcollector  youre a three p he said with a wave of his pencil  im no sic thing cried the old lady  it winna do woman tommy said sternly miss ailie telled me you paid in your first penny on the chap of ten he wetted the pencil on his tongue to show that it was vain to trifle with him and meggy bowed her head  itll be through the town that ive joined she moaned but tommy explained that he was there to save her  im willing to come to your house he said and collect the money every week and not a soul will i tell except the committee  kitty elshioner would see you coming said meggy  no no ill creep yont the hedge and climb the henhouse  but it would be a found out at any rate she remembered when i go for the peats and things at hogmanay  it needna be eagerly replied tommy ill bring them to you in a barrow in the dead o night  could you she cried passionately and he promised he would and it may be mentioned here that he did  and what for yoursel she inquired  a bawbee he said the night afore the muckley  the bargain was made but before he could get away tell me laddie said meggy coaxingly has kitty elshioner joined they were all as curious to know who had joined as they were anxious to keep their own membership a secret but tommy betrayed none at least none who agreed to his proposal there were so many of these that on the night before the muckley he had thirteen pence  and you was doing good all the time you was making the thirteen pence elspeth said fondly i believe that was the reason you did it  i believe it was tommy exclaimed he had not thought of this before but it was easy to him to believe anything     chapter xviii  the muckley   every child in thrums went to bed on the night before the muckley hugging a pirly or as the vulgar say a moneybox and all the pirlies were ready for tomorrow that is to say the mouths of them had been widened with gully knives by owners now so skilful at the jerk which sends their contents to the floor that pirlies they were no longer disgorge was the universal cry or in the vernacular out you come you sweer deevils  not a coin but had its history not a boy who was unable to pick out his own among a hundred the black one came from the sosh the bent lad he got for carrying in ronnyons sticks oh michty me sure as death he had nearly forgotten the one with the warts on it which to spend first the goldy one na faags it was ower ill to come by the scartit one no no it was a lucky well then the one found in the rats hole that was a day ay dagont ay well make the first blatter with it  it was tommys first muckley and the report that he had thirteen pence brought him many advisers about its best investment even corp shiach five pence suspended hostilities for this purpose mind this he said solemnly theres none o the candies as sucks so long as californys teuch and tasty other kinds may be sweeter but teuch and tasty lasts the longest and what a grip it has it pulls out your teeth corp seemed to think that this was a recommendation  im nane sure o teuch and tasty birkie said if you dinna keep a watch on it it slips ower when youre swallowing your spittle  then you should tie a string to it suggested tommy who was thought more of from that hour  beware of pickpockets had it not been for placards with this glorious announcement it is the states first printed acknowledgment that boys and girls form part of the body politic you might have thought that the night before the muckley was absurdly like other nights not a show had arrived not a strange dog no romantic figures were wandering the streets in search of lodgings no stands had sprung up in the square you could pass hours in pretending to fear that when the morning came there would be no fairyland and all the time you knew  about ten oclock ballingalls cat was observed washing its face a deliberate attempt to bring on rain it was immediately put to death  tommy and elspeth had agreed to lie awake all night if tommy nipped elspeth elspeth would nip tommy other children had made the same arrangement though the experienced ones were aware that it would fail if it was true that all the witches were dead then the streets of stands and shows and gamingtables and shootinggalleries were erected by human hands and it followed that were you to listen through the night you must hear the hammers but always in the watches the god of the muckley came unseen and glued your eyes as if with teuch and tasty and while you sleptup you woke with a start what was it you were to mind as soon as you woke listen thats a drum beating its the muckley they are all here it has begun oh michty michty michty whaurs my breeks  when tommy with elspeth and grizel set off excitedly for the town the country folk were already swarming in the monypenny road was thick with them braw loons in blue bonnets with red bobs to them tartan waistcoats scarves of every color woollen shirts as gay and the strutting wearers in two mindswhether to take off the scarf to display the shirt or hide the shirt and trust to the scarf came lassies too in wincey bodices they were like to burst through and they were listening apprehensively as they ploughed onward for a tearing at the seams there were redheaded lasses yellowchyheaded and blackheaded blueshawled and redshawled lasses boots on every one of them stockings almost as common the skirt kilted up for the present but down it should go when they were in the thick of things and then it must take care of itself all were solemn and sheepish as yet but wait a bit  the firstknown face our three met was corp he was only able to sign to them because californys specialty had already done its work and glued his teeth together he was off to the smithy to be melted but gave them to understand that though awkward it was glorious then came birkie who had sewn up the mouths of his pockets all but a small slit in each as a precaution against pickpockets and was now at his own request being held upside down by the haggertytaggertys on the chance that a halfpenny which had disappeared mysteriously might fall out a more tragic figure was francie crabb one and seven pence who like a mad mad thing had taken all his money to the fair at once in ten minutes he had bought fourteen musical instruments  tommy and party had not yet reached the celebrated corner of the west town end where the stands began but they were near it and he stopped to give grizel and elspeth his final instructions 1 keep your money in your purse and your purse in your hand and your hand in your pocket 2 if you lose me ill give shovels whistle and syne you maun squeeze and birse your way back to me  now then are you ready bang they were in it strike up ye fiddlers drums break tooters fifers at it for your lives trumpets blow bagpipes skirl musicboxes all together nowtommy has arrived  even before he had seen thrums except with his mothers eye tommy knew that the wise begin the muckley by measuring its extent that the square and adjoining wynds would be crammed was a law of nature but boyhood drew imaginary lines across the roods the west town end the east town end and the brae and if the stands did not reach these there had been retrogression tommy found all well in two quarters got a nasty shock on the brae but medicine for it in the roods on the whole yelled a hundred children by way of greeting to each other a better muckley than ever  from those who loved them best the more notable muckleys got distinctive names for convenience of reference as shall be ostentatiously shown in its place there was a muckley called and by corp shiach too after tommy but this his first was dubbed sewsters muckley in honor of a seamstress who hanged herself that day in the threecornered wood poor little sewster she had known joyous muckleys too but now she was up in the threecornered wood hanging herself aged nineteen i know nothing more of her except that in her maiden days when she left the house her mother always came to the door to look proudly after her  how to describe the scene when owing to the throng a boy could only peer at it between legs or through the crook of a womans arm shovel would have run up ploughmen to get his birdseye view and he could have told tommy what he saw and tommy could have made a picture of it in his mind every figure ten feet high but perhaps to be lost in it was best you had but to dive and come up anywhere to find something amazing you fell over a box of jumpingjacks into a new world  everyone to his taste if you want tommys sentiments here they are condensed the shows surpass everything else on earth four streets of them in the square the best is the menagerie because there is the loudest roaring there kick the caravans and you increase the roaring admission however prohibitive threepence more economical to stand outside the show of the mountain maid and the shepherds bride and watch the merriman saying funny things to the monkey take care you dont get in front of the steps else you will be pressed up by those behind and have to pay before you have decided that you want to go in when you fling pennies at the mountain maid and the shepherds bride they stop playacting and scramble for them go in at night when there are drunk ploughmen to fling pennies the fat wife with the golden locks lets you put your fingers in her arms but that is soon over the slavedriver and his victims not worth the money they are not blooding to jerusalem and back in a jiffy this is a swindle you just keek through holes  but elspeth was of a different mind she liked to jerusalem and back best and gave the slavedriver and his victims a penny to be christians the only show she disliked was the waxwork where was performed the tragedy of tiffano and the haughty princess tiffano loved the woodmans daughter and so he would not have the haughty princess and so she got a magician to turn him into a pumpkin and then she ate him what distressed elspeth was that tiffano could never get to heaven now and all the consolation tommy doing his best could give her was he could go no doubt he could go but he would have to take the haughty princess wi him and he would be sweer to do that  grizel reflected if i had a whip like the one the slavedriver has shouldnt i lash the boys who hoot my mamma i wish i could turn boys into pumpkins the mountain maid wore a beautiful muslin with gold lace but she does not wash her neck  lastly let corp have his say i looked at the outside of the shows but always landed back at californys stand sucking is better nor near anything the teuch and tasty is stickier than ever i have lost twa teeth the mountain maid is biding all night at tibbie birses and i went in to see her she had a bervie and a boiled egg to her tea she likes her eggs saft wi a lick of butter in them the fat wife is the one i like best shes biding wi shilpit kaytherine on the tanage brae she weighs jeems and kaytherine and the sma black swine she had an ingin to her tea the slavedrivers a fushinless body one o the victims gives him his licks they a bide in the caravan you can stand on the wheel and keek in they had herrings wi the rans to their tea i cut a hole in jerusalem and back and there was no jerusalem there the man as ocht jerusalem greets because the fair circassian winna take him he is biding a night wi blinder he likes a dram in his tea  elspeths money lasted till four oclock for aaron almost the only man in thrums who shunned the revels that day she bought a gingerbread house and the miraculous powder which must be taken on a sixpence was to make blinder see again but unfortunately he forgot about putting it on the sixpence and of course there was something for a certain boy grizel had completed her purchases by five oclock when tommy was still heavy with threepence halfpenny they included a fluffy pink shawl she did not say for whom but the painted lady wore it afterwards and for herself another doll  but that dolls leg is broken tommy pointed out  that was why i bought it she said warmly i feel so sorry for it the darling and she carried it carefully so that the poor thing might suffer as little pain as possible  twice they rushed home for hasty meals and were back so quickly that tommys shadow strained a muscle in turning with him night came on and from a hundred strings stretched along stands and shows there now hung thousands of long tin things like trumpets one burning paper could set a dozen of these ablaze and no sooner were they lit than a wind that had been biding its time rushed in like the merriman making the lamps swing on their strings so that the flaring lights embraced and from a distance thrums seemed to be on fire  even grizel was willing to hold tommys hand now and the three could only move this way and that as the roaring crowd carried them they were not looking at the muckley they were part of it and at last thrums was all tommys fancy had painted it this intoxicated him so that he had to scream at intervals were here elspeth i tell you were here and he became pugnacious and asked youths twice his size whether they denied that he was here and if so would they come on in this frenzy he was seen by miss ailie who had stolen out in a veil to look for gavinia but just as she was about to reprove him dreadful men asked her was she in search of a lad whereupon she fled home and barred the door and later in the evening warned gavinia through the keyhole taking her for a roystering blade that there were policemen in the house to which the astounding reply of gavinia then aged twelve was no sic luck  with the darkness too crept into the muckley certain devils in the color of the night who spoke thickly and rolled braw lads in the mire and egged on friends to fight and cast lewd thoughts into the minds of the women at first the men had been bashful swains to the womens gie me my faring jock they had replied wait jean till im feed but by night most had got their arles with a dram above it and he who could only guffaw at jean a few hours ago had her round the waist now and still an arm free for rough play with other kimmers the jeans were as boisterous as the jocks giving them leer for leer running from them with a giggle waiting to be caught and rudely kissed grand patient longsuffering fellows these men were up at five summer and winter foddering their horses maybe hours before there would be food for themselves miserably paid housed like cattle and when the rheumatism seized them liable to be flung aside like a broken graip as hard was the life of the women coarse food chaff beds damp clothes their portion their sweethearts in the service of masters who were reluctant to fee a married man is it to be wondered that these lads who could be faithful unto death drank soddenly on their one free day that these girls starved of opportunities for womanliness of which they could make as much as the finest lady sometimes woke after a muckley to wish that they might wake no more our three brushed shoulders with the devils that had been let loose but hardly saw them they heard them but did not understand their tongue the eightoclock bell had rung long since and though the racket was as great as ever it was only because every reveller left now made the noise of two mothers were out fishing for their bairns the haggertytaggertys had straggled home hoarse as crows every one of them went to bed that night with a stocking round his throat of monypenny boys tommy could find none in the square but corp who with another tooth missing had been going about since six oclock with his pockets hanging out as a sign that all was over an awkward silence had fallen on the trio the reason that tommy had only threepence left and the smallest of them cost threepence the reference of course is to the wondrous goldpaper packets of sweets not unlike crackers in appearance which are only seen at the muckley and are what every girl claims of her lad or lads now tommy had vowed to elspethbut he had also said to grizelin short how could he buy for both with threepence  grizel as the stranger ought to getbut he knew elspeth too well to believe that she would dry her eyes with that  elspeth being his sisterbut he had promised grizel and she had been so ill brought up that she said nasty things when you broke your word  the gold packet was bought that is it sticking out of tommys inside pocket the girls saw it and knew what was troubling him but not a word was spoken now between the three they set off for home selfconsciously tommy the least agitated on the whole because he need not make up his mind for another ten minutes but he wished grizel would not look at him sideways and then rock her arms in irritation they passed many merrymakers homeward bound many of them following a tortuous course for the scottish toper gives way first in the legs the southron in the other extremity and thus between them could be constructed a man wholly sober and another as drunk as chloe but though the highway clattered with many feet not a soul was in the double dykes and at the easy end of that formidable path grizel came to a determined stop  goodnight she said with such a disdainful glance at tommy  he had not made up his mind yet but he saw that it must be done now and to take a decisive step was always agony to him though once taken it ceased to trouble to dodge it for another moment he said weakly letslets sit down a whiley on the dyke  but grizel while coveting the packet because she had never got a present in her life would not shillyshally  are you to give it to elspeth she asked with the horrid directness that is so trying to an intellect like tommys  nno he said  to grizel cried elspeth  nno he said again  it was an undignified moment for a great boy but the providence that watched over tommy until it tired of him came to his aid in the nick of time it took the form of the painted lady who appeared suddenly out of the gloom of the double dykes two of the children jumped and the third clenched her little fists to defend her mamma if tommy cast a word at her but he did not his mouth remained foolishly open the painted lady had been talking cheerfully to herself but she drew back apprehensively with a look of appeal on her face and thenand then tommy saw a way he handed her the gold packet its to you he said itsits your muckley  for a moment she was afraid to take it but when she knew that this sweet boys gift was genuine she fondled it and was greatly flattered and dropped him the quaintest courtesy and then looked defiantly at grizel but grizel did not take it from her instead she flung her arms impulsively round tommys neck she was so glad glad glad  as tommy and elspeth walked away to their home elspeth could hear him breathing heavily and occasionally he gave her a furtive glance  grizel needna have done that she said sharply  no replied tommy  but it was noble of you she continued squeezing his hand to give it to the painted lady did you mean to give it to her a the time  oh elspeth  but did you  oh elspeth  thats no you greeting is it she asked softly  im near the greeting he said truthfully but im no sure what about his sympathy was so easily aroused that he sometimes cried without exactly knowing why  its because youre so good elspeth told him but presently she said with a complete change of voice no grizel needna have done that  it was a shameful thing to do tommy agreed shaking his head but she did it he added triumphantly you saw her do it elspeth  but you didna like it elspeth asked in terror  no of course i didna like it but  but what tommy  but i liked her to like it he admitted and by and by he began to laugh hysterically im no sure what im laughing at he said but i think its at mysel he may have laughed at himself before but this muckley is memorable as the occasion on which he first caught himself doing it the joke grew with the years until sometimes he laughed in his most emotional moments suddenly seeing himself in his true light but it had become a bitter laugh by that time     chapter xix  corp is brought to heelgrizel defiant   corp shiach was a barefooted colt of a boy of ungainly build with a nose so thick and turned up that it was a certificate of character and his hands were covered with warts which he had a trick of biting till they bled then he rubbed them on his trousers which were the picturesque part of him for he was at present serving to the masons he had earned his keep since long before he could remember and so wore the white or yellow ducks which the dust of the quarry stains a rarer orange color than is known elsewhere the orange of the masons trousers the blue of the hearthstones these are the most beautiful colors to be seen in thrums though of course corp was unaware of it he was really very goodnatured and only used his fists freely because of imagination he had none and thinking made him sweat and consequently the simplest way of proving his case was to say ill fight you what might have been the issue of a conflict between him and shovel was a problem for tommy to puzzle over shovel was as quick as corp was deliberate and would have danced round him putting in unexpected ones but if he had remained just one moment too long within corps reach  they nicknamed him corp because he took fits when he lay like one dead he was proud of his fits was corp but they were a bother to him too because he could make so little of them they interested doctors and other carriage folk who came to his aunts house to put their fingers into him and gave him sixpence and would have given him more but when they pressed him to tell them what he remembered about his fits he could only answer dejectedly not a damned thing  you might as well no have them ava his wrathful aunt with whom he lived would say and she thrashed him until his size forbade it  soon after the muckley came word that the lady of the spittal was to be brought to see corp by mr ogilvy the schoolmaster of glen quharity and at first corp boasted of it but as the appointed day drew near he became uneasy  the worst ot he said to anyone who would listen is that my auntie is to be away frae hame and so theyll put a their questions to me  the haggertytaggertys and birkie were so jealous that they said they were glad they never had fits but tommy made no such pretence  oh corp if i had thae fits of yours he exclaimed greedily  if they were mine to give awa replied corp sullenly you could have them and welcome grown meek in his trouble he invited tommy to speak freely with the result that his eyes were partially opened to the superiority of that boys attainments tommy told him a number of interesting things to say to mr ogilvy and the lady about his fits about how queer he felt just before they came on and the visions he had while he was lying stiff but though the admiring corp gave attentive ear he said hopelessly next day not a dagont thing do i mind when they question me about my fits ill just say im sometimes in them and sometimes out o them and if they badger me more i can aye kick  tommy gave him a look that meant fits are just wasted on you and corp replied with another that meant i ken they are then they parted one of them to reflect  corp he said excitedly when next they met has mr ogilvy or the lady ever come to see you afore  they had not and corp was able to swear that they did not even know him by sight  they dinna ken me either said tommy  what does that matter asked corp but tommy was too full to speak he had found a way  the lady and mr ogilvy found corp such a success that the one gave him a shilling and the other took down his reminiscences in a notebook but if you would hear of the rings of blue and white and yellow corp saw and of the other extraordinary experiences he described himself as having when in a fit you need not search that notebook for the page has been torn out instead of making inquiries of mr ogilvy try any other dominie in the district mr cathro for instance who delighted to tell the tale this of course was when it leaked out that tommy had personated corp by arrangement with the real corp who was listening in rapture beneath the bed  tommy who played his part so well that he came out of it in a daze had corp at heel from that hour he told him what a rogue he had been in london and corp cried admiringly oh you deevil oh you queer little deevil and sometimes it was elspeth who was narrator and then tommys noble acts were the subject but still corps comment was oh the deevil oh the queer little deevil elspeth was flattered by his heroworship but his language shocked her and after consulting miss ailie she advised him to count twenty when he felt an oath coming at the end of which exercise the desire to swear would have passed away goodnatured corp willingly promised to try this but he was never hopeful and as he explained to tommy after a failure it just made me waur than ever for when i had counted the twenty i said a big damn thoughtfullike and syne out jumpit three little damns like as if the first ane had cleckit in my mouth  it was fortunate that elspeth liked corp on the whole for during the three years now to be rapidly passed over tommy took delight in his society though he never treated him as an equal corp indeed did not expect that and was humbly grateful for what he got in summer fishing was their great diversion they would set off as early as four in the morning fishing wands in hand and scour the world for trout plodding home in the gloaming with stones in their fishingbasket to deceive those who felt its weight in the long winter nights they liked best to listen to blinders tales of the thrums jacobites tales never put into writing but handed down from father to son and proved true in the oddest of ways as by blinders trick of involuntarily holding out his hands to a fire when he found himself near one though he might be sweating to the shirt and the time a july forenoon i make no doubt he told them as i do that because my forbear buchan osler called buchan wi the haap after the wars was ower had to hod so lang frae the troopers and them so greedy for him that he daredna crawl to a fire once in an eight days  the lord of the spittal and handsome captain body whose being out made all the women anxious marched through the den flapping their wings at the head of a fearsome retinue and the thrums folk looked so glum at them that gay captain body said he should kiss every lass who did not cheer for charlie and none cheered but at the same time none ran away few in thrums cared a doit for charlie but some hung on behind this troop till there was no turning back for them and one of these was buchan he forced his wife to give captain body a white rose from her bush by the door but a thorn in it pricked the gallant and the blood from his fingers fell on the bush and from that year it grew red roses  if you dinna believe me blinder said look if the roses is no red on the bush at pyotdykes which was a split frae buchans and speir whether theyre no named the blood rose  i believe you tommy would say breathlessly go on  captain body was back in the den by and by but he had no thought of preeing lasses mouths now his face was scratched and haggard and his gay coat torn and when he crawled to the cuttle well he caught some of the water in his bonnet and mixed meal with it stirring the precious compound with his finger and using the loof of his hand as a spoon every stick of furniture buchan and the other thrums rebels possessed was seized by the government and rouped in the marketplace of thrums but few would bid against the late owners for whom the things were secretly bought back very cheaply  to these and many similar stories tommy listened openmouthed seeing the scene far more vividly than the narrator who became alarmed at his quick loud breathing and advised him to forget them and go back to his lessons but his lessons never interested tommy and he would go into the den instead and repeat blinders legends with embellishments which made them so real that corp and elspeth and grizel were afraid to look behind them lest the spectre of captain body should be standing there leaning on a ghostly sword  at such times elspeth kept a firm grip of tommys hand but one evening as they all ran panicstricken from some imaginary alarm she lost him near the cuttle well and then as it seemed to her the den became suddenly very dark and lonely at first she thought she had it to herself but as she stole timidly along the pink path she heard voices and she cried tommy joyously but no answer came so it could not be tommy then she thought it must be a pair of lovers but next moment she stood transfixed with fear for it was the painted lady who was coming along the path talking aloud to herself no not to herselfto someone she evidently thought was by her side she called him darling and other sweet names and waited for his replies and nodded pleased assent to them or pouted at them and terrified elspeth knew that she was talking to the man who never came  when she saw elspeth she stopped irresolutely and the two stood looking in fear at each other you are not my brat are you the painted lady asked  nno the child gasped  then why dont you call me nasty names  i dinna never call you names elspeth replied but the woman still looked puzzled  perhaps you are naughty also she said doubtfully and then as if making up her mind that it must be so she came closer and said with a voice full of pity i am so sorry  elspeth did not understand half of it but the pitying voice which was of the rarest sweetness drove away much of her fear and she said do you no mind me i was wi tommy when he gave you the gold packet on muckley night  then the painted lady remembered he took such a fancy to me she said with a pleased simper and then she looked serious again  do you love him she asked and elspeth nodded  but is he all the world to you  yes elspeth said  the painted lady took her by the arm and said impressively dont let him know  but he does know said elspeth  i am so sorry the painted lady said again when they know too well then they have no pity  but i want tommy to know elspeth insisted  that is the woeful thing the painted lady said rocking her arms in a way that reminded the child of grizel we want them to know we cannot help liking them to know  suddenly she became confidential do you think i showed my love too openly she asked eagerly i tried to hide it you know i covered my face with my hands but he pulled them away and then of course he knew  she went on i kissed his horses nose and he said i did that because it was his horse how could he know when i asked him how he knew he kissed me and i pretended to be angry and ran away but i was not angry and i said to myself i am glad i am glad i am glad  i wanted so to be good butit is so difficult to refuse when you love him very much dont you think  the pathos of that was lost on the girl and the painted lady continued sadly it would be so nice would it not if they liked us to be good i think it would be sweet she bent forward and whispered emphatically but they dont you knowit bores them  never bore themand they are so easily bored it bores them if you say you want to be married i think it would be sweet to be married but you should never ask for a wedding they give you everything else but if you say you want a wedding they stamp their feet and go away why are you crying girl you should not cry they dont like it put on your prettiest gown and laugh and pretend you are happy and then they will tell you naughty stories and give you these she felt her ears and looked at her fingers on which there may once have been jewels but there were none now  if you cry you lose your complexion and then they dont love you any more i had always such a beautiful skin some ladies when they lose their complexion paint horrid isnt it i wonder they can do such a thing  she eyed elspeth suspiciously but of course you might do it just a little she said pleadinglyjust to make them go on loving you dont you think  when they dont want to come any more they write you a letter and you run with it to your room and kiss it because you dont know what is inside then you open it and that breaks your heart you know she nodded her head sagaciously and smiled with tears in her eyes never never never open the letter keep it unopened on your breast and then you can always think that he may come tomorrow and if  someone was approaching and she stopped and listened my brat she cried furiously she is always following me and she poured forth a torrent of filthy abuse of grizel in the midst of which tommy for it was he appeared and carried elspeth off hastily this was the only conversation either child ever had with the painted lady and it bore bad fruit for grizel elspeth told some of the monypenny women about it and they thought it their duty to point out to aaron that the painted lady and her child were not desirable acquaintances for tommy and elspeth  i dinna ken he answered sharply whether tommys a fit acquaintance for grizel but im very sure o this that shes more than a fit acquaintance for him and look at what she has done for this house i kenna what we should do if she didna come in nows and nans  you ken well aaron they said that onything we could do in the way o keeping your house in order we should do gladly  thank you he replied ungraciously but i would rather have her  nevertheless he agreed that he ought to forbid any intercourse with the painted lady and unfortunately grizel heard of this probably there never would have been any such intercourse grizel guarded against it more than anyone for reasons she never spoke of but she resented this veto proudly  why must you not speak to my mamma she demanded of tommy and elspeth  becausebecause she is a queer one he said  she is not a queer oneshe is just sweet  he tried to evade the question by saying weakly we never see her to speak to at any rate so it will make no difference its no as if you ever asked us to come to double dykes  but i ask you now said grizel with flashing eyes  oh i darena cried elspeth  then i wont ever come into your house again said grizel decisively  no to redd up asked tommy incredulously no to bake nor to iron you couldna help it  yes i could  think what youll miss  grizel might have retorted think what you will miss but perhaps the reply she did make had a sharper sting in it i shall never come again she said loftily and my reason for not coming is thatthat my mamma thinks your house is not respectable she flung this over her shoulder as she stalked away and it may be that the tears came when there were none to see them but hers was a resolute mind and though she continued to be friendly with tommy and elspeth out of doors she never again crossed their threshold  the house is in a terrible state for want o you tommy would say trying to wheedle her we hinna sanded the floor for months and the boxiron has fallen ahint the dresser and my gray sark is rove up the back and oh you should just see the holes in aarons stockings  then grizel rocked her arms in agony but no she would not go in     chapter xx  the shadow of sir walter   tommy was in miss ailies senior class now though by no means at the top of it and her mind was often disturbed about his future on this subject aaron had never spoken to anyone and the problem gave tommy himself so little trouble that all elspeth knew was that he was to be great and that she was to keep his house so the schoolmistress braved an interview with aaron for the sake of her favorite  you know he is a remarkable boy she said  at his lessons maam asked aaron quietly  not exactly at his lessons she had to admit  in what way then maam  really miss ailie could not say there was something wonderful about tommy you felt it but you could not quite give it a name the warper must have noticed it himself  ive heard him saying something o the kind to elspeth was aarons reply  but sometimes he is like a boy inspired said the schoolmistress you must have seen that  when he was thinking o himsel answered aaron  he has such noble sentiments  he has  and i think i really think said miss ailie eagerly for this was what she had come to say that he has got great gifts for the ministry  im near sure ot said aaron grimly  ah i see you dont like him  i dinna the warper acknowledged quietly but ive been trying to do my duty by him for all that its no every laddie that gets three years schooling straight on end  this was true but miss ailie used it to press her point you have done so well by him she said that i think you should keep him at school for another year or two and so give him a chance of carrying a bursary if he carries one it will support him at college if he does notwell then i suppose he must be apprenticed to some trade  no aaron said decisively if he gets the chance of a college education and flings it awa ill waste no more siller on his keep ill send him straight to the herding  and i shall not blame you miss ailie declared eagerly  though i would a hantle rather continued the warper waur my money on elspeth  what you spend on him miss ailie argued you will really be spending on her for if he rises in the world he will not leave elspeth behind you are prejudiced against him but you cannot deny that  i dinna deny but what hes fond o her said aaron and after considering the matter for some days he decided that tommy should get his chance the schoolmistress had not acted selfishly for this decision as she knew meant that the boy must now be placed in the hands of mr cathro who was a greek and latin scholar she taught latin herself it is true but as cautiously as she crossed a plank bridge and she was never comfortable in the dominies company because even at a teatable he would refer familiarly to the ablative absolute instead of letting sleeping dogs lie  but elspeth couldna be happy if we were at different schools tommy objected instantly  yes i could said elspeth who had been won over by miss ailie it will be so fine tommy to see you again after i hinna seen you for three hours  tommy was little known to mr cathro at this time except as the boy who had got the better of a rival teacher in the affair of corp which had delighted him greatly but if the sacket thinks he can play any of his tricks on me he told aaron there is an awakening before him and he began the cramming of tommy for a bursary with perfect confidence  but before the end of the month at the mere mention of tommys name mr cathro turned red in the face and the fingers of his layingon hand would clutch an imaginary pair of tawse already tommy had made him selfconscious he peered covertly at tommy and tommy caught him at it every time and then each quickly looked another way and cathro vowed never to look again but did it next minute and what enraged him most was that he knew tommy noted his attempts at selfrestraint as well as his covert glances all the other pupils knew that a change for the worse had come over the dominies temper they saw him punish tommy frequently without perceptible cause and that he was still unsatisfied when the punishment was over this apparently was because tommy gave him a look before returning to his seat when they had been walloped they gave cathro a look also but it merely meant oh that this was a dark road and i had a divot in my hand while his look was unreadable that is unreadable to them for the dominie understood it and writhed what it said was you think me a wonder and therefore i forgive you  and sometimes he fair beats cathro so tommys schoolmates reported at home and the dominie had to acknowledge its truth to aaron i wish you would give that sacket a thrashing for me he said half furiously yet with a grin on his face one day when he and the warper chanced to meet on the monypenny road  ill no lay a hand on bairn o jean myles aaron replied ay and i understood you to say that he should meet his match in you  did i ever say that man well well we live and learn  what has he been doing now  what has he been doing echoed cathro he has been making me look foolish in my own classroom yes sir he has so completely got the better of me and not for the first time that when i tell the story of how he diddled mr ogilvy mr ogilvy will be able to cap it with the story of how the little whelp diddled me upon my soul aaron he is running away with all my selfrespect and destroying my sense of humor  what had so crushed the dominie was the affair of francie crabb francie was now a pupil like gavin dishart and tommy of mr cathros who detested the boys golden curls perhaps because he was bald himself they were also an incentive to evildoing on the part of other boys who must give them a tug in passing and on a day the dominie said in a fury give your mother my compliments francie and tell her im so tired of seeing your curls that i mean to cut them off tomorrow morning  say he shall not whispered tommy  you shanna blurted out francie  but i will said cathro i would do it now if i had the shears  it was only an empty threat but an hour afterwards the dominie caught tommy wagering in witchy marbles and other coin that he would not do it and then instead of taking the tawse to him he said keep him to his bargains laddies for whatever may have been my intention at the time i mean to be as good as my word now  he looked triumphantly at tommy who however instead of seeming crestfallen continued to bet and now the other boys were eager to close with him for great was their faith in cathro these transactions were carried out on the sly but the dominie knew what was going on and despite his faith in himself he had his twitches of uneasiness  however the boy can only be trusting to fear of mrs crabb restraining me he decided and he marched into the schoolroom next morning ostentatiously displaying his wifes largest scissors his pupils crowded in after him and though he noticed that all were strangely quiet and many wearing scared faces he put it down to the coming scene he could not resist giving one triumphant glance at tommy who however instead of returning it looked modestly down thenis francie crabb here asked mr cathro firmly  hes hodding ahint the press cried a dozen voices  come forward francie said the dominie clicking the shears to encourage him  there was a long pause and then francie emerged in fear from behind the press yes it was francie but his curls were gone  the shears fell to the floor who did this roared the terrible cathro  it was tommy sandys blurted out francis in tears  the schoolmaster was unable to speak and alarmed at the stillness francie whined he said it would be done at ony rate and he promised me half his winnings  it is still remembered by bearded men and married women who were at school that day how cathro leaped three forms to get at tommy and how tommy cried under the tawse and yet laughed ecstatically at the same time and how subsequently he and francie collected so many dues that the pockets of them stood out like brackets from their little persons  the dominie could not help grinning a little at his own discomfiture as he told this story but aaron saw nothing amusing in it as i telled you he repeated i winna touch him so if youre no content wi what youve done yoursel you had better put francies mither on him  i hear she has taken him in hand already mr cathro replied dryly but aaron i wish you would at least keep him closer to his lessons at night for it is seldom he comes to the school well prepared  i see him sitting lang ower his books said aaron  ay maybe but is he at them responded the dominie with a shake of the head that made aaron say with his first show of interest in the conversation you have little faith in his carrying a bursary i see  but this mr cathro would not admit for if he thought tommy a numskull the one day he often saw cause to change his mind the next so he answered guardedly its too soon to say aaron for he has eighteen months stuffing to undergo yet before we send him to aberdeen to try his fortune and i have filled some gey toom wimes in eighteen months but you must lend me a hand  the weaver considered and then replied stubbornly no i give him his chance but ill have nocht to do wi his use ot and dominie i want you to say not another word to me about him atween this and examination time for my minds made up no to say a word to him its well kent that im no more fit to bring up bairns than to have them dinna conter me man for the thing was proved lang syne at the cuttle well and so till that time ill let him gang his ain gait but if he doesna carry a bursary to the herding he goes ive said it and ill stick to it  so as far as aaron was concerned tommy was left in peace to the glory of collecting his winnings from those who had sworn by cathro and among them was master gavin ogilvy dishart who now found himself surrounded by a debt of sixpence a degrading position for the son of an auld licht minister  tommy would not give him time but was willing to take his copy of waverley as full payment  gavin offered him ivanhoe instead because his mother had given a read of waverley to gavinia miss ailies servant and she read so slowly putting her finger beneath each word that she had not yet reached the middle also she was so enamoured of the work that she would fight anyone who tried to take it from her  tommy refused ivanhoe as it was not about jacobites but suggested that gavinia should be offered it in lieu of waverley and told that it was a better story  the suggestion came too late as gavinia had already had a loan of ivanhoe and read it with rapture inch by inch however if tommy would wait a month or  tommy was so eager to read more about the jacobites that he found it trying to wait five minutes he thought gavins duty was to get his father to compel gavinia to give the book up  was tommy daft mr dishart did not know that his son possessed these books he did not approve of story books and when mrs dishart gave them to gavin on his birthday sheshe had told him to keep them out of his fathers sight mr and mrs dishart were very fond of each other but there were certain little matters that she thought it unnecessary to trouble him about  so if tommy was to get waverley at once he must discover another way he reflected and then set off to miss ailies to whom he still read sober works of an evening but novels never looking as if he had found a way  for some time miss ailie had been anxious about her redarmed maid who had never before given pain unless by excess of willingness as when she offered her garter to tie miss ailies parcels with of late however gavinia had taken to blurting out disquieting questions to the significance of which she withheld the key such as  is there ony place nowadays maam where theres tourniements and could an ablebodied lassie walk to them and what might be the charge to win in  or would you no like to be so michty beautiful maam that as soon as the men saw your bonny face they just up wi you in their arms and ran  or again whats the heaviest weight o a woman a grand lusty man could carry in his arms as if she were an infant  this method of conveyance seemed to have a peculiar fascination for gavinia and she got herself weighed at the fleshers on another occasion she broke a glass candlestick and all she said to the pieces was wha carries me wears me  this mystery was troubling the schoolmistress sadly when tommy arrived with the key to it im doubting gavinias reading ill books on the sly he said  never exclaimed miss ailie she reads nothing but the mentor  tommy shook his head like one who would fain hope so but could not overlook facts ive been hearing he said that she reads books as are full o strokes and words we have no concern with  miss ailie could not believe it but she was advised to search the kitchen and under gavinias mattress was found the dreadful work  and you are only fifteen said miss ailie eying her little maid sorrowfully  the easier to carry replied gavinia darkly  and you named after a minister miss ailie continued for her maid had been christened gavinia because she was the first child baptized in his church after the rev gavin dishart came to thrums gavinia i must tell him of this i shall take this book to mr dishart this very day  the right man to take it to replied the maid sullenly for its his ain  gavinia  well it was mrs dishart that lended it to me  ii never saw it on the manse shelves  im thinking said the brazen gavinia as theres hoddy corners in manses as well as inblueandwhite rooms  this dark suggestion was as great a shock to the gentle schoolmistress as if out of a clear sky had come suddenly the word  stroke  she tottered with the book that had so demoralized the once meek gavinia into the blueandwhite room where tommy was restlessly awaiting her and when she had told him all he said with downcast eyes  i was never sure o mrs dishart when i hand her the mentor she looks as if she didna care a stroke fort  tommy  im doubting he said sadly that shes ower fond o words we have no concern with  miss ailie would not listen to such talk but she approved of the suggestion that waverley should be returned not to the minister but to his wife and she accepted gratefully tommys kindly offer to act as bearer only happening to open the book in the middle she  im waiting said tommy after ten minutes  she did not hear him  im waiting he said again but she was now in the next chapter  maybe you would like to read it yoursel he cried and then she came to and with a shudder handed him the book but after he had gone she returned to the kitchen to reprove gavinia at greater length and in the midst of the reproof she said faintly you did not happen to look at the end did you  that i did replied gavinia  and did shedid he  no said gavinia sorrowfully  miss ailie sighed thats what i think too said gavinia  why didnt they asked the schoolmistress  because he was just a sumph answered gavinia scornfully if he had been like fergus or like the chield in ivanhoe he wouldna have taen a no he would just have whipped her up in his arms and away wi her thats the kind for me maam  there is a fascination about them murmured miss ailie  a what  but again miss ailie came to for shame gavinia for shame she said severely these are disgraceful sentiments  in the meantime tommy had hurried with the book not to the manse but to a certain garret and as he read his imagination went on fire blinders stories had made him half a jacobite and now waverley revealed to him that he was born neither for the ministry nor the herding but to restore to his country its rightful king the first to whom he confided this was corp who immediately exclaimed michty me but what will the police say  i ken a wy answered tommy sternly     chapter xxi  the last jacobite rising   on the evening of the queens birthday bridies were eaten to her honor in a hundred thrums homes and her health was drunk in toddy scotch toddy and highland toddy patullo the writer gave a mens party and his sole instructions to his maid were keep running back and forrit wi the hot water at the bank there was a ladies party and ginger wine from cathros bedroomwindow a flag was displayed with vivat regina on it the sentiment composed by cathro the words sewn by the girls of his mcculloch class the eightoclock bell rang for an hour and a loyal crowd had gathered in the square to shout to a superficial observer such as the baron bailie or todd the new policeman all seemed well and fair  but a very different scene was being enacted at the same time in the fastnesses of the den where three resolute schemers had met by appointment their trystingplace was the cuttle well which is most easily reached by the pink path made for that purpose but the better to further their dark and sinister design the plotters arrived by three circuitous routes one descending the reekie broth pot a low but dangerous waterfall the second daring the perils of the crags and the third walking stealthily up the burn  is that you tommy  whist do you mind the password  stroke  right have you heard gav dishart coming  i hinna i doubt his father had grippit him as he was slinking out o the manse  i fear it corp im thinking his father is in the womans pay  what woman  the woman of hanover  thats the queen is it no  shell never get me to call her queen  nor yet me i think i hear gav coming  gav dishart was the one who had come by the burn and his boots were cheeping like a field of mice he gave the word stroke and the three then looked at each other firmly the lights of the town were not visible from the cuttle well owing to an arm of cliff that is outstretched between but the bell could be distinctly heard and occasionally a shout of revelry  they little ken said tommy darkly  they hinna a notion said corp but he was looking somewhat perplexed himself  its near time i was back for family exercise said gav uneasily so we had better do it quick tommy  did you bring the wineglasses tommy asked him  no gav said the press was lockit but ive brought eggcups  stand round then  the three boys now presented a picturesque appearance but there was none save the man in the moon to see them they stood round the cuttle well each holding an eggcup and though the daring nature of their undertaking and the romantic surroundings combined to excite them it was not fear but soaring purpose that paled their faces and caused their hands to tremble when tommy said solemnly afore we do what weve come here to do lets swear  stroke he said  stroke said gav  stroke said corp  they then filled their cups and holding them over the well so that they clinked they said  to the king ower the water  to the king ower the water  to the king ower the water  when they had drunk tommy broke his cup against a rock for he was determined that it should never be used to honor a meaner toast and the others followed his example corp briskly though the act puzzled him and gav with a gloomy look because he knew that the cups would be missed tomorrow  is that a now whispered corp wiping his forehead with his sleeve  all cried tommy man weve just begood  as secretly as they had entered it they left the den and anon three figures were standing in a dark trance cynically watching the revellers in the square  if they just kent muttered the smallest who was wearing his jacket outside in to escape observation  but they little ken said gav dishart  they hinna a notion said corp contemptuously but still he was a little puzzled and presently he asked softly lads what just is it that they dinna ken  had gav been ready with an answer he could not have uttered it for just then a terrible little man in black who had been searching for him in likely places seized him by the cuff of the neck and turning his face in an easterly direction ran him to family worship but there was still work to do for the other two walking home alone that night from mr patullos party mr cathro had an uncomfortable feeling that he was being dogged when he stopped to listen all was at once still but the moment he moved onward he again heard stealthy steps behind he retired to rest as soon as he reached his house to be wakened presently by a slight noise at the window whence the flagpost protruded it had been but a gust of wind he decided and turned round to go to sleep again when crash the post was plucked from its place and cast to the ground the dominie sprang out of bed and while feeling for a light thought he heard scurrying feet but when he looked out at the window no one was to be seen vivat regina lay ignobly in the gutters that it could have been the object of an intended theft was not probable but the open window might have tempted thieves and there was a possible though risky way up by the spout the affair was a good deal talked about at the time but it remained shrouded in a mystery which even we have been unable to penetrate  on the heels of the queens birthday came the muckley the one that was to be known to fame if fame was willing to listen to corp as tommys muckley unless he had some grand aim in view never was a boy who yielded to temptations more blithely than tommy but when he had such aim never was a boy so firm in withstanding them at this muckley he had a mighty reason for not spending money and with ninepence in his pocket clamoring to be out he spent not one halfpenny there was something uncanny in the sight of him stalking unscathed between rows of stands and shows everyone of them aiming at his pockets corp and gav of course were in the secret and did their humble best to act in the same unnatural manner but now and again a show made a successful snap at gav and corp had gloomy fears that he would lose his head in presence of the teuch and tasty from which humiliation indeed he was only saved by the happy idea of requesting tommy to shout deuteronomy in a warning voice every time they drew nigh californys seductive stand  was there nothing for sale then that the three thirsted to buy there were many things among them weapons of war a pack of cards more properly called devils books blue bonnets suitable for highland gentlemen feathers for the bonnets a tin lantern yards of tartan cloth which the deft fingers of grizel would convert into warriors sashes corp knew that these purchases were in tommys farseeing eye but he thought the only way to get them was to ask the price and then offer half gav the scholar who had already reached daylight through the first three books of euclid and took a walk every saturday morning with his father and herodotus even gav the scholar was as thickwitted as corp  well let other laddies buy them tommy explained in his superior way and then after the muckley is past well buy them frae them  the others understood now after a muckley there was always a great dearth of pence and a moneyed man could become owner of muckley purchases at a sixth part of the muckley price  you crittur exclaimed corp in abject admiration  but gav saw an objection the feck of them he pointed out will waur their siller on shows and things to eat instead of on what we want them to buy  so they will the nasty sackets cried corp  you couldna blame a laddie for buying teuch and tasty continued gav with triumph for he was a little jealous of tommy  you couldna agreed corp no ill be dagont if you could and his hand pressed his money feverishly  deuteronomy roared tommy and corps hand jumped as if it had been caught in some other persons pocket  but how are we to do he asked if you like ill take birkie and the haggertytaggertys round the muckley and fight ilka ane that doesna buy  corp said tommy calmly i wonder at you do you no ken yet that the best plan is to leave a thing to me  blethering gowks that we are of course it is cried corp and he turned almost fiercely upon gav lippen all to him he said with grand confidence hell find a wy  and tommy found a way birkie was the boy who bought the pack of cards he saw tommy looking sowoebegone that it was necessary to ask the reason  oh birkie lend me threepence sobbed tommy and ill give you sixpence the morn  youre daft said birkie theres no a laddie in thrums that will have one single lonely bawbee the morn  him that buys the cards moaned tommy will never be without siller for you tell auld folks fortunes on them at a penny every throw lend me threepence birkie they cost a sic and i have just  na na said greedy birkie im no to be catched wi chaff if its true what you say ill buy the cards mysel  having thus got hold of him tommy led birkie to a stand where the king of egypt was telling fortunes with cards and doing a roaring trade among the jocks and jennys he also sold packs at sixpence each and the elated birkie was an immediate purchaser  youre no so clever as you think yoursel he said triumphantly to tommy who replied with his inscrutable smile but to his satellites he said not a soul will buy a fortune frae birkie ill get thae cards for a penny afore next weeks out  francie crabb found tommy sniggering to himself in the back wynd what are you goucking at asked francie in surprise for as a rule tommy only laughed behind his face  i winna tell you chuckled tommy but what a bar oh what a divert  come on tell me  well its at the man as is swallowing swords ahint the menagerie  i see nothing to laugh at in that  im no laughing at that im laughing at him for selling the swords for ninepence the piece oh what ignorant he is oh what a bar  ninepence is a mislaird price for a soord said francie i never gave ninepence  tommy looked at him in the way that always made boys fidget with their fists  youre near as big a bar as him he said scornfully did you ever see the sword thats hanging on the wall in the backroom at the postoffice  no but my father has telled me about it it has a grand name  its an andrea ferrara thats what it is  ay i mind the name now there has been folk killed wi that soord  this was true for the postoffice andrea ferrara has a stirring history but for the present its price was the important thing dr mcqueen offered a pound note for it said tommy  i ken that but what has it to do wi the soordswallower  just this that the swords he is selling for ninepence are andrea ferraras the same as the postoffice ones and he could get a pound a piece for them if he kent their worth oh what a bar oh what  francies eyes lit up greedily and he looked at his two silver shillings and took two steps in the direction of the swordswallowers and faltered and could not make up his agitated mind tommy set off toward the square at a brisk walk  whaur are you off to asked francie following him  to tell the man what his swords is worth it would be ill done no to tell him to clinch the matter off went tommy at a run and off went francie after him as a rule tommy was the swifter but on this occasion he lagged of fell purpose and reached the swordswallowers tent just in time to see francie emerge elated therefrom carrying two andrea ferraras francie grinned when they met  what a bar he crowed  what a bar agreed tommy and sufficient has now been told to show that he had found a way even gav acknowledged a master and when the accoutrements of war were bought at second hand as cheaply as tommy had predicted applauded him with eyes and mouth for a full week after which he saw things in a new light gav of course was to enter the bursary lists anon and he had supposed that cathro would have the last years schooling of him but no his father decided to send him for the grand final grind to mr ogilvy of glen quharity a famous dominie between whom and mr dishart existed a friendship that none had ever got at the root of mr cathro was more annoyed than he cared to show gav being of all the boys of that time the one likeliest to do his teacher honor at the university competitions but tommy though the decision cost him an adherent was not illpleased for he had discovered that gav was one of those irritating boys who like to be leader gav as has been said suddenly saw tommys victory over messrs birkie francie etc in a new light this was because when he wanted back the shilling which he had contributed to the funds for buying their purchases tommy replied firmly  i canna give you the shilling but ill give you the lantern and the tartan cloth we bought wi it  what use could they be to me at glen quharity gav protested  oh if they are no use to you tommy said sweetly me and corp is willing to buy them off you for threepence  then gav became a scorner of duplicity but he had to consent to the bargain and again corp said to tommy oh you crittur but he was sorry to lose a fellowconspirator theres just the twa o us now he sighed  just twa cried tommy what are you havering about man theres as many as i like to whistle for  you mean grizel and elspeth i ken but  i wasna thinking of the womenfolk tommy told him with a contemptuous wave of the hand he went closer to corp and said in a low voice the mckenzies are waiting  are they though said corp perplexed as he had no notion who the mckenzies might be  and lochiel has twa hunder spearsmen  do you say so  young kinnordys ettling to come out and i meet lord airlie when the moon rises at the loups o kenny and auld bradwardines as spunky as ever and theres fifty wild highlandmen lying ready in the muckle cave of clova  he spoke so earnestly that corp could only ejaculate michty me  but of course they winna rise continued tommy darkly till he lands  of course no said corp butwha is he  himsel whispered tommy the chevalier  corp hesitated but i thought he said diffidently i thought you  so i am said tommy  but you said he hadna landed yet  neither he has  but you  well  youre here are you no  tommy stamped his foot in irritation youre slow in the uptak he said im no here how can i be here when im at st germains  dinna be angry wi me corp begged i ken youre ower the water but when i see you i kind of forget and just for the minute i think youre here  well think afore you speak  ill try but thats teuch work when do you come to scotland  im no sure but as soon as im ripe  at nights tommy now sometimes lay among the cabbages of the schoolhouse watching the shadow of black cathro on his sittingroom blind cathro never knew he was there the reason tommy lay among the cabbages was that there was a price upon his head  but if black cathro wanted to get the bloodmoney corp said apologetically he could nab you any day he kens you fine  tommy smiled meaningly not him he answered ive cheated him bonny he hasna a notion wha i am corp would you like a good laugh  that i would  weel then ill tell you wha he thinks i am do you ken a little house yont the road a bitty irae monypenny  i ken no sic house said corp except aarons  aarons the man as bides in it tommy continued hastily at least i think thats the name well as you ken the house youve maybe noticed a laddie that bides there too  theres no laddie began corp except  let me see interrupted tommy what was his name was it peter no was it willie stop i mind it was tommy  he glared so that corp dared not utter a word  have you notitched him  iveive seen him corp gasped  well this is the joke said tommy trying vainly to restrain his mirth cathro thinks im that laddie ho ho ho  corp scratched his head then he bit his warts then he spat upon his hands then he said damn  the crisis came when cathro still ignorant that the heather was on fire dropped some disparaging remarks about the stuarts to his history class tommy said nothing butbut one of the schoolwindows was without a snib and next morning when the dominie reached his desk he was surprised to find on it a little cotton glove he raised it on high greatly puzzled and then as ever when he suspected knavery his eyes sought tommy who was sitting on a form his arms proudly folded that the whelp had put the glove there cathro no longer doubted and he would have liked to know why but was reluctant to give him the satisfaction of asking so the gauntletfor gauntlet it waswas laid aside the while tommy his head humming like a beeskep muttered triumphantly through his teeth but he lifted it he lifted it and at closing time it was flung in his face with this fair tribute  im no a rich man laddie but i would give a pound note to know what youll be at ten years from now  there could be no mistaking the dire meaning of these words and tommy hurried pale but determined to the quarry where corp with a barrow in his hands was learning strange phrases by heart and finding it a help to call his warts after the new swears  corp cried tommy firmly ive set sail  on the following saturday evening charles edward landed in the den in his bonnet was the white cockade and round his waist a tartan sash though he had long passed mans allotted span his face was still full of fire his figure lithe and even boyish for state reasons he had assumed the name of captain stroke as he leapt ashore from the bark the dancing shovel he was received right loyally by corp and other faithful adherents of whom only two and these of a sex to which his house was ever partial were visible owing to the gathering gloom corp of that ilk sank on his knees at the waters edge and kissing his royal masters hand said fervently welcome my prince once more to bonny scotland then he rose and whispered but with scarcely less emotion theres an egg to your tea     chapter xxii  the siege of thrums   the man in the moon is a native of thrums who was put up there for hacking sticks on the sabbath and as he sails over the den his interest in the bit placey is still sufficient to make him bend forward and cry boo at the lovers when they jump apart you can see the aged reprobate grinning once out of sight of the den he cares not a boddle how the moon travels but the masterful crittur enrages him if she is in a hurry here just as he is cleverly making out whose childrens children are courting now slow there he cries to the moon but she answers placidly that they have the rest of the world to view tonight the rest of the world be danged roars the man and he cranes his neck for a last glimpse of the cuttle well until he nearly falls out of the moon  never had the man such a trying time as during the year now before him it was the year when so many scientific magnates sat up half the night in their shirts spying at him through telescopes but every effort to discover why he was in such a fidget failed because the spyglasses were never levelled at the thrums den through the whole of the incidents now to tell you may conceive the man on whom sympathy would be wasted dagoning horribly because he was always carried past the den before he could make head or tail of the change that had come over it  the spot chosen by the illfated stuart and his gallant remnant for their last desperate enterprise was eminently fitted for their purpose being round the corner from thrums it was commanded by no fortified place save the farm of nether drumgley and on a recent goustie night nearly all the trees had been blown down making a hundred hidingplaces for bold climbers and transforming the den into a scene of wild and mournful grandeur in no bay more suitable than the flooded field called the silent pool could the hunted prince have cast anchor for the pool is not only sheltered from observation but so little troubled by gales that it had only one drawback at some seasons of the year it was not there this however did not vex stroke as it is cannier to call him for he burned his boats on the night he landed and a dagont tedious job it was too and pointed out to his followers that the drouth which kept him in must also keep the enemy out part of the way to the lair they usually traversed in the burn because water leaves no trace and though they carried turnip lanterns and were armed to the teeth this was often a perilous journey owing to the lovers close at hand on the pink path from which the trees had been cleared for lads and lasses must walk whateer betide ronnyons jean and peter scrymgeour little lisbeth doak and long saml from pyotdykes were pairing that year and never knew how near they were to being dirked by corp of corp who lurking in the burn till there were no tibbits in his toes muttered fiercely cheep one single cheep and it will be thy hinmost methinks under the impression that methinks was a jacobite oath  for this voluntary service stroke clapped corp of corp on the shoulder with a naked sword and said rise sir joseph which made corp more confused than ever for he was already corp of corp him of muckle kenny red mcneil andrew ferrara and the master of inverquharity strokes names as well as stabinthedark grindthemtomullins and warty joe his own and which he was at any particular moment he never knew till stroke told him and even then he forgot and had to be put in irons  the other frequenters of the lair on saturday nights when alone the rebellion was active were the proud lady grizel and widow elspeth it had been thought best to make elspeth a widow because she was so religious  the lair was on the right bank of the burn near the waterfall and you climbed to it by ropes unless you preferred an easier way it is now a dripping hollow down which water dribbles from beneath a sluice but at that time it was hidden on all sides by trees and the huge clods of sward they had torn from the earth as they fell two of these clods were the only walls of the lair which had at times a ceiling not unlike aaron lattas bed coverlets and the chief furniture was two barrels marked usquebach and powder when the darkness of strokes fortunes sat like a pall upon his brow as happened sometimes he sought to drive it away by playing cards on one of these barrels with sir joseph but the approach of the widow made him pocket them quickly with a warning sign to his trusty knight who did not understand and asked what had become of them whereupon elspeth cried in horror  cards oh tommy you promised  but stroke rode her down with cards wha has been playing cards you muckle kenny and you sir joseph after i forbade it hie there inverquharity all of you seize those men  then corp blinked came to his senses and marched himself off to the prison on the lonely promontory called the queens bower saying ferociously jouk sir joseph and ill blaw you into posterity  it is sable night when stroke and sir joseph reach a point in the den whence the glimmering lights of the town are distinctly visible neither speaks presently the distant eightoclock bell rings and then sir joseph looks anxiously at his warts for this is the signal to begin and as usual he has forgotten the words  go on says someone in a whisper it cannot be stroke for his head is brooding on his breast this mysterious voice haunted all the doings in the den and had better be confined in brackets  go on  methinks says sir joseph methinks the borers   burghers  methinks the burghers now cease from their labors  ay replied stroke tis so would that they ceased from them forever  methinks the time is at hand  ha exclaims stroke looking at his lieutenant curiously what makest thou say so for three weeks these fortifications have defied my cannon there is scarce a breach yet in the walls of yonder town  methinks thou wilt find a way  it may be so my good sir joseph it may be so and yet even when i am most hopeful of success my schemes go a gley  methinks thy dark  dinna say methinks so often  tommy i maun if i dinna get that to start me off i go through other  go on  methinks thy dark spirit lies on thee tonight  ay tis too true but canst thou blame me if i grow sad the town still in the enemys hands and so much brave blood already spilt in vain knowest thou that the brave kinnordy fell last night my noble kinnordy  here stroke covers his face with his hands weeping silently andand there is an awkward pause  go onstill have me  so it is weep not my royal scone  scion  weep not my royal scion havest thou not still me  well said sir joseph cries stroke dashing the sign of weakness from his face i still have many brave fellows and with their help i shall be master of this proud town  and then ghost we to fair edinburgh  ay tis so but sir joseph thinkest thou these burghers love the stuart not  nay methinks they are true to thee but their starch commandergive me my time this is a lang ane but their arch commander is thy bitterest foe vile spoon that he is its no spoon its spawn  thou meanest the craven cathro  methinks ay i like thae short anes  tis well says stroke sternly that man hath ever slipped between me and

onion i prithee go not tonight  i have given my word  thy word is a band  adieu my friend  methinks thou ghost to thy damn did we no promise elspeth there should be no swearing  the raft vick lan vohr is dragged to the shore and stroke steps on board a proud solitary figure farewell he cries hoarsely as he seizes the oar  farewell my leech answers corp and then helps him to disembark their hands chance to meet and strokes is so hot that corp quails  tommy he says with a shudder do youyou dinna think its a true do you but the illfated prince only gives him a warning look and plunges into the mazes of the forest for a long time silence reigns over the den lights glint fitfully a human voice imitates the plaintive cry of the peewit cautious whistling follows comes next the clash of arms and the scream of one in the deaththroes and again silence falls stroke emerges near the reekie broth pot wiping his sword and muttering faugh it drippeth at the same moment the air is filled with music of more than mortalwell the air is filled with music it seems to come from but a few yards away and pressing his hand to his throbbing brow the chevalier presses forward till pushing aside the branches of a fallen fir he comes suddenly upon a scene of such romantic beauty that he stands rooted to the ground before him softly lit by a halfmoon the man in it perspiring with curiosity is a miniature dell behind which rise threatening rocks overgrown here and there by grass heath and bracken while in the centre of the dell is a bubbling spring called the cuttle well whose water as it overflows a natural basin soaks into the surrounding ground and so finds a way into the picturesque stream below but it is not the loveliness of the spot which fascinates the prince rather is it the exquisite creature who sits by the bubbling spring a reed from a handloom in her hands from which she strikes mournful sounds the while she raises her voice in song a pink scarf and a blue ribbon are crossed upon her breast her dark tresses kiss her lovely neck and as she sits on the only dry stone her face raised as if in wrapt communion with the heavens and her feet tucked beneath her to avoid the mud she seems not a human being but the very spirit of the place and hour the royal wanderer remains spellbound while she strikes her lyre and sings with but one trivial alteration the song of macmurrough  awake on your hills on your islands awake brave sons of the mountains the frith and the lake tis the buglebut not for the chase is the call tis the pibrochs shrill summonsbut not to the hall  tis the summons of heroes for conquest or death when the banners are blazing on mountain and heath they call to the dirk the claymore and the targe to the march and the muster the line and the charge  be the brand of each chieftain like strokes in his ire may the blood through his veins flow like currents of fire burst the base foreign yoke as your sires did of yore or die like your sires and endure it no more  as the fair singer concluded stroke who had been deeply moved heaved a great sigh and immediately as if in echo of it came a sigh from the opposite side of the dell in a second of time three people had learned that a certain lady had two lovers she starts to her feet still carefully avoiding the puddles but it is not she who speaks  did you hear me  ay  youre ready  ca awa  stroke dashes to the girls side just in time to pluck her from the arms of a masked man the villain raises his mask and reveals the face ofit looks like corp but the disguise is thrown away on stroke  ha cathro he exclaims joyfully so at last we meet on equal terms  back stroke and let me pass  nay we fight for the wench  so be it the prideful onion is his who wins her  have at thee caitiff  a terrible conflict ensues cathro draws first blood tis but a scratch ha well thrust stroke in vain cathro girns his teeth inch by inch he is driven back he slips he recovers he pants he is apparently about to fling himself down the steep bank and so find safety in flight but he comes on again  what are you doing you run now  i ken but im sweer  off you go  even as stroke is about to press home the cowardly foe flings himself down the steep bank and rolls out of sight he will give no more trouble tonight and the victor turns to the lady grizel who had been repinning the silk scarf across her breast while the issue of the combat was still in doubt  now then grizel you kiss my hand  i tell you i wont  well then go on your knees to me  you neednt think it  dagon you then ca awa standing  my liege thou hast saved me from the wretch cathro  may i always be near to defend thee in time of danger my pretty chick  tommy you promised not to call me by those silly names  they slip out i tell you that was aye the way wi the stuarts  well you must say lady grizel good my prince how can i thank thee  by being my wife not a word of this to elspeth  nay i summoned thee here to tell thee that can never be the grizels of grizel are of ancient lineage but they mate not with monarchs my sire the nunnery gates will soon close on me forever  then at least say thou lovest me  alas i love thee not  what haver is this i telled you to say charles would that i loved thee less  and i told you i would not  well then where are we now  we miss out all that about my wearing your portrait next my heart and put in the rich apparel bit the same as last week  oh then i go on bethink thee fair jade  lady  bethink thee fair lady stuart is not so poor but that if thou come with him to his lowly lair he can deck thee with rich apparel and ribbons rare  i spurn thy gifts unhappy man but if there are holes in  miss that common bit out i canna thole it  i like it if there are holes in the garments of thy loyal followers i will come and mend them and have a needle and thread in my pocket tommy there is another button off your shirt have you got the button  its down my breeks so be it proud girl come  it was grizel who made masks out of tin rags picked up where tinkers had passed the night and musical instruments out of broken reeds that smelled of caddis and jacobite headgear out of weavers nightcaps and she kept the lair so clean and tidy as to raise a fear that intruders might mistake its character elspeth had to mind the pot which aaron latta never missed and corp was supposed to light the fire by striking sparks from his knife a trick which tommy considered so easy that he refused to show how it was done many strange sauces were boiled in that pot a sort of potatoturnip pudding often coming out even when not expected but there was an occasional rabbit that had been bowled over by corps unerring hand and once tommy shot aa haunch of venison having first with corps help howked it out of ronnyons swine then suspended head downward and open like a book at the page of contents steaming dripping a tub beneath boys with bladders in the distance when they had supped they gathered round the fire grizel knitting a shawl for they knew whom but the name was never mentioned and tommy told the story of his life at the french court and how he fought in the 45 and afterward hid in caves and so did he shudder as he described the cold of his bracken beds and so glowed his face for it was all real to him that grizel let the wool drop on her knee and corp whispered to elspeth dinna be fleid for him ise uphaud he found a wy those quiet evenings were not the least pleasant spent in the den  but sometimes they were interrupted by a fierce endeavor to carry the lair when boys from cathros climbed to it up each others backs the rope of course having been pulled into safety at the first sound and then that end of the den rang with shouts and deeds of valor on both sides were as common as pine needles and once tommy and corp were only saved from captors who had them down by grizel rushing into the midst of things with two flaring torches and another time bold birkie most daring of the storming party was seized with two others and made to walk the plank the plank had been part of a gate and was suspended over the bank of the silent pool so that as you approached the farther end down you went it was not a jacobite method but tommy feared that rows of bodies hanging from the trees still standing in the den might attract attention     chapter xxiii  grizel pays three visits   less alarming but more irritating was the attempt of the youth of monypenny and the west town end to establish a rival firm of jacobites without even being sure of the name they started business francie crabb leader because he had a kilt on a flagon of porter and an ounce of twist which they carried on a stick through the den saying bowf like dogs when they met anyone and then laughing doubtfully the twist and porter were seized by tommy and his followers and haggertytaggerty major arrived home with his head so firmly secured in the flagon that the solder had to be melted before he saw the world again francie was in still worse plight for during the remainder of the evening he had to hide in shame among the brackens and tommy wore a kilt  one cruel revenge the beaten rivals had they waylaid grizel when she was alone and thus assailed her she answering not a word  whats a father  shell soon no have a mither either  the painted lady needs to paint her cheeks no longer  na the red spots comes themsels now  have you heard her hoasting  ay its the hoast o a dying woman  the joiner heard it and gave her a look measuring her wi his eye for the coffin five and a half by one and a half would hold her snod he says to himsel  ronnyons auld wife heard it and says she dinna think my leddy as youll be buried in consecrated ground  na abody kens shell just be hauled at the end o a rope to the hole where the witches was shooled in  wi a paling spar through her to keep her down on the day o judgment  well well these children became men and women in time one of them even a bit of a hero though he never knew it  are you angry with them if so put the cheap thing aside or think only of grizel and perhaps god will turn your anger into love for her  greathearted solitary child she walked away from them without flinching but on reaching the den where no one could see hershe lay down on the ground and her cheeks were dry but little wells of water stood in her eyes  she would not be the lady grizel that night she went home instead but there was something she wanted to ask tommy now and the next time she saw him she began at once grizel always began at once often in the middle she saw what she was making for so clearly  do you know what it means when there are red spots in your cheeks that used not to be there  tommy knew at once to whom she was referring for he had heard the gossip of the youth of monypenny and he hesitated to answer  and if when you cough you bring up a tiny speck of blood  i would get a bottle frae the doctor said tommy evasively  she wont have the doctor answered grizel unguardedly and then with a look dared tommy to say that she spoke of her mother  does it mean you are dying  iioh no they soon get better  he said this because he was so sorry for grizel there never was a more sympathetic nature than tommys at every time of his life his pity was easily roused for persons in distress and he sought to comfort them by shutting their eyes to the truth as long as possible this sometimes brought relief to them but it was useless to grizel who must face her troubles  why dont you answer truthfully she cried with vehemence it is so easy to be truthful  well then said tommy reluctantly i think they generally die  elspeth often carried in her pocket a little testament presented to her by the rev mr dishart for learning by heart one of the noblest of books the shorter catechism as scottish children do or did not understanding it at the time but its meaning comes long afterwards and suddenly when you have most need of it sometimes elspeth read aloud from her testament to grizel who made no comment but this same evening when the two were alone she said abruptly  have you your testament  yes elspeth said producing it  which is the page about saving sinners  its all about that  but the page when you are in a hurry  elspeth read aloud the story of the crucifixion and grizel listened sharply until she heard what jesus said to the malefactor today shalt thou be with me in paradise  and was he  of course  but he had been wicked all his life and i believe he was only good just that minute because they were crucifying him if they had let him come down  no he repented you know that means he had faith and if you have faith you are saved it doesna matter how bad you have been you have just to say i believe before you die and god lets you in its so easy grizel cried elspeth with shining eyes  grizel pondered i dont believe it is so easy as that she said decisively  nevertheless she asked presently what the testament cost and when elspeth answered fourpence offered her the money  i dont want to sell it elspeth remonstrated  if you dont give it to me i shall take it from you said grizel determinedly  you can buy one  no the shop people would guess  guess what  i wont tell you  ill lend it to you  i wont take it that way so elspeth had to part with her testament saying wonderingly can you read  yes and write too mamma taught me  but i thought she was daft elspeth blurted out  she is only daft now and then grizel replied without her usual spirit generally she is not daft at all but only timid  next morning the painted ladys child paid three calls one in town two in the country the adorable thing is that once having made up her mind she never flinched not even when her hand was on the knocker  the first gentleman received her in his lobby for a moment he did not remember her then suddenly the color deepened on his face and he went back and shut the parlordoor  did anybody see you coming here he asked quickly  i dont know  what does she want  she did not send me i came myself  well  when you come to our house  i never come to your house  that is a lie  speak lower  when you come to our house you tell me to go out and play but i dont i go and cry  no doubt he was listening but his eyes were on the parlordoor  i dont know why i cry but you know you wicked man why is it  why is it she demanded again like a queenchild but he could only fidget with his gold chain and shuffle uneasily in his parnella shoes  you are not coming to see my mamma again  the gentleman gave her an ugly look  if you do she said at once i shall come straight here and open that door you are looking at and tell your wife  he dared not swear his hand  if you offer me money said grizel i shall tell her now  he muttered something to himself  is it true she asked that mamma is dying  this was a genuine shock to him for he had not been at double dykes since winter and then the painted lady was quite well  nonsense he said and his obvious disbelief brought some comfort to the girl but she asked why are there red spots on her cheeks then  paint he answered  no cried grizel rocking her arms it is not paint now i thought it might be and i tried to rub it off while she was sleeping but it will not come off and when she coughs there is blood on her handkerchief  he looked alarmed now and grizels fears came back if mamma dies she said determinedly she must be buried in the cemetery  she is not dying i tell you  and you must come to the funeral  are you gyte  with crape on your hat  his mouth formed an emphatic no  you must said grizel firmly you shall if you dont she pointed to the parlordoor  her remaining two visits were to a similar effect and one of the gentlemen came out of the ordeal somewhat less shamefully than the first the other worse for he blubbered and wanted to kiss her it is questionable whether many young ladies have made such a profound impression in a series of morning calls  the names of these gentlemen are not known but you shall be told presently where they may be found every person in thrums used to know the place and many itched to get at the names but as yet no one has had the nerve to look for them  not at this time did grizel say a word of these interviews to her friends though tommy had to be told of them later and she never again referred to her mother at the saturday evenings in the den but the others began to know a queer thing nothing less than this that in their absence the lair was sometimes visited by a person or persons unknown who made use of their stock of firewood it was a startling discovery but when they discussed it in council grizel never contributed a word the affair remained a mystery until one saturday evening when tommy and elspeth reaching the lair first found in it a delicate white shawl they both recognized in it the pretty thing the painted lady had pinned across her shoulders on the night they saw her steal out of double dykes to meet the man of long ago  even while their eyes were saying this grizel climbed in without giving the password and they knew from her quick glance around that she had come for the shawl she snatched it out of tommys hand with a look that prohibited questions  its the pair o them tommy said to elspeth at the first opportunity that sometimes comes here at nights and kindles the fire and warms themsels at the gloze and the last time they came they forgot the shawl  i dinna like to think the painted lady has been up here tommy  but she has you ken how when she has a daft fit she wanders the den trysting the man that never comes has she no been seen at all hours o the night grizel following a wee bit ahint like as if to take tent o her  they say that and that grizel canna get her to go home till the daft fit has passed  well she has that kechering hoast and spit now and so grizel brings her up here out o the blasts  but how could she be got to come here if she winna go home  because frae here she can watch for the man  elspeth shuddered do you think shes here often tommy she asked  just when she has a daft fit on and they say shes wise sax days in seven  this made the jacobite meetings eerie events for elspeth but tommy liked them the better and what were they not to grizel who ran to them with passionate fondness every saturday night sometimes she even outdistanced her haunting dreads for she knew that her mother did not think herself seriously ill and had not the three gentlemen made light of that curious cough so there were nights when the lair saw grizel go riotous with glee laughing dancing and shouting overmuch like one trying to make up for a lost childhood but it was also noticed that when the time came to leave the den she was very loath and kissed her hands to the places where she had been happiest saying wistfully and with pretty gestures that were foreign to thrums goodnight dear cuttle well goodby sweet sweet lair as if she knew it could not last these weekly risings in the den were most real to tommy but it was grizel who loved them best     chapter xxiv  a romance of two old maids and a stout bachelor   came gavinia a burgess of the besieged city along the south shore of the silent pool she was but a maid seeking to know what love might be and as she wandered on she nibbled dreamily at a hot sweetsmelling bridie whose gravy oozed deliciously through a bursting paperbag  it was a fit night for dark deeds  methinks she cometh to her damn  the speaker was a masked man who had followed herhe was sniffing ecstaticallysince she left the city walls  she seemed to possess a charmed life he would have had her in shovel gorge but just then ronnyons jean and peter scrymgeour turned the corner  suddenly gavinia felt an exquisite thrill a man was pursuing her she slipped the paperbag out of sight holding it dexterously against her side with her arm so that the gravy should not spurt out and ran lights flashed a kingly voice cried now and immediately a petticoat was flung over her head the lady griselda looked thin that evening  gavinia was dragged to the lair and though many a time they bumped her she still tenderly nursed the paperbag with her arm or fondly thought she did so for when unmuffled she discovered that it had been removed as if by painless surgery and her captors tongues were sweeping their chins for stray crumbs  the wench was offered her choice of strokes gallant fellows but wha carries me wears me said she promptly and not only had he to carry her from one end of the den to the other but he must do it whistling as if barely conscious that she was there so after many attempts for she was always willing to let them have their try corp of corp speaking for sir joseph and the others announced a general retreat  instead of taking this prisoners life stroke made her his tool releasing her on condition that every seventh day she appeared at the lair with information concerning the doings in the town also her name was agnes of kingoldrum and if she said it was not the plank bought thus agnes proved of service bringing such bags of news that stroke was often occupied now in drawing diagrams of thrums and its strongholds including the residence of cathro with dotted lines to show the direction of proposed underground passages  and presently came by this messenger disquieting rumors indeed another letter being the third in six months had reached the dovecot addressed not to miss ailie but to miss kitty miss kitty had been dead fully six years and archie piatt the post swore that this was the eighteenth if not the nineteenth letter he had delivered to her name since that time they were all in the same hand a mans and there had been similar letters while she was alive but of these he kept no record miss ailie always took these letters with a trembling hand and then locked herself in her bedroom leaving the key in such a position in its hole that you might just as well go straight back to the kitchen within a few hours of the arrival of these ghostly letters tongues were wagging about them but to the two or three persons who after passing a sleepless night bluntly asked miss ailie from whom they came she only replied by pursing her lips nothing could be learned at the postoffice save that miss ailie never posted any letters there except to two misses and a mrs all resident in redlintie the mysterious letters came from australy or manchester or some such part  what could stroke make of this he expressed no opinion but oh his face was grim orders were immediately given to double the sentinels a barrel was placed in the queens bower sawdust was introduced at immense risk into the lair a paper containing this writing 248xho317 oxh4591aws314dd5 was passed round and then solemnly burned nothing was left to chance  agnes of kingoldrum stroke told her did not know miss ailie but she was commanded to pay special attention to the gossip of the town regarding this new move of the enemy by next saturday the plot had thickened previous letters might have reddened miss ailies eyes for an hour or two but they gladdened her as a whole now she sat crying all evening with this one on her lap she gave up her daily walk to the berlin wool shop with all its romantic possibilities at the clatter of the teathings she would start apprehensively she had let a red shawl lie for two days in the blueandwhite room  stroke never blanched he called his faithful remnant around him and told them the story of bell the cat with its application in the records of his race did they take his meaning this miss ailie must be watched closely in short once more in scottish history someone must bell the cat who would volunteer  corp of corp and sir joseph stepped forward as one man  thou couldst not look like gavinia the prince said shaking his head  wha wants him to look like gavinia cried an indignant voice  peace agnes said stroke  agnes why bletherest thou said sir joseph  if onybodys to watch miss ailie insisted the obstinate woman surely it should be me  ha stroke sprang to his feet for something in her voice or the outline of her figure or perhaps it was her profile had given him an idea a torch he cried eagerly and with its aid he scanned her face until his own shone triumphant  he kens a wy methinks exclaimed one of his men  sir joseph was right it had been among the princes exploits to make his way into thrums in disguise and mix with the people as one of themselves and on several of these occasions he had seen miss ailies attendant agness resemblance to her now struck him for the first time it should be agnes of kingoldrums honorable though dangerous part to take this gavinias place  but how to obtain possession of gavinias person agnes made several suggestions but was told to hold her prating peace it could only be done in one way they must kidnap her sir joseph was ordered to be ready to accompany his liege on this perilous enterprise in ten minutes and mind said stroke gravely we carry our lives in our hands  in our hands gasped sir joseph greatly puzzled but he dared ask no more and when the two set forth leaving agnes of kingoldrum looking very uncomfortable he was surprised to see that stroke was carrying nothing sir joseph carried in his hand his red hanky mysteriously knotted  where is yours he whispered  what meanest thou  sir joseph replied oh nothing and thought it best to slip his handkerchief into his trouserpocket but the affair bothered him for long afterwards  when they returned through the den there still seemed to the unpiercing eye to be but two of them nevertheless stroke reentered the lair to announce to agnes and the others that he had left gavinia below in charge of sir joseph she was to walk the plank anon but first she must be stripped that agnes might don her garments stroke was every inch a prince so he kept agnes by his side and sent down the lady griselda and widow elspeth to strip the prisoner sir joseph having orders to stand back fifty paces it is a pleasure to have to record this  the signal having been given that this delicate task was accomplished stroke whistled shrilly and next moment was heard from far below a thud as of a body falling in water then an agonizing shriek and then again all was still save for the heavy breathing of agnes of kingoldrum  sir joseph very wet returned to the lair and agnes was commanded to take off her clothes in a retired spot and put on those of the deceased which she should find behind a fallen tree  i winna be called the deceased cried agnes hotly but she had to do as she was bid and when she emerged from behind the tree she was the very image of the illfated gavinia stroke showed her a plan of miss ailies backdoor and also gave her a kitchen key when he produced this she felt in her pockets and then snatched it from him after which she set out for the dovecot in a scare about her own identity  and now what doest thou think about it a inquired sir joseph eagerly to which stroke made answer looking at him fixedly  the wind is in the west  sir joseph should have kept this a secret but soon stroke heard inverquharity prating of it and he called his lieutenant before him sir joseph acknowledged humbly that he had been unable to hide it from inverquharity but he promised not to tell muckle kenny of whose loyalty there were doubts henceforth when the faithful fellow was muckle kenny he would say doggedly to himself dinna question me kenny i ken nocht about it  dark indeed were now the fortunes of the pretender but they had one bright spot miss ailie had been taken in completely by the trick played on her and thus stroke now got full information of the enemys doings cathro having failed to dislodge the jacobites the seat of war had been changed by victoria to the dovecot whither her despatches were now forwarded that this last one of which agnes of kingoldrum tried in vain to obtain possession doubled the price on the pretenders head there could be no doubt but as miss ailie was a notorious hanoverian only the hunted prince himself knew why this should make her cry  he hinted with a snigger something about an affair he had once had with the lady  the widow and sir joseph accepted this explanation but it made lady griselda rock her arms in irritation  the reports about miss ailies behavior became more and more alarming she walked up and down her bedroom now in the middle of the night every time the knocker clanked she held herself together with both hands agnes had orders not to answer the door until her mistress had keeked through the window  shes expecting a veesitor methinks said corp this was his bright day  ay answered agnes but ist a manbody or just a womanbody  leaving the rebels in the lair stunned by victorias latest move we now return to thrums where miss ailies excited state had indeed been the talk of many even the gossips however had underestimated her distress of mind almost as much as they misunderstood its cause you must listen now will you to so mild a thing as the long thin romance of two maiden ladies and a stout bachelor all beginning to be old the day the three of them first drank tea together and that was ten years ago  miss ailie and miss kitty you may remember were not natives of thrums they had been born and brought up at redlintie and on the death of their parents they had remained there the gauger having left them all his money which was just sufficient to enable them to live like ladies if they took tiny magenta cottage and preferred an inexperienced maid at first their life was very quiet the walk from eleven to one for the good of fragile miss kittys health its outstanding feature when they strolled together on the cliffs miss ailies short thick figure straight as an elvint cut the wind in two but miss kitty was swayed this way and that and when she shook her curls at the wind it blew them roguishly in her face and had another shot at them as soon as they were put to rights if the two walked by the shore where the younger sometimes bathed her feet the elder keeping a sharp eye on land and water the sea behaved like the wind dodging miss ailies ankles and snapping playfully at miss kittys thus even the elements could distinguish between the sisters who nevertheless had so much in common that at times miss ailie would look into her mirror and sigh to think that some day miss kitty might be like this how miss ailie adored miss kitty she trembled with pleasure if you said miss kitty was pretty and she dreamed dreams in which she herself walked as bridesmaid only and just as miss ailie could be romantic miss kitty the romantic could be prim and the primness was her own as much as the curls but miss ailie usually carried it for her like a cloak in case of rain  not often have two sweeter women grown together on one stem what were the men of redlintie about the sisters never asked each other this question but there were times when apparently without cause miss ailie hugged miss kitty vehemently as if challenging the world and perhaps miss kitty understood  thus a year or more passed uneventfully until the one romance of their lives befell them it began with the reappearance in redlintie of magerful tarn who had come to torment his father into giving him more money but finding he had come too late did not harass the sisters this is perhaps the best thing that can be told of him and as if he knew this he had often told it himself to jean myles without however telling her what followed for something to his advantage did follow and it was greatly to the credit of miss ailie and miss kitty though they went about it as timidly as if they were participating in a crime ever since they learned of the sin which had brought this man into the world their lives had been saddened for on the same day they realized what a secret sorrow had long lain at their mothers heart alison sibbald was a very simple gracious lady who never recovered from the shock of discovering that she had married a libertine yet she had pressed her husband to do something for his son and been greatly pained when he refused with a coarse laugh the daughters were very like her in nature and though the knowledge of what she had suffered increased many fold their love for her so that in her last days their passionate devotion to her was the talk of redlintie it did not blind them to what seemed to them to be their duty to the man as their fathers son they held he had a right to a third of the gaugers money and to withhold it from him now that they knew his whereabouts would have been a form of theft but how to give t his third they called him t from delicacy and they had never spoken to him when he passed them in the streets they turned pale and thinking of their mother looked another way but they knew he winked  at last looking red in one street and white in another but resolute in all they took their business to the office of mr john mclean the writer who had once escorted miss kitty home from a party without anything coming of it so that it was quite a psychological novel in several volumes now mr john happened to be away at the fishing and a reckless maid showed them into the presence of a strange man who was no other than his brother ivie home for a years holiday from india and naturally this extraordinary occurrence so agitated them that miss ailie had told half her story before she realized that miss kitty was titting at her dress then indeed she sought to withdraw but ivie with the alarming yet not unpleasing audacity of his sex said he had heard enough to convince him that in this matter he was qualified to take his brothers place but he was not for he announced my advice to you is not to give t a halfpenny which showed that he did not even understand what they had come about  they begged permission to talk to each other behind the door and presently returned troubled but brave miss kitty whispered courage and this helped miss ailie to the deed  we have quite made up our minds to let t have the money she said butbut the difficulty is the taking it to him must we take it in person  why not asked ivie bewildered  it would be such a painful meeting to us said miss ailie  and to him added simple miss kitty  you see we have thought it best not tonot to know him said miss ailie faintly  mother faltered miss kitty and at the word the eyes of both ladies began to fill  then of course mr mclean discovered the object of their visit and promised that his brother should take this delicate task off their hands and as he bowed them out he said ladies i think you are doing a very foolish thing and i shall respect you for it all my life at least miss kitty insisted that respect was the word miss ailie thought he said esteem  that was how it began and it progressed for nearly a year at a rate that will take away your breath on the very next day he met miss kitty in high street a most awkward encounter for her for you know ailie we were never introduced so how could i decide all in a moment what to do and he raised his hat the misses croall were at their window and saw the whole thing but we must gallop like the friendship he bowed the first two times the third time he shook hands by a sort of providence miss kitty had put on her new mittens the fourth fifth and sixth times he conversed the seventh time hethey replied that they really could not trouble him so much but he said he was going that way at any rate the eighth time ninth time and tenth time the figures of two ladies and a gentleman might have been observed etc and either the eleventh or twelfth time fancy our not being sure ailieit has all come so quickly kitty he took his first dish of tea at magenta cottage  there were many more walks after this often along the cliffs to a little fishing village over which the greatest of magicians once stretched his wand so that it became famous forever as all the world saw except himself and tea at the cottage followed when ivie asked miss kitty to sing the land o the leal and miss ailie sat by the window taking in her merino that it might fit miss kitty cutting her sable muff once alison sibbalds into wristbands for miss kittys astrakhan they did not go quite all the way round but men are blind  ivie was not altogether blind the sisters it is to be feared called him the dashing mclean but he was at this time nearly forty years old an age when bachelors like to take a long rest from thinking of matrimony before beginning again fifteen years earlier he had been in love but the girl had not cared to wait for him and though in india he had often pictured himself returning to redlintie to gaze wistfully at her old home when he did come back he never went because the house was a little out of the way but unknown to him two ladies went to whom he had told this as a rather dreary joke they were ladies he esteemed very much though having a sense of humor he sometimes chuckled on his way home from magenta cottage and he thought out many ways of adding little pleasures to their lives it was like him to ask miss kitty to sing and play though he disliked music he understood that it is a hard world for single women and knew himself for a very ordinary sort of man if it ever crossed his head that miss kitty would be willing to marry him he felt genuinely sorry at the same time that she had not done better long ago he never flattered himself that he could be accepted now save for the good home he could provide he was not the man to blame women for being influenced by that for like most of his sex he was unaware that a woman is never too old to love or to be loved if they do know it the mean ones among them make a jest of it at which god knows why their wives laugh mr mclean had been acquainted with the sisters for months before he was sure even that miss kitty was his favorite he found that out one evening when sitting with an old friend whose wife and children were in the room gathered round a lamp and playing at some childs game suddenly ivie mclean envied his friend and at the same moment he thought tenderly of miss kitty but the feeling passed he experienced it next and as suddenly when arriving at bombay where some women were waiting to greet their husbands  before he went away the two gentlewomen knew that he was not to speak they did not tell each other what was in their minds miss kitty was so bright during those last days that she must have deceived anyone who did not love her and miss ailie held her mouth very tight and if possible was straighter than ever but oh how gentle she was with miss kitty ivies last two weeks in the old country were spent in london and during that time miss kitty liked to go away by herself and sit on a rock and gaze at the sea once miss ailie followed her and would have called him a  dont ailie said miss kitty imploringly but that night when miss kitty was brushing her hair she said courageously ailie i dont think i should wear curls any longer you know ii shall be thirtyseven in august and after the elder sister had become calm again miss kitty said timidly you dont think i have been unladylike do you ailie  such a trifle now remains to tell miss kitty was the better business woman of the two and kept the accounts and understood as miss ailie could not understand how their little income was invested and even knew what consols were though never quite certain whether it was their fall or rise that is matter for congratulation and after the ship had sailed she told miss ailie that nearly all their money was lost and that she had known it for a month  and you kept it from me why  i thought ailie that you knowing i am not strongthat youwould perhaps tell him  and i would cried miss ailie  and then said miss kitty perhaps he out of pity you know  well even if he had said miss ailie  i could not oh i could not replied miss kitty flushing itit would not have been ladylike ailie  thus forced to support themselves the sisters decided to keep school genteelly and hearing that there was an opening in thrums they settled there and miss kitty brushed her hair out now and with a twist and a twirl ran it up her fingers into a net whence by noon some of it had escaped through the little windows and was curls again she and miss ailie were happy in thrums for time took the pain out of the affair of mr mclean until it became not merely a romantic memory but with the letters he wrote to miss kitty and her answers the great quiet pleasure of their lives they were friendly letters only but miss kitty wrote hers out in pencil first and read them to miss ailie who had been taking notes for them  in the last weeks of miss kittys life miss ailie conceived a passionate unspoken hatred of mr mclean and her intention was to write and tell him that he had killed her darling but owing to the illness into which she was flung by miss kittys death that unjust letter was never written  but why did mr mclean continue to write to miss kitty  well have pity or be merciless as you choose for several years mr mcleans letters had been the one thing the sisters looked forward to and now when miss ailie was without miss kitty must she lose them also she never doubted though she may have been wrong that if ivie knew of miss kittys death one letter would come in answer and that the last she could not tell him in the meantime he wrote twice asking the reason of this long silence and at last miss ailie whose handwriting was very like her sisters wrote him a letter which was posted at tilliedrum and signed katherine cray the thing seems monstrous but this gentle lady did it and it was never so difficult to do again latterly it had been easy  this last letter of mr mcleans announced to miss kitty that he was about to start for home for good and he spoke in it of coming to thrums to see the sisters as soon as he reached redlintie poor miss ailie after sleepless nights she trudged to the tilliedrum postoffice with a full confession of her crime which would be her welcome home to him when he arrived at his brothers house many of the words were written on damp blobs after that she could do nothing but wait for the storm and waiting she became so meek that gavinia who loved her because she was that simple said sorrowfully  how ist you never rage at me now maam im sure it keepit you lightsome and i likit to hear the bum ot  and instead o the raging i was prigging for the softhearted maid told her friends she gave me a flannel petticoat indeed miss ailie had taken to giving away her possessions at this time like a woman who thought she was on her deathbed there was something for each of her pupils includingbut the important thing is that there was a gift for tommy which had the effect of planting the hanoverian woman to whom he must have given many uneasy moments more securely on the british throne     chapter xxv  a penny passbook   elspeth conveyed the gift to tommy in a brown paper wrapping and when it lay revealed as an aging volume of mammas boy a magazine for the home nothing could have looked more harmless but ah you never know hungrily tommy ran his eye through the bill of fare for something choice to begin with and he found it the boy pirate it was called never could have been fairer promise and down he sat confidently  it was a paper on the boys who have been undone by reading pernicious fiction it gave their names and the number of pistols they had bought and what the judge said when he pronounced sentence it counted the sensational tales found beneath the bed and described the desolation of the mothers and sisters it told the color of the fathers hair before and afterwards  tommy flung the thing from him picked it up again and read on uneasily and when at last he rose he was shrinking from himself in hopes that he might sleep it off he went early to bed but his contrition was still with him in the morning then elspeth was shown the article which had saved him and she too shuddered at what she had been though her remorse was but a poor display beside his he was so much better at everything than elspeth tommys distress of mind was so genuine and so keen that it had several hours start of his admiration of it and it was still sincere though he himself had become gloomy when he told his followers that they were no more grizel heard his tale with disdain and said she hated miss ailie for giving him the silly book but he reproved these unchristian sentiments while admitting that miss ailie had played on him a scurvy trick  but youre glad youve repented tommy elspeth reminded him anxiously  ay im glad he answered without heartiness  well gin you repent ill repent too said corp always ready to accept tommy without question  youll be happier replied tommy sourly  ay to be goods the great thing corp growled but tommy could we no have just one michty blatter methinks to end up wi  this of course could not be and saturday forenoon found tommy wandering the streets listlessly very happy you know but inclined to kick at any one who came near such for instance as the stranger who asked him in the square if he could point out the abode of miss ailie cray  tommy led the way casting some converted looks at the gentleman and judging him to be the mysterious unknown in whom the late captain stroke had taken such a reprehensible interest he was a stout redfaced man stepping firmly into the fifties with a beard that even the most converted must envy and a frown sat on his brows all the way proving him possibly illtempered but also one of the notable few who can think hard about one thing for at least five consecutive minutes many took a glint at him as he passed but missed the frown they were wondering so much why the fur of his heavy topcoat was on the inside where it made little show save at blasty corners  miss ailie was in her parlor trying to give her mind to a blue and white notebook but when she saw who was coming up the garden she dropped the little volume and tottered to her bedroom she was there when gavinia came up to announce that she had shown a gentleman into the blueandwhite room who gave the name of ivie mclean tell himi shall come downpresently gasped miss ailie and then gavinia was sure this was the man who was making her mistress so unhappy  shes so easily flichtered now gavinia told tommy in the kitchen that for fear o starting her i never whistle at my work without telling her im to dot and if i fall on the stair my first thought is to jump up and cry it was just me tumling and now i believe this brutell be the death o her  but what can he do to her  i dinna ken but shes greeting sair and yon can hear how hes rampaging up and down the blueandwhite room listen to his thrawn feet hes raging because shes so long in coming down and come she daurna oh the poor crittur  now tommy was very fond of his old schoolmistress and he began to be unhappy with gavinia  she hasna a manbody in the world to take care o her sobbed the girl  has she no cried tommy fiercely and under one of the impulses that so easily mastered him he marched into the blueandwhite room  well my young friend and what may you want asked mr mclean impatiently  tommy sat down and folded his arms im going to sit here and see what you do to miss ailie he said determinedly  mr mclean said oh and then seemed favorably impressed for he added quietly she is a friend of yours is she well i have no intention of hurting her  you had better no replied tommy stoutly  did she send you here  no i came mysel  to protect her  there was the irony in it that so puts up a boys dander dinna think said tommy hotly that im fleid at you though i have no beardat least i hinna it wi me  at this unexpected conclusion a smile crossed mr mcleans face but was gone in an instant i wish you had laughed said tommy on the watch once a body laughs he canna be angry no more which was pretty good even for tommy it made mr mclean ask him why he was so fond of miss ailie  im the only manbody she has he answered  oh but why are you her manbody  the boy could think of no better reason than this becausebecause shes so sair in need o are there were moments when one liked tommy  mr mclean turned to the window and perhaps forgot that he was not alone well what are you thinking about so deeply he asked by and by  i was trying to think o something that would gar you laugh answered tommy very earnestly and was surprised to see that he had nearly done it  the blue and white notebook was lying on the floor where miss ailie had dropped it often in tommys presence she had consulted this work and certainly its effect on her was the reverse of laughter but once he had seen dr mcqueen pick it up and roar over every page with an inspiration tommy handed the book to mr mclean it made the doctor laugh he said persuasively  go away said ivie impatiently i am in no mood for laughing  i tell you what answered tommy ill go if you promise to look at it and to be rid of him the man agreed for the next quarter of an hour tommy and gavinia were very near the door of the blueandwhite room tommy whispering dejectedly i hear no laughing and gavinia replying but he has quieted down  mr mclean had a right to be very angry but god only can say whether he had a right to be as angry as he was the book had been handed to him open and he was laying it down unread when a word underlined caught his eye it was his own name nothing in all literature arrests our attention quite so much as that he sat down to the book it was just about this time that miss ailie went on her knees to pray  it was only a penny passbook on its blue cover had been pasted a slip of white paper and on the paper was written in blue ink alison cray with a date nearly nine years old the contents were in miss ailies prim handwriting jottings for her own use begun about the time when the sisters trembling at their audacity had opened school and consulted and added to fitfully ever since hours must have been spent in erasing the blots and other blemishes so carefully the tiny volume was not yet full and between its two last written pages lay a piece of blue blottingpaper neatly cut to the size of the leaf  some of these notes were transcripts from books some contained the advice of friends others were doubtless the result of talks with miss kitty from whom there were signs that the work had been kept a secret many were miss ailies own an entry of this kind was frequent if you are uncertain of the answer to a question in arithmetic it is advisable to leave the room on some pretext and work out the sum swiftly in the passage various pretexts were suggested and this one which had an insufficient line through it had been inserted by dr mcqueen on that day when tommy saw him chuckling you pretend that your nose is bleeding and putting your handkerchief to it retire hastily the supposition being that you have gone to put the key of the blueandwhite room down your back evidently these small deceptions troubled miss ailie for she had written such subterfuge is i hope pardonable the object being the maintenance of scholastic discipline on another page where the arithmetic was again troubling her this appeared if kitty were aware that the squealing of the slatepencils gave me such headaches she would insist on again taking the arithmetic class though it always makes her ill surely then i am justified in saying that the sound does not distress me to this the doctor had added you are a brick  there were two pages headed never which mentioned ten things that miss ailie must never do among them never let the big boys know you are afraid of them to awe them stamp with the foot speak in a loud ferocious voice and look them unflinchingly in the face  punishments was another heading but she had written it small as if to prevent herself seeing it each time she opened the book obviously her hope had been to dispose of punishment in a few lines but it would have none of that and mr mclean found it stalking from page to page miss ailie favored the cane in preference to tawse which often flap round your neck as yon are about to bring them down except in desperate cases it will probably be found sufficient to order the offender to bring the cane to you then followed a note about rubbing the culprits hand with sweet butter or dripping should you have struck too hard  dispiriting item that on resuming his seat the chastised one is a hero to his fellows for the rest of the day item that master john james rattray knows she hurts her own hand more than his item that john james promised to be good throughout the session if she would let him thrash the bad ones item that master t sandys himself under correction explained to her the artistic instinct again how to give the cane a waggle when descending which would double its nip item that elsie dundas offered to receive francie crabbs punishment for two snaps item that master gavin dishart for what he considered the honor of his school though aware he was imperilling his soul fought hendry dickie of cathros for saying miss ailie could not draw blood with one stroke  the effect on miss ailie of these mortifying discoveries could be read in the paragraph headed a mothers method which was copied from a newspaper mrs e it seems was the mother of four boys residing at d and she subjected them frequently to corporal chastisement without permanent spiritual result mrs e by the advice of another lady mrs k mother of six then had recourse to the following interesting experiment instead of punishing her children physically when they misbehaved she now in their presence wounded herself by striking her left hand severely with a ruler held in the right soon their better natures were touched and the four implored her to desist promising with tears never to offend again from that hour mrs e had little trouble with her boys  it was recorded in the blue and white book how miss ailie gave this plan a fair trial but her boys must have been darker characters than mrs es for it merely set them to watching each other so that they might cry out pandy yourself quick miss ailie gavin disharts drawing the devil on his slate nevertheless when miss ailie announced a return to more conventional methods francie was put up with threats to say that he suffered agonies of remorse every time she pandied herself for him but the thing had been organized in a hurry and francie was insufficiently primed and on crossexamination he let out that he thought remorse was a swelling of the hands  miss ailie was very humbleminded and her entries under the teacher taught were all admonitions for herself thus she chided herself for cowardice because delicate private reasons have made me avoid all mention of india in the geography classes kitty says quite calmly that this is fair neither to our pupils nor to i m the courage of kitty in this matter is a constant rebuke to me except on a few occasions mr mclean found that he was always referred to as i m  quite early in the volume miss ailie knew that her sisters hold on life was loosening how bright the world suddenly seems mr mclean read when there is the tiniest improvement in the health of an invalid one loves is it laughable that such a note as this is appended to a recipe for beeftea it is surely not very wicked to pretend to kitty that i keep some of it for myself she would not take it all if she knew i dined on the beef it was made from other entries showed too plainly that miss ailie stinted herself of food to provide delicacies for miss kitty no doubt her expenses were alarming her when she wrote this an interesting article in the mentor says that nearly all of us eat and drink too much were we to mortify our stomachs we should be healthier animals and more capable of sustained thought the word animal in this connection is coarse but the article is most impressive and a crushing reply to dr mcqueens assertion that the editor drinks in the schoolroom i have frequently found my thoughts of late wandering from classwork and i hastily ascribed it to sitting up during the night with kitty or to my habit of listening lest she should be calling for me probably i had overeaten and i must mortify the stomach a glass of hot water with half a spoonful of sugar in it is highly recommended as a light supper  how long ago it may seem since yesterday do you need to be told on what dark day miss ailie discovered that i used to pray that i should be taken first but i was both impious and selfish for how could fragile kitty have fought on alone  in time happiness again returned to miss ailie of all our friends it is the one most reluctant to leave us on this side of the grave it came at first disguised in the form of duties old and new and stealthily when miss ailie was not looking it mixed with the small worries and joys that had been events while miss kitty lived and these it converted once more into events where miss ailie found it lurking and at first she would not take it back to her heart but it crept in without her knowing and still there were i ms letters they are all i have to look forward to she wrote in selfdefence i shall never write to i m again was another entry but mr mclean found on the same page i have written to i m but do not intend posting it and beneath that was god forgive me i have posted it  the troubles with arithmetic were becoming more terrible i am never really sure about the decimals she wrote  a professor of memory had appeared at the muckley and miss ailie admits having given him halfacrown to explain his system to her but when he was gone she could not remember whether you multiplied everything by ten before dividing by five and subtracting a hundred or began by dividing and doing something underhand with the cube root then mr dishart who had a microscope wanted his boy to be taught science and several experiments were described at length in the book one of them dealing with a penny h and a piston x y and you do things to the piston and then the penny comes to the surface but it never does miss ailie wrote sorrowfully perhaps she was glad when master dishart was sent to another school  though i teach the girls the pianoforte i find that i cannot stretch my fingers as i used to do kitty used to take the music and i often remember this suddenly when superintending a lesson it is a pain to me that so many wish to acquire the land o the leal which kitty sang so often to i m at magenta cottage  even the french of which miss ailie had once been very proud was slipping from her kitty and i kept up our french by translating i ms letters and comparing our versions but now that this stimulus is taken away i find that i am forgetting my french or is it only that i am growing old too old to keep school this dread was beginning to haunt miss ailie and the pages between which the blottingpaper lay revealed that she had written to the editor of the mentor asking up to what age he thought a needy gentlewoman had a right to teach the answer was not given but her comment on it told everything i asked him to be severely truthful so that i cannot resent his reply but if i take his advice how am i to live and if i do not take it i fear i am but a stumblingblock in the way of true education  that is a summary of what mr mclean read in the blue and white book remember you were warned not to expect much and tommy and gavinia listened and tommy said i hear no laughing and gavinia answered but he has quieted down and upstairs miss ailie was on her knees a time came when mr mclean could find something to laugh at in that little passbook but it was not then not even when he reached the end he left something on the last page instead at least i think it must have been he miss ailies tears could not have been so long adrying  you may rise now miss ailie your prayer is granted     chapter xxvi  tommy repents and is none the worse for it   mr mclean wrote a few reassuring words to miss ailie and having told gavinia to give the note to her walked quietly out of the house he was coming back after he had visited miss kittys grave gavinia however did not knew this and having delivered the note she returned dolefully to the kitchen to say to tommy his letter maun have been as thraun as himsel for as soon as she read it down she plumped on her knees again  but tommy was not in the kitchen he was on the gardenwall watching miss ailies persecutor  would it no be easier to watch him frae the gate suggested gavinia who had not the true detective instinct  tommy disregarded her womanlike question a great change had come over him since she went upstairs his bead now wobbled on his shoulders like a little balloon that wanted to cut its connection with earth and soar  what makes you look so queer cried the startled maid i thought you was converted  so i am he shouted im more converted than ever and yet i can do it just the same gavinia ive found a wy  he was hurrying off on mr mcleans trail but turned to say gavinia do you ken wha that man is  ower weel i ken she answered its mr mclean  mclean he echoed scornfully ay ive heard thats one of the names he goes by but hearken and ill tell you wha he really is thats the scoundrel stroke  no wonder gavinia was flabbergasted wha are you then she cried  im the champion of dames he replied loftily and before she had recovered from this he was stalking mr mclean in the cemetery  miss kitty sleeps in a beautiful hollow called the basin but the stone put up to her memory hardly marks the spot now for with a score of others it was blown on its face by the wind that uprooted so many trees in the den and as it fell it lies from the basin to the rough road that clings like a belt to the round cemetery dyke is little more than a jump and shortly after miss kittys grave had been pointed out to him mr mclean was seen standing there hat in hand by a man on the road this man was dr mcqueen hobbling home from the forest muir he did not hobble as a rule but hobble everyone must on that misshapen brae except murdoch gelatley who being short in one leg elsewhere is here the only straight man mcqueens sharp eyes however picked out not only the stranger but tommy crouching behind haggarts stone and him did the doctors famous crook staff catch in the neck and whisk across the dyke  what man is that youre watching you mysterious loon mcqueen demanded curiously but of course tommy would not divulge so big a secret now the one weakness of this largehearted old bachelor perhaps it is a professional virtue was a devouring inquisitiveness and he would be troubled until he discovered who was the stranger standing in such obvious emotion by the side of an old grave well you must come back with me to the surgery for i want you to run an errand for me he said testily hoping to pump the boy by the way but tommy dived beneath his stick and escaped this rasped the doctors temper which was unfortunate for grizel whom he caught presently peeping in at his surgery window a dozen times of late she had wondered whether she should ask him to visit her mamma and though the painted lady had screamed in terror at the proposal being afraid of doctors grizel would have ventured ere now had it not been for her mistaken conviction that he was a hard man who would only flout her it had once come to her ears that he had said a woman like her mamma could demoralize a whole town with other harsh remarks doubtless exaggerated in the repetition and so he was the last man she dared think of going to for help when he should have been the first nevertheless she had come now and a soft word from him such as he gave most readily to all who were in distress would have drawn her pitiful tale from her but he was in a grumpy mood and had heard none of the rumors about her mothers being ill which indeed were only common among the monypenny children and his first words checked her confidences what are you hanging about my open window for he cried sharply  did you think i wanted to steal anything replied the indignant child  i wont say but what i had some such thait  she turned to leave him but he hooked her with his staff as youre here he said will you go an errand for me  no she told him promptly i dont like you  theres no love lost between us he replied for i think youre the dourest lassie i ever clapped eyes on but theres no other litlin handy so you must do as you are bid and take this bottle to ballingalls  is it a medicine bottle she asked with sudden interest  yes its medicine do you know ballingalls house in the west town end  ballingall who has the little school  the same but i doubt hell keep school no longer  is he dying  im afraid theres no doubt of it will you go  i should love to go she cried  love he echoed looking at her with displeasure you cant love to go so talk no more nonsense but go and ill give you a bawbee  i dont want a bawbee she said do you think they will let me go in to see ballingall  the doctor frowned what makes you want to see a dying man he demanded  i should just love to see him she exclaimed and she added determinedly i wont give up the bottle until they let me in  he thought her an unpleasant morbid girl but that is no affair of mine he said shrugging his shoulders and he gave her the bottle to deliver before taking it to ballingalls however she committed a little crime she bought an empty bottle at the sosh and poured into it some of the contents of the medicine bottle which she then filled up with water she dared try no other way now of getting medicine for her mother and was too ignorant to know that there are different drugs for different ailments  grizel not only contrived to get in to see ballingan but stayed by his side for several hours and when she came out it was nighttime on her way home she saw a light moving in the den where she had expected to play no more and she could not prevent her legs from running joyously toward it so when corp rising out of the darkness deftly cut her throat she was not so angry as she should have been  im so glad we are to play again after all corp she said but he replied grandly thou little kennest wha youre speaking to my gentle jade  he gave a curious hitch to his breeches but it only puzzled her i wear gallowses no more he explained lifting his waistcoat to show that his braces now encircled him as a belt but even then she did not understand know then said corp sternly i am ben the boatswain  and am i not the lady griselda any more she asked  im no sure he confessed but if you are theres a price on your head  what is tommy  i dinna ken yet but gavinia says he telled her hes champion of damns i kenna what elspethll say to that  grizel was starting for the lair but he caught her by the skirt  is he not at the lair she inquired  we knowest it not he answered gravely were looking fort he added with some awe weve been looking fort this three year then in a louder voice if you can guide us to it my pretty trifle youll be richly rewarded  but where is he dont you know  fine i knowest but it wouldna be mous to tell you for i kenna whether you be friend or foe whats that youre carrying  it is aa medicine bottle  gie me a sook  no  just one begged corp and ill tell you where he is  he got his way and smacked his lips unctuously  now where is tommy  put your face close to mine said corp and then he whispered hoarsely hes in a spleet new lair writing out bills wi a his might offering five hunder crowns reward for strokes head dead or alive                                       the new haunt was a deserted house that stood very damp near a little waterfall to the east of the den bits of it well planted in the marsh adhere doggedly together to this day but even then the roof was off and the chimney lay in a heap on the ground like blankets that have slipped off a bed  this was the good ship ailie lying at anchor manofwar thirty guns a cartwheel to steer it by t sandys commander  on the following saturday ben the boatswain piped all hands and mr sandys delivered a speech of the bluff straightforward kind that sailors love here unfortunately it must be condensed he reminded them that three years had passed since their gracious queen cheers sent them into these seas to hunt down the pretender hisses their ship had been christened the ailie because its object was to avenge the insults offered by the pretender to a lady of that name for whom everyone of them would willingly die like all his race the pretender or stroke as he called himself was a torment to single women he had not only stolen all this ladys wealth but now he wanted to make her walk the plank a way of getting rid of enemies the mere mention of which set the blood of all honest men boiling cheers as yet they had not succeeded in finding strokes lair though they knew it to be in one of the adjoining islands but they had suffered many privations twice their gallant vessel had been burned to the waters edge once she had been sunk once blown into the air but had that dismayed them  here the boatswain sent round a whisper and they all cried loyally ay ay sir  he had now news for them that would warm their hearts like grog he had not discovered the lair but he had seen stroke he had spoken to him disguised as a boy he had tracked the jacobite and found him skulking in the house of the unhappy ailie after blustering for a little stroke had gone on his knees and offered not only to cease persecuting this lady but to return to france mr sandys had kicked him into a standing posture and then left him but this clemency had been ill repaid stroke had not returned to france he was staying at the quharity arms a thrums inn where he called himself mclean it had gone through the town like wildfire that he had written to someone in redlintie to send him on another suit of clothes and four dickies no one suspected his real character but all noted that he went to the unhappy ailies house daily and there was a town about it ailie was but a woman and women could not defend themselves boatswain put grizel in irons if she opens her mouth and so the poor thing had been forced to speak to him and even to go walks with him her life was in danger and before now mr sandys would have taken him prisoner but the queen had said these words noble sandys destroy the lair and the best way to discover this horrid spot was to follow stroke night and day until he went to it then they would burn it to the ground put him on board the ailie up with the jibboom sail and away to the tower of london  at the words tower of london ben cried tumble up there which was the signal for three such ringing cheers as only british tars are capable of three to be exact only two and a half for the third stopped in the middle as if the lid had suddenly been put on  what so startled them was the unexpected appearance in their midst of the very man tommy had been talking of taking a stroll through the den mr mclean had been drawn toward the ruin by the first cheers and had arrived in time to learn who and what he really was  stroke gasped one small voice  the presumptuous man folded his arms so sandys he said in hollow tones we meet again  even grizel got behind tommy and perhaps it was this that gave him spunk to say tremulously whwhat are you doing her  i have come replied the ruddy pretender to defy you ay proud sandys to challenge thee to the deed thou pratest of i go from here to my lair follow me if thou darest  he brought his hand down with a bang upon the barrel laughed disdainfully and springing over the vessels side was at once lost in the darkness instead of following all stood transfixed gazing at the barrel on which lay five shillings  he put them there when he slammed it  losh behears theres a shilling to ilka ane o us  i winna touch the siller said sandys moodily  what cried gavinia  i tell you its a bribe  do you hear him screamed gavinia he says were no to lay hands ont corp wheres your tongue  but even in that trying moment corps trust in tommy shone out beautiful and strong dinna be feared gavinia he whispered hell find a wy  lights out and follow stroke was the order and the crew at once scattered in pursuit mr sandys remaining behind a moment toto put something in his pocket  mr mclean gave them a long chase walking demurely when lovers were in sight but at other times doubling jumping even standing on eminences and crowing insultingly like a cock and not until he had only breath left to chuckle did the stout man vanish from the den elspeth now a cabinboy was so shaken by the realism of the nights adventures that gavinia able seaman took her home and when mr sandys and his boatswain met at the cuttle well neither could tell where grizel was  she had no business to munt without my leave tommy said sulkily  no she hadna is she the lady griselda yet  not her shes the commanders wife  ben shook his head for this he felt was the one thing tommy could not do well then growled tommy if she winna be that shell have to serve before the mast for i tell you plain ill have no single women on board  and what am i forby ben the boatswain  nothing honest men has just one name  what im just one single man corp was a little crestfallen its a come down he said with a sigh mind i dinna grumble but its a come down  and you dinna have methinks now either tommy announced pitilessly  corp had dreaded this ill be gey an lonely without it he said with some dignity and it was the usefulest swear i kent o methinks i used to roar at mason malcolms collie and the crittur came in ahint in a swite o fear losh tommy is that you blooding  there was indeed an ugly gash on tommys hand youve been hacking at yoursel again said the distressed corp who knew that in his enthusiasm tommy had more than once drawn blood from himself when you take it a so real as that he said uncomfortably i near think we should give it up  tommy stamped his foot take tent o yoursel he cried threateningly when i was tracking stroke i fell in with one of his men and we had a tussle he pinked me in the hand but tis only a scratch bah he was carrying treasure and i took it from him  ben whistled five shillings he asked slapping his knee  how did you know demanded tommy frowning and then they tried to stare each other down  i thought i saw you pouching it corp ventured to say  boatswain  i mean explained corp hurriedly i mean that i kent you would find a wy didest thou kill the jacobite rebel  he lies but a few paces off replied tommy and already the vultures are picking his bones  so perish all victorias enemies said ben the boatswain loyally but a sudden fear made him add with a complete change of voice you dinna chance to ken his name  ay i had marked him before answered tommy he was called corp of corp  ben the boatswain rose sat down rose again tommy he said wiping his brow with his sleeve come awa hame     chapter xxvii  the longer catechism   in the meantime mr mclean was walking slowly to the quharity arms fanning his face with his hat and in the west town end he came upon some boys who had gathered with offensive cries round a girl in a lustre jacket a wave of his stick put them to flight but the girl only thanked him with a look and entered a little house the window of which showed a brighter light than its neighbors dr mcqueen came out of this house a moment afterwards and as the two men now knew each other slightly they walked home together mclean relating humorously how he had spent the evening and though commander sandys means to incarcerate me in the tower of london he said he did me a good service the other day and i feel an interest in him  what did the inventive sacket do the doctor asked inquisitively but mclean who had referred to the incident of the passbook affected not to hear miss ailie has told me his history he said and that he goes to the university next year  or to the herding put in mcqueen dryly  yes i heard that was the alternative but he should easily carry a bursary he is a remarkable boy  ay but im no sure that its the remarkable boys who carry the bursaries however if you have taken a fancy to him you should hear what mr cathro has to say on the subject for my own part i have been more taken up with one of his band lately than with himselfa lassie too  she who went into that house just before you came out  the same and she is the most puzzling bit of womankind i ever fell in with  she looked an ordinary girl enough said mr mclean  the doctor chuckled man he said in my time i have met all kinds of women except ordinary ones what would you think if i told you that this ordinary girl had been spending three or four hours daily in that house entirely because there was a man dying in it  some one she had an affection for  my certie no im afraid it is long since anybody had an affection for shilpit hirpling old ballingall and as for this lassie grizel she had never spoken to him until i sent her on an errand to his house a week ago he was a single man like you and me without womenfolk a schoolmaster of his own making and in the smallest way and his one attraction to her was that he was on his deathbed most lassies of her age skirl to get away from the presence of death but she prigged sir fairly prigged to get into it  ah i prefer less uncommon girls mclean said they should not have let her have her wish it can only do her harm  that is another curious thing replied the doctor it does not seem to have done her harm rather it has turned her from being a dour silent crittur into a talkative one and that i take it is a sign of grace  he sighed and added not that i can get her to talk of herself and her mother there is a mystery about them you understand no the obstinate brat will tell me nothing on that subject instead of answering my questions she asks questions of mean endless rush of questions and all about ballingall how did i know he was dying when you put your fingers on their wrist what is it you count which is the place where the lungs are when you tap their chest what do you listen for are they not dying as long as they can rise now and then and dress and go out when they are really dying do they always know it themselves if they dont know it is that a sign that they are not so ill as you think them when they dont know they are dying is it best to keep it from them in case they should scream with terror and so on in a spate of questions till i called her the longer catechism  and only morbid curiosity prompted her  nothing else said the confident doctor if there had been anything else i should have found it out you may be sure however unhealthily minded though she be the women who took their turn at ballingalls bedside were glad of her help  the more shame to them mclean remarked warmly but the doctor would let no one save himself miscall the women of thrums  ca canny he retorted the women of this place are as overdriven as the men from the day they have the strength to turn a pirnwheel to the day they crawl over their bedboard for the last time but never yet have i said i need one of you to sit up all night wi an unweel body but what there were half a dozen willing to do it they are a grand race sir and will remain so till they find it out themselves  but of what use could a girl of twelve or fourteen be to them  use mcqueen cried man she has been simply a treasure and but for one thing i would believe it was less a morbid mind than a sort of divine instinct for nursing that took her to ballingalls bedside the women do their best in a rough and ready way but sir it cowed to see that lassie easying a pillow for ballingalls head or changing a sheet without letting in the air or getting a poultice on his back without disturbing the one on his chest i had just to let her see how to do these things once and after that ballingall complained if any other soul touched him  ah said mclean then perhaps i was uncharitable and the nurses instinct is the true explanation  no youre wrong again though i might have been taken in as well as you but for the one thing i spoke of three days ago ballingall had a ghost of a chance of pulling through i thought and i told the lassie that if he did the credit would be mainly hers youll scarcely believe it but upon my word she looked disappointed rather than pleased and she said to me quite reproachfully you told me he was sure to die what do you make of that  it sounds unnatural  it does and so does what followed do you know what straiking is  arraying the corpse for the coffin laying it out in short is it not  ay ay well it appears that grizel had prigged with the women to let her be present at ballingalls straiking and they had refused  i should think so exclaimed mcqueen with a shudder  but thats not all she came to me in her difficulty and said that if i didna promise her this privilege she would nurse ballingall no more  ugh that shows at least that pity for him had not influenced her  no she cared not a doit for him i question if shes the kind that could care for anyone its plain by her thrawn look when you speak to her about her mother that she has no affection even for her however there she was prepared to leave ballingall to his fate if i did not grant her request and i had to yield to her  you promised  i did sore against the grain but i accept the responsibility you are pained but you dont know what a good nurse means to a doctor  well  well he died after all and the straiking is going on now you saw her go in  i think you could have been excused for breaking your word and turning her out  to tell the truth said the doctor i had the same idea when i saw her enter and i tried to shoo her to the door but she cried you promised you cant break a promise and the morbid brat that she is looked so horrified at the very notion of anybodys breaking a promise that i slunk away as if she had right on her side  no wonder the little monster is unpopular was mcleans comment the children hereabout seem to take to her as little as i do for i had to drive away some who were molesting her i am sorry i interfered now  i can tell you why they tnead her replied the doctor and he repeated the little that was known in thrums of the painted lady and you see the womenfolk are mad because they can find out so little about her where she got her money for instance and who are the gentlemen that are said to visit her at double dykes they have tried many ways of drawing grizel from heckle biscuits and parlies to a slap in the face but neither by coaxing nor squeezing will you get an egg out of a sweer hen and so they found the dour little limmer they say stalking about wi all her blinds down and they are slow to interfere when their laddies call her names its a pity for herself that shes not more communicative for if she would just satisfy the womens curiosity she would find them full of kindness a terrible thing mr mclean is curiosity the bible says that the love of money is the root of all evil but we must ask mr dishart if love of money is not a misprint for curiosity and you wont find men boring their way into other folks concerns it is a womans failing essentially a womans this was the doctors pet topic and he pursued it until they had to part he had opened his door and was about to enter when he saw gavinia passing on her way home from the den  come here my lass he called to her and then said inquisitively im told mr mclean is at his tea with miss ailie every day  and its true replied gavinia in huge delight and whats more she has given him some presents  you say so lassie what were they now  i dinna ken gavinia had to admit dejectedly she took them out o the ottoman and it has aye been kept looked  mcqueen looked very knowingly at her will he think you he asked mysteriously  the maid seemed to understand for she replied promptly i hope he will  but he hasna spiered her as yet you think  no she said no but he calls her ailie and wi the gentry its but one loup frae that to spiering  maybe answered the doctor but its a loup they often bogle at ise uphaud hes close on fifty gavinia  theres no denying he is by his best she said regretfully and then added with spirit but miss ailies no heavy and in thae grite arms o his he could daidle her as if she were an infant  this bewildered mcqueen and he asked what are you blethering about gavinia to which she replied regally wha carries me wears me the doctor concluded that it must be den language  and i hope hes good enough for her continued miss ailies warmhearted maid for she deserves a good ane  she does mcqueen agreed heartily ay and i believe he is for he breathes through his nose instead of through his mouth and let me tell you gavinia thats the one thing to be sure of in a man before you take him for better or worse  the astounded maid replied ill ken better things than that about my lad afore i take him but the doctor assured her that it was the box which held them all though you maun tell no one lassie for its my one discovery in five and thirty years of practice  seeing that despite his bantering tone he was speaking seriously she pressed him for his meaning but he only replied sadly youre like the rest gavinia i see it breaking out on you in spots  an illness she cried in alarm  ay lassie an illness called curiosity i had just been telling mr mclean that curiosity is essentially a womans ailment and up you come ahint to prove it he shook a finger at her reprovingly and was probably still reflecting on womans ways when grizel walked home at midnight breathing through her nose and tommy fell asleep with his mouth open for tommy could never have stood the doctors test of a man in the painting of him aged twentyfour which was exhibited in the royal academy his lips meet firmly but no one knew save himself how he gasped after each sitting     chapter xxviii  but it should have been miss kitty   the ottoman whence as gavinia said miss ailie produced the presents she gave to mr mclean stood near the door of the blueandwhite room with a reel of thread between to keep them apart forever except on washing days it was of a genteel appearance for though but a wooden kist it had a gay outer garment with frills which gavinia starched and beneath this was apparel of a private character that tied with tapes when miss ailie pins in her mouth was on her knees arraying the ottoman it might almost have been mistaken for a female child  the contents of the ottoman were a few trivial articles sewn or knitted by miss kitty during her last illness just to keep me out of languor she would explain wistfully to her sister she never told miss ailie that they were intended for any special person on the contrary she said perhaps you may find someone they will be useful to but almost without her knowing it they always grew into something that would be useful to ivie mclean  the remarkable thing is that they are an exact fit the man said about the slippers and miss ailie nodded but she did not think it remarkable  there were also two fluffy little bags and miss ailie had to explain their use if you put your feet into them in bed she faltered theythey keep you warm  mclean turned hastily to something else a smokingcap i scarcely think this can have been meant for me he said you have forgotten how she used to chide me for smoking  miss ailie had not forgotten but in a way she replied flushing a little wethat is kittycould not help admiring you for smoking there is something soso dashing about it  i was little worthy all the friendship you two gave me ailie he told her humbly and he was nearly saying something to her then that he had made up his mind to say the time came a few days later they had been walking together on the hill and on their return to the dovecot he had insisted in his old imperious way on coming in to tea hearing talking in the kitchen miss ailie went along the passage to discover what company her maid kept but before she reached the door which was ajar she turned as if she had heard something dreadful and hurried upstairs signing to mr mclean with imploring eyes to follow her this at once sent him to the kitchen door  gavinia was alone she was standing in the middle of the floor with one arm crooked as if making believe that anothers arm rested on it and over her head was a little muslin windowblind representing a brides veil thus she was two persons but she was also a third who addressed them in clerical tones  ivie mclean she said as solemnly as tho she were the rev mr dishart do you take this woman to be thy lawful wedded wife with almost indecent haste she answered herself i do  alison cray she said next do you take this man to be thy lawful wedded husband i do  just then the door shut softly and gavinia ran to see who had been listening with the result that she hid herself in the coalcellar  while she was there miss ailie and mr mclean were sitting in the blueandwhite room very selfconscious and miss ailie was speaking confusedly of anything and everything saying more in five minutes than had served for the previous hour and always as she slackened she read an intention in his face that started her tongue upon another journey but timid ailie he said at last do you think you can talk me down and then she gave him a look of reproach that turned treacherously into one of appeal but he had the hardihood to continue ailie do you need to be told what i want to say  miss ailie stood quite still now a stiff thick figure with a soft plain face and nervous hands before you speak she said nervously i have something to tell you thatperhaps then you will not say it  i have always led you to believe she began trembling that i am fortynine i am fiftyone  he would have spoken but the look of appeal came back to her face asking him to make it easier for her by saying nothing she took a pair of spectacles from her pocket and he divined what this meant before she spoke i have avoided letting you see that i need them she said youmen dont like she tried to say it all in a rush but the words would not come  i am beginning to be a little deaf she went on to deceive you about that i have sometimes answered you without really knowing what you said  anything more ailie  my accomplishmentsthey were never great but kitty and i thought my playing of classical piecesmy fingers are not sufficiently pliable now and ii forget so many things  but ailie  please let me tell you i was reading a book a story last winter and one of the characters an old maid was held up to ridicule in it for many little peculiarities thatthat i recognized as my own they had grown upon me without my knowing that they made me ridiculous and now ii have tried but i cannot alter them  is that all ailie  no  the last seemed to be the hardest to say dusk had come on and they could not see each other well she asked him to light the lamp and his back was toward her while he did it wondering a little at her request when he turned her hands rose like cowards to hide her head but she pulled them down do you not see she said  i see that you have done something to your hair he answered i liked it best the other way  most people would have liked it best the other way there was still a good deal of it but the bun in which it ended had gone strangely small the rest was false said miss ailie with a painful effort at least it is my own but it came out whenwhen kitty died  she stopped but he was silent that is all now she said softly and she waited for him to speak if he chose he turned his head away sharply and miss ailie mistook his meaning if she gave one little sobwell it was but one and then all the glory of womanhood came rushing to her aid and it unfurled its flag over her whispering now sweet daughter now strike for me and she raised her head gallantly and for a moment in her life the old schoolmistress was a queen i shall ring for tea she said quietly and without a tremor do you think there is anything so refreshing after a walk as a dish of tea  she rang the bell but its tinkle only made gavinia secede farther into the cellar and that summons has not been answered to this day and no one seems to care for while the wires were still vibrating mr mclean had asked miss ailie to forgive him and marry him  miss ailie said she would but oh she cried ten years ago it might have been my kitty i would that it had been kitty  miss ailie was dear to him now and ten years is a long time and men are vain mr mclean replied quite honestly i am not sure that i did not always like you best but that hurt her and he had to unsay the words  i was a thoughtless fool ten years ago he said bitterly and miss ailies answer came strangely from such timid lips yes you were she exclaimed passionately and all the wrath long pent up with very different feelings in her gentle bosom against the man who should have adored her kitty leapt at that reproachful cry to her mouth and eyes and so passed out of her forever     chapter xxix  tommy the scholar   so miss ailie could be brave but what a poltroon she was also three calls did she make on dear friends ostensibly to ask how a cold was or to instruct them in a new device in shetland wool but really to announce that she did not propose keeping school after the end of the termbecausein short mr ivie mclean and shethat is heand so on but though she had planned it all out so carefully with at least three capital ways of leading up to it and knew precisely what they would say and pined to hear them say it on each occasion shyness conquered and she came away with the words unspoken how she despised herself and how mr mclean laughed he wanted to take the job off her hands by telling the news to dr mcqueen who could be depended on to spread it through the town and miss ailie discovered with horror that his simple plan was to say how are you doctor i just looked in to tell you that miss ailie and i are to be married good afternoon the audacity of this captivated miss ailie even while it outraged her sense of decency to redlintie went mr mclean and returning next day drew from his pocket something which he put on miss ailies finger and then she had the idea of taking off her left glove in church which would have announced her engagement as loudly as though mr dishart had included it in his pulpit intimations religion however stopped her when she had got the little finger out and the misses finlayson who sat behind and knew she had an itchy something inside her glove concluded that it was her threepenny for the plate as for gavinia like others of her class in those days she had never heard of engagement rings and so it really seemed as if mr mclean must call on the doctor after all but no said he i hit upon a better notion today in the den and to explain this notion he produced from his pocket a large vulgar bottle which shocked miss ailie and indeed that bottle had not passed through the streets uncommented on  mr mclean having observed this bottle afloat on the silent pool had fished it out with his stick and its contents set him chuckling they consisted of a sheet of paper which stated that the bottle was being flung into the sea in lat 20 long 40 by t sandys commander of the ailie then among the breakers sandys had little hope of weathering the gale but he was indifferent to his own fate so long as his enemy did not escape and he called upon whatsoever loyal subjects of the queen should find this document to sail at once to lat 20 long 40 and there cruise till they had captured the pretender alias stroke and destroyed his lair a somewhat unfavorable personal description of stroke was appended with a map of the coast and a stern warning to all loyal subjects not to delay as one ailie was in the villains hands and he might kill her any day victoria regina would give five hundred pounds for his head the letter ended in manly style with the writers sending an affecting farewell message to his wife and little children  and so while we are playing ourselves said mr mclean to miss ailie your favorite is seeking my blood  our favorite interposed the schoolmistress and he accepted the correction for neither of them could forget that their present relations might have been very different had it not been for tommys faith in the passbook the boy had shown a knowledge of the human heart in miss ailies opinion that was simply wonderful inspiration she called it and though ivie thought it a happy accident he did not call it so to her tommys father had been the instrument in bringing these two together originally and now tommy had brought them together again there was fate in it and if the boy was of the right stuff mclean meant to reward him  i see now he said to miss ailie a way of getting rid of our fearsome secret and making my peace with sandys at one fell blow he declined to tell her more but presently he sought gavinia who dreaded him nowadays because of his disconcerting way of looking at her inquiringly and saying i do  you dont happen to know gavinia he asked whether the good ship ailie weathered the gale of the 15th instant if it did he went on commander sandys will learn something to his advantage from a bottle that is to be cast into the ocean this evening  gavinia thought she heard the chink of another five shillings and her mouth opened so wide that a chaffinch could have built therein is he to look for a bottle in the pond she asked eagerly  i do replied mclean with such solemnity that she again retired to the coalcellar  that evening mr mclean cast a bottle into the silent pool and subsequently called on mr cathro to whom he introduced himself as one interested in master thomas sandys he was heartily received but at the name of tommy cathro heaved a sigh that could not pass unnoticed i see you dont find him an angel said mr mclean politely  deed sir there are times when i wish he was an angel the dominie replied so viciously that mclean laughed and i grudge you that laugh continued cathro for your tommy sandys has taken from me the most precious possession a teacher can havemy sense of humor  he strikes me as having a considerable sense of humor himself  well he may mr mclean for he has gone off with all mine but bide a wee till i get in the tumblers and ill tell you the latest about himif what you want to hear is just the plain exasperating truth  his humor that you spoke of resumed the schoolmaster presently addressing his words to the visitor and his mind to a toddy ladle of horn is ill to endure in a school where the understanding is that the dominie makes all the jokes except on examinationday when the ministers get their yearly fling but i think i like your young friend worst when he is deadly serious he is constantly playing some new partplaying is hardly the word though for into each part he puts an earnestness that cheats even himself until he takes to another i suppose you want me to give you some idea of his character and i could tell you what it is at any particular moment but it changes sir i do assure you almost as quickly as the circusrider flings off his layers of waistcoats a single puff of wind blows him from one character to another and he may be noble and vicious and a tyrant and a slave and hard as granite and melting as butter in the sun all in one forenoon all you can be sure of is that whatever he is he will be it in excess  but i understood said mclean that at present he is solely engaged on a war of extermination in the den  ah those exploits i fancy are confined to saturday nights and unfortunately his saturday debauch does not keep him sober for the rest of the week which we demand of respectable characters in these parts for the last day or two for instance he has been in mourning  i had not heard of that  no i daresay not and ill give you the facts if youll fill your glass first but perhaps here the dominies eyes twinkled as if a gleam of humor had been left him after allperhaps you have been more used of late to ginger wine  the visitor received the shock impassively as if he did not know he had been hit and cathro proceeded with his narrative well for a day or two tommy sandys has been coming to the school in a black jacket with crape on the cuffs and not only so he has sat quiet and forlornlike at his desk as if he had lost some near and dear relative now i knew that he had not for his only relative is a sister whom you may have seen at the hanky school and both she and aaron latta are hearty yet sir and this shows the effect he has on me though i was puzzled and curious i dared not ask for an explanation  but why not was the visitors natural question  because sir he is such a mysterious little sacket replied cathro testily and so clever at leading you into a hole that its not chancey to meddle with him and i could see through the corner of my eye that for all this woeful face he was proud of it and hoped i was taking note for though sometimes his emotion masters him completely at other times he can step aside as it were and take an approving look at it that is a characteristic of him and not the least maddening one  but you solved the mystery somehow i suppose  i got at the truth today by an accident or rather my wife discovered it for me she happened to call in at the school on a domestic matter i need not trouble you with sal she needna have troubled me with it either and on her way up the yard she noticed a laddie called lewis doig playing with other ungodly youths at the game of kickbonnety lewiss father a gentleman farmer was buried jimply a fortnight since and such want of respect for his memory made my wife give the loon a dunt on the head with a pound of sugar which she had just bought at the sosh he turned on her ready to scart or spit or run as seemed wisest and in a klink her womans eye saw what mine had overlooked that he was not even wearing a black jacket well she told him what the slap was for and his little countenance cleared at once oh says he thats all right tommy and me has arranged it and he pointed blithely to a corner of the yard where tommy was hunkering by himself in lewiss jacket and wiping his mournful eyes with lewiss hanky i daresay you can jalouse the rest but i kept lewis behind after the school skailed and got a full confession out of him he had tried hard he gave me to understand to mourn fittingly for his father but the kickbonnety season being on it was uphill work and he was relieved when tommy volunteered to take it off his hands tommys offer was to swop jackets every morning for a week or two and thus properly attired to do the mourning for him  the dominie paused and regarded his guest quizzically sir he said at length laddies are a queer growth i assure you there was no persuading lewis that it was not a right and honorable compact  and what payment asked mclean laughing did tommy demand from lewis for this service  not a farthing sirwhich gives another uncanny glint into his character when he wants money theres none so crafty at getting it but he did this for the pleasure of the thing or as he said to lewis to feel what it would be like that i tell you is the nature of the sacket he has a devouring desire to try on other folks feelings as if they were so many suits of clothes  and from your account he makes them fit him too  my certie he does and a lippie in the bonnet more than that  so far the schoolmaster had spoken frankly even with an occasional grin at his own expense but his words came reluctantly when he had to speak of tommys prospects at the bursary examinations i would rather say nothing on that head he said almost coaxingly for the laddie has a year to reform in yet and its never safe to prophesy  still i should have thought that you could guess pretty accurately how the boys you mean to send up in a years time are likely to do you have had a long experience and i am told a glorious one  deed theres no denying it answered the dominie with a pride he had won the right to wear if all the ministers for instance i have turned out in this bit school were to come back together they could hold the general assembly in the square  he lay back in his big chair a complacent dominie again guess the chances of my laddies he cried forgetting what he had just said and that there was a tommy to bother him i tell you sir thats a matter on which im never deceived i can tell the results so accurately that a wise senatus would give my lot the bursaries i say theyll carry without setting them down to examinationpapers at all and for the next halfhour he was reciting cases in proof of his sagacity  wonderful chimed in mclean i see it is evident you can tell me how tommy sandys will do but at that cathros rush of words again subsided into a dribble  hes the worst latinist that ever had the impudence to think of bursaries he groaned  and his greek asked mclean helping on the conversation as far as possible  his greek sir could be packed in a pillbox  that does not sound promising but the best mathematicians are sometimes the worst linguists  his greek is better than his mathematics said cathro and he fell into lamentation i have had no luck lately he sighed the laddies i have to prepare for college are secondraters and the vexing thing is that when a real scholar is reared in thrums instead of his being handed over to me for the finishing they send him to mr ogilvy in glenquharity did miss ailie ever mention gavin dishart to youthe ministers son i just craved to get the teaching of that laddie he was the kind you can cram with learning till theres no room left for another spoonful and they bude send him to mr ogilvy and youll see hell stand high above my loons in the bursary list and then ogilvy will put on sic airs that there will be no enduring him ogilvy and i sir we are engaged in an everlasting duel when we send students to the examinations it is we two who are the real competitors but what chance have i when he is represented by a gavin dishart and my man is tommy sandys  mclean was greatly disappointed why send tommy up at all if he is so backward he said you are sure you have not exaggerated his deficiencies  well not much at any rate but he baffles me one day i think him a perfect numskull and the next he makes such a show of the small drop of scholarship he has that im not sure but what he may be a genius  that sounds better does he study hard  study he is the most careless whelp that ever  but if i were to give him an inducement to study  such as asked cathro who could at times be as inquisitive as the doctor  we need not go into that but suppose it appealed to him  cathro considered to be candid he said i dont think he could study in the big meaning of the word i daresay im wrong but i have a feeling that whatever knowledge that boy acquires he will dig out of himself there is something inside him or so i think at times that is his master and rebels against booklearning no i cant tell what it is when we know that we shall know the real tommy  and yet said mclean curiously you advise his being allowed to compete for a bursary that if you will excuse my saying so sounds foolish to me  it cant seem so foolish to you replied cathro scratching his head as it seems to me six days in seven  and you know that aaron latta has sworn to send him to the herding if he does not carry a bursary surely the wisest course would be to apprentice him now to some trade  what trade would not be the worse of him he would cut off his fingers with a joiners saw and smash them with a masons mell put him in a brot behind a counter and in some grand magnanimous mood he would sell off his masters things for nothing make a clerk of him and he would only ravel the figures send him to the soldiering and he would have a sudden impulse to fight on the wrong side no no miss ailie says he has a gift for the ministry and we must cling to that  in thus sheltering himself behind miss ailie where he had never skulked before the dominie showed how weak he thought his position and he added with a brazen laugh then if he does distinguish himself at the examinations i can take the credit for it and if he comes back in disgrace i shall call you to witness that i only sent him to them at her instigation  all which maintained mclean as he put on his topcoat means that somehow against your better judgment you think he may distinguish himself after all  youve found me out answered cathro half relieved half sorry i had no intention of telling you so much but as you have found me out ill make a clean breast of it unless something unexpected happens to the laddieunless he take to playing at scholarship as if it were a jacobite rebellion for instancehe shouldna have the ghost of a chance of a bursary and if he were any other boy as illprepared i should be ashamed to send him up but he is tommy sandys you see andit is a terrible thing to say but its gospel truth its gospel truthim trusting to the possibility of his diddling the examiners  it was a startling confession for a conscientious dominie and cathro flung out his hands as if to withdraw the words but his visitor would have no tampering with them so that sums up tommy so far as you know him he said as he bade his host goodnight  it does cathro admitted grimly but if what you wanted was a written certificate of character i should like to add this that never did any boy sit on my forms whom i had such a pleasure in thrashing     chapter xxx  end of the jacobite rising   in the small hours of the following night the pulse of thrums stopped for a moment and then went on again but the only watcher remained silent and the people rose in the morning without knowing that they had lost one of their number while they slept in the same ignorance they toiled through a long day  it was a close october day in the end of a summer that had lingered to give the countryside nothing better than a second crop of haws beneath the beeches leaves lay in yellow heaps like sliced turnip and over all the strath was a pink haze the fields were singed brown except where a recent ploughing gave them a mourning border from early morn men women and children tommy among them were in the fields taking up their potatoes halfadozen gatherers at first to every drill and by noon it seemed a dozen though the newcomers were but stout sacks now able to stand alone by and by heavyladen carts were trailing into thrums dogtired toilers hanging on behind not to be dragged but for an incentive to keep them trudging boys and girls falling asleep on top of the load and so neglecting to enjoy the ride which was their recompense for lifting a growing mist mixed with the daylight and still there were a few people out falling over their feet with fatigue it took silent possession and then the shadowy forms left in the fields were motionless and would remain there until carted to garrets and kitchen corners and other winter quarters on monday morning there were few gadabouts that saturday night washings were not brought in though mr dishart had preached against the unseemly sight of linen hanging on the line on the sabbathday innes stravaiging the square and wynds in his applecart jingled his weights in vain unable to shake even moneyed children off their stools and when at last he told his beast to go home they took with them all the stir of the town family exercise came on early in many houses and as the gude wife handed her man the bible she said entreatingly a short ane after that one might have said that no earthly knock could bring them to their doors yet within an hour the town was in a ferment  when tommy and elspeth reached the den the mist lay so thick that they had to feel their way through it to the ailie where they found gavinia alone and scared was you peeping in trying to fleg me twa three minutes syne she asked eagerly and when they shook their heads she looked cold with fear  as sure as death she said there was some living thing standing there i couldna see it for the rime but i heard it breathing hard  tommy felt elspeths hand begin to tremble and he said mclean hastily though he knew that mclean had not yet left the quharity arms next moment corp arrived with another story as unnerving  has grizel no come yet he asked in a troubled voice tommy hearken to this a light has been burning in double dykes and the door swinging open a day i saw it mysel and so did willum dods  did you go close  na faags willum was holing and i was lifting so we hadna time in the daylight and wha would venture near the painted ladys house on sic a night  even tommy felt uneasy but when gavinia cried theres something uncanny in being out the night tell us what was in mr mcleans bottle tommy and syne well run hame he became commander sandys again and replied blankly what bottle  the ane i warned you he was to fling into the water dinna dare tell me you hinna got it  i know not what thou art speaking about said tommy but its a queer thing its a queer thing gaviniahere he fixed her with his terrifying eyei happen to have found aanother bottle and still glaring at her he explained that he had found his bottle floating on the horizon it contained a letter to him which he now read aloud it was signed the villain stroke his mark and announced that the writer tired of this relentless persecution had determined to reform rather than be killed meet me at the cuttle well on saturday when the eightoclock bell is ringing he wrote and i shall there make you an offer for my freedom  the crew received this communication with shouts gavinias cry of five shillings if no ten expressing the general sentiment but it would not have been like tommy to think with them you poor things he said you just believe everything youre telled how do i know that this is not a trick of strokes to bring me here when he is some other gait working mischief  corp was impressed but gavinia said shortsightedly theres no sign ot  theres ower much sign ot retorted tommy whats this story about double dykes and how do we ken that there hasna been foul work there and this man at the bottom ot i tell you before the worlds half an hour older ill find out and he looked significantly at corp who answered quaking i winna gang by mysel no tommy i winna  so tommy had to accompany him saying valiantly im no feared and this rime is fine for hodding in to which corp replied as firmly neither am i and we can aye keep touching cauld iron before they were half way down the double dykes they got a thrill for they realized simultaneously that they were being followed they stopped and gripped each other hard but now they could hear nothing  the painted lady corp whispered  stroke tommy replied as cautiously he was excited rather than afraid and had the pluck to cry whas that i see youbut no answer came back through the mist and now the boys had a double reason for pressing forward  can you see the house corp  it should be here about but its smored in rime  im touching the paling i ken the road to the window now  hark whats that  it sounded like devils music in front of them and they fell back until corp remembered it maun be the door swinging open and squealing and moaning on its hinges tommy i take ill wi that what can it mean  im here to find out they reached the window where tommy had watched once before and looking in together saw the room plainly by the light of a lamp which stood on the spinet there was no one inside but otherwise tommy noticed little change the fire was out having evidently burned itself done the bedclothes were in some disorder to avoid the creaking door the boys passed round the back of the house to the window of the other room this room was without a light but its door stood open and sufficient light came from the kitchen to show that it also was untenanted it seemed to have been used as a lumberroom  the boys turned to go passing near the front of the empty house where they shivered and stopped mastered by a feeling they could not have explained the helpless door like the staring eyes of a dead person seemed to be calling to them to shut it and tommy was about to steal forward for this purpose when corp gripped him and whispered that the light had gone out it was true though tommy disbelieved until they had returned to the east window to make sure  there maun be folk in the hoose tommy  you saw it was toom the lamp had gone out itself or elsewhats that  it was the unmistakable closing of a door softly but firmly the wind has blown it to they tried to persuade themselves though aware that there was not sufficient wind for this after a long period of stillness they gathered courage to go to the door and shake it it was not only shut but locked  on their way back through the double dykes they were silent listening painfully but hearing nothing but when they reached the coffin brig tommy said dinna say nothing about this to elspeth it would terrify her he was always so thoughtful for elspeth  but what do you think ot a corp said imploringly  i winna tell you yet replied tommy cautiously  when they boarded the ailie where the two girls were very glad to see them again the eightoclock bell had begun to ring and thus tommy had a reasonable excuse for hurrying his crew to the cuttle well without saying anything of his expedition to double dykes save that he had not seen grizel at the well they had not long to wait before mr mclean suddenly appeared out of the mist and to their astonishment miss ailie was leaning on his arm she was blushing and smiling too in a way pretty to see though it spoilt the effect of strokes statement  the first thing stroke did was to give up his sword to tommy and to apologize for its being an umbrella on account of the unsettled state of the weather and then corp led three cheers the captain alone declining to join in for he had an uneasy feeling that he was being ridiculed  but i thought there were five of you mr mclean said where is the fifth  you ken best replied tommy sulkily and sulky he remained throughout the scene because he knew he was not the chief figure in it having this knowledge to depress him it is to his credit that he bore himself with dignity throughout keeping his crew so well in hand that they dared not give expression to their natural emotions  as you are aware mr sandys mclean began solemnly i have come here to sue for pardon it is not yours to give you reply the queen alone can pardon and i grant it but sir is it not well known to all of us that you can get anything out of her you like  tommys eyes roved suspiciously but the suppliant proceeded in the same tone what are my offences the first is that i have been bearing arms unwittingly against the throne the second that i have brought trouble to the lady by my side who has the proud privilege of calling you her friend but sandys such amends as can come from an erring man i now offer to make most contritely intercede with her majesty on my behalf and on my part i promise to war against her no more i am willing to settle down in the neighboring town as a lawabiding citizen whom you can watch with eagle eye say what more wouldst thou of the unhappy stuart  but tommy would say nothing he only looked doubtfully at miss ailie and that set mclean off again you ask what reparation i shall make to this lady sandys i tell thee that here also thou hast proved too strong for me in the hope that she would plead for me with you i have been driven to offer her my hand in marriage and she is willing to take me if thou grantest thy consent  at this gavinia jumped with joy and then cried up wi her words whose bearing the schoolmistress fortunately did not understand all save tommy looked at miss ailie and she put her arm on mr mcleans and yes it was obvious miss ailie was a lover at the cuttle well at last like so many others she had often said that the den parade was vulgar but she never said it again  it was unexpected news to tommy but that was not what lowered his head in humiliation now in the general rejoicing he had been nigh forgotten even elspeth was hanging on miss ailies skirts gavinia had eyes for none but lovers corp was rapturously examining five halfcrowns that had been dropped into his hands for distribution had tommy given an order now who would have obeyed it his power was gone his crew would not listen to another word against mr mclean  tommy thought mr mclean hated you said elspeth to miss ailie  it was queer you made sic a mistake said corp to tommy  oh the tattiedoolie cried gavinia  so they knew that mr mclean had only been speaking sarcastically of a sudden they saw through and despised their captain tears of mortification rose in tommys eyes and kindhearted miss ailie saw them and she thought it was her lovers irony that made him smart she had said little hitherto but now she put her hand on his shoulder and told them all that she did indeed owe the supreme joy that had come to her to him no gavinia she said blushing i will not give you the particulars but i assure you that had it not been for tommy mr mclean would never have asked me to marry him  elspeth crossed proudly to the side of her noble brother who could scarcely trust his ears and gavinia cried in wonder what did he do  now mclean had seen tommys tears also and being a kindly man he dropped the satirist and chimed in warmly and if i had not asked miss ailie to marry me i should have lost the great happiness of my life so you may all imagine how beholden i feel to tommy  again tommy was the centrepiece and though these words were as puzzling to him as to his crew their sincerity was unmistakable and once more his head began to waggle complacently  and to show how grateful we are said miss ailie we are to give him aa sort of marriage present we are to double the value of the bursary he wins at the university she could get no farther for now elspeth was hugging her and corp cheering frantically and mr mclean thought it necessary to add the warning if he does carry a bursary you understand for should he fail i give him nothing  him fail exclaimed corp with whom miss ailie of course agreed and he can spend the money in whatever way he chooses she said what will you do with it tommy  the lucky boy answered instantly ill take elspeth to aberdeen to bide with me and then elspeth hugged him and miss ailie said in a delighted aside to mr mclean i told you so and he too was well pleased  it was the one thing needed to make him work the schoolmistress whispered is not his love for his sister beautiful  mclean admitted that it was but halfbanteringly he said to elspeth what could you do in lodgings you excited mite  i can sit and look at tommy she answered quickly  but he will be away for hours at his classes  ill sit at the window waiting for him said she  and ill run back quick said tommy  all this time another problem had been bewildering gavinia and now she broke in eagerly but what was it he did i thought he was agin mr mclean  and so did i said corp  i cheated you grandly replied tommy with the audacity he found so useful  and a the time you was pretending to be agin him screamed gavinia was youwas you bringing this about on the sly  tommy looked up into mr mcleans face but could get no guidance from it so he said nothing he only held his head higher than ever oh the clever little curse cried corp and elspeths delight was as ecstatic though differently worded yet gavinia stuck to her problem how did you do it what was it you did and the cruel mclean said you may tell her tommy you have my permission  it would have been an awkward position for most boys and even tommybut next moment he said quite coolly i think you and me and miss ailie should keep it to oursels gavinias sic a gossip  oh how thoughtful of him cried miss ailie the deceived and mclean said how very thoughtful but now he saw in a flash why mr cathro still had hopes that tommy might carry a bursary  thus was the repentant mclean pardoned and nothing remained for him to do save to show the crew his lair which they had sworn to destroy he had behaved so splendidly that they had forgotten almost that they were the emissaries of justice but not to destroy the lair seemed a pity it would be such a striking way of bringing their adventures in the den to a close the degenerate stuart read this feeling in their faces and he was ready he said to show them his lair if they would first point it out to him but here was a difficulty for how could they do that for a moment it seemed as if the negotiations must fall through but sandys that captain of resource invited mclean to step aside for a private conference and when they rejoined the others mclean said gravely that he now remembered where the lair was and would guide them to it  they had only to cross a plank invisible in the mist until they were close to it and climb a slippery bank strewn with fallen trees mclean with a mock serious air led the way miss ailie on his arm corp and gavinia followed weighted and hampered by their new halfcrowns and tommy and elspeth in the rear whispered joyously of the coming life and so very unprepared for it they moved toward the tragedy of the night     chapter xxxi  a letter to god   do you keep a light burning in the lair mclean turned to ask forgetting for the moment that it was not their domicile but his  no theres no light replied corp equally forgetful but even as he spoke he stopped so suddenly that elspeth struck against him for he had seen a light this is queer he cried and both he and gavinia fell back in consternation mclean pushed forward alone and was back in a trice with a new expression on his face are you playing some trick on me he demanded suspiciously of tommy there is some one there i almost ran against a pair of blazing eyes  but theres nobody there can be nobody there answered tommy in a bewilderment that was obviously unfeigned unlessunless he looked at corp and the eyes of both finished the sentence the desolate scene at double dykes which the meeting with mclean and miss ailie had driven from their minds again confronted them and they seemed once more to hear the whimpering of the painted ladys door  unless what asked the man impatiently but still the two boys only stared at each other the dens no mous the night said corp at last in a low voice and his unspoken fears spread to the womankind so that miss ailie shuddered and elspeth gripped tommy with both hands and gavinia whispered lets away hame we can come back in the daylight  but mclean chafed and pressed upward and next moment a girls voice was heard crying it is no business of yours i wont let you touch her  grizel exclaimed tommy and his crew simultaneously and they had no more fear until they were inside the lair what they saw had best be described very briefly a fire was burning in a corner of the lair and in front of it partly covered with a sheet lay the painted lady dead grizel stood beside the body guarding it her hands clenched her eyes very strange you shant touch her she cried passionately and repeated it many times as if she had lost the power to leave off but corp crept past her and raised the coverlet  shes straikit he shouted did you do it yoursel grizel god behears she did it hersel  a very long silence it seemed to be after that  miss ailie would have taken the motherless girl to her arms but first at corps discovery she had drawn back in uncontrollable repulsion and grizel about to go to her saw it and turned from her to tommy her eyes rested on him beseechingly with a look he saw only once again in them until she was a woman but his first thought was not for grizel elspeth was clinging to him terrified and sobbing and he cried to her shut your een and then led her tenderly away he was always good to elspeth                                       there was no lack of sympathy with grizel when the news spread through the town and unshod men with their gallowses hanging down and women buttoning as they ran hurried to the den but to all the questions put to her and to all the kindly offers made as the body was carried to double dykes she only rocked her arms crying i dont want anything to eat i shall stay all night beside her i am not frightened at my mamma i wont tell you why she was in the den i am not sure how long she has been dead oh what do these little things matter  the great thing was that her mamma should be buried in the cemetery and not in unconsecrated ground with a stake through her as the boys had predicted and it was only after she was promised this that grizel told her little tale she had feared for a long time that her mamma was dying of consumption but she told no one because everybody was against her and her mamma her mamma never knew that she was dying and sometimes she used to get so much better that grizel hoped she would live a long time but that hope never lasted long the reason she sat so much with ballingall was just to find out what doctors did to dying people to make them live a little longer and she watched his straiking to be able to do it to her mamma when the time came she was sure none of the women would consent to straik her mamma on the previous night she could not say at what hour she had been awakened by a cold wind and so she knew that the door was open she put out her hand in the darkness and found that her mamma was not beside her it had happened before and she was not frightened she had hidden the key of the door that night and nailed down the window but her mamma had found the key grizel rose lit the lamp and having dressed hurriedly set off with wraps to the den her mamma was generally as sensible as anybody in thrums but sometimes she had shaking fits and after them she thought it was the time of long ago then she went to the den to meet a man who had promised she said to be there but he never came and before daybreak grizel could usually induce her to return home latterly she had persuaded her mamma to wait for him in the old lair because it was less cold there and she had got her to do this last night her mamma did not seem very unwell but she fell asleep and she died sleeping and then grizel went back to double dykes for linen and straiked her  some say in thrums that a spade was found in the lair but that is only the growth of later years grizel had done all she could do and through the long saturday she sat by the side of the body helpless and unable to cry she knew that it could not remain there much longer but every time she rose to go and confess fear of the indignities to which the body of her darling mamma might be subjected pulled her back the boys had spoken idly but hunted grizel who knew so much less and so much more than any of them believed it all  it was she who had stood so near gavinia in the ruined house she had only gone there to listen to human voices when she discovered from the talk of her friends that she had left a light burning at double dykes and the door open fear of the suspicions this might give rise to had sent her to the house on the heels of the two boys and it was she who had stolen past them in the mist to put out the light and lock the door then she had returned to her mammas side  the doctor was among the listeners almost the only dryeyed one but he was not dryeyed because he felt the artless story least again and again he rose from his chair restlessly and grizel thought he scowled at her when he was really scowling at himself as soon as she had finished he cleared the room brusquely of all intruders and then he turned on her passionately  think shame of yoursel he thundered for keeping me in the dark and of course she took his words literally though their full meaning was i shall scorn myself from this hour for not having won the poor childs confidence  oh he was a hard man grizel thought the hardest of them all but she was used to standing up to hard men and she answered defiantly i did mean to tell you that day you sent me with the bottle to ballingall i was waiting at the surgery door to tell you but you were cruel you said i was a thief and then how could i tell you  this too struck home and the doctor winced but what he said was you fooled me for a whole week and the town knows it do you think i can forgive you for that  i dont care whether you forgive me replied grizel at once  nor do i care whether you care he rapped out all the time wishing he could strike himself but im the doctor of this place and when your mother was ill you should have come straight to me what had i done that you should be afraid of me  i am not afraid of you she replied i am not afraid of anyone but mamma was afraid of you because she knew you had said cruel things about her and i thoughti wont tell you what i thought but with a little pressing she changed her mind and told him i was not sure whether you would come to see her though i asked you and if you came i knew you would tell her she was dying and that would have made her scream and that is not all i thought you might tell her that she would be buried with a stake through her  oh these blackguard laddies cried mcqueen clenching his fists  and so i dared not tell you grizel concluded calmly i am not frightened at you but i was frightened you would hurt my dear darling mamma and she went and stood defiantly between him and her mother  the doctor moved up and down the room crying how did i not know of this why was i not told and he knew that the fault had been his own and so was furious when grizel told him so  yes it is she insisted you knew mamma was an unhappy lady and that the people shouted things against her and terrified her and you must have known for everybody knew that she was sometimes silly and wandered about all night and you are a big strong man and so you should have been sorry for her and if you had been sorry you would have come to see her and been kind to her and then you would have found it all out  have done lassie he said half angrily half beseechingly but she did not understand that he was suffering and she went on relentlessly and you knew that bad men used to come to see her at nightthey have not come for a long timebut you never tried to stop their coming and i could have stopped it if i had known they were bad but i did not know at first and i was only a little girl and you should have told me  have done it was all that he could say for like many he had heard of men visiting the painted lady by stealth and he had only wondered with other gossips who they were  he crossed again to the side of the dead woman and ballingalls was the only corpse you ever saw straiked he said in wonder she had done her work so well but he was not doubting her he knew already that this girl was clothed in truthfulness  was it you that kept this house so clean he asked almost irritably for he himself was the one undusted neglectedlooking thing in it and he was suddenly conscious of his frayed wristband and of buttons hanging by a thread  yes  what age are you  i think i am thirteen  he looked long at her vindictively she thought but he was only picturing the probable future of a painted ladys child and he said mournfully to himself ay it does not even end here and thats the crowning pity of it but grizel only heard him say poor thing and she bridled immediately  i wont let you pity me she cried  you dour brat he retorted but you need not think you are to have everything your own way still i must get some monypenny woman to take you till the funeral is over and after that  i wont go said grizel determinedly i shall stay with mamma till she is buried  he was not accustomed to contradiction and he stamped his foot you shall do as you are told he said  i wont replied grizel and she also stamped her foot  very well then you thrawn tid but at any rate ill send in a woman to sleep with you  i want no one do you think i am afraid  i think you will be afraid when you wake up in the darkness and find yourself alone withwith it  i shant i shall remember at once that she is to be buried nicely in the cemetery and that will make me happy  you unnatural  besides i shant sleep i have something to do  his curiosity again got the better of the doctor what can you have to do at such a time he demanded and her reply surprised him  i am to make a dress  you  i have made them before now she said indignantly  but at such a time  it is a black dress she cried i dont have one i am to make it out of mammas  he said nothing for some time then when did you think of this  i thought of it weeks ago i bought crape at the corner shop to be ready and  she thought he was looking at her in horror and stopped abruptly i dont care what you think she said  what i do think he retorted taking up his hat is that you are a most exasperating lassie if i bide here another minute i believe youll get round me  i dont want to get round you  then what makes you say such things i question if ill get an hours sleep tonight for thinking of you  i dont want you to think of me  he groaned what could an untidy hardened old single man like me do with you in his house he said oh you little limmer to put such a thought into my head  i never did she exclaimed indignantly  it began i do believe it began he sighed the first time i saw you easying ballingalls pillows  what began  you brat you wilful brat dont pretend ignorance you set a trap to catch me and  oh cried grizel and she opened the door quickly go away you horrid man she said  he liked her the more for this regal action and therefore it enraged him sheer anxiety lest he should succumb to her on the spot was what made him bluster as he strode off and that brat of a grizel or the painted ladys most unbearable lassie or the dour little besom was his way of referring to her in company for days but if any one agreed with him he roared dont be a fool man shes a wonder shes a delight or you have a dozen yourself janet but i wouldna neifer grizel for the lot of them and it was he still denouncing her so long as he was contradicted who persuaded the auld licht minister to officiate at the funeral then he said to himself and now i wash my hands of her i have done all that can be expected of me he told himself this a great many times as if it were a medicine that must be taken frequently and grizel heard from tommy with whom she had some strange conversations that he was going about denouncing her up hill and down dale but she did not care she was soso happy for a hole was dug for the painted lady in the cemetery just as if she had been a good woman and mr dishart conducted the service in double dykes before the removal of the body nor did he say one word that could hurt grizel perhaps because his wife had drawn a promise from him a large gathering of men followed the coffin three of them because as yon may remember grizel had dared them to stay away but all the others out of sympathy with a motherless child who as the procession started rocked her arms in delight because her mamma was being buried respectably  being a woman she could not attend the funeral and so the chief mourner was tommy as you could see by the position he took at the grave and by the white bands grizel had sewn on his sleeves he was looking very important as if he had something remarkable in prospect but little attention was given him until the cords were dropped into the grave and a prayer offered up when he pulled mr disharts coat and muttered something about a paper those who had been making ready to depart swung round again and the minister told him if he had anything to say to speak out  its a paper tommy said nervous yet elated and addressing all that grizel put in the coffin she told me to tell you about it when the cords fell on the lid  what sort of a paper asked mr dishart frowning  itsits a letter to god tommy gasped  nothing was to be heard except the shovelling of earth into the grave hold your spade john the minister said to the gravedigger and then even that sound stopped go on mr dishart signed to the boy  grizel doesna believe her mother has much chance of getting to heaven tommy said and she wrote the letter to god so that when he opens the coffins on the last day he will find it and read about them  about whom asked the stern minister  about grizels father for one she doesna know his name but the painted lady wore a locket wi a picture of him on her breast and its buried wi her and grizel told god to look at it so as to know him she thinks her mother will be damned for having her and that it winna be fair unless god damns her father too  go on said mr dishart  there was three thrums meni think they were gentlemen tommy continued almost blithely that used to visit the painted lady in the night time afore she took ill they wanted grizel to promise no to tell about their going to double dykes and she promised because she was ower innocent to know what they went forbut their names are in the letter  a movement in the crowd was checked by the ministers uplifted arm go on he cried  she wouldna tell me who they were because it would have been breaking her promise said tommy buthe looked around him inquisitivelybut theyre here at the funeral  the mourners were looking sideways at each other some breathing hard but none dared to speak before the minister he stood for a long time in doubt but at last he signed to john to proceed with the filling in of the grave contrary to custom all remained not until the grave was again level with the sward did mr dishart speak and then it was with a gesture that appalled his hearers this grave he said raising his arm is locked till the day of judgment  leaving him standing there a threatening figure they broke into groups and dispersed walking slowly at first and then fast to tell their wives     chapter xxxii  an elopement   the solitary child remained at double dykes awaiting the arrival of her father for the painted ladys manner of leaving the world had made such a stir that the neighbors said he must have heard of it even though he were in london and if he had the heart of a stone he could not desert his bairn they argued thus among themselves less as people who were sure of it than to escape the perplexing question what to do with grizel if the man never claimed her and before her they spoke of his coming as a certainty because it would be so obviously the best thing for her in the meantime they overwhelmed her with offers of everything she could need which was kindly but not essential for after the funeral expenses had been paid grizel insisted on paying them herself she had still several gold pieces found in her mammas beautiful tortoiseshell purse and there were nearly twenty pounds in the bank  but day after day passed and the man had not come perhaps he resented the painted ladys ostentatious death which if he was nicely strung must have jarred upon his nerves he could hardly have acknowledged grizel now without publicity being given to his private concerns or he may never have heard of the painted ladys death or if he read of it he may not have known which painted lady in particular she was or he may have married and told his wife all and she had forgiven him which somehow according to the plays and the novels cuts the past adrift from a man and enables him to begin again at yesterday whatever the reason grizels father was in no hurry to reveal himself and though not to her among themselves the people talked of the probability of his not coming at all she could not remain alone at double dykes they all admitted but where then should she go no fine lady in need of a handmaid seemed to think a painted ladys child would suit indeed grizel at first sight had not the manner that attracts philanthropists once only did the problem approach solution a woman in the denhead was willing to take the child because she expressed it as she had seven she might as well have eight but her man said no he would not have his bairns filt others would have taken her cordially for a few weeks or months had they not known that at the end of this time they would be blamed even by themselves if they let her go all in short were eager to show her kindness if one would give her a home but where was that one to be found  much of this talk came to grizel through tommy and she told him in the house of double dykes that people need not trouble themselves about her for she had no wish to stay with them it was only charity they brought her no one wanted her for herself it is because i am a child of shame she told him dryeyed  he fidgeted on his chair and asked whats that not very honestly  i dont know she said no one will tell me but it is something you cant love  you have a terrible wish to be loved he said in wonder and she nodded her head wistfully that is not what i wish for most of all though she told him and when he asked what she wished for most of all she said to love somebody oh it would be sweet  to tommy most sympathetic of mortals she seemed a very pathetic little figure and tears came to his eyes as he surveyed her he could always cry very easily  if it wasna for elspeth he began stammering i could love you but you winna let a body do onything on the sly  it was a vague offer but she understood and became the old grizel at once i dont want you to love me she said indignantly i dont think you know how to love  neither can you know then retorted tommy huffily for theres nobody for you to love  yes there is she said and i do love her and she loves me  but wha is she  that girl to his amazement she pointed to her own reflection in the famous mirror the size of which had scandalized thrums tommy thought this affection for herself barely respectable but he dared not say so lest he should be put to the door i love her ever so much grizel went on and she is so fond of me she hates to see me unhappy dont look so sad dearest darlingest she cried vehemently i love you you know oh you sweet and with each epithet she kissed her reflection and looked defiantly at the boy  but you canna put your arms round her and hug her he pointed out triumphantly and so he had the last word after all unfortunately grizel kept this side of her new even to tommy hidden from all others and her unresponsiveness lost her many possible friends even miss ailie who now had a dressmaker in the blueandwhite room sitting on a bedroom chair and sewing for her life oh the agonyor is it the raptureof having to decide whether to marry in gray with beads or brown plain to the throat even sympathetic miss ailie having met with several rebuffs said that grizel had a most unaffectionate nature and ay shes hardy agreed the town but its better maybe for hersel there are none so unpopular as the silent ones  if only miss ailie or others like her could have slipped noiselessly into double dykes at night they would have found grizels pillow wet but she would have heard them long before they reached the door and jumped to the floor in terror thinking it was her fathers step at last for unknown to anyone his coming which the town so anxiously desired was her one dread she had told tommy what she should say to him if he came and tommy had been awed and delighted they were such scathing things probably had the necessity arisen she would have found courage to say them but they were made up in the daytime and at night they brought less comfort then she listened fearfully and longed for the morning wild ideas coursing through her head of flying before he could seize her but when morning came it brought other thoughts as of the strange remarks she had heard about her mamma and herself during the past few days to brood over these was the most unhealthy occupation she could find but it was her only birthright many of the remarks came unguardedly from lips that had no desire to pain her others fell in a rage because she would not tell what were the names in her letter to god the words that troubled her most perhaps were the doctors she is a brave lass but it must be in her blood they were not intended for her ears but she heard what did he mean she asked miss ailie mrs dishart and others who came to see her and they replied awkwardly that it had only been a doctors remark of no importance to people who were well then why are you crying she demanded looking them full in the face with eyes there was no deceiving  oh why is everyone afraid to tell me the truth she would cry beating her palms in anguish  she walked into mcqueens surgery and said could you not cut it out so abruptly that he wondered what she was speaking about  the bad thing that is in my blood she explained do cut it out i shant scream i promise not to scream  he sighed and answered if it could be cut out lassie i would try to do it though it was the most dangerous of operations  she looked in anguish at him there are cleverer doctors than you arent there she asked and he was not offended  ay a hantle cleverer he told her but none so clever as that god help you bairn if you have to do it yourself some day  can i do it myself she cried brightening i shall do it now is it done with a knife  with a sharper knife than a surgeons he answered and then regretting he had said so much he tried to cheer her but that he could not do you are afraid to tell me the truth too she said and when she went away he was very sorry for her but not so sorry as she was for herself when i am grown up she announced dolefully to tommy i shall be a bad woman just like mamma  not if you try to be good he said  yes i shall there is something in my blood that will make me bad and i so wanted to be good oh oh oh  she told him of the things she had heard people say but though they perplexed him almost as much as her he was not so hopeless of learning their meaning for here was just the kind of difficulty he liked to overcome ill get it out o blinder he said with confidence in his ingenuity and then ill tell you what he says but however much he might strive to do so tommy could never repeat anything without giving it frills and other adornment of his own making and grizel knew this i must hear what he says myself she insisted  but he winna speak plain afore you  yes he will if he does not know i am there  the plot succeeded though only partially for so quick was the blind mans sense of hearing that in the middle of the conversation he said sharply somebodys ahint the dyke and he caught grizel by the shoulder its the painted ladys lassie he said when she screamed and he stormed against tommy for taking such advantage of his blindness but to her he said gently i daresay you egged him on to this meaning well but you maun forget most of what ive said especially about being in the blood i spoke in haste it doesna apply to the like of you  yes it does replied grizel and all that had been revealed to her she carried hot to the surgery tommy stopping at the door in as great perturbation as herself i know what being in the blood is now she said tragically to mcqueen there is something about it in the bible i am the child of evil passions and that means that i was born with wickedness in my blood it is lying sleeping in me just now because i am only thirteen and if i can prevent its waking when i am grown up i shall always be good but a very little thing will waken it it wants so much to be wakened and if it is once wakened it will run all through me and soon i shall be like mamma  it was all horribly clear to her and she would not wait for words of comfort that could only obscure the truth accompanied by tommy who said nothing but often glanced at her fascinated yet alarmed as if expecting to see the ghastly change come over her at any momentfor he was as convinced as she and had the livelier imaginationshe returned to monypenny to beg of blinder to tell her one thing more and he told her not speaking lightly but because his words contained a solemn warning to a girl who he thought might need it  what sort of thing would be likeliest to waken the wickedness she asked holding her breath for the answer  keeping company wi ill men said blinder gravely  like the man who made mamma wicked like my father  ay blinder replied fly from the like of him my lass though it should be to the other end of the world  she stood quite still with a most sorrowful face and then ran away ran so swiftly that when tommy who had lingered for a moment came to the door she was already out of sight scarcely less excited than she he set off for double dykes his imagination in such a blaze that he looked fearfully in the pools of the burn for a black frock but grizel had not drowned herself she was standing erect in her home like one at bay her arms rigid her hands clenched and when he pushed open the door she screamed  grizel said the distressed boy did you think i was him come for you  yes  maybe hell no come the folk think he winna come  but if he does if he does  maybe you needna go wi him unless youre willing  i must he can compel me because he is my father oh oh oh she lay down on the bed and on her eyes there slowly formed the little wells of water tommy was to know so well in time he stood by her side in anguish for though his own tears came at the first call he could never face them in others  grizel he said impulsively theres just one thing for you to do you have money and you maun run away afore he comes  she jumped up at that i have thought of it she answered i am always thinking about it but how can i oh now can i it would not be respectable  to run away  to go by myself said the poor girl and i do want to be respectable it would be sweet  in some ways tommy was as innocent as she and her reasoning seemed to him to be sound she was looking at him woefully and entreaty was on her face all at once he felt what a lonely little crittur she was and in a burst of manhood  but dinna prig wi me to go with you he said struggling  i have not she answered panting and she had not in words but the mute appeal was still on her face  grizel he cried ill come  then she seized his hand and pressed it to her breast saying oh tommy i am so fond of you  it was the first time she had admitted it and his head wagged well content as if saying for him i knew you would understand me some day but next moment the haunting shadow that so often overtook him in the act of soaring fell cold upon his mind and i maun take elspeth he announced as if elspeth had him by the leg  you shant said grizels face  she winna let go said tommys  grizel quivered from top to toe i hate elspeth she cried with curious passion and the more moral tommy was ashamed of her  you dinna ken how fond o her i am he said  yes i do  then you shouldna want me to leave her and go wi you  that is why i want it grizel blurted out and now we are all ashamed of her but fortunately tommy did not see how much she had admitted in that hasty cry and as neither would give way to the other they parted stiffly his last words being mind it wouldna be respectable to go by yoursel and hers i dont care im going nevertheless it was she who slept easily that night and he who tossed about almost until cockcrow she had only one ugly dream of herself wandering from door to door in a strange town asking for lodgings but the woman who answered her weary knocksthere were many doors but it was invariably the same womanalways asked suspiciously is tommy with you and grizel shook her head and then the woman drove her away perceiving that she was not respectable this woke her and she feared the dream would come true but she clenched her fists in the darkness saying i cant help it i am going and i wont have elspeth and after that she slept in peace in the meantime tommy the imaginativebut that night he was not tommy rather was he grizel for he saw her as we can only see ourselves now sheor he if you willhad been caught by her father and brought back and she turned into a painted thing like her mother she brandished a brandy bottle and a stream of foul words ran lightly from her mouth and suddenly stopped because she was wailing i wanted so to be good it is sweet to be good now a man with a beard was whipping her and tommy felt each lash on his own body so that he had to strike out and he started up in bed and the horrible thing was that he had never been asleep thus it went on until early morning when his eyes were red and his body was damp with sweat  but now again he was tommy and at first even to think of leaving elspeth was absurd yet it would be pleasant to leave aaron who disliked him so much to disappear without a word would be a fine revenge for the people would say that aaron must have illtreated him and while they searched the pools of the burn for his body aaron would be looking on trembling perhaps with a policemans hand on his shoulder tommy saw the commotion as vividly as if the searchers were already out and he in a tree looking down at them but in a second he also heard elspeth skirling and down he flung himself from the tree crying im here elspeth dinna greet oh what a brute ive been no he could not leave elspeth how wicked of grizel to expect it of him she was a bad one grizel  but having now decided not to go his sympathy with the girl who was to lose him returned in a rush and before he went to school he besought her toit amounted to this to be more like himself that is he begged her to postpone her departure indefinitely not to make up her mind until tomorrowor the day afteror the day after that he produced reasons as that she had only four pounds and some shillings now while by and by she might get the painted ladys money at present in the bank also she ought to wait for the money that would come to her from the roup of the furniture but grizel waived all argument aside secure in her four pounds and shillings she was determined to go tonight for her father might be here tomorrow she was going to london because it was so big that no one could ever find her there and she would never never write to tommy to tell him how she fared lest the letter put her father on her track he implored her to write once so that the money owing her might be forwarded but even this bribe did not move her and he set off for school most gloomily  cathro was specially aggravating that day nagged him said before the whole school that he was a numskull even fell upon him with the tawse and for no earthly reason except that tommy would not bother his head with the oratio obliqua if there is any kind of dominie more maddening than another it is the one who will not leave you alone ask any thoughtful boy how wretched the lot of him whose life is cast among fools not capable of understanding him what was that saying about entertaining angels unawares london grizel had more than sufficient money to take two there and once in london a wonder such as himself was bound to do wondrous things now that he thought of it to become a minister was abhorrent to him to preach would be rather nice oh what things he should say he began to make them up and they were so grand that he almost wept but to be good after the sermon was over always to be good even when elspeth was out of the way never to think queer unsayable things never to say stroke never in short to find a wayhe was appalled if it had not been for elspeth  so even elspeth did not need him when he went home from school thinking only of her he found that she had gone to the auld licht manse to play with little margaret very well if such was her wish he would go nobody wanted him except grizel perhaps when news came from london of his greatness they would think more of him he would send a letter to thrums asking mr mclean to transfer his kindness to elspeth that would show them what a noble fellow he was elspeth would really benefit by his disappearance he was running away for elspeths sake and when he was great which would be in a few years he would come back for her  but no he the dash represents tommy swithering once more and he was at one or other end of the swither all day when he acted sharply it was always on impulse and as soon as the die was cast he was a philosopher with no regrets but when he had time to reflect he jumped miserably back and forward so when grizel was ready to start he did not know in the least what he meant to do  she was to pass by the cuttle well on her way to tilliedrum where she would get the london train he had been told coldly and he could be there at the timeif he liked the time was seven oclock in the evening on a weekday when the lovers are not in the den and tommy arrived first when he stole through the small field that separates monypenny from the den his decision wasbut on reaching the cuttle well its nearness to the uncanny lair chilled his courage and now he had only come to bid her goodby she was very late and it suddenly struck him that she had already set off after getting me to promise to go wi her he said to himself at once  but grizel came she was only late because it had taken her such a long time to say goodby to the girl in the glass she was wearing her black dress and lustre jacket and carried in a bundle the few treasures she was taking with her and though she did not ask tommy if he was coming she cast a quick look round to see if he had a bundle anywhere and he had none that told her his decision and she would have liked to sit down for a minute and cry but of course she had too much pride and she bade him farewell so promptly that he thought he had a grievance im coming as far as the tollhouse wi you he said sulkily and so they started together  at the tollhouse grizel stopped its a fine night said tommy almost apologetically ill go as far as the quarry o benshee  when they came to the quarry he said were no halfroads yet ill go wi you as far as padanarum now she began to wonder and to glance at him sideways which made him more uncomfortable than ever to prevent her asking him a question for which he had no answer he said what makes you look so little the day  i am not looking little she replied greatly annoyed i am looking taller than usual i have let down my frock three inches so as to look tallerand older  you look younger than ever he said cruelly  i dont i look fifteen and when you are fifteen you grow up very quickly do say i look older she entreated anxiously it would make me feel more respectable  but he shook his head with surprising obstinacy and then she began to remark on his clothes which had been exercising her curiosity ever since they left the den  how is it that you are looking so stout she asked  i feel cold but you are wiping the sweat off your face every minute  it was true but he would have preferred not to answer grizels questions however were all so straight in the face that there was no dodging them i have on twa suits o clothes and a my sarks he had to admit sticky and sullen  she stopped but he trudged on doggedly she ran after him and gave his arm an impulsive squeeze with both hands oh you sweet she said  no im not he answered in alarm  yes you are you are coming with me  im not  then why did you put on so many clothes  tommy swithered wretchedly on one foot i didna put them on to come wi you he explained i just put them on in case i should come wi you  and are you not coming  how can i ken  but you must decide grizel almost screamed  i needna he stammered till were at tilliedrum lets speak about some other thing  she rocked her arms crying it is so easy to make up ones mind  its easy to you that has just one mind he retorted with spirit but if you had as many minds as i have  on they went     chapter xxxiii  there is some one to love grizel at last   corp was sitting on the monypenny dyke spitting on a candlestick and then rubbing it briskly against his orangecolored trousers the doctor passing in his gig both of them streaked till they blended with the mud of lookaboutyou road through which you should drive winking rapidly all the way saw him and drew up  well how is grizel he asked he had avoided double dykes since the funeral but vain had been his attempts to turn its little inmate out of his mind there she was against his will and there he now admitted to himself angrily or with a rueful sigh she seemed likely to remain until someone gave her a home it was an almost ludicrous distrust of himself that kept him away from her he feared that if he went to double dykes her lonely face would complete his conquest for oh he was reluctant to be got the better of as he expressed it to himself maggy ann his maid was the ideal woman for a bachelors house when she saw him coming she fled guiltily concealing the hated duster when he roared at her for announcing that dinner was ready she left him to eat it half cold when he spilled matches on the floor and then stepped upon them and set the rug on fire she let him tell her that she should be more careful she did not carry off his favorite boots to the cobbler because they were down at heel she did not fling up her arms in horror and cry that she had brushed that coat just five minutes ago nor did she count the treasured dottels on the mantelpiece to discover how many pipes he had smoked since morning nor point out that he had stepped over the doormat nor line her shelves with the new mentor nor give him up his foot for sitting half the night with patients who could not payin short he knew the ways of the limmers and maggy ann was a jewel but it had taken him a dozen years to bring her to this perfection and well he knew that the curse of eve as he called the rage for the duster slumbered in her rather than was extinguished with the volcanic grizel in the house maggy ann would once more burst into flame and the horrified doctor looked to right of him to left of him before him and behind him and everywhere he seemed to see two new brooms bearing down no the brat he would not have her the besom why did she bother him the witches take her for putting the idea into his head nailing it into his head indeed but nevertheless he was forever urging other people to adopt her assuring them that they would find her a treasure and even shaking his staff at them when they refused and he was so uneasy if he did not hear of her several times a day that he made monypenny the way to and from everywhere so that he might drop into artful talk with those who had seen her last corp accordingly was not surprised at his how is grizel now and he answered between two spits shes fine she gave me this  it was one of the painted ladys silver candlesticks and the doctor asked sharply why grizel had given it to him  she said because she liked me corp replied wonderingly she brought it to my aunties door soon after i loused and put it into my hand ay and she had a blue shawl and she telled me to give it to gavinia because she liked her too  what else did she say  corp tried to think i said this cows grizel but thank you kindly he answered much pleased with his effort of memory but the doctor interrupted him rudely nobody wants to hear what you said you dottrel what more did she say and thus encouraged corp remembered that she had said she hoped he would not forget her what for should i forget her when i see her ilka day he asked and was probably about to divulge that this was his reply to her but without waiting for more mcqueen turned his beasts head and drove to the entrance to the double dykes here he alighted and hastened up the path on foot but before he reached the house he met dite deuchars taking his ease beneath a tree and dite could tell him that grizel was not at home but theres somebody in double dykes he said though i kenna wha could be there unless its the ghost of the painted lady hersel about an hour syne i saw grizel come out o the house carrying a bundle but she hadna gone many yards when she turned round and waved her hand to the east window i couldna see wha was at it but there maun have been somebody for first the crittur waved to the window and next she kissed her hand to it and syne she went on a bit and syne she ran back close to the window and nodded and flung more kisses and back and forrit she went a curran times as if she could hardly tear hersel awa whas that youre so chief wi i speired when she came by me at last but she just said i wont tell you in her dour wy and she hasna come back yet  whom could she have been saying goodby to so demonstratively and whither had she gone with a curiosity that for the moment took the place of his uneasiness mcqueen proceeded to the house the door of which was shut but not locked two glances convinced him that there was no one here the kitchen was as he had seen it last except that the long mirror had been placed on a chair close to the east window the doctor went to the outside of the window and looked in he could see nothing but his own reflection in the mirror and was completely puzzled but it was no time he felt for standing there scratching his head when there was reason to fear that the girl had gone gone where he saw his selfishness now in a glaring light and it fled out of him pursued by curses  he stopped at aarons door and called for tommy but tommy had left the house an hour ago gone with her the sacket he very likely put her up to this the doctor muttered and the surmise seemed justified when he heard that grizel and tommy had been seen passing the fens that they were running away had never struck those who saw them and mcqueen said nothing of his suspicions but off he went in his gig on their track and ran them down within a mile of tilliedrum grizel scurried on thinking it was undoubtedly her father but in a few minutes the three were conversing almost amicably the doctors first words had been so sweet  tommy explained that they were out for a walk but grizel could not lie and in a few passionate sentences she told mcqueen the truth he had guessed the greater part of it and while she spoke he looked so sorry for her such a sweet change had come over his manner that she held his hand  but you must go no farther he told her i am to take you back with me and that alarmed her i wont go back she said determinedly he might come  theres little fear of his coming mcqueen assured her gently but if he does come i give you my solemn word that i wont let him take you away unless you want to go  even then she only wavered but he got her altogether with this and should he come just think what a piece of your mind you could give him with me standing by holding your hand  oh would you do that she asked brightening  i would do a good deal to get the chance he said  i should just love it she cried i shall come now and she stepped lightheartedly into the gig where the doctor joined her tommy who had been in the background all this time was about to jump up beside them but mcqueen waved him back saying maliciously theres just room for two my man so i wont interfere with your walk  tommy in danger of being left very hot and stout and sulky whimpered what have i done to anger you  you were going with her you blackguard replied mcqueen not yet in full possession of the facts for whether tommy was or was not going with her no one can ever know  if i was cried the injured boy it wasna because i wanted to go it was because it wouldna have been respectable for her to go by hersel  the doctor had already started his shalt but at these astonishing words he drew up sharply say that again ha said as if thinking that his ears must have deceived him and tommy repeated his remark wondering at its effect  and you tell me that you were going with her the doctor repeated to make her enterprise more respectable and he looked from one to the other  of course i was replied tommy resenting his surprise at a thing so obvious and thats why i wanted him to come chimed in grizel  still mcqueens glance wandered from the boy to the girl and from the girl to the boy you are a pair he said at last and he signed in silence to tommy to mount the gig but his manner had alarmed grizel ever watching herself lest she should stray into the ways of bad ones and she asked anxiously there was nothing wrong in it was there  no the doctor answered gravely laying his hand on hers no it was just sweet                                       what mcqueen had to say to her was not for tommys ears and the conversation was but a makeshift until they reached thrums where he sent the boy home recommending him to hold his tongue about the escapade and tommy of course saw the advisability of keeping it from elspeth but he took grizel into his parlor and set her down on the buffet stool by the fire where he surveyed her in silence at his leisure then he tried her in his old armchair then on his sofa then he put the mentor into her hand and told her to hold it as if it were a duster then he sent her into the passage with instructions to open the door presently and announce dinner is ready then he told her to put some coals on the fire then he told her to sit at the window first with an open book in her hand secondly as if she was busy knitting and all these things she did wondering exceedingly for he gave no explanation except the incomprehensible one i want to see what it would be like  she had told him in the gig why she had changed the position of the mirror at double dykes it was to let that darling wave goodby to her from the window and now having experimented with her in his parlor he drew her toward his chair so that she stood between his knees and he asked her if she understood why he had gone to double dykes  was it to get me to tell you what were the names in the letter she said wistfully that is what everyone asks me but i wont tell no i wont and she closed her mouth hard  he too would have liked to hear the names and he sighed it must be admitted at sight of that determined mouth but he could say truthfully your refusal to break your promise is one of the things that i admire in you  admire grizel could scarce believe that this gift was for her you dont mean that you really like me she faltered but she felt sure all the time that he did and she cried oh but why oh how can you  for one reason he said because you are so good  good oh oh oh she clapped her hands joyously  and for anotherbecause you are so brave  but i am not really brave she said anxiously yet resolved to hide nothing i only pretend to be brave i am often frightened but i just dont let on  that he told her is the highest form of bravery but grizel was very very tired of being brave and she insisted impetuously i dont want to be brave i want to be afraid like other girls  ay its your right you little woman he answered tenderly and then again he became mysterious he kicked off his shoes to show her that he was wearing socks that did not match i just pull on the first that come to hand he said recklessly  oh cried grizel  on his dusty bookshelves he wrote with his finger not dusted since the year one  oh oh she cried  he put his fingers through his gray untidy hair thats the only comb i have that is at hand when i want it he went on regardless of her agony  all the studholes in my shirts he said are now so frayed and large that the studs fall out and i find them in my socks at night  oh oh he was killing her he was but what cared he look at my clothes said the cruel man i read when im eating and i spill so much gravy thatthat we boil my waistcoat once a month and make soup of it  to grizel this was the most tragic picture ever drawn by man and he saw that it was time to desist and its all he said looking at her sadly its all because i am a lonely old bachelor with no womankind to look after him no little girl to brighten him when he comes home dogtired no one to care whether his socks are in holes and his comb behind the washstand no soft hand to soothe his brow when it aches no one to work for no one to love many a one to close the old bachelors eyes when he dies but none to drop a tear for him no one to  oh oh oh that is just like me oh oh cried grizel and he pulled her closer to him saying the more reason we should join thegither grizel if you dont take pity on me and come and bide with me and be my little housekeeper the lord almighty only knows what is to become of the old doctor  at this she broke away from him and stood far back pressing her arms to her sides and she cried it is not out of charity you ask me is it and then she went a little nearer you would not say it if it wasnt true would you  no my dawtie its true he told her and if he had been pitying himself a little there was an end of that now  she remembered something and cried joyously and you knew what was in my blood before you asked me so i dont need to tell you do i and you are not afraid that i shall corrupt you are you and you dont think it a pity i didnt die when i was a tiny baby do you some people think so i heard them say it  what would have become of me was all he dared answer in words but he drew her to him again and when she asked if it was true as she had heard some woman say that in some matters men were all alike and did what that one man had done to her mamma he could reply solemnly no it is not true its a lie that has done more harm than any war in any century  she sat on his knee telling him many things that had come recently to her knowledge but were not so new to him the fall of woman was the subject a strange topic for a girl of thirteen and a man of sixty they dont become wicked in a moment he learned if they are good to begin with it takes quite a long time to make them bad her mamma was good to begin with i know she was good because when she thought she was the girl she used to be she looked sweet and said lovely things the way the men do is this they put evil thoughts into the womans head and say them often to her till she gets accustomed to them and thinks they cannot be bad when the man she loves likes them and it is called corrupting the mind  and then a baby comes to them grizel said softly and it is called a child of shame i am a child of shame  he made no reply so she looked up and his face was very old and sad i am sorry too she whispered but still he said nothing and then she put her fingers on his eyes to discover if they were wet and they were wet and so grizel knew that there was someone who loved her at last  the mirror was the only article of value that grizel took with her to her new home everything else was rouped at the door of double dykes tommy who should have been at his books acting as auctioneers clerk for sixpence there are houses in thrums where you may still be told who got the bed and who the rockingchair and how nether drumgleys wife dared him to come home without the spinet but it is not by the sales that the roup is best remembered curiosity took many persons into double dykes that day and in the room that had never been furnished they saw a mournful stack of empty brandy bottles piled there by the auctioneer who had found them in every corner beneath the bed in presses in boxes whither they had been thrust by grizels mamma as if to conceal their number from herself the counting of these bottles was a labor but it is not even by them that the roup is remembered among them some sacrilegious hands found a bundle of papers with a sad blue ribbon round them they were the painted ladys loveletters the letters she had written to the man why or how they had come back to her no one knew  most of them were given to grizel but a dozen or more passed without her leave into the kists of various people where often since then they have been consulted by swains in need of a pretty phrase and tommys schoolfellows the very boys and girls who hooted the painted lady were in timeso oddly do things turn outto be among those whom her letters taught how to woo where the kists did not let in the damp or careless fingers the paper long remained clean the ink but little faded some of the letters were creased as if they had once been much folded perhaps for slipping into secret hidingplaces but none of them bore any address or a date to my beloved was sometimes written on the cover and inside he was darling or beloved again so no one could have arranged them in the order in which they were written though there was a threecornered one which said it was the first there was a violet in it clinging to the paper as if they were fond of each other and grizels mamma had written the violet is me hiding in a corner because i am so happy the letters were in many moods playful reflective sad despairing arch but all were written in an ecstasy of the purest love and most of them were cheerful so that you seemed to see the sun dancing on the paper while she wrote the same sun that afterwards showed up her painted cheeks why they came back to her no one ever discovered any more than how she who slipped the violet into that threecornered one and took it out to kiss again and wrote it is my first loveletter and i love it so much i am reluctant to let it go became in a few years the derision of the double dykes some of these letters may be in old kists still but whether that is so or not they alone have passed the painted ladys memory from one generation to another and they have purified it so that what she was died with her vile body and what she might have been lived on as if it were her true self     chapter xxxiv  who told tommy to speak   miss alison cray presents her compliments toand requests the favor of their company at her marriage with mr ivie mclean on january 8th at six oclock  tommy in his sabbath clothes with a rose from the dovecot hothouse for buttonhole which he slipped into his pocket when he saw other boys approaching delivered them at the doors of the aristocracy where by the way he had been a few weeks earlier with another circular  miss alison cray being about to give up school has pleasure in stating that she has disposed of the goodwill of her establishment to miss jessy langlands and miss s oram who will enter upon their scholastic duties on january 9th at hoods cottage where she most cordially and so on  here if the writer dared but you would be so angry he would introduce at the length of a chapter two brandnew characters the misses langlands and oram who suddenly present themselves to him in the most sympathetic light miss ailie has been safely stowed to port but their little boat is only setting sail and they are such young ones neither out of her teens that he would fain turn for a time from her to them twelve pounds they paid for the goodwill and oh the exciting discussions oh the scraping to get the money together if little miss langlands had not been so bold big miss oram must have drawn back but if miss oram had not had that idea about a paper partition of what avail the boldness of miss langlands how these two trumps of girls succeeded in hiring the painted ladys spinet from nether drumgleyin the absence of his wife who on her way home from buying a cochinchina met the spinet in a carthow the mother of one of them realizing in a klink that she was common no more henceforth wore black caps instead of mutches but the father dandered on in the old plebeian way what the enterprise meant to a young man in distant newcastle whose favorite name was jessy how the news travelled to still more distant canada where a family of emigrants which had left its sarah behind in thrums could talk of nothing else for weeksit is hard to have to pass on without dwelling on these things and indeedbut pass on we must  the chief figure at the wedding of miss ailie was undoubtedly mr t sandys when one remembers his prominence it is difficult to think that the wedding could have taken place without him it was he in his sabbath clothes again and now flaunting his buttonhole brazenly who in insulting language ordered the rabble to stand back there it was he who dashed out to the sosh to get a hundred hapennies for the fifty pennies mr mclean had brought to toss into the air it was he who went round in the carriage to pick up the guests and whisked them in and out and slammed the door and saw to it that the minister was not kept waiting and warned miss ailie that if she did not come now they should begin without her it was he who stood near her with a handkerchief ready in his hand lest she took to crying on her new brown silk miss ailie was married in brown silk after all as a crown to his audacity it was he who told mr dishart in the middle of a noble passage to mind the lamp  these duties were dr mcqueens the best man but either demoralized by the bridegroom who went all to pieces at the critical moment and was much more nervous than the bride or in terror lest grizel who had sent him to the wedding speckless and most beautifully starched should suddenly appear at the door and cry oh oh take your fingers off your shirt he was through other till the knot was tied and then it was too late for tommy had made his mark it was tommy who led the way to the schoolroom where the feast was ready it was tommy who put the guests in their places even the banker cringed to him it was tommy who winked to mr dishart as a sign to say grace as you will readily believe miss ailie could not endure the thought of excluding her pupils from the festivities and they began to arrive as soon as the tables had been cleared of all save oranges and tarts and raisins tommy waving gavinia aside showed them in and one of them curious to tell was corp in borrowed blacks and tommy shook hands with him and called him mr shiach both new experiences to corp who knocked over a table in his anxiety to behave himself and roared at intervals do you see the little deevil and bit his warts and then politely swallowed the blood  as if oranges and tarts and raisins were not enough came the punch and judy show tommys culminating triumph all the way to redlintie had mr mclean sent for the punch and judy show and nevertheless there was a probability of no performance for miss ailie considered the show immoral most anxious was she to give pleasure to her pupils and this she knew was the best way but how could she countenance an entertainment which was an encouragement to every form of vice and crime to send these children to the misses langlands and oram fresh from an introduction to the comic view of murder it could not be done now could it mr mclean could make no suggestion mr dishart thought it would be advisable to substitute another entertainment was there not a game called the ministers cat mrs dishart thought they should have the show and risk the consequences so also thought dr mcqueen the banker was consulted but saw no way out of the difficulty nor did the lawyer nor did the misses finlayson then tommy appeared on the scene and presently retired to find a way  he found it the performance took place and none of the fun was omitted yet neither miss ailietuts tuts mrs mcleannor mr dishart could disapprove punch did chuck his baby out at the window roars of laughter in his jovial timehonored way but immediately thereafter up popped the showman to say ah my dear boys and girls let this be a lesson to you never to destroy your offsprings oh shame on punch for to do the wicked deed he will be catched in the end and serve him right then when mr punch had wolloped his wife with the stick amid thunders of applause up again bobbed the showman ah my dear boys and girls what a lesson is this we sees what goings on is this he have bashed the head of her as should ha been the apple of his eye and he does not care ahe does not care but mark my words his home it will now be desolate no more shall she meet him at his door with kindly smile he have done for her quite and now he is a hunted man oh be warned by his sad igsample and do not bash the head of your loving wife and there was a great deal more of the same and simple mrs mclean almost wept tears of joy because her favorites good heart had suggested these improvements  grizel was not at the wedding she was invited but could not go because she was in mourning but only her parramatty frock was in mourning for already she had been the doctors housekeeper for two full months and her father had not appeared to plague her he never did appear it may be told at once and so how could her face be woeful when her heart leapt with gladness never had prisoner pined for the fields more than this reticent girl to be frank and she poured out her inmost self to the doctor so that daily he discovered something beautiful and exasperating about womanhood and it was his love for her that had changed her you do love me dont you she would say and his answer might be i have told you that fifty times already to which she would reply gleefully that is not often i say it all day to myself  exasperating yes that was the word long before summer came the doctor knew that he had given himself into the hands of a tyrant it was idle his saying that this irregularity and that carelessness were habits that had become part of him she only rocked her arms impatiently and if he would not stand still to be put to rights then she would follow him along the street brushing him as he walked a sight that was witnessed several times while he was in the mutinous stage  talk about masterfulness he would say when she whipped off his coat or made a dart at the mud on his trousers you are the most masterful little besom i ever clapped eyes on  but as he said it he perhaps crossed his legs and she immediately cried you have missed two holes in lacing your boots  of a morning he would ask her sarcastically to examine him from top to toe and see if he would do and examine him she did turning him round pointing out that he had been sitting again on his tails that oh oh he must have cut that buttonhole with his knife he became most artful in hiding deficiencies from her but her suspicions once roused would not sleep and all subterfuge was vain why have you buttoned your coat up tight to the throat today she would demand sternly  it is such a cold morning he said  that is not the reason she replied at once she could see through broadcloth at a glance i believe you have on the old necktie again and you promised to buy a new one  i always forget about it when im out he said humbly and next evening he found on his table a new tie made by grizel herself out of her mammas rokelay  it was related by one who had dropped in at the doctors house unexpectedly that he found grizel making a new shirt and forcing the doctor to try on the sleeves while they were still in the pin stage  she soon knew his every want and just as he was beginning to want it there it was at his elbow he realized what a study she had made of him when he heard her talking of his favorite dishes and his favorite seat and his way of biting his underlip when in thought and how hard he was on his left cuff it had been one of his boasts that he had no favorite dishes etc but he saw now that he had been a slave to them for years without knowing it  she discussed him with other mothers as if he were her little boy and he denounced her for it but all the time she was spoiling him formerly he had got on very well when nothing was in its place now he roared helplessly if he mislaid his razor  he was determined to make a lady of her which necessitated her being sent to school she preferred hemming baking and rubbing things till they shone and not both could have had their way which sounds fatal for the man had they not arranged a compromise grizel for instance to study geography for an hour in the evening with miss langlands go to school in the daytime she would not so long as the doctor shaved every morning but if no shave no geography the doctor to wipe his pen on the blotsheet instead of on the lining of his coat if she took three lessons a week from miss oram on the spinet how happy and proud she was her glee was a constant source of wonder to mcqueen perhaps she put on airs a little her walk said the critical had become a strut but how could she help that when the new joyousness of living was dancing and singing within her  had all her fears for the future rolled away like clouds that leave no mark behind the doctor thought so at times she so seldom spoke of them to him he did not see that when they came she hid them from him because she had discovered that they saddened him and she had so little time to brood being convinced of the sinfulness of sitting still that if the clouds came suddenly they never stayed long save once and then it was mayhap as well the thunderclap was caused by tommy who brought it on unintentionally and was almost as much scared by his handiwork as grizel herself she and he had been very friendly of late partly because they shared with mcqueen the secret of the frustrated elopement partly because they both thought that in that curious incident tommy had behaved in a most disinterested and splendid way grizel had not been sure of it at first but it had grown on tommy he had so thoroughly convinced himself of his intention to get into the train with her at tilliedrum that her doubts were dispelledeasily dispelled you say but the truth must be told grizel was very anxious to be rid of them and tommys were honest convictions born full grown of a desire for happiness to all had elspeth discovered how nearly he had deserted her the same sentiment would have made him swear to her with tears that never should he have gone farther than tilliedrum and while he was persuading her he would have persuaded himself then again when he met grizelwell to get him in doubt it would have been necessary to catch him on the way between these two girls  so tommy and grizel were friends and finding that it hurt the doctor to speak on a certain subject to him grizel gave her confidences to tommy she had a fear which he shared on its being explained to him that she might meet a man of the stamp of her father and grow fond of him before she knew the kind he was and as even tommy could not suggest an infallible test which would lay them bare at the first glance he consented to consult blinder once more he found the blind man by his fireside very difficult to coax into words on the important topic but tommys youve said ower much no to tell a bit more seemed to impress him and he answered the question  you said a woman should fly frae the like o grizels father though it should be to the other end of the world but how is she to ken that hes that kind  shell ken blinder answered after thinking it over if she likes him and fears him at one breath and has a sort of secret dread that hes getting a power ower her that she canna resist  these words were a flash of light on a neglected corner to tommy now i see now i ken he exclaimed amazed now i ken what my mother meant blinder is that no the kind of man thats called masterful  its what poor women find them and call them to their cost said blinder  tommys excitement was prodigious now i ken now i see he cried slapping his leg and stamping up and down the room  sit down roared his host  i canna retorted the boy oh to think ot to think i came to speir that question at you to think her and me has wondered what kind he was and i kent a the time without staying to tell blinder what he was blethering about he hurried off to grizel who was waiting for him in the den and to her he poured out his astonishing news  i ken all about them ive kent since afore i came to thrums but though i generally say the prayer ive forgot to think o what it means in a stampede of words he told her all he could remember of his mothers story as related to him on a grim night in london so long ago and she listened eagerly and when that was over he repeated first his prayer and then elspeths o god whatever is to be my fate may i never be one of them that bow the knee to masterful man and if i was born like that and canna help it o take me up to heaven afore im filt grizel repeated it after him until she had it by heart and even as she said it a strange thing happened for she began to draw back from tommy with a look of terror on her face  what makes you look at me like that he cried  i believei thinkyou are masterful she gasped  me he retorted indignantly  now she went on waving him back now i know why i would not give in to you when you wanted me to be strokes wife i was afraid you were masterful  was that it cried tommy  now she proceeded too excited to heed his interruptions now i know why i would not kiss your hand now i know why i would not say i liked you i was afraid of you i  were you his eyes began to sparkle and something very like rapture was pushing the indignation from his face oh grizel have i a power ower you  no you have not she cried passionately i was just frightened that you might have oh oh i know you now  to think ot to think ot he crowed wagging his head and then she clenched her fist crying oh you wicked you should cry with shame  but he had his answer ready it canna be my wite for i never kent ot till you telled me grizel it has just come about without either of us kenning  she shuddered at this and then seized him by the shoulders it has not come about at all she said i was only frightened that it might come and now it cant come for i wont let it  but can you help yoursel  yes i can i shall never be friends with you again  she had such a capacity for keeping her word that this alarmed him and he did his best to extinguish his lights im no masterful grizel he said and i dinna want to be it was just for a minute that i liked the thought she shook her head but his next words had more effect if i had been that kind would i have teached you elspeths prayer  nno i dont think so she said slowly and perhaps he would have succeeded in soothing her had not a sudden thought brought back the terror to her face  what is t now he asked  oh oh oh she cried and i nearly went away with you and without another word she fled from the den she never told the doctor of this incident and in time it became a mere shadow in the background so that she was again his happy housekeeper but that was because she had found strength to break with tommy she was only an eager little girl pathetically ignorant about what she wanted most to understand but she saw how an instinct had been fighting for her and now it should not have to fight alone how careful she became all tommys wiles were vain she would scarcely answer if he spoke to her if he had ever possessed a power over her it was gone elspeths prayer had saved her  jean myles had told tommy to teach that prayer to elspeth but who had told him to repeat it to grizel     chapter xxxv  the branding of tommy   grizels secession had at least one good effect it gave tommy more time in which to make a scholar of himself would you like a picture of tommy trying to make a scholar of himself  they all helped him in their different ways grizel by declining his company corp by being far away at lookaboutyou adding to the inches of a farmhouse aaron latta by saying nothing but looking college or the herding mr mclean who had settled down with ailie at the dovecot by inquiries about his progress elspeth bybut did elspeths talks with him about how they should live in aberdeen and afterwards when they were in the big house do more than send his mind agalloping she holding on behind along roads that lead not to aberdeen what drove tommy oftenest to the weary drudgery was perhaps the alarm that came over him when he seemed of a sudden to hear the names of the bursars proclaimed and no thomas sandys among them then did he shudder for well he knew that aaron would keep his threat and he hastily covered the round table with books and sat for hours sorrowfully pecking at them every little while to discover that his mind had soared to other things when he hauled it back as one draws in a reluctant kite on these occasions aaron seldom troubled him except by glances that nevertheless brought the kite back more quickly than if they had been words of warning if elspeth was present the warper might sit moodily by the fire but when the man and the boy were left together one or other of them soon retired as if this was the only way of preserving the peace though determined to keep his word to jean myles liberally aaron had never liked tommy and tommys avoidance of him is easily accounted for he knew that aaron did not admire him and unless you admired tommy he was always a boor in your presence shy and selfdistrustful especially was this so if you were a lady how amazingly he got on in after years with some of you what agony others endured till he went away and it is the chief reason why there are such contradictory accounts of him today  sometimes mr cathro had hopes of him other than those that could only be revealed in a shameful whisper with the door shut not so bad he might say to mr mclean if he keeps it up we may squeeze him through yet without trusting toto what i was fool enough to mention to you the mathematics are his weak point theres nothing practical about him except when its needed to carry out his devils designs and he cares not a doit about the line a b nor what its doing in the circle k but theres whiles he surprises me when were at homer he has the spirit ot man even when he bogles at the sense  but the next time ivie called for a report  in his great days so glittering so brief the days of the penny life tommy looking back to this year was sure that he had never really tried to work but he had he did his very best doggedly wearily sitting at the round table till elspeth feared that he was killing himself and gave him a melancholy comfort by saying so an hour afterwards he might discover that he had been far away from his books looking on at his affecting death and counting the mourners at the funeral  had he thought that grizels discovery was making her unhappy he would have melted at once but never did she look so proud as when she scornfully passed him by and he wagged his head complacently over her coming chagrin when she heard that he had carried the highest bursary then she would know what she had flung away this should have helped him to another struggle with his lexicon but it only provided a breeze for the kite which flew so strong that he had to let go the string  aaron and the dominie met one day in the square and to aarons surprise mr cathros despondency about tommy was more pronounced than before i wonder at that the warper said for i assure you he has been harder at it than ever thae last nights whats more he used to look doleful as he sat at his table but i notice now that hes as sweer to leave off as hes keen to begin and the face of him is a eagerness too and he reads ower to himself what he has wrote and wags his head at it as if he thought it grand  say you so asked cathro suspiciously does he leave what he writes lying about aaron  no but he takes it to you does he no  not him said the dominie emphatically i may be mistaken aaron but im doubting the young whelp is at his tricks again  the dominie was right and before many days passed he discovered what was tommys new and delicious occupation  for years mr cathro had been in the habit of writing letters for such of the populace as could not guide a pen and though he often told them not to come deaving him he liked the job unexpected presents of a hen or a ham occasionally arriving as his reward while the personal matters thus confided to him as if he were a safe for the banking of private histories gave him and his wife gossip for winter nights of late the number of his clients had decreased without his noticing it so confident was he that they could not get on without him but he received a shock at last from andrew dickie who came one saturday night with paper envelope a queens head and a request for a letter for bell birse now of tilliedrum  you want me to speir in your name whether shell have you do you asked cathro with a flourish of his pen  its no just so simple as that said andrew and then he seemed to be rather at a loss to say what it was i dinna ken he continued presently with a grave face whether youve noticed that im a gey queer deevil losh i think im the queerest deevil i ken  we are all that the dominie assured him but what do you want me to write  well its like this said andrew im willing to marry her if shes agreeable but i want to make sure that shell take me afore i speir her im a proud man dominie  youre a sly one  am i no said andrew well pleased well could you put the letter in that wy  i wouldna replied mr cathro though i could and i couldna though i would it would defy the face of clay to do it you canny lover  now the dominie had frequently declined to write as he was bidden and had suggested alterations which were invariably accepted but to his astonishment andrew would not give in ill be stepping then he said coolly for if you hinna the knack ot i ken somebody that has  who demanded the irate dominie  i promised no to tell you replied andrew and away he went mr cathro expected him to return presently in humbler mood but was disappointed and a week or two afterwards he heard andrew and mary jane proctor cried in the parish church did bell birse refuse him he asked the kirk officer and was informed that bell had never got a chance his letter was so cunning said john that without speiring her it drew ane frae her in which she let out that she was centred on davit allardyce  but who wrote andrews letter asked mr cathro sharply  i thought it had been yoursel said john and the dominie chafed and lost much of the afternoon service by going over in his mind the names of possible rivals he never thought of tommy  then a week or two later fell a heavier blow at least twice a year the dominie had written for meggy duff to her daughter in ireland a long letter founded on this suggestion dear kaytherine if you dinna send ten shillings immediately your puir auld mother will have neither house nor hame im crying to you fort kaytherine hearken and youll hear my cry across the cauldriff sea he met meggy in the bankers close one day and asked her pleasantly if the time was not drawing nigh for another appeal  i have wrote replied the old woman giving her pocket a boastful smack which she thus explained and it was the whole ten shillings this time and you never got more for me than five  who wrote the letter for you he asked lowering  she too it seemed had promised not to tell  did you promise to tell nobody meggy or just no to tell me he pressed her of a sudden suspecting tommy  just no to tell you she answered and at that  daaa began the dominie and then saved his reputation by adding gont the derivation of the word dagont has puzzled many but here we seem to have it  it is interesting to know what tommy wrote the general opinion was that his letter must have been a triumph of eloquent appeal and indeed he had first sketched out several masterpieces all of some length and in different styles but on the whole not unlike the concoctions of meggys former secretary that is he had dwelt on the duties of daughters on the hardness of the times on the certainty that if katherine helped this time assistance would never be needed again this sort of thing had always satisfied the dominie but tommy despite his several attempts had a vague consciousness that there was something secondrate about them and he tapped on his brain till it responded the letter he despatched to ireland but had the wisdom not to read aloud even to meggy contained nothing save her own words dear kaytherine if you dinna send ten shillings immediately your puir auld mother will have neither house nor hame im crying to you fort kaytherine hearken and youll hear my cry across the cauldriff sea it was a call from the heart which transported katherine to thrums in a second of time she seemed to see her mother again grown frail since last they metand so all was well for meggy tommy did not put all this to himself but he felt it and after that he could not have written the letter differently happy tommy to be an artist is a great thing but to be an artist and not know it is the most glorious plight in the world  other fickle clients put their correspondence into the boys hands and cathro found it out but said nothing dignity kept him in check he did not even let the tawse speak for him so well did he dissemble that tommy could not decide how much he knew and dreaded his getting hold of some of the letters yet pined to watch his face while he read them this could not last forever mr cathro was like a haughty kettle which has choked its spout that none may know it has come aboil and we all know what in that event must happen sooner or later to the lid  the three boys who had college in the tail of their eye had certain privileges not for the herd it was taken for granted that when knowledge came their way they needed no overseer to make them stand their ground and accordingly for great part of the day they had a back bench to themselves with half a dozen hedges of boys and girls between them and the dominie from his chair mr cathro could not see them but a footboard was nailed to it and when he stood on this as he had an aggravating trick of doing softly and swiftly they were suddenly in view a large fire had been burning all day and the atmosphere was soporific mr cathro was so sleepy himself that the sight of a nodding head enraged him like a caricature and he was on the footboard frequently for the reason that makes bearded men suck peppermints in church against his better judgment he took several peeps at tommy whom he had lately suspected of writing his letters in school or at least of gloating over them on that back bench today he was sure of it however absorbing euclid may be even the fortyseventh of the first book does not make you chuckle and wag your head you can bring a substantive in virgil back to the verb that has lost it without looking as if you would like to exhibit them together in the square but tommy was thus elated until he gave way to grief of the most affecting kind now he looked gloomily before him as if all was over now he buried his face in his hands next his eyes were closed as if in prayer all this the dominie stood from him but when at last he began to blubber  at the blackboard was an arithmetic class slates in hand each member adding up aloud in turn a row of figures by and by it was known that cathro had ceased to listen go on his voice rather than himself said and he accepted mary dundass trembling assertion that four and seven make ten such was the faith in cathro that even boys who could add promptly turned their eleven into ten and he did not catch them at it so obviously was his mind as well as his gaze on something beyond that sandy riach a wit who had been waiting his chance for years snapped at it now and roared ten and eleven nineteen go on said cathro and four twenty gasped sandy and eight sixteen he added gaining courage very good nmrmured the dominie whereupon sandy clenched his reputation forever by saying in one glorious mouthful and six eleven and two five and one nocht  there was no laughing at it then though sandy held a levee in the evening they were all so stricken with amazement by one movement they swung round to see what had fascinated cathro and the other classes doing likewise tommy became suddenly the centre of observation big tears were slinking down his face and falling on some sheets of paper which emotion prevented his concealing anon the unusual stillness in the school made him look up but he was dazed like one uncertain of his whereabouts and he blinked rapidly to clear his eyes as a bird shakes water from its wings  mr cathro first uttered what was afterward described as a kind of throttled skirl and then he roared come here whereupon tommy stepped forward heavily and tried as commanded to come to his senses but it was not easy to make so long a journey in a moment and several times as he seemed about to conquer his fears a wave of feeling set them flowing again  take your time said mr cathro grimly i can wait and this had such a helpful effect that tommy was able presently to speak up for his misdeeds they consisted of some letters written at home but brought to the school for private reading and the dominie got a nasty jar when he saw that they were all signed betsy grieve miss betsy grieve servant to mr duthie was about to marry and these letters were acknowledgments of wedding presents now mr cathro had written similar letters for betsy only a few days before  did she ask you to write these for her he demanded fuming and tommy replied demurely that she had he could not help adding though he felt the unwisdom of it she got some other body to do them first but his letters didna satisfy her  oh said mr cathro and it was such a vicious oh that tommy squeaked tremblingly i dinna know who he was  keeping his mouth shut by gripping his underlip with his teeth the dominie read the letters and tommy gazed eagerly at him all fear forgotten soul conquering body the others stood or sat waiting perplexed as to the cause confident of the issue the letters were much finer productions than cathros he had to admit it to himself as he read yet the rivals had started fair for betsy was a recent immigrant from dunkeld way and the letters were to people known neither to tommy nor to the dominie also she had given the same details for the guidance of each a lady had sent a teapot which affected to be new but was not betsy recognized it by a scratch on the lid and wanted to scratch back but politely so tommy wrote when you come to see me we shall have a cup of tea out of your beautiful present and it will be like a meeting of three old friends that was perhaps too polite betsy feared but tommy said authoritatively no the politer the nippier  there was a set of six cups and saucers from peter something who had loved betsy in vain she had shown the dominie and tommy the earrings given her long ago by peter they were bought with sosh checks and the poem he had written about them and she was most anxious to gratify him in her reply all cathro could do however was to wish peter well in some ornate sentences while tommys was a letter that only a tender womans heart could have indited with such beautiful touches about the days which are no more alas forever that betsy listened to it with heaving breast and felt so sorry for her old swain that forgetting she had never loved him she all but gave andrew the goby and returned to peter as for peter who had been getting over his trouble he saw now for the first time what he had lost and he carried betsys dear letter in his oxter pocket and was inconsolable  but the masterpiece went to mrs dinnie baker in return for a flagon bun long ago her daughter janet and betsy had agreed to marry on the same day and many a quip had mrs dinnie cast at their romantic compact but janet died and so it was a sad letter that tommy had to write to her mother im doubting youre no auld enough for this ane softhearted betsy said but she did not know her man tell me some one thing the mother used often to say when she was taking her fun off the pair of you he said and where is she buried was a suggestive question with the happy tag is there a tree hanging over the grave thus assisted he composed a letter that had a tear in every sentence betsy rubbed her eyes red over it and not all its sentiments were allowed to die for mrs dinnie touched to the heart printed the best of them in black licorice on short bread for funeral feasts at which they gave rise to solemn reflections as they went down  nevertheless this letter affected none so much as the writer of it his first rough sketch became so damp as he wrote that he had to abandon his pen and take to pencil while he was revising he had often to desist to dry his eyes on the coverlet of aarons bed which made elspeth weep also though she had no notion what he was at but when the work was finished he took her into the secret and read his letter to her and he almost choked as he did so yet he smiled rapturously through his woe and she knew no better than to be proud of him and he woke next morning with a cold brought on you can see how but his triumph was worth its price  having read the letter in an uncanny silence mr cathro unbottled tommy for the details and out they came with a rush blowing away the cork discretion yet was the dominie slow to strike he seemed to find more satisfaction in surveying his young friend with a wondering gaze that had a dash of admiration in it which tommy was the first to note  i dont mind admitting before the whole school said mr cathro slowly that if these letters had been addressed to me they would have taken me in  tommy tried to look modest but his chest would have its way  you little sacket cried the dominie how did you manage it  i think i thought i was betsy at the time tommy answered with proper awe  she told me nothing about the weepingwillow at the grave said the dominie perhaps in selfdefence  you hadna speired if there was one retorted tommy jealously  what made you think of it  i saw it might come in neat he had said in the letter that the weepingwillow reminded him of the days when janets bonny hair hung down kissing her waist just as the willow kissed the grave  willows dont hang so low as you seem to think said the dominie  yes they do replied tommy i walked three miles to see one to make sure i was near putting in another beautiful bit about weepingwillows  well why didnt you  tommy looked up with an impudent snigger you could never guess he said  answer me at once thundered his preceptor was it because  no interrupted tommy so conscious of mr cathros inferiority that to let him go on seemed waste of time it was because though it is a beautiful thing in itself i felt a servant lassie wouldna have thought ot i was sweer he admitted with a sigh then firmly but i cut it out  again cathro admired reluctantly the hack does feel the difference between himself and the artist cathro might possibly have had the idea he could not have cut it out  but the hack is sometimes or usually or nearly always the artists master and can make him suffer for his demd superiority  what made you snivel when you read the pathetic bits asked cathro with itching fingers  i was so sorry for peter and mrs dinnie tommy answered a little puzzled himself now i saw them so clear  and yet until betsy came to you you had never heard tell of them  no  and on reflection you dont care a doit about them  nno  and you care as little for betsy  no now but at the time i a kind of thought i was to be married to andrew  and even while you blubbered you were saying to yourself what a clever billie i am  mr cathro had certainly intended to end the scene with the strap but as he stretched out his hand for it he had another idea do you know why nether drumgleys sheep are branded with the letters nd he asked his pupils and a dozen replied so as all may ken wha they belong to  precisely said mr cathro and similarly they used to brand a letter on a felon so that all might know whom he belonged to he crossed to the fireplace and picking up a charred stick wrote with it on the forehead of startled tommy the letters st  now said the dominie complacently we know to whom tommy belongs  all were so taken aback that for some seconds nothing could be heard save tommy indignantly wiping his brow then wha is he cried one the mouthpiece of half a hundred  he is one of the two proprietors we have just been speaking of replied cathro dryly and turning again to tommy he said wipe away sentimental tommy try hot water try cold water try a knife but you will never get those letters off you you are branded for ever and ever     chapter xxxvi  of four ministers who afterwards boasted that they had known tommy sandys   bursary examination time had come and to the siege of aberdeen marched a hungry halfdozenthree of them from thrums two from the glenuharity school the sixth was tod lindertis a ploughman from the dubb of prosen his place of study the bothy after lousing time do you hear the klink of quoits or a oneroomed house near it his tutor a dogged little woman who knew not the accusative from the dative but never tired of holding the book while tod recited him someone greets with the goodnatured jeer its your fourth try is it no tod and he answers cheerily it is my lathie and ill keep kick kick kicking away to the nth time  which means till the door flies open says the dogged little woman who is the gallant tods no less gallant wife and already the mother of two i hope tod will succeed this time  the competitors who were to travel part of the way on their shanks met soon after daybreak in cathros yard where a little crowd awaited them parents trying to look humble mr duthie and ramsay cameron thinking of the morning when they set off on the same errandbut the results were different and mr duthie is now a minister and ramsay is in the middle of another wob both dominies were present hating each other for that day only up to the mouth where their icy politeness was a thing to shudder at and each was drilling his detachment to the last moment but by different methods for while mr cathro entreated joe meldrum for gods sake to mind that about the genitive and willie simpson to keep his mouth shut and drink even water sparingly mr ogilvy cracked jokes with gav dishart and explained them to lauchlan mclauchlan think of anything now but what is before you was mr ogilvys advice think of nothing else roared mr cathro but though mr ogilvy seemed outwardly calm it was base pretence his dickie gradually wriggled through the opening of his waistcoat as if bearing a protest from his inward parts and he let it hang crumpled and conspicuous while grizel on the outskirts of the crowd yearned to put it right  grizel was not there she told several people including herself to say goodby to tommy and oh how she scorned elspeth for looking as if life would not be endurable without him knowing what elspeth was tommy had decided that she should not accompany him to the yard of course she was to follow him to aberdeen if he distinguished himselfmr mclean had promised to bring her but she told him of her dream that he headed the bursary list and as this dream coincided with some dreams of his own though not with all it seemed to give her such fortitude that he let her come an expressionless face was tommys so that not even the experienced dominie of glenquharity covertly scanning his rivals lot could tell whether he was gloomy or uplifted he did not seem to be in need of a long sleep like willie simpson nor were his eyes glazed like gav disharts who carried all the problems of euclid before him on an invisible blackboard and dared not even wink lest he displaced them nor did he like tod lindertis answer questions about his money pocket or where he had stowed his bread and cheese with  after envy spare obey the dative put remember pray  mr ogilvy noticed that cathro tapped his forehead doubtfully every time his eyes fell on tommy but otherwise shunned him and he asked what are his chances  thats the laddie replied mr cathro who when you took her ladyship to see corp shiach years ago impersona  i know mr ogilvy interrupted him hastily but how will he stand think you  mr cathro coughed well see he said guardedly  nevertheless tommy was not to get round the corner without betraying a little of himself for elspeth having borne up magnificently when he shook hands screamed at the tragedy of his back and fell into the arms of tods wife whereupon tommy first tried to brazen it out and then kissed her in the presence of a score of witnesses including grizel who stamped her foot though what right had she to be so angry im sure elspeth sobbed that the professor would let me sit beside you i would just hunker on the floor and hold your foot and no say a word tommy gave tods wife an imploring look and she managed to comfort elspeth with predictions of his coming triumph and the reunion to follow grateful elspeth in return asked tommy to help tod when the professors were not looking and he promised after which she had no more fear for tod  and now ye drums that we all carry in our breasts beat your best over the bravest sight ever seen in a small scotch town of an autumn morning the departure of its fighting lads for the lists at aberdeen let the tune be the sweet familiar one you found somewhere in the bible long ago the mothers we leave behind usleave behind us on their knees may it dirl through your bones brave boys to the end as you hope not to be damned and now quick march  a week has elapsed and nowthere is no call for music now for these are but the vanquished crawling back joe meldrum andand another no it is not tod he stays on in aberdeen for he is a twelvepound tenner the two were within a mile of thrums at three oclock but after that they lagged waiting for the gloaming when they stole to their homes ducking as they passed windows without the blinds down elspeth ran to tommy when he appeared in the doorway and then she got quickly between him and aaron the warper was sitting by the fire at his evening meal and he gave the wanderer a long steady look then without a word returned to his porridge and porter it was a less hearty welcome home even than joes his mother was among those who had wept to lose her son but when he came back to her she gave him a whack on the head with the thieval  aaron asked not a question about those days in aberdeen but he heard a little about them from elspeth tommy had not excused himself to elspeth he had let her do as she liked with his head this was a great treat to her and while it lay pressed against hers she made remarks about aberdeen professors which it would have done them good to hear these she repeated to aaron who was about to answer roughly and then suddenly put her on his knee instead  they didna ask the right questions she told him and when the warper asked if tommy had said so she declared that he had refused to say a word against them which seemed to her to cover him with glory but he doubted they would make that mistake afore he started she said brightly so you see he saw through them afore ever he set eyes on them  corp would have replied admiringly to this oh the little deevil when he heard of tommys failure he wanted to fight gav dishart and willie simpson but aaron was another kind of confidant and even when she explained on tommys authority that there are two kinds of cleverness the kind you learn from books and a kind that is inside yourself which latter was tommys kind he only replied  he can take it wi him to the herding then and see if itll keep the cattle frae stravaiging  its no that kind of cleverness either said elspeth quaking and quaked also tommy who had gone to the garret to listen through the floor  no i would like to ken what use his cleverness can be put to then said aaron and elspeth answered nothing and tommy only sighed for that indeed was the problem but though to these three and to cathro and to mr and mrs mclean and to others more mildly interested it seemed a problem beyond solution there was one in thrums who rocked her arms at their denseness a girl growing so long in the legs that twice within the last year she had found it necessary to let down her parramatty frock as soon as she heard that tommy had come home vanquished she put on the quaint blue bonnet with the white strings in which she fondly believed she looked ever so old her period of mourning was at an end but she still wore her black dress and forgetting all except that he was unhappy she ran to a certain little house to comfort him but she did not go in for through the window she saw elspeth petting him and that somehow annoyed her in the evening however she called on mr cathro  perhaps you want to know why she who at last saw sentimental tommy in his true light and spurned him accordingly now exerted herself in his behalf instead of going on with the papering of the surgery well that was the reason she had put the question to herself beforenot indeed before going to monypenny but before calling on the dominieand decided that she wanted to send tommy to college because she disliked him so much that she could not endure the prospect of his remaining in thrums now are you satisfied  she could scarcely take time to say goodevening to mr cathro before telling him the object of her visit the letters tommy has been writing for people are very clever are they not she began  youve heard of them have you  everybody has heard of them she said injudiciously and he groaned and asked if she had come to tell him this but he admitted their cleverness whereupon she asked well if he is clever at writing letters would he not be clever at writing an essay  i wager my head against a snuff mull that he would be but what are you driving at  i was wondering whether he could not win the prize i heard dr mcqueen speaking about theis it not called the hugh blackadder  my head against a buckie that he could sit down grizel i see what you mean now ay but the pity is hes not eligible for the hugh blackadder oh that he was oh that he was it would make ogilvy of glenquharity sing small at last his loons have carried the blackadder for the last seven years without a break the hugh blackadder mortification the bequest is called and deed it has been a sore mortification to me  calming down he told her the story of the bequest hugh blackadder was a thrums man who made a fortune in america and bequeathed the interest of three hundred pounds of it to be competed for yearly by the youth of his native place he had grown fond of thrums and all its ways over there and left directions that the prize should be given for the best essay in the scots tongue the ministers of the town and glens to be the judges the competitors to be boys who were going to college but had not without it the wherewithal to support themselves the ministers took this to mean that those who carried small bursaries were eligible and indeed it had usually gone to a bursar  sentimental tommy would not have been able to compete if he had got a bursary mr cathro explained because however small it was mr mclean meant to double it and he cant compete without it for mclean refuses to help him now he was here an hour since saying the laddie was obviously hopeless so i never thought of entering tommy for the blackadder no it will go to ogilvys lauchlan mclauchlan who is a twelvepounder and as there can be no competitors hell get it without the trouble of coming back to write the essay  but suppose mr mclean were willing to do what he promised if tommy won the blackadder  its useless to appeal to mclean hes hard set against the laddie now and washes his hands of him saying that aaron latta is right after all he may soften and get tommy into a trade to save him from the herding but send him to college he wont and indeed hes right the laddies a fool  not at writing let  and what is the effect of his letterwriting but to make me ridiculous me i wonder you can expect me to move a finger for him he has been my torment ever since his inscrutable face appeared at my door  never mind him said grizel cunningly but think what a triumph it would be to you if your boy beat mr ogilvys  the dominie rose in his excitement and slammed the table my certie lassie but it would he cried ogilvy looks on the blackadder as his perquisite and hes surer of it than ever this year and theres no doubt but tommy would carry it my head to a buckie preen he would carry it and then oh for a sight of ogilvys face oh for he broke off abruptly but whats the good of thinking of it he said dolefully mr mcleans a firm man when he makes up his mind  nevertheless though mclean who had a scotchmans faith in the verdict of professors and had been bitterly disappointed by tommys failure refused to be converted by the dominies entreaties he yielded to them when they were voiced by ailie brought into the plot vice grizel retired and elspeth got round aaron and so it came about that with his usual luck tommy was given another chance present at the competition which took place in the thrums school the rev mr duthie the rev mr dishart the rev mr gloag of noran side the rev mr lorrimer of glenquharity these on hairbottomed chairs and mr cathro and mr ogilvy cane present also to a less extent that is to say their faces at the windows corp and others who applauded the local champion when he entered and derided mclauchlan the subject of the essay was changed yearly this time a day in church was announced and immediately lauchlan mclauchlan who had not missed a service since his scarlet fever year and too few then smote his red head in agony while tommy who had missed as many as possible looked calmly confident for two hours the competitors were put into a small room communicating with the larger one and tommy began at once with a confident smirk that presently gave way to a most holy expression while lauchlan gaped at him and at last got started also but had to pause occasionally to rub his face on his sleeve for like corp he was one of the kind who cannot think without perspiring in the large room the ministers gossiped about eternal punishment and of the two dominies one sat at his ease like a passenger who knows that the coach will reach the goal without any exertion on his part while the other paced the floor with many a despondent glance through the open door whence the scraping proceeded and the one was pleasantly cool and the other in a plot of heat and the one made genial remarks about everyday matters and the answers of the other stood on their heads it was a familiar comedy to mr ogilvy hardly a variation on what had happened five times in six for many years the same scene the same scraping in the little room the same background of ministers blackaviced mr lorrimer had begun to bark again the same dominies everything was as it had so often been except that he and cathro had changed places it was cathro who sat smiling now and mr ogilvy who dolefully paced the floor  to be able to write throughout mr ogilvys life save when he was about one and twenty this had seemed the great thing and he ever approached the thought reverently as if it were a maid of more than mortal purity and it is and because he knew this she let him see her face which shall ever be hidden from those who look not for the soul and to help him nearer to her came assistance in strange guise the loss of loved ones dolour unutterable but still she was beyond his reach night by night when the only light in the glen was the schoolhouse lamp of use at least as a landmark to solitary travellerswho miss it nowadays for it burns no moreshe hovered over him nor did she deride his hopeless efforts but rather as she saw him go from black to gray and from gray to white in her service were her luminous eyes sorrowful because she was not for him and she bent impulsively toward him so that once or twice in a long life he touched her fingers and a heavenly spark was lit for he had risen higher than himself and that is literature  he knew that oblivion was at hand ready to sweep away his pages almost as soon as they were filled do we not all hear her besom when we pause to dip but he had done his best and he had a sense of humor and perhaps some day would come a pupil of whom he could make what he had failed to make of himself that prodigy never did come though it was not for want of nursing and there came at least in succession most maddening to mr cathro a row of youths who could be trained to carry the hugh blackadder mr ogilvys many triumphs in this competition had not dulled his appetite for more and depressed he was at the prospect of a reverse that it was coming now he could not doubt mclauchlan who was to be rev had a flow of words which would prevent his perspiring much in the pulpit but he could no more describe a familiar scene with the pen than a milkmaid can draw a cow the thrums representatives were sometimes as little gifted it is true and never were they so well exercised but this tommy had the knack of it as mr ogilvy could not doubt for the story of his letterwriting had been through the glens  keep up your spirits mr lorrimer had said to mm as they walked together to the fray cathros loon may compose the better of the two but as i understand the first years of his life were spent in london and so he may bogle at the scotch  but the dominie replied dont buoy me up on a soap bubble if theres as much in him as i fear that should be a help to him instead of a hindrance for it will have set him athinking about the words he uses  and the satisfaction on tommys face when the subject of the essay was given out with the businesslike way in which he set to work had added to the dominies misgivings if anything was required to dishearten him utterly it was provided by cathros confident smile the two thrums ministers were naturally desirous that tommy should win but the younger of them was very fond of mr ogilvy and noticing his unhappy peeps through the door dividing the rooms proposed that it should be closed he shut it himself and as he did so he observed that tommy was biting his pen and frowning while mclauchlan having ceased to think was getting on nicely but it did not strike mr dishart that this was worth commenting on  are you not satisfied with the honors you have already got you greedy man he said laying his hand affectionately on mr ogilvy who only sighed for reply  it is well that the prize should go to different localities for in that way its sphere of usefulness is extended remarked pompous mr gloag who could be impartial as there was no candidate from noran side he was a minister much in request for church soirees where he amused the congregations so greatly with personal anecdote about himself that they never thought much of him afterwards there is one such minister in every presbytery  and to have carried the hugh blackadder seven times running is surely enough for any one locality even though it be glenquharity said mr lorrimer preparing for defeat  theres consolation for you sir said mr cathro sarcastically to his rival who tried to take snuff in sheer bravado but let it slip through his fingers and after that until the two hours were up the talk was chiefly of how tommy would get on at aberdeen but it was confined to the four ministers and one dominie mr ogilvy still hovered about the door of communication and his face fell more and more making mr dishart quite unhappy  im an old fool the dominie admitted but i cant help being cast down the fact is thati have only heard the scrape of one pen for nearly an hour  poor lauchlan exclaimed mr cathro rubbing his hands gleefully and indeed it was such a shameless exhibition that the auld licht minister said reproachfully you forget yourself mr cathro let us not be unseemly exalted in the hour of our triumph  then mr cathro sat upon his hands as the best way of keeping them apart but the moment mr disharts back presented itself he winked at mr ogilvy he winked a good deal more presently for after allhow to tell it tommy was ignominiously beaten making such a beggarly show that the judges thought it unnecessary to take the essays home with them for leisurely consideration before pronouncing mr lauchlan mclauchlan winner there was quite a commotion in the schoolroom at the end of the allotted time the two competitors had been told to hand in their essays and how mr mclauchlan was sniggering is not worth recording so dumfounded confused and raging was tommy he clung to his papers crying fiercely that the two hours could not be up yet and lauchlan having tried to keep the laugh in too long it exploded in his mouth whereupon said he with a guffaw he hasna written a word for near an hour  what it was you i heard cried mr ogilvy gleaming while the unhappy cathro tore the essay from tommys hands essay it was no more an essay than a twig is a tree for the gowk had stuck in the middle of his second page yes stuck is the right expression as his chagrined teacher had to admit when the boy was crossexamined he had not been up to some of his tricks he had stuck and his explanations as you will admit merely emphasized his incapacity  he had brought himself to public scorn for lack of a word what word they asked testily but even now he could not tell he had wanted a scotch word that would signify how many people were in church and it was on the tip of his tongue but would come no farther puckle was nearly the word but it did not mean so many people as he meant the hour had gone by just like winking he had forgotten all about time while searching his mind for the word  when mr ogilvy heard this he seemed to be much impressed repeatedly he nodded his head as some beat time to music and he muttered to himself the right wordyes thats everything and the time went by like winkingexactly precisely and he would have liked to examine tommys bumps but did not nor said a word aloud for was he not there in mclauchlans interest  the other five were furious even mr lorrimer though his man had won could not smile in face of such imbecility you little tattie doolie cathro roared were there not a dozen words to wile from if you had an illwill to puckle what ailed you at manzy or  i thought of manzy replied tommy woefully for he was ashamed of himself butbut a manses a swarm it would mean that the folk in the kirk were buzzing thegither like bees instead of sitting still  even if it does mean that said mr duthie with impatience what was the need of being so particular surely the art of essaywriting consists in using the first word that comes and hurrying on  thats how i did said the proud mclauchlan who is now leader of a party in the church and a figure in edinburgh during the month of may  i see interposed mr gloag that mclauchlan speaks of there being a mask of people in the church mask is a fine scotch word  admirable assented mr dishart i thought of mask whimpered tommy but that would mean the kirk was crammed and i just meant it to be middling full  flow would have done suggested mr lorrimer  flows but a handful said tommy  curran then you jackanapes  currans no enough  mr lorrimer flung up his hands in despair  i wanted something between curran and mask said tommy dogged yet almost at the crying  mr ogilvy who had been hiding his admiration with difficulty spread a net for him you said you wanted a word that meant middling full well why did you not say middling fullor fell mask  yes why not demanded the ministers unconsciously caught in the net  i wanted one word replied tommy unconsciously avoiding it  you jewel muttered mr ogilvy under his breath but mr cathro would have banged the boys head had not the ministers interfered  it is so easy too to find the right word said mr gloag  its no its as difficult as to hit a squirrel cried tommy and again mr ogilvy nodded approval  but the ministers were only pained  the lad is merely a numskull said mr dishart kindly  and no teacher could have turned him into anything else said mr duthie  and so cathro you need not feel sore over your defeat added mr gloag but nevertheless cathro took tommy by the neck and ran him out of the parish school of thrums when he returned to the others he found the ministers congratulating mclauchlan whose nose was in the air and complimenting mr ogilvy who listened to their formal phrases solemnly and accepted their handshakes with a dry chuckle  ay grin away sir the mortified dominie of thrums said to him sourly the joke is on your side  you are right sir replied mr ogilvy mysteriously the joke is on my side and the best of it is that not one of you knows what the joke is  and then an odd thing happened as they were preparing to leave the school the door opened a little and there appeared in the aperture the face of tommy tearstained but excited i ken the word now he cried it came to me a at once it is hantle  the door closed with a victorious bang just in time to prevent cathro  oh the sumph exclaimed mr lauchlan mclauchlan as if it mattered what the word is now  and said mr dishart cathro you had better tell aaron latta that the sooner he sends this nincompoop to the herding the better  but mr ogilvy giving his lauchlan a push that nearly sent him sprawling said in an ecstasy to himself he had to think of it till he got itand he got it the laddie is a genius they were about to tear up tommys essay but he snatched it from them and put it in his oxter pocket i am a collector of curiosities he explained and this paper may be worth money yet  well said cathro savagely i have one satisfaction i ran him out of my school  who knows replied mr ogilvy but what you may be proud to dust a chair for him when he comes back     chapter xxxvii  the end of a boyhood   convinced of his own worthlessness tommy was sufficiently humble now but aaron latta nevertheless marched to the square on the following market day and came back with the boys sentence elspeth being happily absent  i say nothing about the disgrace you have brought on this house the warper began without emotion for it has been a shamed house since afore you were born and its a small offence to skail on a clarty floor but now ive done more for you than i promised jean myles to do and you had your pick atween college and the herding and the herding youve chosen twice i call you no names you ken best what youre fitted for but ive seen the farmer of the dubb of prosen the day and he was shorthanded through the loss of tod lindertis so youre feed to him dinna think you get tods place itll be years afore you rise to that but its right and proper that as he steps up you should step down  the dubb of prosen cried tommy in dismay its fifteen miles frae here  its a that  butbutbut elspeth and me never thought of my being so far away that she couldna see me we thought of a farmer near thrums  the farther youre frae her the better said aaron uneasily yet honestly believing what he said  itll kill her tommy cried fiercely with only his own suffering to consider he would probably have nursed it into a play through which he stalked as the noble child of misfortune but in his anxiety for elspeth he could still forget himself fine you ken she canna do without me he screamed  she maun be weaned replied the warper with a show of temper he was convinced that the sooner elspeth learned to do without tommy the better it would be for herself in the end but in his way of regarding the boy there was also a touch of jealousy pathetic rather than forbidding to him he left the task of breaking the news to elspeth and tommy terrified lest she should swoon under it was almost offended when she remained calm but alas the reason was that she thought she was going with him  will we have to walk all the way to the dubb of prosen she asked quite brightly and at that tommy twisted about in misery you are noyou canna he began and then dodged the telling wewe may get a lift in a cart he said weakly  and ill sit aside you in the fields and make chains o the gowans will i no speak tommy  ayay will you he groaned  and well have a wee wee room to oursels and  he broke down oh elspeth he cried it was illdone of me no to stick to my books and get a bursary and it was waur o me to bother about that word im a scoundrel i am im a black im a  but she put her hand on his mouth saying im fonder o you than ever tommy and ill like the dubb o prosen fine and what does it matter where we are when were thegither which was poor comfort for him but still he could not tell her the truth and so in the end aaron had to tell her it struck her down and the doctor had to be called in during the night to stop her hysterics when at last she fell asleep tommys arm was beneath her and by and by it was in agony but he set his teeth and kept it there rather than risk waking her  when tommy was out of the way aaron did his clumsy best to soothe her sometimes half shamefacedly pressing her cheek to his and she did not repel him but there was no response dinna take on in that way dawtie he would say ill be good to you  but youre no tommy elspeth answered  im not im but a stunted tree blasted in my youth but for a that i would like to have somebody to care for me and theres none to dot elspeth if you winna ill gang walks wi you ill take you to the fishing ill come to the garret at night to hap you up illill teach you the games i used to play mysel im no sure but what you might make something o me yet bairn if you tried hard  but youre no tommy elspeth wailed again and when he advised her to put tommy out of her mind for a little and speak of other things she only answered innocently what else is there to speak about  mr mclean had sent tommy a pound and so was done with him but ailie still thought him a dear though no longer a wonder and elspeth took a strange confession to her how one night she was so angry with god that she had gone to bed without saying her prayers she had just meant to keep him in suspense for a little and then say them but she fell asleep and that was not the worst for when she woke in the morning and saw that she was still living she was glad she had not said them but next night she said them twice  and this too is another flash into her dark character tommy who never missed saying his prayers and could say them with surprising quickness told her god is fonder of lonely lassies than of any other kind and every time you greet it makes him greet and when youre cheerful it makes him cheerful too this was meant to dry her eyes but it had not that effect for said elspeth vindictively well then ill just make him as miserable as i can  when tommy was merely concerned with his own affairs he did not think much about god but he knew that no other could console elspeth and his love for her usually told him the right things to say and while he said them he was quite carried away by his sentiments and even wept over them but within the hour he might be leering they were beautiful and were repeated of course to mrs mclean who told her husband of them declaring that this boys love for his sister made her a better woman  but nevertheless said ivie mr cathro assures me  he is prejudiced retorted mrs mclean warmly prejudice being a failing which all women marvel at just listen to what the boy said to elspeth today he said to her when i am away try for a whole day to be better than you ever were before and think of nothing else and then when prayertime comes you will see that you have been happy without knowing it fancy his finding out that  i wonder if he ever tried it himself said mr mclean  ivie think shame of yourself  well even cathro admits that he has a kind of cleverness but  cleverness exclaimed ailie indignantly that is not cleverness it is holiness and leaving the cynic she sought elspeth and did her good by pointing out that a girl who had such a brother should try to save him pain he is very miserable dear she said because you are so unhappy if you looked brighter think how that would help him and it would show that you are worthy of him so elspeth went home trying hard to look brighter but made a sad mess of it  think of getting letters frae me every time the post comes in said tommy and then indeed her face shone  and then elspeth could write to himyes as often as ever she liked this pleased her even more it was such an exquisite thought that she could not wait but wrote the first one before he started and he answered it across the table and mrs mclean made a letter bag with two strings to it and showed her how to carry it about with her in a safer place than a pocket  then a cheering thing occurred came corp with the astounding news that in the glenquharity dominies opinion tommy should have got the hugh blackadder  he says he is glad he wasna judge because he would have had to give you the prize and he laughs like to split at the ministers for giving it to lauchlan mclauchlan  now great was the repute of mr ogilvy and tommy gaped incredulous he had no word of that at the time he said  no likely he says if the ministers was so doited as to think his loon did best it wasna for him to conter them  man corp you came me aff my feet how do you ken this  corp had promised not to tell and he thought he did not tell but tommy was too clever for him grizel it appeared had heard mr ogilvy saying this strange thing to the doctor and she burned to pass it on to tommy but she could not carry it to him herself becausewhy was it oh yes because she hated him so she made a messenger of corp and warned him against telling who had sent him with the news  half enlightened tommy began to strut again you see theres something in me for all they say he told elspeth listen to this at the bursary examinations there was some english we had to turn into latin and it said no man ever attained supreme eminence who worked for mere lucre such efforts must ever be bounded by base mediocrity none shall climb high but he who climbs for love for in truth where the heart is there alone shall the treasure be found elspeth it came ower me in a clink how true that was and i sat saying it to myself though i saw gav dishart and willie simpson and the rest beginning to put it into latin at once as little taen up wi the words as if they had been about auld hannibal i aye kent elspeth that i could never do much at the learning but i didna see the reason till i read that syne i kent that playing so reallike in the den and telling about my fits when it wasna me that had them but corp and mourning for lewis doigs father and writing letters for folk so grandly and a my other queer ploys that ended in cathros calling me sentimental tommy was what my heart was in and i saw in a jiffy that if thae things were work i should soon rise to supreme eminence  but theyre no said elspeth sadly  no he admitted his face falling but elspeth if i was to hear some day of work i could put my heart into as if it were a game i wouldna be laug in finding the treasure syne oh the blatter i would make  i doubt theres no sic work she answered but he told her not to be so sure i thought there wasna mysel he said till now but sure as death my heart was as taen up wi hunting for the right word as if it had been a game and that was how the time slipped by so quick yet it was paying work for the way i did it made mr ogilvy see i should have got the prize and a body kens theres more cleverness in him than in a cartload o ministers  but but there are no more hugh blackadders to try for tommy  thats nothing there maun be other work o the same kind elspeth cheer up i tell you ill find a wy  but you didna ken yoursel that you should have got the hugh blackadder  he would not let this depress him i ken now he said nevertheless why he should have got it was a mystery which he longed to fathom mr ogilvy had returned to glenquharity so that an explanation could not be drawn from him even if he were willing to supply it which was improbable but tommy caught grizel in the bankers close and compelled her to speak  i wont tell you a word of what mr ogilvy said she insisted in her obstinate way and oh how she despised corp for breaking his promise  corp didna ken he telled me said tommy less to clear corp than to exalt himself i wriggled it out o him but even this did not bring grizel to a proper frame of mind so he said to annoy her  at any rate youre fond o me  i am not she replied stamping i think you are horrid  what else made you send corp to me  i did that because i heard you were calling yourself a blockhead  oho said he so you have been speiring about me though you winna speak to me  grizel looked alarmed and thinking to weaken his case said hastily i very nearly kept it from you i said often to myself i wont tell him  so you have been thinking a lot about me was his prompt comment  if i have she retorted i did not think nice things and what is more i was angry with myself for telling corp to tell you  surely this was crushing but apparently tommy did not think so for he said you did it against your will that means i hare a power over you that you canna resist oho oho  had she become more friendly so should he had she shed one tear he would have melted immediately but she only looked him up and down disdainfully and it hardened him he said with a leer i ken what makes you hold your hands so tight its to keep your arms frae wagging and then her cry how do you know convicted her he had not succeeded in his mission but on his way home he muttered triumphantly i did her i did her and once he stopped to ask himself the question was it because my heart was in it it was their last meeting till they were man and woman                                       a blazing sun had come out on top of heavy showers and the land reeked and smelled as of the washtub the smaller girls of monypenny were sitting in passages playing at fivey just as sappho for instance used to play it but they heard the dubb of prosen cart draw up at aaron lattas door and they followed it to see the last of tommy sandys corp was already there calling in at the door every time he heard a sob dinna elspeth dinna hell find a wy but grizel had refused to come though tommy knew that she had been asking when he started and which road the cart would take well he was not giving her a thought at any rate his box was in the cart now and his face was streaked with tears that were all for elspeth she should not have come to the door but she came andit was such a pitiable sight that aaron latta could not look on he went hurriedly to his workshop but not to warp and even the carter was touched and he said to tommy i tell you what man i have to go round by causeway end smiddy and you and the crittur have time if you like to take the short cut and meet me at the far corner o caddam wood  so tommy and elspeth holding each others hands took the short cut and they came to the far end of caddam and elspeth thought they had better say it here before the cart came but tommy said he would walk back with her through the wood as far as the toom well and they could say it there they tried to say it at the well butelspeth was still with him when he returned to the far corner of caddam where the cart was now awaiting him the carter was sitting on the shaft and he told them he was in no hurry and what is more he had the delicacy to turn his back on them and struck his horse with the reins for looking round at the sorrowful pair they should have said it now but first tommy walked back a little bit of the way with elspeth and then she came back with him and that was to be the last time but he could not leave her and so there they were in the wood looking woefully at each other and it was not said yet  they had said it now and all was over they were several paces apart elspeth smiled she had promised to smile because tommy said it would kill him if she was greeting at the very end but what a smile it was tommy whistled he had promised to whistle to show that he was happy as long as elspeth could smile she stood still but he went on turning round every few yards toto whistle never forget day nor night what i said to you he called to her youre the only one i love and i care not a hair for grizel  but when he disappeared shouting to her ill find a wy ill find a wy she screamed and ran after him he was already in the cart and it had started he stood up in it and waved his hand to her and she stood on the dyke and waved to him and thus they stood waving till a hollow in the road swallowed cart and man and boy then elspeth put her hands to her eyes and went sobbing homeward  when she was gone a girl who had heard all that passed between them rose from among the broom of caddam and took elspeths place on the dyke where she stood motionless waiting for the cart to reappear as it climbed the other side of the hollow she wore a black frock and a blue bonnet with white strings but the cart was far away and tommy thought she was elspeth and springing to his feet again in the cart he waved and waved at first she did not respond for had she not heard him say youre the only one i love and i care not a hair for grizel and she knew he was mistaking her for elspeth but by and by it struck her that he would be more unhappy if he thought elspeth was too overcome by grief to wave to him her arms rocked passionately no no she would not lift them to wave to him he could be as unhappy as he chose then in a spirit of selfabnegation that surely raised her high among the daughters of men though she was but a painted ladys child she waved to him to save him pain and he still erect in the cart waved back until nothing could be seen by either of them save wood and fields and a long deserted road
