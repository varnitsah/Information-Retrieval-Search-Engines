 may 19  dear e  this letter i consecrate to you because i know that the persons and things to be introduced into it will most particularly be appreciated by you  in your evening reading circles macaulay sidney smith and milman have long been such familiar names that you will be glad to go with me over all the scenes of my morning breakfast at sir charles trevelyans yesterday lady trevelyan i believe i have said before is the sister of macaulay and a daughter of zachary macaulaythat undaunted laborer for the slave whose place in the hearts of all english christians is little below saintship  we were set down at welbourne terrace somewhere i believe about eleven oclock and found quite a number already in the drawing room i had met macaulay before but as you have not you will of course ask a ladys first question how does he look  well my dear so far as relates to the mere outward husk of the soul our engravers and daguerreotypists have done their work as well as they usually do the engraving that you get in the best editions of his works may be considered i suppose a fair representation of how he looks when he sits to have his picture taken which is generally very different from the way any body looks at any other time people seem to forget in taking likenesses that the features of the face are nothing but an alphabet and that a dry dead map of a persons face gives no more idea how one looks than the simple presentation of an alphabet shows what there is in a poem  macaulays whole physique gives you the impression of great strength and stamina of constitution he has the kind of frame which we usually imagine as peculiarly english short stout and firmly knit there is something hearty in all his demonstrations he speaks in that full round rolling voice deep from the chest which we also conceive of as being more common in england than america as to his conversation it is just like his writing that is to say it shows very strongly the same qualities of mind  i was informed that he is famous for a most uncommon memory one of those men to whom it seems impossible to forget any thing once read and he has read all sorts of things that can be thought of in all languages a gentleman told me that he could repeat all the old newgate literature hanging ballads last speeches and dying confessions while his knowledge of milton is so accurate that if his poems were blotted out of existence they might be restored simply from his memory this same accurate knowledge extends to the latin and greek classics and to much of the literature of modern europe had nature been required to make a man to order for a perfect historian nothing better could have been put together especially since there is enough of the poetic fire included in the composition to fuse all these multiplied materials together and color the historical crystallization with them  macaulay is about fifty he has never married yet there are unmistakable evidences in the breathings and aspects of the family circle by whom he was surrounded that the social part is not wanting in his conformation some very charming young lady relatives seemed to think quite as much of their gifted uncle as you might have done had he been yours  macaulay is celebrated as a conversationalist and like coleridge carlyle and almost every one who enjoys this reputation he has sometimes been accused of not allowing people their fair share in conversation this might prove an objection possibly to those who wish to talk but as i greatly prefer to hear it would prove none to me i must say however that on this occasion the matter was quite equitably managed there were i should think some twenty or thirty at the breakfast table and the conversation formed itself into little eddies of two or three around the table now and then welling out into a great bay of general discourse i was seated between macaulay and milman and must confess i was a little embarrassed at times because i wanted to hear what they were both saying at the same time however by the use of the faculty by which you play a piano with both hands i got on very comfortably  milmans appearance is quite striking tall stooping with a keen black eye and perfectly white haira singular and poetic contrast he began upon architecture and westminster abbeya subject to which i am always awake i told him i had not yet seen westminster for i was now busy in seeing life and the present and by and by i meant to go there and see death and the past  milman was for many years dean of westminster and kindly offered me his services to indoctrinate me into its antiquities  macaulay made some suggestive remarks on cathedrals generally i said that i thought it singular that we so seldom knew who were the architects that designed these great buildings that they appeared to me the most sublime efforts of human genius  he said that all the cathedrals of europe were undoubtedly the result of one or two minds that they rose into existence very nearly contemporaneously and were built by travelling companies of masons under the direction of some systematic organization perhaps you knew all this before but i did not and so it struck me as a glorious idea and if it is not the true account of the origin of cathedrals it certainly ought to be and as our old grandmother used to say im going to believe it  looking around the table and seeing how every body seemed to be enjoying themselves i said to macaulay that these breakfast parties were a novelty to me that we never had them in america but that i thought them the most delightful form of social life  he seized upon the idea as he often does and turned it playfully inside out and shook it on all sides just as one might play with the lustres of a chandelierto see them glitter he expatiated on the merits of breakfast parties as compared with all other parties he said dinner parties are mere formalities you invite a man to dinner because you must invite him because you are acquainted with his grandfather or it is proper you should but you invite a man to breakfast because you want to see him you may be sure if you are invited to breakfast there is something agreeable about you this idea struck me as very sensible and we all generally having the fact before our eyes that we were invited to breakfast approved the sentiment  yes said macaulay depend upon it if a man is a bore he never gets an invitation to breakfast  rather hard on the poor bores said a lady  particularly said macaulay laughing as bores are usually the most irreproachable of human beings did you ever hear a bore complained of when they did not say that he was the best fellow in the world for my part if i wanted to get a guardian for a family of defenceless orphans i should inquire for the greatest bore in the vicinity i should know that he would be a man of unblemished honor and integrity  the conversation now went on to milton and shakspeare macaulay made one remark that gentlemen are always making and that is that there is very little characteristic difference between shakspeares women well there is no hope for that matter so long as men are not women they will think so in general they lump together miranda juliet desdemona and viola    as matter too soft a lasting mark to bear   and best distinguished as black brown or fair  it took mrs jameson to set this matter forth in her characteristics of women a book for which shakspeare if he could get up ought to make her his best bow especially as there are fine things ascribed to him there which i dare say he never thought of careless fellow that he was but i take it every true painter poet and artist is in some sense so far a prophet that his utterances convey more to other minds than he himself knows so that doubtless should all the old masters rise from the dead they might be edified by what posterity has found in their works  some how or other we found ourselves next talking about sidney smith and it was very pleasant to me recalling the evenings when your father has read and we have laughed over him to hear him spoken of as a living existence by one who had known him still i have always had a quarrel with sidney for the wicked use to which he put his wit in abusing good old dr carey and the missionaries in india nay in some places he even stooped to be spiteful and vulgar i could not help therefore saying when macaulay observed that he had the most agreeable wit of any literary man of his acquaintance well it was very agreeable but it could not have been very agreeable to the people who came under the edge of it and instanced his treatment of dr carey some others who were present seemed to feel warmly on this subject too and macaulay said  ah well sidney repented of that afterwards he seemed to cling to his memory and to turn from every fault to his joviality as a thing he could not enough delight to remember  truly wit like charity covers a multitude of sins a man who has the faculty of raising a laugh in this sad earnest world is remembered with indulgence and complacency always  there were several other persons of note present at this breakfast whose conversation i had not an opportunity of hearing as they sat at a distance from me there was lord glenelg brother of sir robert grant governor of bombay whose beautiful hymns have rendered him familiar in america the favorite one commencing when gathering clouds around i view was from his pen lord glenelg formerly sir charles grant himself has been the author of several pieces of poetry which were in their time quite popular  the historian hallam was also present whose constitutional history you will remember gave rise to one of macaulays finest reviews a quiet retiring man with a benignant somewhat sad expression of countenance the loss of an only son has cast a shadow over his life it was on this son that tennyson wrote his in memoriam  sir robert h inglis was also present and mr s held considerable conversation with him knowing that he was both high tory and high church it was an agreeable surprise to find him particularly gentle and bland in manners earnest and devout in religious sentiment i have heard him spoken of even among dissenters as a devout and earnest man another proof this of what mistakes we fall into when we judge the characters of persons at a distance from what we suppose likely to be the effect of their sentiments we often find the professed aristocrat gentle and condescending and the professed supporter of forms spiritual  i think it very likely there may have been other celebrities present whom i did not know i am always finding out a day or two after that i have been with somebody very remarkable and did not know it at the time  after breakfast we found on consulting our list that we were to lunch at surrey parsonage  of all the cities i was ever in london is the most absolutely unmanageable it takes so long to get any where wherever you want to go it seems to take you about two hours to get there from the west end down into the city is a distance that seems all but interminable london is now more than ten miles long and yet this monster city is stretching in all directions yearly and where will be the end of it nobody knows southey says i began to study the map of london though dismayed at its prodigious extent the river is no assistance to a stranger in finding his way there is no street along its banks and no eminence from whence you can look around and take your bearings  you may take these reflections as passing through my mind while we were driving through street after street and going round corner after corner towards the parsonage  surrey chapel and parsonage were the church and residence of the celebrated kowland hill at present the incumbent is the rev mr sherman well known to many of our american clergy by the kind hospitalities and attentions with which he has enriched their stay in london the church maintains a medium rank between congregationalism and episcopacy retaining part of the ritual but being independent in its government the kindness of mr sherman had assembled here a very agreeable company among whom were farquhar tupper the artist cruikshank from whom i received a call the other morning and mr pilatte m p cruikshank is an old man with gray hair and eyebrows strongly marked features and keen eyes he talked to me something about the promotion of temperance by a series of literary sketches illustrated by his pencil  i sat by a lady who was well acquainted with kingsley the author of alton locke hypatia and other works with whom i had some conversation with regard to the influence of his writings  she said that he had been instrumental in rescuing from infidelity many young men whose minds had become unsettled that he was a devoted and laborious clergyman exerting himself without any cessation for the good of his parish  after the company were gone i tried to get some rest as my labors were not yet over we being engaged to dine at sir edward buxtons this was our most dissipated day in london we never tried the experiment again of going to three parties in one day  by the time i got to my third appointment i was entirely exhausted i met here some however whom i was exceedingly interested to see among them samuel gurney brother of elizabeth fry with his wife and family lady edward buxton is one of his daughters all had that air of benevolent friendliness which is characteristic of the sect  dr lushington the companion and venerable associate of wilberforce and clarkson was also present he was a member of parliament with wilberforce forty or fifty years ago he is now a judge of the admiralty court that is to say of the law relating to marine affairs this is a branch of law which the nature of our government in america makes it impossible for us to have he is exceedingly brilliant and animated in conversation  dr cunningham the author of world without souls was present there was there also a master of harrow school  he told me an anecdote which pleased me for several reasons that once when the queen visited the school she put to him the inquiry whether the educational system of england did not give a disproportionate attention to the study of the ancient classics his reply was that her majesty could best satisfy her mind on that point by observing what men the public schools of england had hitherto produced certainly a very adroit reply yet one which would be equally good against the suggestion of any improvement whatever we might as well say see what men we have been able to raise in america without any classical education at all witness benjamin franklin george washington and roger sherman  it is a curious fact that christian nations with one general consent in the early education of youth neglect the volume which they consider inspired and bring the mind at the most susceptible period under the dominion of the literature and mythology of the heathen world and that too when the sacred history and poetry are confessedly superior in literary quality grave doctors of divinity expend their forces in commenting on and teaching things which would be utterly scouted were an author to publish them in english as original compositions a christian community has its young men educated in ovid and anacreon but is shocked when one of them comes out in english with don juan yet probably the latter poem is purer than either  the english literature and poetry of the time of pope and dryden betray a state of association so completely heathenized that an old greek or roman raised from the dead could scarce learn from them that any change had taken place in the religion of the world and even milton often pains one by introducing secondhand pagan mythology into the very shadow of the eternal throne in some parts of the paradise lost the evident imitations of homer are to me the poorest and most painful passages  the adoration of the ancient classics has lain like a dead weight on all modern art and literature because men instead of using them simply for excitement and inspiration have congealed them into fixed imperative rules as the classics have been used i think wonderful as have been the minds educated under them there would have been more variety and originality without them  with which long sermon on a short text i will conclude my letter     letter xx  thursday may 12 my dear i  yesterday what with my breakfast lunch and dinner i was as the fashionable saying is fairly knocked up this expression which i find obtains universally here corresponds to what we mean by being used up they talk of americanisms and i have a little innocent speculation now and then concerning anglicisms i certainly find several here for which i can perceive no more precedent in the well of english undefiled than for some of ours for instance this being knocked up which is variously inflected as for example in the form of a participial adjective as a knocking up affair in the form of a noun as when they say such a person has got quite a knocking up and so on  the fact is if we had ever had any experience in london life we should not have made three engagements in one day to my simple eye it is quite amusing to see how they manage the social machine here people are under such a pressure of engagements that they go about with their lists in their pockets if a wants to invite b to dinner out come their respective lists a says he has only tuesday and thursday open for this week b looks down his list and says that the days are all closed a looks along and says that he has no day open till next wednesday week b however is going to leave town tuesday so that settles the matter as to dining so they turn back again and try the breakfasting for though you cannot dine in but one place a day yet by means of the breakfast and the lunch you can make three social visits if you are strong enough  then there are evening parties which begin at ten oclock the first card of the kind that was sent me which was worded at home at ten oclock i in my simplicity took to be ten in the morning  but here are people staying out night after night till two oclock sitting up all night in parliament and seeming to thrive upon it there certainly is great apology for this in london if it is always as dark drizzling and smoky in the daytime as it has been since i have been here if i were one of the london people i would live by gaslight as they do for the streets and houses are altogether pleasanter by gaslight than by daylight but to ape these customs under our clear american skies so contrary to our whole social system is simply ridiculous  this morning i was exceedingly tired and had a perfect longing to get but of london into some green fieldsto get somewhere where there was nobody so kind mrs b had the carriage and off we drove together by and by we found ourselves out in the country and then i wanted to get out and walk  after a while a lady came along riding a little donkey these donkeys have amused me so much since i have been here at several places on the outskirts of the city they have them standing all girt up with saddles covered with white cloth for ladies to ride on one gets out of london by means of an omnibus to one of these places and then for a few pence can have a ride upon one of them into the country mrs b walked by the side of the lady and said to her something which i did not hear and she immediately alighted and asked me with great kindness if i wanted to try the saddle so i got upon the little beast which was about as large as a goodsized calf and rode a few paces to try him it is a slow but not unpleasant gait and if the creature were not so insignificantly small as to make you feel much as if you were riding upon a cat it would be quite a pleasant affair after dismounting i crept through a hole in a hedge and looked for some flowers and in short made the most that i could of my interview with nature till it came time to go home to dinner for our dinner hour at mr bs is between one and two quite like home in the evening we were to dine at lord shaftesburys  after napping all the afternoon we went to grosvenor square there was only a small select party of about sixteen among the guests were dr mcall hebrew professor in kings college lord wriothesley russell brother of lord john and one of the private chaplains of the queen and the archbishop of canterbury dr mcall is a millenarian he sat next to c at table and they had some conversation on that subject he said those ideas had made a good deal of progress in the english mind  while i was walking down to dinner with lord shaftesbury he pointed out to me in the hall the portrait of his distinguished ancestor antony ashley cooper earl of shaftesbury whose name he bears this ancestor notwithstanding his sceptical philosophy did some good things as he was the author of the habeas corpus act  after dinner we went back to the drawing rooms again and while tea and coffee were being served names were constantly being announced till the rooms were quite full  among the earliest who arrived was mr a mulatto gentleman formerly british consul at liberia i found him a man of considerable cultivation and intelligence evincing much good sense in his observations  i overheard some one saying in the crowd shaftesbury has been about the chimney sweepers again in parliament i said to lord shaftesbury i thought that matter of the chimney sweepers had been attended to long ago and laws made about it  so we have made laws said he but people wont keep them unless we follow them up  he has a very prompt cheerful way of speaking and throws himself into every thing he talks about with great interest and zeal he introduced me to one gentleman i forget his name now as the patron of the shoeblacks on my inquiring what that meant he said that he had started the idea of providing employment for poor street boys by furnishing them with brushes and blacking and forming them into regular companies of shoeblacks each boy has his particular stand where he blacks the shoes of every passer by who chooses to take the trouble of putting up his foot and paying his twopence lord shaftesbury also presented me to a lady who had been a very successful teacher in the ragged schools also to a gentleman who he said had been very active in the london city missions some very ingenious work done in the ragged schools was set on the table for the company to examine and excited much interest  i talked a little while with lord wriothesley russell from him we derived the idea that the queen was particularly careful in the training and religious instruction of her children he said that she claimed that the young prince should be left entirely to his parents in regard to his religious instruction till he was seven years of age but that on examining him at that time they were equally surprised and delighted with his knowledge of the scriptures i must remark here that such an example as the queen sets in the education of her children makes itself felt through all the families of the kingdom domesticity is now the fashion in high life i have had occasion to see in many instances how carefully ladies of rank instruct their children this argues more favorably for the continuance of english institutions than any thing i have seen if the next generation of those who are born to rank and power are educated in the words of fenelon to consider these things as a ministry which they hold for the benefit of the poor the problem of life in england will become easier of solution such are lord shaftesburys views and as he throws them out with unceasing fervor in his conversation and conduct they cannot but powerfully affect not only his own circle but all circles through the kingdom lady shaftesbury is a beautiful and interesting woman and warmly enters into the benevolent plans of her husband a gentleman and lady with whom i travelled said that lord and lady shaftesbury had visited in person the most forlorn and wretched parts of london that they might get by their own eyesight a more correct gauge of the misery to be relieved i did not see lord shaftesburys children but from the crayon likenesses which hung upon the walls they must be a family of uncommon beauty  i talked a little while with the bishop of tuam i was the more interested to do so because he was from that part of ireland which sibyl jones has spoken of as being in so particularly miserable a condition i said how are you doing now in that part of the country there has been a great deal of misery there i hear he said there has been but we have just turned the corner and now i hope we shall see better days the condition of the people has been improved by emigration and other causes till the evils have been brought within reach and we feel that there is hope of effecting a permanent improvement  while i was sitting talking lord shaltesbury brought a gentleman and lady whom he introduced as lord chief justice campbell and lady strathheden lord campbell is a man of most dignified and imposing personal presence tall with a large frame a fine high forehead and strongly marked features naturally enough i did not suppose them to be husband and wife and when i discovered that they were so expressed a good deal of surprise at their difference of titles to which she replied that she did not wonder we americans were sometimes puzzled among the number of titles she seemed quite interested to inquire into our manner of living and customs and how they struck me as compared with theirs the letter of mrs tyler was much talked of and some asked me if i supposed mrs tyler really wrote it expressing a little civil surprise at the style i told them that i had heard it said that it must have been written by some of the gentlemen in the family because it was generally understood that mrs tyler was a very ladylike person some said it does us no harm to be reminded of our deficiencies we need all the responsibility that can be put upon us others said it is certain we have many defects but lord john campbell said there is this difference between our evils and those of slavery ours exist contrary to law those are upheld by law   i did not get any opportunity of conversing with the archbishop of canterbury though this is the second time i have been in company with him he is a most prepossessing man in his appearancesimple courteous mild and affable he was formerly bishop of chester and is now primate of all england  it is some indication of the tendency of things in a country to notice what kind of men are patronized and promoted to the high places of the church sumner is a man refined gentle affable scholarly thoroughly evangelical in sentiment to render him into american phraseology he is in doctrine what we should call a moderate new school man he has been a most industrious writer one of his principal works is his commentary on the new testament in several volumes a work most admirably adapted for popular use combining practical devotion with critical accuracy to an uncommon degree he has also published a work on the evidences of christianity in which he sets forth some evidences of the genuineness of the gospel narrative which could only have been conceived by a mind of peculiar delicacy and which are quite interesting and original he has also written a work on biblical geology which is highly spoken of by sir charles lyell and others if i may believe accounts that i hear this mild and moderate man has shown a most admirable firmness and facility in guiding the ship of the establishment in some critical and perilous places of late years i should add that he is warmly interested in all the efforts now making for the good of the poor  among other persons of distinction this evening i noticed lord and lady palmerston  a lady asked me this evening what i thought of the beauty of the ladies of the english aristocracy she was a scotch lady by the by so the question was a fair one i replied that certainly report had not exaggerated their charms then came a home questionhow the ladies of england compared with the ladies of america now for it patriotism said i to myself and invoking to my aid certain fair saints of my own country whose faces i distinctly remembered i assured her that i had never seen more beautiful women than i had in america grieved was i to be obliged to add but your ladies keep their beauty much later and longer this fact stares one in the face in every company one meets ladies past fifty glowing radiant and blooming with a freshness of complexion and fulness of outline refreshing to contemplate what can be the reason tell us muses and graces what can it be is it the conservative power of sea fogs and coal smokethe same cause that keeps the turf green and makes the holly and ivy flourish how comes it that our married ladies dwindle fade and grow thinthat their noses incline to sharpness and their elbows to angularity just at the time of life when their island sisters round out into a comfortable and becoming amplitude and fulness if it is the fog and the sea coal why then i am afraid we never shall come up with them but perhaps there may be other causes why a country which starts some of the most beautiful girls in the world produces so few beautiful women have not our closeheated stove rooms something to do with it have not the immense amount of hot biscuits hot corn cakes and other compounds got up with the acrid poison of saleratus something to do with it above all has not our climate with its alternate extremes of heat and cold a tendency to induce habits of indoor indolence climate certainly has a great deal to do with it ours is evidently more trying and more exhausting and because it is so we should not pile upon its back errors of dress and diet which are avoided by our neighbors they keep their beauty because they keep their health it has been as remarkable as any thing to me since i have been here that i do not constantly as at home hear one and another spoken of as in miserable health as very delicate c health seems to be the rule and not the exception for my part i must say the most favorable omen that i know of for female beauty in america is the multiplication of water cure establishments where our ladies if they get nothing else do gain some ideas as to the necessity of fresh air regular exercise simple diet and the laws of hygiene in general  there is one thing more which goes a long way towards the continued health of these english ladies and therefore towards their beauty and that is the quietude and perpetuity of their domestic institutions they do not like us fade their cheeks lying awake nights ruminating the awful question who shall do the washing next week or who shall take the chambermaids place who is going to be married or that of the cook who has signified her intention of parting with the mistress their hospitality is never embarrassed by the consideration that their whole kitchen cabinet may desert at the moment that their guests arrive they are not obliged to choose between washing their own dishes or having their cut glass silver and china left to the mercy of a foreigner who has never done any thing but field work and last not least they are not possessed with that ambition to do the impossible in all branches which i believe is the death of a third of the women in america what is there ever read of in books or described in foreign travel as attained by people in possession of every means and appliance which our women will not undertake singlehanded in spite of every providential indication to the contrary who is not cognizant of dinner parties invited in which the lady of the house has figured successively as confectioner cook diningroom girl and lastly rushed up stairs to bathe her glowing cheeks smooth her hair draw on satin dress and kid gloves and appear in the drawing room as if nothing were the matter certainly the undaunted bravery of our american females can never enough be admired other women can play gracefully the head of the establishment but who like them could be head hand and foot all at once  as i have spoken of stoves i will here remark that i have not yet seen one in england neither so far as i can remember have i seen a house warmed by a furnace bright coal fires in grates of polished steel are as yet the lares and penates of old england if i am inclined to mourn over any defection in my own country it is the closing up of the cheerful open fire with its bright lights and dancing shadows and the planting on our domestic hearth of that sullen stifling gnome the airtight i agree with hawthorne in thinking the movement fatal to patriotism for who would fight for an airtight  i have run on a good way beyond our evening company so good by for the present     letter xxi  may 13 dear father  today we are to go out to visit your quaker friend mr alexander at stoke newington where you passed so many pleasant hours during your sojourn in england at half past nine we went into the congregational union which is now in session i had a seat upon the platform where i could command a view of the house it was a most interesting assemblage to me recalling forcibly our new england associations and impressing more than ever on my mind how much of one blood the two countries are these earnest thoughtful intelligentlooking men seemed to transport me back to my own country they received us with most gratifying cordiality and kindness most naturally congregationalism in england must turn with deep interest and sympathy to congregationalism in america in several very cordial addresses they testified their pleasure at seeing us among them speaking most affectionately of you and your labors and your former visit to england the wives and daughters of many of them present expressed in their countenances the deepest and most affectionate feeling it is cheering to feel that an ocean does not divide our hearts and that the christians of america and england are one  in the afternoon we drove out to mr alexanders his place is called paradise and very justly being one more of those home edens in which england abounds where without ostentation or display every appliance of rational enjoyment surrounds one  we were ushered into a cheerful room opening by one glass door upon a brilliant conservatory of flowers and by another upon a neatlykept garden the air was fresh and sweet with the perfume of blossoming trees and every thing seemed doubly refreshing from the contrast with the din and smoke of london our chamber looked out upon a beautiful park shaded with fine old trees while contemplating the white draperies of our windows and the snowy robings of the bed we could not but call to mind the fact of which we were before aware that not an article was the result of the unpaid oil of the slave neither did this restriction voluntarily assumed fetter at all the bountifulness of the table where freegrown sugar coffee rice and spices seemed to derive a double value to our friends from this consideration  some of the quakers carry the principle so far as to refuse money in a business transaction which they have reason to believe has been gained by the unpaid toil of the slave a friend in edinburgh told me of a brother of his in the city of carlisle who kept a celebrated biscuit bakery who received an order from new orleans for a thousand dollars worth of biscuit before closing the bargain he took the buyer into his counting room and told him that he had conscientious objections about receiving money from slaveholders and that in case he were one he should prefer not to trade with him fortunately in this case consistency and interest were both on one side  things like these cannot but excite reflection in ones mind and the query must arise if all who really believe slavery to be a wrong should pursue this course what would be the result there are great practical difficulties in the way of such a course particularly in america where the subject has received comparatively little attention yet since i have been in england i am informed by the friends here that there has been for many years an association of friends in philadelphia who have sent their agents through the entire southern states entering by them into communication with quite a considerable number scattered through the states who either from poverty or principle raise their cotton by free labor that they have established a depot in philadelphia and also a manufactory where the cotton thus received is made into various household articles and thus by dint of some care and selfsacrifice many of them are enabled to abstain entirely from any participation with the results of this crime  as soon as i heard this fact it flashed upon my mind immediately that the beautiful cotton lands of texas are as yet unoccupied to a great extent that no law compels cotton to be raised there by slave labor and that it is beginning to be raised there to some extent by the labor of free german emigrants footnote one small town in texas made eight hundred bales last year by free labor will not something eventually grow out of this i trust so even the smallest chink of light is welcome in a prison if it speak of a possible door which courage and zeal may open i cannot as yet admit the justness of the general proposition that it is an actual sin to eat drink or wear any thing which has been the result of slave labor because it seems to me to be based upon a principle altogether too wide in extent to be consistent in it we must extend it to the results of all labor which is not conducted on just and equitable principles and in order to do this consistently we must needs as st paul says go out of the world but if two systems one founded on wrong and robbery and the other on right and justice are competing with each other should we not patronize the right  i am the more inclined to think that some course of this kind is indicated to the christian world from the reproaches and taunts which proslavery papers are casting upon us for patronizing their cotton at all events the quakers escape the awkwardness of this dilemma  in the evening quite a large circle of friends came to meet us we were particularly interested in the conversation of mr and mrs wesby missionaries from antigua antigua is the only one of the islands in which emancipation was immediate without any previous apprenticeship system and it is the one in which the results of emancipation have been altogether the most happy they gave us a very interesting account of their schools and showed us some beautiful specimens of plain needlework which had been wrought by young girls in them they confirmed all the accounts which i have heard from other sources of the peaceableness docility and good character of the negroes of their kindly disposition and willingness to receive instruction  after tea mr s and i walked out a little while first to a large cemetery where repose the ashes of dr watts this burying ground occupies the site of the dwelling and grounds formerly covered by the residence of sir t abney with whom dr watts spent many of the last years of his life it has always seemed to me that dr wattss rank as a poet has never been properly appreciated if ever there was a poet born he was that man he attained without study a smoothness of versification which with pope was the result of the intensest analysis and most artistic care nor do the most majestic and resounding lines of dryden equal some of his in majesty of volume the most harmonious lines of dryden that i know of are these    when jubal struck the chorded shell      his listening brethren stood around    and wondering on their faces fell      to worship that celestial sound    less than a god they thought there could not dwell    within the hollow of that shell    that spoke so sweetly and so well  the first four lines of this always seem to me magnificently harmonious but almost any verse at random in dr wattss paraphrase of the one hundred and fortyeighth psalm exceeds them both in melody and majesty for instance take these lines    wide as his vast dominion lies      let the creators name be known    loud as his thunder shout his praise      and sound it lofty as his throne     speak of the wonders of that love      which gabriel plays on every chord    from all below and all above      loud hallelujahs to the lord  simply as a specimen of harmonious versification i would place this paraphrase by dr watts above every thing in the english language not even excepting popes messiah but in hymns where the ideas are supplied by his own soul we have examples in which fire fervor imagery roll from the soul of the poet in a stream of versification evidently spontaneous such are all those hymns in which he describes the glories of the heavenly state and the advent of the great events foretold in prophecy for instance this verse from the opening of one of his judgment hymns    lo i behold the scattered shades      the dawn of heaven appears    the sweet immortal morning sheds      its blushes round the spheres  dr johnson in his lives of the poets turns him off with small praise it is true saying that his devotional poetry is like that of others unsatisfactory graciously adding that it is sufficient for him to have done better than others what no one has done well and lastly that he is one of those poets with whom youth and ignorance may safely be pleased but if dr johnson thought irene was poetry it is not singular that he should think the lyrics of watts were not  stoke newington is also celebrated as the residence of de foe we passed by in our walk the ancient mansion in which he lived new river which passes through the grounds of our host is an artificial stream which is said to have been first suggested by his endlessly fertile and industrious mind as productive in practical projects as in books  it always seemed to me that there are three writers which every one who wants to know how to use the english language effectively should study and these are shakspeare bunyan and defoe one great secret of their hold on the popular mind is their being so radically and thoroughly english they have the solid grain of the english oak not veneered by learning and the classics not inlaid with arabesques from other nations but developing wholly out of the english nationality  i have heard that goethe said the reason for the great enthusiasm with which his countrymen regarded him was that he did know how to write german and so also these men knew how to write english i think defoe the most suggestive writer to an artist of fiction that the english language affords that power by which he wrought fiction to produce the impression of reality so that his plague in london was quoted by medical men as an authentic narrative and his life of a cavalier recommended by lord chatham as an historical authority is certainly worth an analysis with him undoubtedly it was an instinct  one anecdote related to us this evening by our friends brought to mind with new power the annoyances to which the quakers have been subjected in england under the old system of church rates it being contrary to the conscientious principles of the quakers to pay these church rates voluntarily they allowed the officers of the law to enter their houses and take whatever article he pleased in satisfaction of the claim on one occasion for the satisfaction of a claim of a few pounds they seized and sold a most rare and costly mantel clock which had a particular value as a choice specimen of mechanical skill and which was worth four or five times the sum owed a friend afterwards repurchased and presented it to the owner  we were rejoiced to hear that these church rates are now virtually abolished the liberal policy pursued in england for the last twentyfive years is doing more to make the church of england and the government generally respectable and respected than the most extortionate exactions of violence  we parted from our kind friends in the morning came back and i sat a while to mr burnard the sculptor who entertained me with various anecdotes he had taken the bust of the prince of wales and i gathered from his statements that young princes have very much the same feelings and desires that other little boys have and that he has a very judicious mother  in the afternoon mr s mrs b and i had a pleasant drive in hyde park as i used to read of heroines of romance doing in the old novels it is delightful to get into this fairyland of parks so green and beautiful which embellish the west end  in the evening we had an engagement at two placesat a highland school dinner and at mr charles dickenss i felt myself too much exhausted for both and so it was concluded that i should go to neither but try a little quiet drive into the country and an early retirement as the most prudent termination of the week while mr s prepared to go to the meeting of the highland school society mr and mrs b took me a little drive into the country after a while they alighted before a new gothic congregational college in st johns wood i found that there had been a kind of teadrinking there by the congregational ministers and their families to celebrate the opening of the college  on returning we called for mr s at the dinner and went for a few moments into the gallery the entertainment being now nearly over here we heard some scottish songs very charmingly sung and what amused me very much a few highland musicians dressed in full costume occasionally marched through the hall playing on their bagpipes as was customary in old scottish entertainments the historian sir archibald alison sheriff of lanarkshire sat at the head of the tablea tall finelooking man of very commanding presence  about nine oclock we retired  may 15 heard mr binney preach this morning he is one of the strongest men among the congregationalists and a very popular speaker he is a tall large man with a finelybuilt head high forehead piercing dark eye and a good deal of force and determination in all his movements his sermon was the first that i had heard in england which seemed to recognize the existence of any possible sceptical or rationalizing element in the minds of his hearers it was in this respect more like the preaching that i had been in the habit of hearing at home instead of a calm statement of certain admitted religious facts or exhortations founded upon them his discourse seemed to be reasoning with individual cases and answering various forms of objections such as might arise in different minds this mode of preaching i think cannot exist unless a minister cultivates an individual knowledge of his people  mr binneys work entitled how to make the best of both worlds i have heard spoken of as having had the largest sale of any religious writing of the present day  may 16 this evening is the great antislavery meeting at exeter hall lord shaftesbury in the chair exeter hall stands before the public as the representation of the strong democratic religious element of england in exeter hall are all the philanthropies foreign and domestic and a crowded meeting there gives one perhaps a better idea of the force of english democracyof that kind of material which goes to make up the mass of the nationthan any thing else  when macaulay expressed some sentiments which gave offence to this portion of the community he made a defence in which he alluded sarcastically to the bray of exeter hall  the expression seems to have been remembered for i have often heard it quoted though i believe they have forgiven him for it and concluded to accept it as a joke  the hall this night was densely crowded and as i felt very unwell i did not go in till after the services had commenceda thing which i greatly regretted afterwards as by this means i lost a most able speech by lord shaftesbury  the duchess of sutherland entered soon after the commencement of the exercises and was most enthusiastically cheered when we came in a seat had been reserved for us by her grace in the side gallery and the cheering was repeated i thought i had heard something of the sort in scotland but there was a vehemence about this that made me tremble there is always something awful to my mind about a dense crowd in a state of high excitement let the nature of that excitement be what it will  i do not believe that there is in all america more vehemence of democracy more volcanic force of power than comes out in one of these great gatherings in our old fatherland i saw plainly enough where concord lexington and bunker hill came from and it seems to me there is enough of this element of indignation at wrong and resistance to tyranny to found half a dozen more republics as strong as we are  a little incident that occurred gave me an idea of what such a crowd might become in a confused state of excitement a woman fainted in a distant part of the house and a policeman attempted to force a way through the denselypacked crowd the services were interrupted for a few moments and there were hoarse surgings and swellings of the mighty mass who were so closely packed that they moved together like waves some began to rise in their seats and some cried order order and one could easily see that were a sudden panic or overwhelming excitement to break up the order of the meeting what a terrible scene might ensue  what is it said i to a friend who sat next to me  a pickpocket perhaps said she i am afraid we are going to have a row they are going to give you one of our genuine exeter hall brays  i felt a good deal fluttered but the duchess of sutherland who knew the british lion better than i did seemed so perfectly collected that i became reassured  the character of the speeches at this meeting with the exception of lord shaftesburys was more denunciatory and had more to pain the national feelings of an american than any i had ever attended it was the real old saxon battle axe of brother john swung without fear or favor such things do not hurt me individually because i have such a radical faith in my country such a genuine belief that she will at last right herself from every wrong that i feel she can afford to have these things said  mr s spoke on this point that the cotton trade of great britain is the principal support to slavery and read extracts from charleston papers in which they boldly declare that they do not care for any amount of moral indignation wasted upon them by nations who after all must and will buy the cotton which they raise  the meeting was a very long one and i was much fatigued when we returned  tomorrow we are to make a little run out to windsor     letter xxii  may 18  dear m  i can compare the embarrassment of our london life with its multiplied solicitations and infinite stimulants to curiosity and desire only to that annual perplexity which used to beset us in our childhood on thanksgiving day having been kept all the year within the limits which prudence assigns to wellregulated children came at last the governors proclamation and a general saturnalia of dainties for the little ones for one day the gates of license were thrown open and we plumped down into the midst of pie and pudding exceeding all conception but that of a yankee housekeeper were left to struggle our way out as best we might  so here beside all the living world of london its scope and range of persons and circles of thought come its architecture its arts its localities historic poetic all that expresses its past its present and its future every day and every hour brings its conflicting allurements of persons to be seen places to be visited things to be done beyond all computation like miss edgeworths philosophic little frank we are obliged to make out our list of what man must want and of what he may want and in our list of the former we set down in large and decisive characters one quiet day for the exploration and enjoyment of windsor  we were solicited indeed to go in another direction a party was formed to go down the thames with the right hon sidney herbert secretary at war and visit an emigrant ship just starting for australia i should say here that since mrs chisholms labors have awakened the attention of the english public to the wants and condition of emigrants the benevolent people of england take great interest in the departing of emigrant ships a society has been formed called the family colonization loan society and a fund raised by which money can be loaned to those desiring to emigrate this society makes it an object to cultivate acquaintance and intimacy among those about going out by uniting them into groups and as far as possible placing orphan children and single females under the protection of families any one by subscribing six guineas towards the loan can secure one passage each individual becomes responsible for refunding his own fare and furthermore to pay a certain assessment in case any individual of the group fails to make up the passage money the sailing of emigrant ships therefore has become a scene of great interest those departing do not leave their native shore without substantial proofs of the interest and care of the land they are leaving  in the party who were going down today were mr and mrs binney mr sherman and a number of distinguished names among whom i recollect to have heard the names of lady hatherton and lady byron widow of the poet this would have been an exceedingly interesting scene to us but being already worn with company and excitement we preferred a quiet day at windsor  for if we took warwick as the representative feudal estate we took windsor as the representative palace that which imbodies the english idea of royalty apart from this windsor has been immortalized by the merry wives it has still standing in its park the herne oak where the mischievous fairies played their pranks upon old falstaff  and the castle still has about it the charm of the poets invocation    search windsor castle elves within without    strew good luck ouphes on every sacred room    that it may stand till the perpetual doom    in state as wholesome as in state tis fit    worthy the owner and the owner it    the several chairs of order look you scour    with juice of balm and every precious flower    each fair instalment coat and several crest    with loyal blazon evermore be blest    and nightly meadow fairies look you sing    like to the garters compass in a ring    the expressure that it bears green let it be    more fertile fresh than all the field to see    and honi soit qui mal y pense write    in emerald tufts flowers purple blue and white    like sapphire pearl and rich embroidery    fairies use flowers for their charactery  as if for the loyal purpose of recommending old windsor the english skies had cleared up into brightness about nine oclock we found ourselves in the cars riding through a perpetual garden of blooming trees and blossoming hedges birds in a perfect fury of delight our spirits were all elated good honest cackling mrs quickly herself was not more disposed to make the best of every thing and every body than were we mr s in particular was so joyous that i was afraid he would break out into song after the fashion of sir hugh evans    melodious birds sung madrigals    whenas i sat in babylon c  by the by the fishing ground of izaak walton is one of the localities connected with windsor  the ride was done all too soon one should not whirl through such a choice bit of england in the cars one should rather wish to amble over the way after a sleepy contemplative old horse as we used to make rural excursions in new england ere yet railroads were however all thats bright must fade and this among the rest  about eleven oclock we found ourselves going up the old stone steps to the castle it was the last day of a fair which had been holden in this part of the country and crowds of the common people were flocking to the castle men women and children pattering up the stairs before and after us  we went first through the state apartments the principal thing that interested me was the ball room which was a perfect gallery of vandykes paintings here was certainly an opportunity to know what vandyke is i should call him a true court paintera master of splendid conventionalities whose portraits of kings are the most powerful arguments for the divine right i know of nevertheless beyond conventionality and outward magnificence his ideas have no range he suggests nothing to the moral and ideal part of us here again was the picture of king charles on horseback which had interested me at warwick it had however a peculiar and romantic charm from its position at the end of that long dim corridor visavis with the masque of cromwell which did not accompany it here where it was but one among a set of pictures  there was another presenting the front side and three quarters face of the same sovereign painted by vandyke for benini to make a bust from there were no less than five portraits of his wife henrietta maria in different dresses and attitudes and two pictures of their children no sovereign is so profusely and perseveringly represented  the queens audience chamber is hung with tapestry representing scenes from the book of esther this tapestry made a very great impression upon me a knowledge of the difficulties to be overcome in the material part of painting is undoubtedly an unsuspected element of much of the pleasure we derive from it and for this reason probably this tapestry appeared to us better than paintings executed with equal spirit in oils we admired it exceedingly entirely careless what critics might think of us if they knew it  another room was hung with gobelin tapestry representing the whole of the tragedy of medea first you have jason cutting down the golden fleece while the dragon lies slain and medea is looking on in admiration in another he pledges his love to medea in a third the men sprung from the dragons teeth are seen contending with each other in another the unfaithful lover espouses creusa in the next creusa is seen burning in the poisoned shirt given her by medea in another medea is seen in a car drawn by dragons bearing her two children by jason whom she has stabbed in revenge for his desertion nothing can exceed the ghastly reality of death as shown in the stiffened limbs and sharpened features of those dead children the whole drawing and grouping is exceedingly spirited and lifelike and has great power of impression  i was charmed also by nine landscapes of zuccarelli which adorn the state drawing room zuccarelli was a follower of claude and these pictures far exceed in effect any of claudes i have yet seen the charm of them does not lie merely in the atmospheric tints and effects as those of cuyp but in the rich and fanciful combination of objects in this respect they perform in painting what the first part of the castle of indolence or tennysons lotus eaters do in poetry evoke a fairyland there was something peculiar about their charm for me  who can decide how much in a picture belongs to the idiosyncrasies and associations of the person who looks upon it artists undoubtedly powerful and fine may have nothing in them which touches the nervous sympathies and tastes of some persons who therefore shall establish any authoritative canon of taste who shall say that claude is finer than zuccarelli or zuccarelli than claude a man might as well say that the woman who enchants him is the only true venus for the world  then again how much in painting or in poetry depends upon the frame of mind in which we see or hear whoever looks on these pictures or reads the lotus eaters or castle of indolence at a time when soul and body are weary and longing for retirement and rest will receive an impression from them such as could never be made on the strong nerves of our more healthful and hilarious seasons  certainly no emotions so rigidly reject critical restraints and disdain to be bound by rule as those excited by the fine arts a man unimpressible and incapable of moods and tenses is for that reason an incompetent critic and the sensitive excitable man how can he know that he does not impose his peculiar mood as a general rule  from the state rooms we were taken to the top of the hound tower where we gained a magnificent view of the park of windsor with its regal avenue miles in length of ancient oaks its sweeps of greensward clumps of trees its old herne oak of classic memory in short all that constitutes the idea of a perfect english landscape the english tree is shorter and stouter than ours its foliage dense and deep lying with a full rounding outline against the sky every thing here conveys the idea of concentrated vitality but without that rank luxuriance seen in our american growth having unfortunately exhausted the english language on the subject of grass i will not repeat any ecstasies upon that topic  after descending from the tower we filed off to the proper quarter to show our orders for the private rooms the state apartments which we had been looking at are open at all times but the private apartments can only be seen in the queens absence and by a special permission which had been procured for us on this occasion by the kindness of the duchess of sutherland  one of the first objects that attracted my attention when entering the vestibule was a babys wicker wagon standing in one corner it was much such a carriage as all mothers are familiar with such as figures largely in the history of almost every family it had neat curtains and cushions of green merino and was not royal only maternal i mused over the little thing with a good deal of interest it is to my mind one of the providential signs of our times that at this stormy and most critical period of the worlds history the sovereignty of the most powerful nation on earth is represented by a woman and a mother how many humanizing gentle and pacific influences constantly emanate from this centre  one of the most interesting apartments was a long corridor hung with paintings and garnished along the sides with objects of art and virtu here c and i renewed a dispute which had for some time been pending in respect to canalettos paintings this canaletto was a venetian painter who was born about 1697 and died in london in 1768 and was greatly in vogue with the upper circles in those days he delighted in architectural paintings which he represents with the accuracy of a daguerreotype and a management of perspective chiaro oscuro and all the other mysteries of art such as make his paintings amount to about the same as the reality  well here in this corridor we had him in full force here was venice served up to orderits streets palaces churches bridges canals and gondolas made as real to our eye as if we were looking at them out of a window i admired them very warmly but i could not go into the raptures that c did who kept calling me from every thing else that i wanted to see to come and look at this canaletto well i see it said i it is goodit is perfectit cannot be bettered but what then there is the same difference between these and a landscape of zuccarelli as there is between a neatlyarranged statistical treatise and a poem the latter suggests a thousand images the former gives you only information  we were quite interested in a series of paintings which represented the various events of the present queens history there was the coronation in westminster abbeythat national romance which for once in our prosaic world nearly turned the heads of all the sensible people on earth think of vesting the sovereignty of so much of the world in a fair young girl of seventeen the picture is a very pretty one and is taken at the very moment she is kneeling at the feet of the archbishop of canterbury to receive her crown she is represented as a fairhaired interesting girl the simplicity of her air contrasting strangely with the pomp and gorgeous display around the painter has done justice to a train of charming young ladies who surround her among the faces i recognized the blue eyes and noble forehead of the duchess of sutherland  then followed in due order the baptism of children the reception of poor old louis philippe in his exile and various other matters of the sort which go to make up royal pictures  in the family breakfast room we saw some fine gobelin tapestry representing the classical story of meleager in one of the rooms on a pedestal stood a gigantic china vase a present from the emperor of russia and in the state rooms before we had seen a large malachite vase from the same donor the toning of this room with regard to color was like that of the room i described in stafford housethe carpet of green ground with the same little leaf upon it the walls chairs and sofas covered with green damask around the walls of the room in some places were arranged cases of books about three feet high i liked this arrangement particularly because it gives you the companionship of books in an apartment without occupying that space of the wall which is advantageous for pictures moreover books placed high against the walls of a room give a gloomy appearance to the apartment  the whole air of these rooms was very charming suggestive of refined taste and domestic habits the idea of home which pervades every thing in england from the cottage to the palace was as much suggested here as in any apartments i have seen the walls of the different rooms were decorated with portraits of the members of the royal family and those of other european princes  after this we went through the kitchen departmentsaw the silver and gold plate of the table among the latter were some designs which i thought particularly graceful to conclude all we went through the stables the man who showed them told us that several of the queens favorite horses were taken to osborne but there were many beautiful creatures left which i regarded with great complacency the stables and stalls were perfectly clean and neatly kept and one in short derives from the whole view of the economics of windsor that satisfaction which results from seeing a thing thoroughly done in the best conceivable manner  the management of the estate of windsor is i am told a model for all landholders in the kingdom a society has been formed there within a few years under the patronage of the queen prince albert and the duchess of kent in which the clergy and gentry of the principal parishes in this vicinity are interested for improving the condition of the laboring classes in this region the queen and prince albert have taken much interest in the planning and arranging of model houses for the laboring people which combine cheapness neatness ventilation and all the facilities for the formation of good personal habits there is a school kept on the estate at windsor in which the queen takes a very practical interest regulating the books and studies and paying frequent visits to it during the time of her sojourn here the young girls are instructed in fine needlework but the queen discourages embroidery and ornamental work meaning to make practical efficient wives for laboring men these particulars with regard to this school were related to me by a lady living in the vicinity of windsor  we went into st georges chapel and there we were all exceedingly interested and enchained in view of the marble monument to the princess charlotte it consists of two groups and is designed to express in one view both the celestial and the terrestrial aspect of deaththe visible and the invisible part of dying for the visible part you have the body of the princess in all the desolation and abandonment of death the attitude of the figure is as if she had thrown herself over in a convulsion and died the body is lying listless simply covered with a sheet through every fold of which you can see the utter relaxation of that moment when vitality departs but the limbs have not yet stiffened her hand and a part of the arm are hanging down exposed to view beneath the sheet  four figures with bowed heads covered with drapery are represented as sitting around in mute despair the idea meant to be conveyed by the whole group is that of utter desolation and abandonment all is over there is not even heart enough left in the mourners to straighten the corpse for the burial the mute marble says as plainly as marble can speak let all go tis no matter now there is no more use in livingnothing to be done nothing to be hoped  above this group rises the form of the princess springing buoyant and elastic on angel wings a smile of triumph and aspiration lighting up her countenance her drapery floats behind her as she rises two angels one carrying her infant child and the other with clasped hands of exultant joy are rising with her in serene and solemn triumph  now i simply put it to you or to any one who can judge of poetry if this is not a poetical conception i ask any one who has a heart if there is not pathos in it is there not a high poetic merit in the mere conception of these two scenes thus presented and had we seen it rudely chipped and chiselled out by some artist of the middle ages whose hand had not yet been practised to do justice to his conceptions should we not have said this sculptor had a glorious thought within him but the chiselling of this piece is not unworthy the conception nothing can be more exquisite than the turn of the head neck and shoulders nothing more finely wrought than the triumphant smile of the angel princess nothing could be more artistic than the representation of death in all its hopelessness in the lower figure the poor dead hand that shows itself beneath the sheet has an unutterable pathos and beauty in it as to the working of the draperyan inferior consideration of coursei see no reason why it should not compare advantageously with any in the british museum  well you will ask why are you going on in this argumentative style who doubts you let me tell you then a little fragment of my experience we saw this group of statuary the last thing before dinner after a most fatiguing forenoon of sightseeing when we were both tired and hungrya most unpropitious time certainlyand yet it enchanted our whole company what is more it made us all crya fact of which i am not ashamed yet but only the next day when i was expressing my admiration to an artist who is one of the authorities and knows all that is proper to be admired i was met with  o you have seen that have you shocking thing miserable tastemiserable  dear me said i with apprehension what is the matter with it  0 said he melodramatic melodramaticterribly so  i was so appalled by this word of whose meaning i had not a very clear idea that i dropped the defence at once and determined to reconsider my tears to have been actually made to cry by a thing that was melodramatic was a distressing consideration seriously however on reconsidering the objection i see no sense in it a thing may be melodramatic or any other atic that a man pleases so that it be strongly suggestive poetic pathetic it has a right to its own peculiar place in the world of art if artists had had their way in the creation of this world there would have been only two or three kinds of things in it the first three or four things that god created would have been enacted into fixed rules for making all the rest  but they let the works of nature alone because they know there is no hope for them and content themselves with enacting rules in literature and art which make all the perfection and grace of the past so many impassable barriers to progress in future because the ancients kept to unity of idea in their groups and attained to most beautiful results by doing so shall no modern make an antithesis in marble and why has not a man a right to dramatize in marble as well as on canvas if he can produce a powerful and effective result by so doing and even if by being melodramatic as the terrible word is he can shadow forth a grand and comforting religious ideaif he can unveil to those who have seen only the desolation of death its glory and its triumphwho shall say that he may not do so because he violates the lines of some old greek artist where would shakspeares dramas have been had he studied the old dramatic unities  so you see like an obstinate republican as i am i defend my right to have my own opinion about this monument albeit the guide book with its usual diplomatic caution says it is in very questionable taste  we went for our dinner to the white hart the very inn which shakspeare celebrates in his merry wives and had a most overflowing merry time of it the fact is we had not seen each other for so long that to be in each others company for a whole day was quite a stimulant  after dinner we had a beautiful drive passing the colleges at eton and seeing the boys out playing cricket had an excellent opportunity to think how true grays poem on the prospect of eton is to boynature then now and forever we were bent upon looking up the church which gave rise to his elegy in a country churchyard intending when we got there to have a little scene over it mr s in all the conscious importance of having been there before assuring us that he knew exactly where it was so after some difficulty with our coachman and being stopped at one church which would not answer our purpose in any respect we were at last set down by one which looked authentic embowered in mossy elms with a most ancient and goblin yew tree an ivymantled tower all perfect as could be  there had been a sprinkle of rainan ornament which few english days wantand the westering beams of the sun twinkled through innumerable drops in fact it was a pretty place and i felt such dispositions to melancholies as sir hugh evans would have it that i half resented mr ss suggestion that the cars were waiting however as he was engaged to speak at a peace meeting in london it was agreed he should leave us there to stroll while he took the cars so away he went and we leaning on the old fence repeated the elegy which certainly applies here as beautifully as language could apply  what a calm shady poetical nature is expressed in these lines gray seems to have been sent into the world for nothing but to be a poem like some of those fabulous shadowy beings which haunted the cool grottoes on grecian mountains creatures that seem to have no practical vitalityto be only a kind of voice an echo heard for a little and then lost in silence he seemed to be in himself a kind of elegy  from thence we strolled along enjoying the beautiful rural scenery having had a kind invitation to visit labouchère park that day which we were obliged to decline for want of time we were pleased to discover that we had two more hours in which we could easily accomplish a stroll there by a most singular infelicity our party became separated and misunderstanding each other we remained waiting for w till it was too late for us to go while he on the other hand supposing us to have walked before him was redoubling his speed all the while hoping to overtake us in consequence of this he accomplished the walk to labouchère park and we waited in the dismal depot till it was too late to wait any longer and finally went into london without him  after all imagine our chagrin on being informed that we had not been to the genuine churchyard the gentleman who wept over the scenes of his early days on the wrong doorstep was not more grievously disappointed however he and we could both console ourselves with the reflection that the emotion was admirable and wanted only the right place to make it the most appropriate in the world the genuine country churchyard however was that at stoke pogis which we should have seen had not the fates forbidden our going to labouchère park     letter xxiii  dear sister  the evening after our return from windsor was spent with our kind friends mr and mrs gurney mr gurney is rector of marylebone parish one of the largest districts in london and he is i have been told one of the court chaplains a man of the most cultivated and agreeable manners earnestly and devoutly engaged in the business of his calling as one of the working men of the church establishment i felt a strong interest in his views and opinions and he seemed to take no less interest in mine as coming from a country where there is and can be no church establishment he asked many questions about america the general style of our preaching the character of our theology our modes of religious action our revivals of religion our theories of sudden and instantaneous conversion as distinguished from the gradual conversion of education our temperance societies and the stand taken by our clergy in behalf of temperance  he wished to know how the english style of preaching appeared to me in comparison with that of america i told him one principal difference that struck me was that the english preaching did not recognize the existence of any element of inquiry or doubt in the popular mind that it treated certain truths as axioms which only needed to be stated to be believed whereas in american sermons there is always more or less time employed in explaining proving and answering objections to the truths enforced i quoted baptist noels sermon in illustration of what i meant  i asked him to what extent the element of scepticism with regard to religious truth had pervaded the mind of england adding that i had inferred its existence there from such novels as those of kingsley he thought that there was much of this element particularly in the working classes that they were coming to regard the clergy with suspicion and to be less under their influence than in former times and said it was a matter of much solicitude to know how to reach them  i told him that i had heard an american clergyman who had travelled in england say that dissenters were treated much as free negroes were in america and added that my experience must have been very exceptional or the remark much overstated as i had met dissenting clergymen in all circles of society he admitted that there might be a good deal of bigotry in this respect but added that the infrequency of association was more the result of those circumstances which would naturally draw the two parties to themselves than to superciliousness on the side of the establishment adding that where a court and aristocracy were in the established church there would necessarily be a pressure of fashion in its favor which might at times bring uncomfortable results  the children were sitting by studying their evening lessons and i begged mrs gurney to allow me to look over their geographies and atlases and on her inquiring why i told her that wellinformed people in england sometimes made such unaccountable mistakes about the geography of our country as were quite surprising to me and that i did not understand how it was that our children should know so much more about england than they about us i found the children however in possession of a very excellent and authentic map of our country i must say also that the most highly educated people i have met in england have never betrayed any want of information on this subject  the next morning we had at breakfast two clergymen members of the established church they appeared to be most excellent devout practical men anxious to do good and thoughtfully seeking for suggestions from any quarter which might assist them in their labors they renewed many of the inquiries which mr gurney had made the evening before  after breakfast i went with mr gurney and mr s to richmonds studio to sit for a likeness which is to be presented to mr s by several friends richmonds name is one which in this london sphere has only to be announced to explain itself not to know him argues yourself unknown he is one of the most successful artists in a certain line of portrait painting that the present day affords he devotes himself principally to crayon and watercolor sketches his crayon heads are generally the size of life his watercolors of a small size he often takes fulllengths in this way which render not merely the features but the figure air manner and what is characteristic about the dress these latter sketches are finished up very highly with the minuteness of a miniature his forte consists in seizing and fixing those fleeting traits of countenance air and movement which go so far towards making up our idea of a persons appearance many of the engravings of distinguished persons with which we are familiar have come from his designs such as wilberforce sir powell buxton elizabeth fry and others i found his studio quite a gallery of notabilities almost all the distingués of the day having sat to him so i certainly had the satisfaction of feeling myself in good company mr richmond looks quite youthful but i never can judge of any ones age here is most agreeable in conversation full of anecdote in regard to all the moving life of london i presume his power of entertaining conversation is one secret of his successful likenesses some portrait painters keep calling on you for expression all the while and say nothing in the world to awaken it  from richmonds mr s c and i drove out to call upon kossuth we found him in an obscure lodging on the outskirts of london i would that some of the editors in america who have thrown out insinuations about his living in luxury could have seen the utter bareness and plainness of the reception room which had nothing in it beyond the simplest necessaries here dwells the man whose greatest fault is an undying love of his country we all know that if kossuth would have taken wealth and a secure retreat with a life of ease for himself america would gladly have laid all these at his feet but because he could not acquiesce in the unmerited dishonor of his country he lives a life of obscurity poverty and labor all this was written in his pale worn face and sad thoughtful blue eye but to me the unselfish patriot is more venerable for his poverty and his misfortunes  have we among the thousands who speak loud of patriotism in america many men who were she enfeebled despised and trampled would forego self and suffer as long as patiently for her it is even easier to die for a good cause in some hour of high enthusiasm when all that is noblest in us can be roused to one great venture than to live for it amid wearing years of discouragement and hope delayed  there are those even here in england who delight to get up slanders against kossuth and not long ago some most unfounded charges were thrown out against him in some public prints by way of counterpoise an enthusiastic public meeting was held in which he was presented with a splendid set of shakspeare  he entered into conversation with us with cheerfulness speaking english well though with the idioms of foreign languages he seemed quite amused at the sensation which had been excited by mr ss cotton speech in exeter hall c asked him if he had still hopes for his cause he answered i hope still because i work still my hope is in god and in man  i inquired for madame kossuth and he answered i have not yet seen her today adding she has her family affairs you know madam we are poor exiles here and fearing to cause embarrassment i did not press an interview  when we parted he took my hand kindly and said god bless you my child  i would not lose my faith in such men for any thing the world could give me there are some people who involve in themselves so many of the elements which go to make up our confidence in human nature generally that to lose confidence in them seems to undermine our faith in human virtue as shakspeare says their defection would be like another fall of man  we went back to mr gurneys to lunch and then as the afternoon was fine mr and mrs gurney drove with us in their carriage to pembroke lodge the country seat of lord john russell it was an uncommonly beautiful afternoon and the view from richmond hill was as perfect a specimen of an english landscape seen under the most benignant auspices as we could hope to enjoy orchards gardens villas charming meadows enamelled with flowers the silver windings of the thames the luxuriant outlines of the foliage varied here and there by the graceful perpendicular of the poplars all formed one of the richest of landscapes the brow of the hill is beautifully laid out with tufts of trees winding paths diversified here and there with arbors and rustic seats  richmond park is adorned with clumps of ancient trees among which troops of deer were strolling pembroke lodge is a plain unostentatious building rising in the midst of charming grounds we were received in the drawing room by the young ladies and were sorry to learn that lady russell was so unwell as to be unable to give us her company at dinner two charming little boys came in and a few moments after their father lord john i had been much pleased with finding on the centre table a beautiful edition of that revered friend of my childhood dr wattss divine songs finely illustrated i remarked to lord john that it was the face of an old friend he said it was presented to his little boys by their godfather sir george grey and when taking one of the little boys on his knee he asked him if he could repeat me one of his hymns the whole thing seemed so new englandlike that i began to feel myself quite at home i hope i shall some day see in america an edition of dr watts in which the illustrations do as much justice to the authors sentiments as in this for in all our modern religious works for children there is nothing that excels these divine songs  there were only a few guests among them sir george grey and lady he is nephew to earl grey of reform memory and she is the eldest daughter of the pious and learned bishop ryder of lichfield sir george is a man of great piety and worth a liberal and much interested in all benevolent movements there was also the earl of albemarle who is a colonel in the army and has served many years under wellington a particularly cheerful entertaining conversable man full of anecdote he told several very characteristic and comical stories about the duke of wellington  at dinner among other things the conversation turned upon hunting it always seemed to me a curious thing that in the height of english civilization this vestige of the savage state should still remain i told lord albemarle that i thought the idea of a whole concourse of strong men turning out to hunt a poor fox or hare creatures so feeble and insignificant and who can do nothing to defend themselves was hardly consistent with manliness that if they had some of our american buffaloes or a bengal tiger the affair would be something more dignified and generous thereupon they only laughed and told stories about fox hunters it seems that killing a fox except in the way of hunting is deemed among hunters an unpardonable offence and a man who has the misfortune to do it would be almost as unwilling to let it be known as if he had killed a man  they also told about deer stalking in the highlands in which exercise i inferred lord john had been a proficient the conversation reminded me of the hunting stories i had heard in the log cabins in indiana and i amused myself with thinking how some of the narrators would appear among my highbred friends there is such a quaint vivacity and drollcry about that halfsavage western life as always gives it a charm in my recollection i thought of the jolly old hunter who always concluded the operations of the day by discharging his rifle at his candle after he had snugly ensconced himself in bed and of the celebrated scene in which henry clay won an old hunters vote in an election by his aptness in turning into a political simile some points in the management of a rifle  now there is to my mind something infinitely more sublime about hunting in real earnest amid the solemn shadows of our interminable forests than in making believe hunt in parks  it is undoubtedly the fact that these outofdoor sports of england have a great deal to do with the firm health which men here enjoy speaking of this subject i could not help expressing my surprise to lord john at the apparently perfect health enjoyed by members of parliament notwithstanding their protracted night labors he thinks that the session of parliament this year will extend nearly to august speaking of breakfasts he said they often had delightful breakfasts about three oclock in the day this is a total reverse of all our ideas in regard to time  after dinner lord and lady ribblesdale came in connections of lord john by a former marriage i sat by lord john on the sofa and listened with great interest to a conversation between him and lady grey on the working of the educational system in england a subject which has particularly engaged the attention of the english government since the reign of the present queen i found a difficulty in understanding many of the terms they used though i learned much that interested me  after a while i went to lady russells apartment and had an hour of very pleasant conversation with her it greatly enlarges our confidence in human nature to find such identity of feeling and opinion among the really good of different countries and of all different circles in those countries i have never been more impressed with this idea than during my sojourn here in england different as the institutions of england and america are they do not prevent the formation of a very general basis of agreement in so far as radical ideas of practical morality and religion are concerned and i am increasingly certain that there is a foundation for a lasting unity between the two countries which shall increase constantly as the increasing facilities of communication lessen the distance between us  lady russell inquired with a good deal of interest after prescott our historian and expressed the pleasure which she and lord john had derived from his writings  we left early after a most agreeable evening the next day at eleven oclock we went to an engagement at lambeth palace where we had been invited by a kind note from its venerable master the archbishop of canterbury lambeth is a stately pile of quaint antique buildings rising most magnificently on the banks of the thames it is surrounded by beautiful grounds laid out with choice gardening through an ancient hall lighted by stainedglass windows we were ushered into the drawing room where the guests were assembling there was quite a number of people there among others the lady and eldest son of the bishop of london the earl and countess waldegrave and the family friends of the archbishop  the good archbishop was kind and benign as usual and gave me his arm while we explored the curiosities of the palace now my dear if you will please to recollect that the guide book says this palace contains all the gradations of architecture from early english to late perpendicular you will certainly not expect me to describe it in one letter it has been the residence of the archbishops of canterbury from time immemorial both in the days before the reformation and since  the chapel was built between the years 1200 and 1300 and there used to be painted windows in it as archbishop laud says which contained the whole history of the world from the creation to the day of judgment unfortunately these comprehensive windows were destroyed in the civil wars  the part called the lollards tower is celebrated as having been the reputed prison of the lollards these lollards perhaps you will remember were the followers of john wickliffe called lollards as christ was called a nazarene simply because the word was a term of reproach wickliffe himself was summoned here to lambeth to give an account of his teachings and in 1382 william courtnay archbishop of canterbury called a council which condemned his doctrines the tradition is that at various times these lollards were imprisoned here  in order to get to the tower we had to go through a great many apartments passages and corridors and terminate all by climbing a winding staircase steeper and narrower than was at all desirable for any but wicked heretics who ought to be made as uncomfortable as possible however by reasonable perseverance the archbishop the bishops lady and all the noble company present found themselves safely at the top our host remarked i think that it was the second time he had ever been there  the room is thirteen feet by twelve and about eight feet high wainscotted with oak which is scrawled over with names and inscriptions there are eight large iron rings in the wall to which the prisoners were chained for aught we know wickliffe himself may have been one as our kind host moved about among us with his placid face we could not but think that times had altered since the days when archbishops used to imprison heretics and preside over grim inquisitorial tribunals we all agreed however that considering the very beautiful prospect this tower commands up and down the thames the poor lollards in some respects might have been worse lodged  we passed through the guard room library and along a corridor where hung a row of pictures of all the archbishops from the very earliest times and then the archbishop took me into his study which is a most charming room containing his own private library after that we all sat down to lunch in a large dining hall i was seated between the archbishop and a venerable admiral in the navy among other things the latter asked me if there were not many railroad and steamboat accidents in america o my countrymen what trouble do you make us in foreign lands by your terrible carelessness i was obliged in candor to say that i thought there was a shocking number of accidents of that sort and suggested the best excuse i could think ofour youth and inexperience but i certainly thought my venerable friend had touched a very indefensible point  among other topics discussed in the drawing room i heard some more on dits respecting spiritual rappings every body seems to be wondering what they are and what they are going to amount to  we took leave of our kind host and his family gratefully impressed with the simplicity and sincere cordiality of our reception there are many different names for goodness in this world but after all true brotherly kindness and charity is much the same thing whether it show itself by a quakers fireside or in an archbishops palace  leaving the archbishops i went to richmonds again where i was most agreeably entertained for an hour or two we have an engagement for playford hall tomorrow and we breakfast with joseph sturge it being now the time of the yearly meeting of the friends he and his family are in town     letter xxiv  my dear s  the next morning c and i took the cars to go into the country to playford hall and whats playford hall you say and why did you go to see it as to what it is here is a reasonably good picture before you as to why it was for many years the residence of thomas clarkson and is now the residence of his venerable widow and her family  playford hall is considered i think the oldest of the fortified houses in england and is i am told the only one that has water in the moat the water which is seen girdling the wall in the picture is the moat it surrounds the place entirely leaving no access except across the bridge which is here represented  after crossing this bridge you come into a green court yard filled with choice plants and flowering shrubs and carpeted with that thick soft velvetlike grass which is to be found nowhere else in so perfect a state as in england  the water is fed by a perpetual spring whose current is so sluggish as scarcely to be perceptible but which yet has the vitality of a running stream  it has a dark and glassy stillness of surface only broken by the forms of the water plants whose leaves float thickly over it  the walls of the moat are green with ancient moss and from the crevices springs an abundant flowering vine whose delicate leaves and bright yellow flowers in some places entirely mantle the stones with their graceful drapery  illustration of playford hall  the picture i have given you represents only one side of the moat the other side is grown up with dark and thick shrubbery and ancient trees rising and embowering the entire place adding to the retired and singular effect of the whole the place is a specimen of a sort of thing which does not exist in america it is one of those significant landmarks which unite the present with the past for which we must return to the country of our origin  playford hall is peculiarly english and thomas clarkson for whose sake i visited it was as peculiarly an englishmana specimen of the very best kind of english mind and character as this is of characteristic english architecture  we anglosaxons have won a hard name in the world there are undoubtedly bad things which are true about us  taking our developments as a race both in england and america we may be justly called the romans of the nineteenth century we have been the race which has conquered subdued and broken in pieces other weaker races with little regard either to justice or mercy with regard to benefits by us imparted to conquered nations i think a better story on the whole can be made out for the romans than for us witness the treatment of the chinese of the tribes of india and of our own american indians  but still there is in anglosaxon blood a vigorous sense of justice as appears in our habeas corpus our jury trials and other features of state organization and when this is tempered in individuals with the elements of gentleness and compassion and enforced by that energy and indomitable perseverance which are characteristic of the anglosaxon mind they form a style of philanthropy peculiarly efficient in short the anglosaxon is efficient in whatever he sets himself about whether in crushing the weak or lifting them up  thomas clarkson was born in a day when good pious people imported cargoes of slaves from africa as one of the regular christianized modes of gaining a subsistence and providing for themselves and their households it was a thing that every body was doing and every body thought they had a right to do it was supposed that all the sugar molasses and rum in the world were dependent on stealing men women and children and could be got in no other way and as to consume sugar molasses and rum were evidently the chief ends of human existence it followed that men women and children must be stolen to the end of time  some good people when they now and then heard an appalling story of the cruelties practised in the slave ship declared that it was really too bad sympathetically remarked what a sorrowful world we live in stirred their sugar into their tea and went on as before because what was there to dohadnt every body always done it and if they didnt do it wouldnt somebody else  it is true that for many years individuals at different times had remonstrated written treatises poems stories and movements had been made by some religious bodies particularly the quakers but the opposition had amounted to nothing practically efficient  the attention of clarkson was first turned to the subject by having it given out as the theme for a prize composition in his college class he being at that time a sprightly young man about twentyfour years of age he entered into the investigation with no other purpose than to see what he could make of it as a college theme  he says of himself i had expected pleasure from the invention of arguments from the arrangement of them from the putting of them together and from the thought in the interim that i was engaged in an innocent contest for literary honor but all my pleasures were damped by the facts which were now continually before me  it was but one gloomy subject from morning till night in the daytime i was uneasy in the night i had little rest i sometimes never closed my eyelids for grief  it became not now so much a trial for academical reputation as to write a work which should be useful to africa it is not surprising that a work written under the force of such feelings should have gained the prize as it did clarkson was summoned from london to cambridge to deliver his prize essay publicly he says of himself on returning to london the subject of it almost wholly engrossed my thoughts i became at times very seriously affected while on the road i stopped my horse occasionally dismounted and walked  i frequently tried to persuade myself that the contents of my essay could not be true but the more i reflected on the authorities on which they were founded the more i gave them credit coming in sight of wades mill in hertfordshire i sat down disconsolate on the turf by the roadside and held my horse here a thought came into my mind that if the contents of the essay were true it was time that somebody should see these calamities to an end  these reflections as it appears were put off for a while but returned again  this young and noble heart was of a kind that could not comfort itself so easily for a brothers sorrow as many do  he says of himself in the course of the autumn of the same year i walked frequently into the woods that i might think of the subject in solitude and find relief to my mind there but there the question still recurred are these things true still the answer followed as instantaneously they are still the result accompanied itsurely some person should interfere i began to envy those who had seats in parliament riches and widelyextended connections which would enable them to take up this cause  finding scarcely any one at the time who thought of it i was turned frequently to myself but here many difficulties arose it struck me among others that a young man only twentyfour years of age could not have that solid judgment or that knowledge of men manners and things which were requisite to qualify him to undertake a task of such magnitude and importance and with whom was i to unite i believed also that it looked so much like one of the feigned labors of hercules that my understanding would be suspected if i proposed it  he however resolved to do something for the cause by translating his essay from latin into english enlarging and presenting it to the public immediately on the publication of this essay he discovered to his astonishment and delight that he was not the only one who had been interested in this subject  being invited to the house of william dillwyn one of these friends to the cause he says how surprised was i to learn in the course of our conversation of the labors of granville sharp of the writings of ramsey and of the controversy in which the latter was engaged of all which i had hitherto known nothing how surprised was i to learn that william dillwyn had two years before associated himself with five others for the purpose of enlightening the public mind on this great subject  how astonished was i to find that a society had been formed in america for the same object these thoughts almost overpowered me my mind was overwhelmed by the thought that i had been providentially directed to this house the finger of providence was beginning to be discernible and that the daystar of african liberty was rising  after this he associated with many friends of the cause and at last it became evident that in order to effect any thing he must sacrifice all other prospects in life and devote himself exclusively to this work  he says after mentioning reasons which prevented all his associates from doing this i could look therefore to no person but myself and the question was whether i was prepared to make the sacrifice in favor of the undertaking i urged to myself that never was any cause which had been taken up by man in any country or in any age so great and important that never was there one in which so much misery was heard to cry for redress that never was there one in which so much good could be done never one in which the duty of christian charity could be so extensively exercised never one more worthy of the devotion of a whole life towards it and that if a man thought properly he ought to rejoice to have been called into existence if he were only permitted to become an instrument in forwarding it in any part of its progress  against these sentiments on the other hand i had to urge that i had been designed for the church that i had already advanced as far as deacons orders in it that my prospects there on account of my connections were then brilliant that by appearing to desert my profession my family would be dissatisfied if not unhappy these thoughts pressed upon me and rendered the conflict difficult  but the sacrifice of my prospects staggered me i own the most when the other objections which i have related occurred to me my enthusiasm instantly like a flash of lightning consumed them but this stuck to me and troubled me i had ambition i had a thirst after worldly interest and honors and i could not extinguish it at once i was more than two hours in solitude under this painful conflict at length i yielded not because i saw any reasonable prospect of success in my new undertakingfor all coolheaded and coolhearted men would have pronounced against itbut in obedience i believe to a higher power and i can say that both on the moment of this resolution and for some time afterwards i had more sublime and happy feelings than at any former period of my life  in order to show how this enterprise was looked upon and talked of very commonly by the majority of men in those times we will extract the following passage from boswells life of johnson in which bozzy thus enters his solemn protest the wild and dangerous attempt which has for some time been persisted in to obtain an act of our legislature to abolish so very important and necessary a branch of commercial interest must have been crushed at once had not the insignificance of the zealots who vainly took the lead in it made the vast body of planters merchants and others whose immense properties are involved in that trade reasonably enough suppose that there could be no danger the encouragement which the attempt has received excites my wonder and indignation and though some men of superior abilities have supported it whether from a love of temporary popularity when prosperous or a love of general mischief when desperate my opinion is unshaken  to abolish a status which in all ages god has sanctioned and man has continued would not only be robbery to an innumerable class of our fellowsubjects but it would be extreme cruelty to the african savages a portion of whom it saves from massacre or intolerable bondage in their own country and introduces into a much happier state of life especially now when their passage to the west indies and their treatment there is humanely regulated to abolish this trade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind  one of the first steps of clarkson and his associates was the formation of a committee of twelve persons for the collection and dissemination of information on the subject  the contest now began in earnest a contest as sublime as any the world ever saw  the abolition controversy more fully aroused the virtue the talent and the religion of the great english nation than any other event or crisis which ever occurred  wilberforce was the leader of the question in parliament the other members of the antislavery committee performed those labors which were necessary out of it  this labor consisted principally in the collection of evidence with regard to the traffic and the presentation of it before the public mind in this labor clarkson was particularly engaged the subject was hemmed in with the same difficulties that now beset the antislavery cause in america those who knew most about it were precisely those whose interest it was to prevent inquiry an immense moneyed interest was arrayed against investigation and was determined to suppress the agitation of the subject owing to this powerful pressure many who were in possession of facts which would bear upon this subject refused to communicate them and often after a long and wearisome journey in search of an individual who could throw light upon the subject clarkson had the mortification to find his lips sealed by interest or timidity as usual the cause of oppression was defended by the most impudent lying the slave trade was asserted to be the latest revised edition of philanthropy it was said that the poor african the slave of miserable oppression in his own country was wafted by it to an asylum in a christian land that the middle passage was to the poor negro a perfect elysium infinitely happier than any thing he had ever known in his own country all this was said while manacles and handcuffs and thumbscrews and instruments to force open the mouth were a regular part of the stock for a slave ship and were hanging in the shop windows of liverpool for sale  for clarksons attention was first called to these things by observing them in the shop window and on inquiring the use of one of them the man informed him that many times negroes were sulky and tried to starve themselves to death and this instrument was used to force open their jaws  of clarksons labor in this investigation some idea may be gathered from his own words when stating that for a season he was compelled to retire from the cause he thus speaks  as far as i myself was concerned all exertion was then over the nervous system was almost shattered to pieces both my memory and my hearing failed me sudden dizzinesses seized my head a confused singing in the ear followed me wherever i went on going to bed the very stairs seemed to dance up and down under me so that misplacing my foot i sometimes fell talking too if it continued but half an hour exhausted me so that profuse perspiration followed and the same effect was produced even by an active exertion of the mind for the like time  these disorders had been brought on by degrees in consequence of the severe labors necessarily attached to the promotion of the cause for seven years i had a correspondence to maintain with four hundred persons with my own hand i had some book or other annually to write in behalf of the cause in this time i had travelled more than thirtyfive thousand miles in search of evidence and a great part of these journeys in the night all this time my mind had been on the stretch it had been bent too to this one subject for i had not even leisure to attend to my own concerns the various instances of barbarity which had come successively to my knowledge within this period had vexed harassed and afflicted it the wound which these had produced was rendered still deeper by those cruel disappointments before related which arose from the reiterated refusals of persons to give their testimony after i had travelled hundreds of miles in quest of them but the severest stroke was that inflicted by the persecution begun and pursued by persons interested in the continuance of the trade of such witnesses as had been examined against them and whom on account of their dependent situation in life it was most easy to oppress as i had been the means of bringing these forward on these occasions they naturally came to me when thus persecuted as the author of their miseries and their ruin from their supplications and wants it would have been ungenerous and ungrateful to have fled these different circumstances by acting together had at length brought me into the situation just mentioned and i was therefore obliged though very reluctantly to be borne out of the field where i had placed the great honor and glory of my life  i may as well add here that a mr whitbread to whom clarkson mentioned this latter cause of distress generously offered to repair the pecuniary losses of all who had suffered in this cause one anecdote will be a specimen of the energy with which clarkson pursued evidence it had been very strenuously asserted and maintained that the subjects of the slave trade were only such unfortunates as had become prisoners of war and who if not carried out of the country in this manner would be exposed to death or some more dreadful doom in their own country this was one of those stories which nobody believed and yet was particularly useful in the hands of the opposition because it was difficult legally to disprove it it was perfectly well known that in very many cases slave traders made direct incursions into the country kidnapped and carried off the inhabitants of whole villages but the question was how to establish it a gentleman whom clarkson accidentally met on one of his journeys informed him that he had been in company about a year before with a sailor a very respectablelooking young man who had actually been engaged in one of these expeditions he had spent half an hour with him at an inn he described his person but knew nothing of his name or the place of his abode all he knew was that he belonged to a ship of war in ordinary but knew nothing of the port clarkson determined that this man should be produced as a witness and knew no better way than to go personally to all the ships in ordinary until the individual was found he actually visited every seaport town and boarded every ship till in the very last port and on the very last ship which remained the individual was found and found to be possessed of just the facts and information which were necessary by the labors of clarkson and his contemporaries an incredible excitement was produced throughout all england the pictures and models of slave ships accounts of the cruelties practised in the trade were circulated with an industry which left not a man woman or child in england uninstructed in disseminating information and in awakening feeling and conscience the women of england were particularly earnest and labored with that wholehearted devotion which characterizes the sex  it seems that after the committee had published the facts and sent them to every town in england clarkson followed them up by journeying to all the places to see that they were read and attended to of the state of feeling at this time clarkson gives the following account  and first i may observe that there was no town through which i passed in which there was not some one individual who had left off the use of sugar in the smaller towns there were from ten to fifty by estimation and in the larger from two to five hundred who made this sacrifice to virtue these were of all ranks and parties hich and poor churchmen and dissenters had adopted the measure even grocers had left off trading in the article in some places in gentlemens families where the master had set the example the servants had often voluntarily followed it and even children who were capable of understanding the history of the sufferings of the africans excluded with the most virtuous resolution the sweets to which they had been accustomed from their lips by the best computation i was able to make from notes taken down in my journey no fewer than three hundred thousand persons had abandoned the use of sugar it was the reality depth and earnestness of the public feeling thus aroused which pressed with resistless force upon the government for the government of england yields to popular demands quite as readily as that of america  after years of protracted struggle the victory was at last won the slave trade was finally abolished through all the british empire and not only so but the english nation committed with the whole force of its national influence to seek the abolition of the slave trade in all the nations of the earth but the wave of feeling did not rest there the investigations had brought before the english conscience the horrors and abominations of slavery itself and the agitation never ceased till slavery was finally abolished through all the british provinces at this time the religious mind and conscience of england gained through this very struggle a power which it never has lost the principle adopted by them was the same so sublimely adopted by the church in america in reference to the foreign missionary cause the field is the world they saw and felt that as the example and practice of england had been powerful in giving sanction to this evil and particularly in introducing it into america there was the greatest reason why she should never intermit her efforts till the wrong was righted throughout the earth  clarkson to his last day never ceased to be interested in the subject and took the warmest interest in all movements for the abolition of slavery in america  at the ipswich depot we were met by a venerable lady the daughter of clarksons associate william dillwyn she seemed overjoyed to meet us and took us at once into her carriage and entertained us all our way to the hall by anecdotes and incidents of clarkson and his times she read me a manuscript letter from him written at a very advanced age in which he speaks with the utmost ardor and enthusiasm of the first antislavery movements of cassius m clay in kentucky she described him to me as a cheerful companionable being frank and simplehearted and with a good deal of quiet humor  it is remarkable of him that with such intense feeling for human suffering as he had and worn down and exhausted as he was by the dreadful miseries and sorrows with which he was constantly obliged to be familiar he never yielded to a spirit of bitterness or denunciation  the narrative which he gives is as calm and unimpassioned and as free from any trait of this kind as the narratives of the evangelists thus riding and talking we at last arrived at the hall  the old stone house the moat the draw bridge all spoke of days of violence long gone by when no man was safe except within fortified walls and every mans house literally had to be his castle  to me it was interesting as the dwelling of a conqueror as one who had not wrestled with flesh and blood merely but with principalities and powers and the rulers of the darkness of this world and who had overcome as his great master did before him by faith and prayer and labor  we were received with much cordiality by the widow of clarkson now in her eightyfourth year she has been a woman of great energy and vigor and an efficient colaborer in his plans of benevolence  she is now quite feeble i was placed under the care of a respectable female servant who forthwith installed me in a large chamber overlooking the court yard which had been clarksons own room the room where for years many of his most important labors had been conducted and from whence his soul had ascended to the reward of the just  the servant who attended me seemed to be quite a superior woman like many of the servants in respectable english families she had grown up in the family and was identified with it its ruling aims and purposes had become hers she had been the personal attendant of clarkson and his nurse during his last sickness she had evidently understood and been interested in his plans and the veneration with which she therefore spoke of him had the sanction of intelligent appreciation  a daughter of clarkson who was married to a neighboring clergyman with her husband was also present on this day  after dinner we rode out to see the old church in whose enclosure the remains of clarkson repose it was just such a still quiet mossy old church as you have read of in story books with the graveyard spread all around it like a thoughtful mother who watches the resting of her children  the grass in the yard was long and green and the daisy which in other places lies like a little button on the ground here had a richer fringe of crimson and a stalk about six inches high it is i well know the vital influence from the slumbering dust beneath which gives the richness to this grass and these flowers but let not that be a painful thought let it rather cheer us that beauty should spring from ashes and life smile brighter from the near presence of death the grave of clarkson is near the church enclosed by a railing and marked by a simple white marble slab it is carefully tended and planted with flowers in the church was an old book of records and among other curious inscriptions was one recording how a pious committee of old nolls army had been there knocking off saints noses and otherwise purging the church from the relics of idolatry  near by the church was the parsonage the home of my friends a neat pleasant sequestered dwelling of about the style of a new england country parsonage  the effect of the whole together was inexpressibly beautiful to me for a wonder it was a pleasant day and this is a thing always to be thankfully acknowledged in england the calm stillness of the afternoon the seclusion of the whole place the silence only broken by the cawing of the rooks the ancient church the mossy graves with their flowers and green grass the sunshine and the tree shadows all seemed to mingle together in a kind of hazy dream of peacefulness and rest how natural it is to say of some place sheltered simple cool and retired here one might find peace as if peace came from without and not from within in the shadiest and stillest places may be the most turbulent hearts and there are hearts which through the busiest scenes carry with them unchanging peace as we were walking back we passed many cottages of the poor  i noticed with particular pleasure the invariable flower garden attached to each some pansies in one of them attracted my attention by their peculiar beauty so very large and richly colored on being introduced to the owner of them she with cheerful alacrity offered me some of the finest i do not doubt of there being suffering and misery in the agricultural population of england but still there are multitudes of cottages which are really very pleasant objects as were all these the cottagers had that bright rosy look of health which we seldom see in america and appeared to be both polite and selfrespecting  in the evening we had quite a gathering of friends from the neighborhoodintelligent sensible earnest people who had grown up in the love of the antislavery cause as into religion the subject of conversation was the duty of english people to free themselves from any participation in american slavery by taking means to encourage the production of free cotton in the british provinces  it is no more impossible or improbable that something effective may be done in this way than that the slave trade should have been abolished every great movement seems an impossibility at first there is no end to the number of things declared and proved impossible which have been done already so that this may become something yet  mrs clarkson had retired from the room early after a while she sent for me to her sitting room the faithful attendant of whom i spoke was with her she wished to show me some relics of her husband his watch and seals some of his papers and manuscripts among these was the identical prize essay with which he began his career and a commentary on the gospels which he had written with great care for the use of his grandson his seal attracted my attentionit was that kneeling figure of the negro with clasped hands which was at first adopted as the badge of the cause when every means was being made use of to arouse the public mind and keep the subject before the public mr wedgwood the celebrated porcelain manufacturer designed a cameo with this representation which was much worn as an ornament by ladies it was engraved on the seal of the antislavery society and was used by its members in sealing all their letters this of clarksons was handsomely engraved on a large oldfashioned carnelian and surely if we look with emotion on the sword of a departed herowhich at best we can consider only as a necessary evilwe may look with unmingled pleasure on this memorial of a bloodless victory  when i retired to my room for the night i could not but feel that the place was hallowed unceasing prayer had there been offered for the enslaved and wronged race of africa by that noble and brotherly heart i could not but feel that those prayers had had a wider reach than the mere extinction of slavery in one land or country and that their benign influence would not cease while a slave was left upon the face of the earth     letter xxv  dear c  we returned to london and found mr s and joseph sturge waiting for us at the depot we dined with mr sturge it seems that mr ss speech upon the subject of cotton has created some considerable disturbance different papers declaring themselves for or against it with a good deal of vivacity  after dinner mr sturge desired me very much to go into the meeting of the women for it seems that at the time of the yearly meeting among the friends the men and women both have their separate meetings for attending to business the aspect of the meeting was very interestingso many placid amiable faces shaded by plain quaker bonnets so many neat white handkerchiefs folded across peaceful bosoms either a large number of very pretty women wear the quaker dress or it is quite becoming in its effect  there are some things in the mode of speaking among the friends particularly in their public meetings which do not strike me agreeably and to which i think it would take me some time to become accustomed such as a kind of intoning somewhat similar to the manner in which the church service is performed in cathedrals it is a curious fact that religious exercises in all ages and countries have inclined to this form of expression it appears in the cantilation of the synagogue the service of the cathedral the prayers of the covenanter and the puritan  there were a table and writing materials in this meeting and a circle of from fifty to a hundred ladies one of those upon the platform requested me to express to them my opinion on free labor in a few words i told them i considered myself upon that subject more a learner than a teacher but that i was deeply interested in what i had learned upon this subject since my travelling in england and particularly interested in the consistency and selfdenial practised by their sect  i have been quite amused with something which has happened lately it always has seemed to me that distinguished people here in england live a remarkably outdoor sort of life and newspapers tell a vast deal about peoples concerns which it is not our custom to put into print in america such for instance as where the hon mr a is staying now and where he expects to go next what her grace wore at the last ball and when the royal children rode out and what they had on and whom lord suchaone had to dinner besides a large number of particulars which probably never happen  could i have expected dear old england to make me so much one of the family as to treat my humble fortunes in this same public manner but it is even so this week the times has informed the united kingdom that mrs stowe is getting a new dress madethe charming old aristocratic times which every body declares is such a wicked paper and yet which they can no more do without than they can their breakfast what am i and what is my fathers house that such distinction should come upon me i assure you my dear i feel myself altogether too much flattered there side by side with speculations on the eastern question and conjectures with regard to the secret and revealed will of the emperor of russia news from her majestys most sacred retreat at osborne and the last debates in parliament comes my brown silk dress the times has omitted the color i had a great mind to send him word about that but you may tell the girlsfor probably the news will spread through the american papersthat it is the brown chinese silk which they put into my trunk unmade when i was too ill to sit up and be fitted  mr times wants to know if mrs stowe is aware what sort of a place her dress is being made in and there is a letter from a dressmakers apprentice stating that it is being made up piecemeal in the most shockingly distressed dens of london by poor miserable white slaves worse treated than the plantation slaves of america  now mrs stowe did not know any thing of this but simply gave the silk into the hands of a friend and was in due time waited on in her own apartment by a very respectable woman who offered to make the dress and lo this is the result since the publication of this piece i have received earnest missives from various parts of the country begging me to interfere hoping that i was not going to patronize the white slavery of england and that i would employ my talents equally against oppression under every form the person who had been so unfortunate as to receive the weight of my public patronage was in a very tragical state protested her innocence of any connection with dens of any overworking of hands c with as much fervor as if i had been appointed on a committee of parliamentary inquiry let my case be a warning to all philanthropists who may happen to want clothes while they are in london some of my correspondents seemed to think that i ought to publish a manifesto for the benefit of distressed great britain stating how i came to do it and all the circumstances since they are quite sure i must have meant well and containing gentle cautions as to the disposal of my future patronage in the dressmaking line  could these people only know in what sacred simplicity i had been living in the state of maine where the only dressmaker of our circle was an intelligent refined welleducated woman who was considered as the equal of us all and whose spring and fall ministrations to our wardrobe were regarded a double pleasurea friendly visit as well as a domestic assistancei say could they know all this they would see how guiltless i was in the matter i verily never thought but that the nice pleasant person who came to measure me for my silk was going to take it home and make it herself it never occurred to me that she was the head of an establishment  and now what am i to do the times seems to think that in order to be consistent i ought to take up the conflict immediately but for my part i think otherwise what an unreasonable creature does he suppose me so lost to all due sense of humility as to take out of his hands a cause which he is pleading so well if the plantation slaves had such a good friend as the times and if every overworked female cotton picker could write as clever letters as this dressmakers apprentice and get them published in as influential papers and excite as general a sensation by them as this seems to have done i think i should feel that there was no need of my interfering in a work so much better done unfortunately our female cotton pickers do not know how to read and write and it is against the law to teach them and this instance shows that the law is a sagacious one since doubtless if they could read and write most embarrassing communications might be made  nothing shows more plainly to my mind than this letter the difference between the working class of england and the slave the free workman or workwoman of england or america however poor is selfrespecting is to some extent clever and intelligent is determined to resist wrong and as this incident shows has abundant means for doing so  when we shall see the columns of the charleston courier adorned with communications from cotton pickers and slave seamstresses we shall then think the comparison a fair one in fact apart from the whimsicality of the affair and the little annoyance which one feels at notoriety to which one is not accustomed i consider the incident as in some aspects a gratifying one as showing how awake and active are the sympathies of the british public with that muchoppressed class of needlewomen  horace greeley would be delighted could his labors in this line excite a similar commotion in new york  we dined today at the duke of argyles at dinner there were the members of the family the duchess of sutherland lord carlisle lord and lady blantyre c the conversation flowed along in a very agreeable channel i told them the more i contemplated life in great britain the more i was struck with the contrast between the comparative smallness of the territory and the vast power physical moral and intellectual which it exerted in the world  the duchess of sutherland added that it was beautiful to observe how gradually the idea of freedom had developed itself in the history of the english nation growing clearer and more distinct in every successive century  i might have added that the history of our own american republic is but a continuation of the history of this development the resistance to the stamp act was of the same kind as the resistance to the ship money and in our revolutionary war there were as eloquent defences of our principles and course heard in the british parliament as echoed in faneuil hall  i conversed some with lady caroline campbell the dukes sister with regard to scottish preaching and theology she is a member of the free church and attends in london dr cummings congregation i derived the impression from her remarks that the style of preaching in scotland is more discriminating and doctrinal than in england one who studies the pictures given in scotts novels must often have been struck with the apparent similarity in the theologic training and tastes of the laboring classes in new england and scotland the hardfeatured man whom he describes in rob roy as following the preacher so earnestly keeping count of the doctrinal points on his successive fingers is one which can still be seen in the retired rural districts of new england and i believe that this severe intellectual discipline of the pulpit has been one of the greatest means in forming that strong selfsustaining character peculiar to both countries  the duke of argyle said that chevalier bunsen had been speaking to him in relation to a college for colored people at antigua and inquired my views respecting the emigration of colored people from america to the west india islands i told him my impression was that canada would be a much better place to develop the energies of the race first on account of its cold and bracing climate second because having never been a slave state the white population there are more thrifty and industrious and of course the influence of such a community was better adapted to form thrift arid industry in the negro  in the evening some of the ladies alluded to the dressmakers letter in the times i inquired if there was nothing done for them as a class in london and some of them said  o lord shaftesbury can tell you all about it he is president of the society for their protection  so i said to lord shaftesbury playfully i thought my lord you had reformed every thing here in london  ah indeed he replied but this was not in one of my houses i preside over the west end  he talked on the subject for some time with considerable energy said it was one of the most difficult he had ever attempted to regulate and promised to send me a few documents which would show the measures he had pursued he said however that there was progress making and spoke of one establishment in particular which had recently been erected in london and was admirably arranged with regard to ventilation being conducted in the most perfect manner  quite a number of distinguished persons were present this evening among others sir david brewster famed in the scientific world he is a finelooking old gentleman with silverwhite hair who seemed to be on terms of great familiarity with the duke he bears the character of a decidedly religious man and is an elder in the free church  lord mahon the celebrated historian was there with his lady he is a younglooking man of agreeable manners and fluent in conversation this i gather from mr s with whom he conversed very freely on our historians prescott bancroft and especially dr sparks his sharp controversy with whom he seems to bear with great equanimity  lady mahon is a handsome interesting woman with very pleasing manners  mr gladstone was there also one of the ablest and best men in the kingdom it is a commentary on his character that although one of the highest of the high church we have never heard him spoken of even among dissenters otherwise than as an excellent and highly conscientious man for a gentleman who has attained to such celebrity both in theology and politics he looks remarkably young he is tall with dark hair and eyes a thoughtful serious cast of countenance and is easy and agreeable in conversation  on the whole this was a very delightful evening     letter xxvi  dear c  i will add to this a little sketch derived from the documents sent me by lord shaftesbury of the movements in behalf of the milliners and dressmakers in london for seven years past  about thirteen years ago in the year 1841 lord shaftesbury obtained a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the employment of children and young persons in various trades and manufactures this commission among other things was directed toward the millinery and dressmaking trade these commissioners elicited the following facts that there were fifteen hundred employers in this trade in london and fifteen thousand young people employed besides a great number of journeywomen who took the work home to their own houses they discovered also that during the london season which occupied about four months of the year the regular hours of work were fifteen but in many establishments they were entirely unlimitedthe young women never getting more than six hours for sleep and often only two or three that frequently they worked all night and part of sunday they discovered also that the rooms in which they worked and slept were overcrowded and deficient in ventilation and that in consequence of all these causes blindness consumption and multitudes of other diseases carried thousands of them yearly to the grave  these facts being made public to the english nation a society was formed in london in 1843 called the association for the aid of milliners and dressmakers the president of this society is the earl of shaftesbury the vice presidents are twenty gentlemen of the most influential position besides this there is a committee of ladies and a committee of gentlemen at the head of the committee of ladies stands the name of the duchess of sutherland with seventeen others among whom we notice the countess of shaftesbury countess of ellesmere lady robert grosvenor and others of the upper london sphere the subscription list of donations to the society is headed by the queen and royal family  the features of the plan which the society undertook to carry out were briefly these  first they opened a registration office where all young persons desiring employment in the dressmaking trade might enroll their names free of expense and thus come in a manner under the care of the association from the young people thus enrolled they engaged to supply to the principals of dressmaking establishments extra assistants in periods of uncommon pressure so that they should not be under the necessity of overtaxing their workwomen this assistance is extended only to those houses which will observe the moderate hours recommended by the association  in the second place an arrangement is made by which the young persons thus registered are entitled to the best of medical advice at any time for the sum of five shillings per year three physicians and two consulting surgeons are connected with the association  in the third place models of simple and cheap modes of ventilation are kept at all times at the office of the society and all the influence of the association is used to induce employers to place them in the work and sleeping rooms  fourth a kind of savings bank has been instituted in which the workwomen are encouraged to deposit small earnings on good interest  this is the plan of the society and as to its results i have at hand the report for 1851 from which you can gather some particulars of its practical workings they say eight years have elapsed since this association was established during which a most gratifying change has been wrought in respect to the mode of conducting the dressmaking and millinery business  without overstepping the strict limits of truth it may be affirmed that the larger part of the good thus achieved is attributable to the influence and unceasing efforts of this society the general result so far as the metropolis is concerned may be thus stated first the hours of work speaking generally now rarely exceed twelve whereas formerly sixteen seventeen and even eighteen hours were not unusual  second the young persons are rarely kept up all night which was formerly not an unusual occurrence  third labor on the lords day it is confidently believed has been entirely abrogated  under the old system the health and constitution of many of the young people were irretrievably destroyed at present permanent loss of health is rarely entailed and even when sickness does from any cause arise skilful and prompt advice and medicine are provided at a moderate charge by the association  in addition to these and similar ameliorations other and more important changes have been effected among the heads of establishments as the committee are happy to know and most willing to record more elevated views of the duties and responsibilities inseparable from employers have secured to the association the zealous cooperation of numerous and influential principals without whose aid the efforts of the last few years would have been often impeded or even in many instances defeated nor have the young persons engaged in the dressmaking and millinery business remained uninfluenced amidst the general improvement finding that a strenuous effort was in progress to promote their physical and moral welfare and that increased industry on their part would be rewarded by diminished hours of work the assistants have become more attentive the workrooms are better managed and both parties relieved from a system which was oppressive to all and really beneficial to none have recognized the fundamental truth that in no industrial pursuit is there any real incompatibility between the interests rightfully interpreted of the employer and the employed although not generally known evils scarcely less serious than those formerly prevalent in the metropolis were not uncommon in the manufacturing towns and fashionable wateringplaces it is obviously impracticable to ascertain to what extent the efforts of the association have been attended with success in the provinces but a rule has been established that in no instance shall the cooperation of the office in providing assistants be extended to any establishment in which the hours of work are known to exceed those laid down by the association on these conditions the principals of many country establishments have for several years been supplied latterly indeed owing to the great efficiency of the manager miss newton and to the general satisfaction thus created these applications have so much increased as to constitute a principal part of the business of the office and with the increase the influence of the association has been proportionally extended  this as you perceive was the report for 1851 lord shaftesbury has kindly handed me the first proof of the report for 1853 from which i will send you a few extracts  after the publication of the letter from the ladies of england to the ladies of america much was said in the times and other newspapers with regard to the condition of the dressmakers these things are what are alluded to in the commencement of the report they say  in presenting their annual report the committees would in the first place refer to the public notice that has lately been directed to the mode in which the dressmaking and millinery business is conducted this they feel to be due both to the association and to those employers who have cooperated in the good work of improvement it has been stated in former reports that since the first establishment of this society in the year 1843 and essentially through its influence great ameliorations have been secured that the inordinate hours of work formerly prevalent had speaking generally been greatly reduced that sunday labor had been abolished that the young people were rarely kept up all night and that as a consequence of these improvements there had been a marked decrease of serious sickness  at the present moment in consequence of the statements that have appeared in the public journals and in order to guard against misconceptions the committees are anxious to announce that they perceive no reason for withdrawing any of their preceding statements the latest equally with former investigations indicating the great improvement effected in recent years the manager at the office has been instructed to make express inquiries of the young dressmakers themselves and the result distinctly proves that on the whole there has been a marked diminution in the hours of work  the report of mr trouncer the medical officer who has attended the larger number of the young persons for whom advice has been provided by the association is equally satisfactory this gentleman after alluding to the great evils in regard to health inflicted in former years remarks that these have through the instrumentality of the association been greatly ameliorated that as regards consumption although the nature of the employment itself however modified by kindness has a tendency to develop the disease where the predisposition existshe is happy to state that the average number of cases even in the incipient stage has not been so great as might from the circumstances have been anticipated that during the last two years out of about two hundred and fifty cases of sickness no death has occurred and that but in a few instances only has it been necessary to advise a total cessation of business mr trouncer adds and this is a statement which the committees have much pleasure in announcingthat in the majority of the west end houses the principals have in cases of sickness acted the part of parents evincing in some instances even more care than the young persons themselves  in addition to these satisfactory and reliable statements it is a matter of simple justice to state that many houses of business have cooperated with the association in reducing the hours of work in improving the workrooms and sleeping apartments and generally in promoting the comfort of those in their employ some employers have also very creditably and at considerable expense exerted themselves to secure a good system of ventilationa subject to which the committees attach great importance both as regards the health and comfort of those employed  it is not by these statements intended to be said that all requiring amendment has been corrected in their last report the committees remarked that some few houses of business systematically persisted in exacting excessive labor from their assistants and they regret to state that this observation is still applicable the important subject of ventilation is still much neglected and there is reason to apprehend that the sleeping apartments are often much overcrowded another and a more prevailing evil relates to the time allowed for meals this is often altogether insufficient and strongly contrasted with the custom in other industrial pursuits in which one hour for dinner and half an hour for breakfast or tea as the case may be is the usual allowance in an occupation so sedentary as dressmaking and especially in the case of young females hurried meals are most injurious and are a frequent cause of deranged health it is also the painful duty of the committees to state that in some establishments according to the medical report the principals in cases of sickness will neither allow the young people an opportunity of calling on the medical officer for his advice nor permit that gentleman to visit them at the place of business the evils resulting from this absence of all proper feeling are so obvious that it is hoped this public rebuke will in future obviate the necessity of recurring to so painful a topic  the committee after this proceed to publish the following declaration signed by fiftythree of the west end dressmakers  we the undersigned principals of millinery and dressmaking establishments at the west end of london having observed in the newspapers statements of excessive labor in our business feel called upon in selfdefence to make the following public statement especially as we have reason to believe that some of the assertions contained in the letters published in the newspapers are not wholly groundless  1 during the greater portion of the year we do not require the young people in our establishments to work more than twelve hours inclusive of one hour and a half for meals from march to july we require them to work thirteen hours and a half allowing during that time one hours rest for dinner and half an hours rest for tea  2 it has been our object to provide suitable sleeping accommodations and to avoid overcrowding  3 in no case do we require work on sundays or all night  4 the food we supply is of the best quality and unlimited in quantity  five of these dressmakers whose names are designated by stars signed with the understanding that on rare occasions the hours might possibly be exceeded  the remarks which the committee make considering that it has upon its list the most influential and distinguished ladies of the london world are i think worth attention as showing the strong moral influence which must thus be brought to bear both on the trade and on fashionable society by this association they first remark with regard to those employers who signed with the reservation alluded to that they have every reason to believe that the feeling which prompted this qualification is to be respected as it originated in a determination not to undertake more than they honestly intended to perform  they say of the document on the whole that though not realizing all the views of the association it must be regarded as creditable to those who have signed it since it indicates the most important advance yet made towards the improvement of the dressmaking and millinery business the committees then go on to express a most decided opinion first that the hours of work in the dressmaking trade ought not to exceed ten per diem second that during the fashionable season ladies should employ sufficient time for the execution of their orders  the influence of this association as will be seen has extended all over england in manchester a paper signed by three thousand ladies was presented to the principals of the establishments desiring them to adopt the rules of the london association  i mentioned in a former letter that the lady mayoress of london and the ladies of the city held a meeting on the subject only a short time since with a view of carrying the same improvement through all the establishments of that part of london the lady mayoress and five others of this meeting consented to add their names to the committee so that it now represents the whole of london the bishop of london and several of the clergy extend their patronage to the association     letter xxvii  dear s  the next day we went to hear a sermon in behalf of the ragged schools by the archbishop of canterbury the children who attended the ragged schools of that particular district were seated in the gallery each side of the organ as this was the sunday appropriated to the exercise all three of the creeds were readthe apostles athanasian and nicene all which the little things repeated after the archbishop with great decorum and probably with the same amount of understanding that we when children had of the assemblys catechism  the venerable archbishop was ushered into the pulpit by beadles with gold lace cocked hats striking the ground majestically with their long staves of office his sermon however was as simple clear and beautiful an exposition of the duty of practical christianity towards the outcast and erring as i ever heard he said that should we find a young child wandering away from its home and friends we should instinctively feel it our duty to restore the little wanderer and such he said is the duty we owe to all these young outcasts who had strayed from the home of their heavenly father  after the sermon they took up a collection and when we went into the vestry to speak to the archbishop we saw him surrounded by the church wardens counting over the money  i noticed in the back part of the church a number of children in tattered garments with rather a forlorn and wild appearance and was told that these were those who had just been introduced into the school and had not been there long enough to come under its modifying influences we were told that they were always thus torn and forlorn in their appearance at first but that they gradually took pains to make themselves respectable the archbishop said pleasantly when they return to their right mind they appear clothed also and sitting at the feet of jesus  the archbishop sent me afterwards a beautiful edition of his sermons on christian charity embracing a series of discourses on various topics of practical benevolence relating to the elevation and christianization of the masses they are written with the same purity of style and show the same devout and benevolent spirit with his other writings  my thoughts were much saddened today by the news which i received this week of the death of mary edmonson it is not for her that i could weep for she died as calmly and serenely as she lived resigning her soul into the hands of her savior what i do weep for is that under the flag of my countryand that country a christian onesuch a life as marys could have been lived and so little said or done about it  in the afternoon i went to the deanery of st paulsa retired building in a deep court opposite the cathedral after a brief conversation with mr and mrs milman we went to the cathedral i had never seen it before and was much impressed with the majesty and grace of the interior nevertheless the italian style of architecture with all its elegance fails to affect me equally with the gothic the very rudeness of the latter a something inchoate and unfinished is significant of matter struggling with religious ideas too vast to be fully expressed even as in the ancient scriptures there are ideas which seem to overtask the powers of human language i sat down with mrs m in one of the little compartments or stalls as they are called into which the galleries are divided and which are richly carved in black oak the whole service was chanted by a choir expressly trained for the purpose some of the performers are boys of about thirteen years and of beautiful countenances there is a peculiar manner of reading the service practised in the cathedrals which is called intoning it is a plaintive rhythmical chant with as strong an unction of the nasal as ever prevailed in a quaker or methodist meeting i cannot exactly understand why episcopacy threw out the slur of nasal twang as one of the peculiarities of the conventicle when it is in full force in the most approved seats of church orthodoxy i listened to all in as uncritical and sympathetic a spirit as possible giving myself up to be lifted by the music as high as it could waft me to one thus listening it is impossible to criticize with severity for unless positively offensive any music becomes beautiful by the power of sympathy and association after service we listened to a short sermon from the rev mr villiers fervent affectionate and evangelical in spirit and much in the general style of sermonizing which i have already described  monday morning may 23 we went to breakfast at mr cobdens mr c is a man of slender frame rather under than over the middle size with great ease of manner and flexibility of movement and the most frank fascinating smile his appearance is a sufficient account of his popularity for he seems to be one of those men who carry about them an atmosphere of vivacity and social exhilaration we had a very pleasant and social time discussing and comparing things in england and america mr cobden assured us that he had had curious calls from americans sometimes once an editor of a small village paper called who had been making a tour through the rural districts of england he said that he had asked some mowers how they were prospering they answered we aint prosperin were hayin said cobden  i told the man now dont you go home and publish that in your paper but he did nevertheless and sent me over the paper with the story in it i might have comforted him with many a similar anecdote of americans as for example the man who was dead set against a tariff cause he knew if they once got it theyd run the old thing right through his farm or those immortal pennsylvania dutchmen who to this day it is said give in all their votes under the solemn conviction that they are upholding general jacksons administration  the conversation turned on the question of the cultivation of cotton by free labor the importance of this great measure was fully appreciated by mr cobden as it must be by all the difficulties to be overcome in establishing the movement were no less clearly seen and ably pointed out on the whole the comparison of views was not only interesting in a high degree but to us at least eminently profitable we ventured to augur favorably to the cause from the indications of that interview  from this breakfast we returned to dine at surrey parsonage and after dinner attended miss greenfields concert at stafford house mr s could not attend on account of so soon leaving town  the concert room was the brilliant and picturesque hall i have before described to you it looked more picturelike and dreamy than ever the piano was on the flat stairway just below the broad central landing it was a grand piano standing end outward and perfectly banked up among hothouse flowers so that only its gilded top was visible sir george smart presided the choicest of the élite were there ladies in demitoilet and bonneted miss greenfield stood among the singers on the staircase and excited a sympathetic murmur among the audience she is not handsome but looked very well she has a pleasing dark face wore a black velvet headdress and white carnelian earrings a black mohr antique silk made high in the neck with white lace falling sleeves and white gloves a certain gentleness of manner and selfpossession the result of the universal kindness shown her sat well upon her chevalier bunsen the prussian ambassador sat by me he looked at her with much interest are the race often as good looking he said i said she is not handsome compared with many though i confess she looks uncommonly well today  among the company present i noticed the beautiful marchioness of stafford i have spoken of her once before but it is difficult to describe her there is something so perfectly simple yet elegant in her appearance but it has cut itself like a cameo in my memorya figure under the middle size perfectly moulded dressed simply in black a beautiful head hair à la madonna ornamented by a band of gold coins on black velvet a band of the same kind encircling her throat is the only relief to the severe simplicity of her dress  the singing was beautiful six of the most cultivated glee singers of london sang among other things springs delights are now returning and where the bee sucks there lurk i the duchess said these glees are peculiarly english it was indeed delightful to hear shakspeares aerial words made vocal within the walls of this fairy palace the duchess has a strong nationality and nationality always interesting never appears in so captivating a form as when it expresses itself through a beautiful and cultivated woman one likes to see a person identifying ones self with a country and she embraces england with its history its strength its splendor its moral power with an evident pride and affection which i love to see  miss greenfields turn for singing now came and there was profound attention her voice with its keen searching fire its penetrating vibrant quality its timbre as the french have it cut its way like a damascus blade to the heart it was the more touching from occasional rusticities and artistic defects which showed that she had received no culture from art  she sang the ballad old folks at home giving one verse in the soprano and another in the tenor voice  as she stood partially concealed by the piano chevalier bunsen thought that the tenor part was performed by one of the gentlemen he was perfectly astonished when he discovered that it was by her this was rapturously encored between the parts sir george took her to the piano and tried her voice by skips striking notes here and there at random without connection from d in alt to a first space in bass clef she followed with unerring precision striking the sound nearly at the same instant his finger touched the key this brought out a burst of applause  after the concert we walked through the rooms the effect of the groups of people sauntering through the hall or looking down from the galleries was picturelike two of the dukes highland pipers in full costume playing their bagpipes now made their appearance and began to promenade the halls playing their dress reminds me in its effect of that of our american indians and their playing is wild and barbaric it had a striking effect among these wide halls and corridors there is nothing poetic connected with the history and position of the family of which the fair owner of the halls does not feel the power and which she cannot use with artistic skill in heightening the enchantments of an entertainment  rev s r ward attracted attention in the company as a fullblooded africantall enough for a palm tree i observed him in conversation with lords dukes and ambassadors sustaining himself modestly but with selfpossession all who converse with him are satisfied that there is no native difference between the african and other men  the duchess took me to look at a model of dunrobintheir castle on the sutherland estate it is in the old french chateau style in general architecture something like the print of glamis it is curious that the french architecture has obtained in scotland her grace kindly invited me to visit dunrobin on my return to scotland in the autumn taking it after inverary this will be delightful that scottish coast i love almost like my own country  lord shaftesbury was there he came and spoke to us after the concert speaking of miss greenfield he said i consider the use of these halls for the encouragement of an outcast race a consecration this is the true use of wealth and splendor when it is employed to raise up and encourage the despised and forgotten  in the evening though very weary c persuaded me to accept an invitation to hear the creation at exeter hall performed by the london sacred harmonic society they had kindly reserved a gallery for us and when we went in mr surman the founder and for twenty years conductor of the society presented me with a beautifully bound copy of the creation  having never heard it before i could not compare the performance with others i heard it as i should hear a poem read simply thinking of the authors ideas and not of the style of reading haydn i was thinking ofthe bright brilliant cheerful haydnwho when complained of for making church music into dancing tunes replied when i think of god my soul is always so full of joy that i want to dance this creation is a descriptive poemthe garden parts unite thomson and miltons stylethe whole effect pastoral yet brilliant i was never more animated i had had a new experience it is worth while to know nothing to have such a fresh sensation  the next day tuesday may 24 we went to lunch with miss r at oxford terrace among a number of distinguished guests was lady byron with whom i had a few moments of deeply interesting conversation no engravings that ever have been circulated of her in america do any justice to her appearance she is of a slight figure formed with exceeding delicacy and her whole form face dress and air unite to make an impression of a character singularly dignified gentle pure and yet strong no words addressed to me in any conversation hitherto have made their way to my inner soul with such force as a few remarks dropped by her on the present religious aspect of englandremarks of such a quality as one seldom hears  lady byrons whole course i have learned has been one made venerable by consistent active benevolence i was happy to find in her the patroness of our american outcasts william and ellen crafts she had received them into the schools of her daughter lady lovelace at occum and now spoke in the highest terms of their character and proficiency in study the story of their misfortunes united with their reputation for worth had produced such an impression on the simple country people that they always respectfully touch their hats when meeting them ellen she says has become mother of a most beautiful child and their friends are now making an effort to put them into some little business by which they may obtain a support  i could not but observe with regret the evident fragility of lady byrons health yet why should i regret it why wish to detain here those whose home is evidently from hence and who will only then fully live when the shadow we call life is passed away  here also i was personally introduced to a lady with whom i had passed many a dreamy hour of spiritual communionmrs jameson whose works on arts and artists were for years almost my only food for a certain class of longings  mrs jameson is the most charming of critics with the gift often too little prized of discovering and pointing out beauties rather than defects beauties which we may often have passed unnoticed but which when so pointed out never again conceal themselves this shows itself particularly in her characteristics of shakspeares women a critique which only a true woman could have written  she seemed rather surprised to find me inquiring about art and artists i asked her where one might go to study that subject most profitably and her answer was in munich  by her side was mrs chisholm the author of those benevolent movements for the emigrants which i have mentioned to you she is a stout practical looking woman who impresses you with the idea of perfect health exuberant life and an iron constitution her face expresses decision energy and good sense she is a woman of few words every moment of whose time seems precious  one of her remarks struck me from the quaint force with which it was uttered i found said she if we want any thing done we must go to work and do it is of no use to talk none whatever it is the secret of her lifes success mrs chisholm first began by doing on a small scale what she wanted done and people seeing the result fell in with and helped her but to have convinced them of the feasibility of her plans by talking without this practical demonstration would have been impossible  at this réunion also was mr george thompson whom i had never seen before and many of the warmest friends of the slave during this visit i was taken ill and obliged to return to mr gurneys where i was indisposed during the remainder of the day and late in the evening drove home to surrey parsonage  the next evening wednesday may 29 we attended an antislavery soirée at williss rooms formerly known as almacks so at least i was told a number of large rooms were thrown open brilliantly lighted and adorned and filled with throngs of people in the course of the evening we went upon the platform in the large hall where an address was presented by s bowley esq of gloucester it was one of the most beautiful sensible judicious and christian addresses that could have been made and i listened to it with unmingled pleasure in reply mr s took occasion still further to explain his views with respect to the freegrown cotton movement in england and its bearings on the future progress of the cause of freedom footnote we are happy to say that a large body of religious persons in great britain have become favorable to these views a vigorous society has been established combining india reform and free cotton with the antislavery cause the earl of albemarle made while we were in london a vigorous india reform speech in the house of lords and messrs bright and cobden are fully in for the same object in the commons there is much hope in the movement  after the addresses we dispersed to different rooms where refreshment tables were bountifully laid out and adorned by my side at one end of them was a young female of pleasing exterior with fine eyes delicate person neatly dressed in white she was introduced to me as ellen craftsa name memorable in boston annals her husband a pleasant intelligent young man with handsome manners was there also had it not been for my introduction i could never have fancied ellen to have been any other than some english girl with rather a paler cheek than common she has very sweet manners and uses uncommonly correct and beautiful language let it not be supposed that with such witnesses as these among them our english brethren have derived their first practical knowledge of slavery from uncle toms cabin the mere knowledge that two such persons as william and ellen crafts have been rated as merchantable commodities in any country but ours would be a sufficient comment on the system  we retired early after a very agreeable evening     letter xxviii  may 28  my dear cousin  this morning lord shaftesbury came according to appointment to take me to see the model lodging houses he remarked that it would be impossible to give me the full effect of seeing them unless i could first visit the dens of filth disease and degradation in which the poor of london formerly were lodged with a good deal of satisfaction he told me that the american minister mr ingersoll previous to leaving london had requested the police to take him over the dirtiest and most unwholesome parts of it that he might see the lowest as well as the highest sphere of london life after this however the policeman took him through the baths wash houses and model lodging houses which we were going to visit and he expressed himself both surprised and delighted with the improvement that had been made  illustration of the facade of the model lodging house  we first visited the lodging house for single men in charles street drury lane this was one of the first experiments made in this line and to effect the thing in the most economical manner possible three old houses were bought and thrown into one and fitted up for the purpose on the ground floor we saw the superintendents apartment and a large long sitting room furnished with benches and clean scoured tables where the inmates were some of them reading books or papers the day being wet perhaps kept them from their work in the kitchen were ample cooking accommodations and each inmate as i understand cooks for himself lord shaftesbury said thatsomething like a common table had been tried but that it was found altogether easier or more satisfactory for each one to suit himself on this floor also was a bathing room and a wellselected library of useful reading books history travels c on the next floor were the dormitoriesa great hall divided by board partitions into little sleeping cells about eight feet square each containing a neat bed chair and stand the partition does not extend quite up to the wall and by this means while each inmate enjoys the privacy of a small room he has all the comfort of breathing the air of the whole hall  a working man returning from his daily toil to this place can first enjoy the comfort of a bath then going into the kitchen make his cup of tea or coffee and sitting down at one of the clean scoured tables in the sitting room sip his tea and look over a book or a friendly company may prepare their supper and sit down to tea together lord shaftesbury said that the effect produced on the men by such an arrangement was wonderful they became decent decorous and selfrespecting they passed rules of order for their community they subscribed for their library from their own earnings and the books are mostly of their own selection it is remarkable said his lordship that of their own accord they decided to reject every profane indecent or immoral work it showed he said how strong are the influences of the surroundings in reforming or ruining the character it should be remarked that all these advantages are enjoyed for the same price charged by the most crowded and filthy of lodging houses namely fourpence per night or two shillings per week the building will accommodate eightytwo the operation supports itself handsomely  i should remark by the by that in order to test more fully the practicability of the thing this was accomplished in one of the worst neighborhoods in london  from these we proceeded to view a more perfect specimen of the same sort in the model lodging house of george street bloomsbury square a house which was built de novo for the purpose of perfectly illustrating the principle this house accommodates one hundred and four working men and combines every thing essential or valuable in such an establishmentcomplete ventilation and drainage the use of a distinct living room a kitchen and a wash house a bath and an ample supply of water and all the conveniences which while promoting the physical comfort of the inmates tend to increase their selfrespect and elevate them in the scale of moral and intellectual beings the arrangement of the principal apartments are such as to insure economy as well as domestic comfort the kitchen and wash house being furnished with every requisite convenience including a bath supplied with hot and cold water also a separate and wellventilated safe for the food of each inmate under the care of the superintendent is a small but wellselected library  the common room thirtythree feet long twentythree feet wide and ten feet nine inches high is paved with white tiles laid on brick arches and on each side are two rows of tables with seats at the fireplace is a constant supply of hot water and above it are the rules of the establishment the staircase which occupies the centre of the building is of stone the dormitories eight in number ten feet high are subdivided with movable wood partitions six feet nine inches high each compartment enclosed by its own door is fitted up with a bed chair and clothes box a shaft is carried up at the end of every room the ventilation through it being assisted by the introduction of gas which lights the apartment a similar shaft is carried up the staircase supplying fresh air to the dormitories with a provision for warming it if necessary the washing closets on each floor are fitted up with slate having japanned iron basins and water laid on  during the fearful ravages of the cholera in this immediate neighborhood not one case occurred in this house among its one hundred and four inmates  from this place we proceeded to one if any thing more interesting to me this was upon the same principle appropriated to the lodgment of single women when one considers the defenceless condition of single women who labor for their own subsistence in a large city how easily they are imposed upon and oppressed and how quickly a constitution may be destroyed for want of pure air fresh water and other common necessaries of life one fully appreciates the worth of a large and beautiful building which provides for this oppressed fragile class  the thanksgiving model buildings at port pool lane grays inn are so called because they were built with a thankoffering collected in the various religious societies of london as an appropriate expression of their gratitude to god for the removal of the cholera this block of buildings has in it accommodations for twenty families and one hundred and twentyeight single women together with a public wash house and a large cellar in which are stored away the goods of those women who live by the hucksters trade  the hundred and twentyeight single women of whom the majority are supposed to be poor needlewomen occupy sixtyfour rooms in a building of four stories divided by a central staircase a corridor on either side forms a lobby to eight rooms each twelve feet six inches long by nine feet six inches wide sufficiently large for two persons they are fitted up with two bedsteads a table chairs and a washing stand the charge is one shilling per week for each person or two shillings per room  lord shaftesbury took me into one of the rooms where was an aged female partially bedridden who maintained herself by sewing the room was the picture of neatness and comfort a good supply of hot and cold water was furnished in it her work was spread out by her upon the bed together with her bible and hymn book she looked cheerful and comfortable she seemed pleased to see lord shaftesbury whom she had evidently seen many times before as his is a familiar countenance in all these places she expressed the most fervent thankfulness for the quiet order and comfort of her pleasant lodgings comparing them very feelingly with what used to be her condition before any such place had been provided  illustration of a four story rectangular brickmasonry structure  from this place we drove to the streatham street lodging house for families of which the following is an outside view this building is in the first place fire proof in the second the separation in the parts belonging to different families is rendered complete and perfect by the use of hollow brick for the partitions which entirely prevents as i am told the transmission of sound  the accompanying print shows the plan of one

galleries into which every tenement opens run round the inside of the hollow court which the building encloses and afford an admirable playplace for the little children out of the dangers and temptations of the street and in view of their respective mothers the foregoing print representing the inner half of the quadrangle shows the arrangement of the galleries  now said lord shaftesbury as he was showing me through these tenements which were models of neatness and good keeping you must bear in mind that these are tenanted by the very people who once were living in the dirtiest and filthiest lodging houses people whom the world said it did no good to try to help that they liked to be dirty better than clean and would be dirty under any circumstances  he added the following anecdote to show the effect of poor lodgings in degrading the character a fine young man of some considerable taste and talent obtained his living by designing patterns for wall paper a long and expensive illness so reduced his circumstances that he was obliged to remove to one of these low filthy lodging houses already alluded to from that time he became an altered man his wife said that he lost all energy all taste in designing love of reading and fondness for his family began to frequent drinking shops and was visibly on the road to ruin hearing of these lodging houses he succeeded in renting a tenement in one of them for the same sum which he had paid for the miserable dwelling under the influence of a neat airy pleasant domestic home the mans better nature again awoke his health improved he ceased to crave ardent spirits and his former ingenuity in his profession returned  now this shows said lord shaftesbury that hundreds may have been ruined simply by living in miserable dwellings i looked into this young mans tenement it was not only neat but ornamented with a great variety of engravings tastefully disposed upon the wall on my expressing my pleasure in this circumstance he added it is one of the pleasantest features of the case to notice how soon they began to ornament their little dwellings some have cages with singing birds and some pots of flowering plants some pictures and engravings  and are these buildings successful in a pecuniary point of view i said do they pay their own way  yes he replied they do i consider that these buildings if they have done nothing more have established two points first that the poor do not prefer dirt and disorder where it is possible for them to secure neatness and order and second that buildings with every proper accommodation can be afforded at a price which will support an establishment  said i are people imitating these lodging houses very rapidly  to a great extent they are he replied but not so much as i desire buildings on these principles have been erected in the principal towns of england and scotland the state of the miserable dwellings courts alleys c is the consequence of the neglect of former days when speculators and builders were allowed to do as they liked and run up hovels where the working man whose house must be regulated not by his choice but by his work was compelled then as he is now to live however narrow unhealthy or repulsive the place might be this was called the liberty of the subject it has been one of lord shaftesburys most arduous parliamentary labors to bring the lodging houses under governmental regulation he told me that he introduced a bill to this effect in the house of commons while a member as lord ashley and that just as it had passed through the house of commons he entered the house of lords as lord shaftesbury and so had the satisfaction of carrying the bill to its completion in that house where it passed in the year 1851 the provisions of this bill require every keeper of a lodging house to register his name at the metropolitan police office under a penalty of a fine of five pounds for every lodger received before this is done after having given notice to the police they are not allowed to receive lodgers until the officers have inspected the house to see whether it accords with the required conditions these conditions are that the walls and ceilings be whitewashed that the floors stairs beds and bed clothes are clean that there be some mode of ventilating every room that each house be provided with every accommodation for promoting decency and neatness that the drains and cesspools are perfect the yards properly paved so as to run dry and that each house has a supply of water with conveniences for cooking and washing and finally that no person with an infectious disease is inhabiting the house it is enacted moreover that only so many shall be placed in a room as shall be permitted by the commissioners of the police and it is made an indispensable condition to the fitness of a house that the proprietor should hang up in every room a card properly signed by the police inspector stating the precise number who are allowed to be lodged there the law also strictly forbids persons of different sexes occupying the same room except in case of married people with children under ten years of age more than one married couple may not inhabit the same apartment without the provision of a screen to secure privacy it is also forbidden to use the kitchens sculleries or cellars for sleeping rooms unless specially permitted by the police the keeper of the house is required thoroughly to whitewash the walls and ceilings twice a year and to cleanse the drains and cesspools whenever required by the police in case of sickness notice must be immediately given to the police and such measures pursued for preventing infection as may be deemed judicious by the inspector  the commissioner of police reports to the secretary of state systematically as to the results of this system  after looking at these things we proceeded to view one of the model washing houses which had been erected for the convenience of poor women we entered a large hall which was divided by low wood partitions into small apartments in each of which a woman was washing the whole process of washing clothes in two or three waters and boiling them can be effected without moving from the spot or changing the tub each successive water is let out at the bottom while fresh is let on from the top when the clothes are ready to be boiled a wooden cover is placed over them and a stream of scalding steam is directed into the tub by turning a stop cock this boils the water in a few moments effectually cleansing the clothes they are then whirled in a hollow cylinder till nearly dry after which they are drawn through two rollers covered with flannel which presses every remaining particle of water out of them the clothes are then hung upon frames which shut into large closets and are dried by steam in a very short space of time  lord shaftesbury pointing out the partitions said this is an arrangement of delicacy to save their feelings their clothes are sometimes so old and shabby they do not want to show them poor things i thought this feature worthy of special notice  in addition to all these improvements for the laboring classes very large bathing establishments have been set up expressly for the use of the working classes to show the popularity and effectiveness of this movement five hundred and fifty thousand baths were given in three houses during the year 1850 these bathing establishments for the working classes are rapidly increasing in every part of the kingdom  when we returned to our carriage after this survey i remarked to lord shaftesbury that the combined influence of these causes must have wrought a considerable change in the city he answered with energy you can have no idea whole streets and districts have been revolutionized by it the people who were formerly savage and ferocious because they supposed themselves despised and abandoned are now perfectly quiet and docile i can assure you that lady shaftesbury has walked alone with no attendant but a little child through streets in london where years ago a welldressed man could not have passed safely without an escort of the police  i said to him that i saw nothing now with all the improvements they were making throughout the kingdom to prevent their working classes from becoming quite as prosperous as ours except the want of a temperance reformation  he assented with earnestness he believed he said that the amount spent in liquors of various kinds which do no good but much injury was enough to furnish every laborers dwelling not only with comforts but with elegances but then he said one thing is to be considered a reform of the dwellings will do a great deal towards promoting a temperance reformation a man who lives in a close unwholesome dwelling deprived of the natural stimulus of fresh air and pure water comes into a morbid and unhealthy state he craves stimulants to support the sinking of his vital powers caused by these unhealthy influences there is certainly a great deal of truth in this and i think that in america we should add to the force of our maine law by adopting some of the restrictions of the lodging house act  i have addressed this letter to you my dear cousin on account of the deep interest you have taken in the condition of the poor and perishing in the city of new york while making these examinations these questions occurred to my mind could our rich christian men employ their capital in a more evangelical manner or more adorn the city of new york than by raiding a large and beautiful lodging house which should give the means of health comfort and vigor to thousands of poor needlewomen the same query may be repeated concerning all the other lodging houses i have mentioned furthermore should not a movement for the registration and inspection of common lodging houses keep pace with efforts to suppress the sale of spirits the poison of these dismal haunts creates a craving for stimulants which constantly tends to break over and evade law     letter xxix  dear father  i wish in this letter to give you a brief view of the movements in this country for the religious instruction and general education of the masses if we compare the tone of feeling now prevalent with that existing but a few years back we notice a striking change no longer ago than in the time of lady huntington we find a lady of quality ingenuously confessing that her chief source of scepticism in regard to christianity was that it actually seemed to imply that the educated the refined the noble must needs be saved by the same savior and the same gospel with the ignorant and debased working classes traces of a similar style of feeling are discernible in the letters of the polished correspondents of hannah more robert walpole gayly intimates himself somewhat shocked at the idea that the nobility and the vulgar should be equally subject to the restraints of the sabbath and the law of godequally exposed to the sanctions of endless retribution and young makes his highborn dame inquire    shall pleasures of a short duration chain    a ladys soul in everlasting pain  in broad contrast to this all the modern popular movements in england are based upon the recognition of the equal value of every human soul the times the most aristocratic paper in england publishes letters from needlewomen and dressmakers apprentices and reads grave lectures to duchesses and countesses on their duties to their poor sisters one may fancy what a stir this would have made in the courtly circles of the reign of george ii fashionable literature now arrays itself on the side of the working classes the current of novel writing is reversed instead of milliners and chambermaids being bewitched with the adventures of countesses and dukes we now have fine lords and ladies hanging enchanted over the history of john the carrier with his little dot dropping sympathetic tears into little charlies wash tub and pursuing the fortunes of a dressmakers apprentice in company with poor smike and honest john brodie and his little yorkshire wife punch laughs at every body but the work people and if occasionally he laughs at them it is rather in a kindly way than with any air of contempt then prince albert visits model lodging houses and commands all the ingenuity of the kingdom to expend itself in completing the ideal of a workmans cottage for the great worlds fair lords deliver lydeum lectures ladies patronize ragged schools committees of duchesses meliorate the condition of needlewomen in short the great ship of the world has tacked and stands on another course  the beginning of this great humanitarian movement in england was undoubtedly the struggle of clarkson wilberforce and their associates for the overthrow of the slave trade in that struggle the religious democratic element was brought to bear for years upon the mind of parliament the negro most degraded of men was taken up and for years made to agitate british society on the simple ground that he had a human soul  of course the religious obligations of society to every human soul were involved in the discussion it educated parliament it educated the community parliament became accustomed to hearing the simple principles of the gospel asserted in its halls as of binding force the community were trained in habits of efficient benevolent action which they have never lost the use of tracts of committees of female cooperation of voluntary association and all the appliances of organized reform were discovered and successfully developed the triumphant victory then achieved moreover became the pledge of future conquests in every department of reform concerning the movements for the elevation of the masses lord shaftesbury has kindly furnished me with a few brief memoranda set down as nearly as possible in chronological order  in the first place there has been reform of the poor laws so corrupt had this system become that a distinct caste had well nigh sprung into permanent existence families having been known to subsist in idleness for five generations solely by means of skilful appropriation of public and private charities  the law giving to paupers the preference in all cases where any public work was to be done operated badly good workmen might starve for want of work by declaring themselves paupers they obtained employment thus virtually a bounty was offered to pauperism his lordship remarks  there have been sad defects no doubt and some harshness under the new system but the general result has been excellent and in many instances the system has been reduced to practice in a truly patriarchal spirit the great difficulty and the great failure are found in the right and safe occupation of children who are trained in these workhouses of which so much has been said  in the second place the treatment of the insane has received a thorough investigation this began in 1828 by a committee of inquiry moved for by mr gordon  an almost incredible amount of suffering and horrible barbarity was thus brought to light for the most part it appeared that the treatment of the insane had been conducted on the old absurd idea which cuts them off from humanity and reduces them below the level of the brutes the regimen in private madhouses was such that lord shaftesbury remarked of them in a speech on the subject i have said before and now say again that should it please god to visit me with such an affliction i would greatly prefer the treatment of paupers in an establishment like that of the surrey asylum to the treatment of the rich in almost any one of these receptacles  instances are recorded of individuals who were exhumed from cells where they had existed without clothing or cleansing as was ascertained for years after they had entirely recovered the exercise of sound reason lord shaftesbury procured the passage of bills securing the thorough supervision of these institutions by competent visiting committees and the seasonable dismissal of all who were pronounced cured and the adoption for the pauper insane of a judicious course of remedial treatment  the third step was the passage of the ten hour factory bill this took nearly eighteen years of labor and unceasing activity in parliament and in the provinces its operation affects full half a million of actual workers and if the families be included nearly two millions of persons young and old two thirds as many as the southern slaves  it is needless to enlarge on the horrible disclosures in reference to the factory operatives made during this investigation england never shuddered with a deeper thrill at the unveiling of american slavery than did all america at this unveiling of the whitelabor slavery of england in reading the speeches of lord shaftesbury one sees that in presenting this subject he had to encounter the same opposition and obloquy which now beset those in america who seek the abolition of slavery  in the beginning of one of his speeches his lordship says nearly eleven years have now elapsed since i first made the proposition to the house which i shall renew this night never at any time have i felt greater apprehension or even anxiety not through any fear of personal defeat for disappointment is the badge of our tribe but because i know well the hostility that i have aroused and the certain issues of indiscretion on my part affecting the welfare of those who have so long confided their hopes and interests to my charge one may justly wonder on what conceivable grounds any could possibly oppose the advocate of a measure like this he was opposed on the same ground that clarkson was resisted in seeking the abolition of the slave trade as boswell said that to abolish the slave trade would be to shut the gates of mercy on mankind so the advocates of eighteen hours labor in factories said that the ten hour system would diminish produce lower wages and bring starvation on the workmen his lordship was denounced as an incendiary a meddling fanatic interfering with the rights of masters and desiring to exalt his own order by destroying the prosperity of the manufacturers  in the conclusion of one of his speeches he says sir it may not be given me to pass over this jordan other and better men have preceded me and i entered into their labors other and better men will follow me and enter into mine but this consolation i shall ever continue to enjoythat amidst much injustice and somewhat of calumny we have at last lighted such a candle in england as by gods blessing shall never be put out  the next effort was to regulate the labor of children in the calico and print works the great unhealthiness of the work and the tender age of the children employedsome even as young as four yearswere fully disclosed an extract from his lordships remarks on this subject will show that human nature takes the same course in all countries sir in the various discussions on these kindred subjects there has been a perpetual endeavor to drive us from the point under debate and taunt us with a narrow and onesided humanity i was told there were far greater evils than those i had assailedthat i had left untouched much worse things it was in vain to reply that no one could grapple with the whole at once my opponents on the ten hour bill sent me to the collieries when i invaded the collieries i was referred to the print works from the print works i know not to what i shall be sent for what can be worse sir it has been said to me more than once where will you stop i reply nowhere so long as any portion of this mighty evil remains to be removed i confess that my desire and ambition are to bring all the laboring children of this empire within the reach and opportunities of education within the sphere of useful and happy citizens i am ready so far as my services are of any value to devote what little i have of energy and all the remainder of my life to the accomplishment of this end the labor would be great and the anxieties very heavy but i fear neither one nor the other i fear nothing but defeat  from the allusion above to the colliery effort it would seem that the act for removing women and children from the coalpits preceded the reform of the printworks concerning the result of these various enterprises he says the present state of things may be told in few words full fifty thousand children under thirteen years of age attend school every day none are worked more than seven generally only six hours in the day those above thirteen and under eighteen and all women are limited to ten hours and a half exclusive of the time for meals the work begins at six in the morning and ends at six in the evening saturdays labor ends at four oclock and there is no work on sunday the printworks are brought under regulation and the women and children removed from the coalpits his lordship adds the report of inspectors which i send you will give you a faint picture of the physical social and moral good that has resulted i may safely say of these measures that god has blessed them far beyond my expectation and almost equal to my hearts desire  the next great benevolent movement is the ragged school system from a miserable hole in field lane they have grown up to a hundred and sixteen in number of these lord shaftesbury says they have producedi speak seriouslysome of the most beautiful fruits that ever grew upon the tree of life i believe that from the teachers and from the children though many are now gone to their rest might have been and might still be selected some of the most pure simple affectionate specimens of christianity the world ever saw growing out of the ragged school is an institution of most interesting character called a place for repentance it had its origin in the efforts of a young man a mr nash to reform two of his pupils they said they wished to be honest but had nothing to eat and must steal to live though poor himself he invited them to his humble abode and shared with them his living other pupils hearing of this desired to join with them and become honest too soon he had six now the honest scholars in the ragged school seeing what was going on of their own accord began to share their bread with this little band and to contribute their pennies gradually the number increased benevolent individuals noticed it and supplies flowed in until at last it has grown to be an establishment in which several hundreds are seeking reformation to prevent imposition a rigid probation is prescribed fourteen days the applicant feeds on bread and water in solitary confinement with the door unfastened so that he can depart at any moment if he goes through with that ordeal it is thought he really wants to be honest and he is admitted a member after sufficient time spent in the institution to form correct habits assistance is given him to emigrate to some of the colonies to commence life as it were anew lord shaftesbury has taken a deep interest in this establishment and among other affecting letters received from its colonists in australia is one to him commencing kind lord ashley in which the boy says i wish your lordship would send out more boys and use your influence to convert all the prisons into ragged schools as soon as i get a farm i shall call it after your name  a little anecdote related by mr nash shows the grateful feelings of the inmates of this institution a number of them were very desirous to have a print of lord shaftesbury to hang up in their sitting room mr nash told them he knew of no way in which they could earn the money except by giving up something from their daily allowance of food this they cheerfully agreed to do a benevolent gentleman offered to purchase the picture and present it to them but they unanimously declined they wanted it to be their own they said and they could not feel that it was so unless they did something for it themselves  connected with the ragged school also is a movement for establishing what are called ragged churchesa system of simple gratuitous religious instruction which goes out to seek those who feel too poor and degraded to be willing to enter the churches  another of the great movements in england is the institution of the laborers friend society under the patronage of the most distinguished personages its principal object has been the promotion of allotments of land in the country to be cultivated by the peasantry after their days labor thus adding to their days wages the produce of their fields and gardens it has been instrumental first and last of establishing nearly four hundred thousand of these allotments it publishes also a monthly paper called the laborers friend in which all subjects relative to the elevation of the working classes receive a full discussion  in consequence of all these movements the dwellings of the laboring classes throughout great britain are receiving much attention so that if matters progress for a few years as they have done the cottages of the working people will be excelled by none in the world  another great movement is the repeal of the corn laws the benefit of which is too obvious to need comment  what has been doing for milliners and dressmakers for the reform lodging houses and for the supply of baths and wash houses i have shown at length in former letters i will add that the city of london has the services of one hundred and twenty city missionaries  there is a great multiplication of churches and of clergymen to labor in the more populous districts the pastoral aid society and the scripture reading society are both extensive and fruitful laborers for the service of the mass of the people  there has also been a public health act by which towns and villages are to be drained and supplied with water this has gone into operation in about one hundred and sixty populous places with the most beneficial results  in fine lord shaftesbury says the best proof that the people are cared for and that they know it appeared in the year 1848 all europe was convulsed kings were falling like rotten pears we were as quiet and happy in england as the president of the united states in his drawing room  it is true that all these efforts united could not radically relieve the distress of the working classes were it not for the outlet furnished by emigration but australia has opened as m new world of hope upon england and confirmatory of all other movements for the good of the working classes come the benevolent efforts of mrs chisholm and the colonizing society formed under her auspices  i will say finally that the aspect of the religious mind of england as i have been called to meet it is very encouraging in this respect that it is humble active and practical with all that has been done they do not count themselves to have attained or to be already perfect and they evidently think and speak more of the work that yet remains to be done than of victories already achieved could you my dear father have been with me through the different religious circles it has been my privilege to enter from the humble cotters fireside to the palace of the highest and noblest your heart would share with mine a sincere joy in the thought that the lord has much people in england called by different names churchman puseyite dissenter presbyterian independent quaker differing widely sincerely earnestly i have still found among them all evidence of that true piety which consists in a humble and childlike spirit of obedience to god and a sincere desire to do good to man it is comforting and encouraging to know that while there are many sects and opinions there is after all but one christianity i sometimes think that it has been my peculiar lot to see the exhibition of more piety and loveliness of spirit in the differing sects and ranks in england than they can see in each other and it lays in my mind a deep foundation of hope for that noble country my belief is that a regenerating process is going on in england a gradual advance in religion of which contending parties themselves are not aware under various forms all are energizing together i trust under the guidance of a superior spirit who is gently moderating acerbities removing prejudices inclining to conciliation and harmony and preparing england to develop from many outward forms the one pure beautiful invisible church of christ     letter xxx  london june 3  my dear husband  according to request i will endeavor to keep you informed of all our goings on after you left up to the time of our departure for paris  we have borne in mind your advice to hasten away to the continent c wrote a day or two since to mrs c at paris to secure very private lodgings and by no means let any one know that we were coming she has replied urging us to come to her house and promising entire seclusion and rest so since you departed we have been passing with a kind of comprehensive skip and jump over remaining engagements and first the evening after you left came off the presentation of the inkstand by the ladies of surrey chapel  our kind mr sherman showed great taste as well as energy in the arrangements the lecture room of the chapel was prettily adorned with flowers lord shaftesbury was in the chair and the duchess of argyle and the marquis of stafford were there miss greenfield sang some songs and there were speeches in which each speaker said all the obliging things he could think of to the rest rev mr binney complimented the nobility and lord shaftesbury complimented the people and all were but too kind in what they said to mein fact there was general good humor in the whole scene  the inkstand is a beautiful specimen of silverwork it is eighteen inches long with a group of silver figures on it representing religion with the bible in her hand giving liberty to the slave the slave is a masterly piece of work he stands with his hands clasped looking up to heaven while a white man is knocking the shackles from his feet but the prettiest part of the scene was the presentation of a gold pen by a band of beautiful children one of whom made a very pretty speech i called the little things to come and stand around me and talked with them a few minutes and this was all the speaking that fell to my share now this really was too kind of these ladies and of our brotherly friend mr s and i was quite touched with it especially as i have been able myself to do so very little socially for any bodys pleasure mr sherman still has continued to be as thoughtful and careful as a brother could be and his daughter mrs b i fear has robbed her own family to give us the additional pleasure of her society we rode out with her one day into the country and saw her home and little family saturday morning we breakfasted at stafford house i wish you could have been there all was as cool and quiet and still there as in some retreat deep in the country we went first into the duchesss boudoiryou rememberwhere is that beautiful crayon sketch of lady constance the duchess was dressed in pale blue we talked with her some time before any one came in about miss greenfield i showed her a simple note to her grace in which miss g tried to express her gratitude and which she had sent to me to correct for her the duchess said 0 give it me it is a great deal better as it is i like it just as she wrote it  people always like simplicity and truth better than finish after entering the breakfast room the duke and duchess of argyle and lord carlisle appeared and soon after lord shaftesbury we breakfasted in that beautiful green room which has the two statues the eve of thorwaldsen and the venus of canova the view of the gardens and trees from the window gave one a sense of seclusion and security and made me forget that we were in great crowded london a pleasant talk we had among other things they proposed various inquiries respecting affairs in america particularly as to the difference between presbyterians and congregationalists the influence of the assemblys catechism and the peculiarities of the other religious denominations  the duke of argyle who is a presbyterian seemed to feel an interest in those points he said it indicated great power in the assemblys catechism that it could hold such ascendency in such a free country  in the course of the conversation it was asked if there was really danger that the antislavery spirit of england would excite ill feeling between the two countries  i said were it possible that america were always to tolerate and defend slavery this might be but this would be selfdestruction it cannot must not will not be we shall struggle and shall overcome and when the victory has been gained we shall love england all the more for her noble stand in the conflict as i said this i happened to turn to the duchess and her beautiful face was lighted with such a strong inspired noble expression as set its seal at once in my heart  lord carlisle is going to constantinople tomorrow or next day to be gone perhaps a year the eastern question is much talked of now and the chances of war between russia and turkey  lord shaftesbury is now allengaged upon the fête of the seven thousand charity children which is to come off at st pauls next thursday  the duchesses of sutherland and argyle were to have attended but the queen has just come to town and the first drawing room will be held on thursday so that they will be unable his lordship had previously invited me and this morning renewed the invitation our time to leave london is fixed for friday but as i am told there is no sight more peculiar and beautiful than this fête and i think i can manage both to go there and be forward with my preparations  in the afternoon of this day i went with lord shaftesbury over the model lodging houses which i have described very particularly in a letter to mr c l b  on thursday at five p m we drove to stafford house to go with her grace to the house of parliament what a magnificent building i say so in contempt of all criticism i hear that all sorts of things are said against it for my part i consider that no place is so utterly hopeless as that of a modern architect intrusted with a great public building it is not his fault that he is modern but his misfortune things which in old buildings are sanctioned by time he may not attempt and if he strikes out new things that is still worse he is fair game for every bodys criticism he builds too high for one too low for another is too ornate for this too plain for that he sacrifices utility to aesthetics or aesthetics to utility and somebody is displeased either way the duchess has been a sympathizing friend of the architect through this arduous ordeal she took pleasure and pride in his work and showed it to me as something in which she felt an almost personal interest  for my part i freely confess that viewed as a national monument it seems to me a grand one what a splendid historic corridor is old westminster hall with its ancient oaken roof i seemed to see all that brilliant scene when burke spoke there amid the nobility wealth and fashion of all england in the warren hastings trial that speech always makes me shudder i think there never was any thing more powerful than its conclusion then the corridor that is to be lined with statues of the great men of england will be a noble affair the statue of hampden is grand will they leave out cromwell there is less need of a monument to him it is true than to most of them we went into the house of lords the earl of carlisle made a speech on the cuban question in the course of which he alluded very gracefully to a petition from certain ladies that england should enforce the treaties for the prevention of the slave trade there and spoke very feelingly on the reasons why woman should manifest a particular interest for the oppressed the duke of argyle and the bishop of oxford came over to the place where we were sitting her grace intimated to the bishop a desire to hear from him on the question and in the course of a few moments after returning to his place he arose and spoke he has a fine voice and speaks very elegantly  at last i saw lord aberdeen he looks like some of our presbyterian elders a plain grave old man with a bald head and dressed in black by the by i believe i have heard that he is an elder in the national kirk i am told he is a very good man you dont know how strangely and dreamily this house of lords as seen today mixed itself up with my historic recollections of bygone days it had a very sheltered comfortable parlorlike air the lords in their cushioned seats seemed like men that had met in a social way to talk over public affairs it was not at all that roomy vast declamatory national hall i had imagined  then we went into the house of commons there is a kind of latticed gallery to which ladies are admitteda charming little oriental rookery there we found the duchess of argyle and others lord carlisle afterwards joined us and we went all over the house examining the frescoes looking into closets tea rooms libraries smoking rooms committee rooms and all till i was thoroughly initiated the terrace that skirts the thames is magnificent i inquired if any but members might enjoy it no it was only for statesmen our short promenade there was therefore an act of grace  on the whole when this parliament house shall have gathered the dust of two hundred yearswhen victorias reign is among the mythsfuture generations will then venerate this building as one of the rare creations of old masters and declare that no modern structure can ever equal it  the next day at three oclock i went to miss greenfields first public morning concert a bill of which i send you she comes out under the patronage of all the great names you observe lady hatherton was there and the duchess of sutherland with all her daughters  miss greenfield did very well and was heard with indulgence though surrounded by artists who had enjoyed what she had nota lifes training i could not but think what a loss to art is the enslaving of a race which might produce so much musical talent had she had culture equal to her voice and ear no singer of any country could have surpassed her there could even be associations of poetry thrown around the dusky hue of her brow were it associated with the triumphs of art  after concert the duchess of s invited lady h and myself to stafford house we took tea in the green library lady c campbell was there and her grace of argyle after tea i saw the duchess of s a little while alone in her boudoir and took my leave then and there of one as good and truehearted as beautiful and noble  the next day i lunched with mrs malcolm daughterinlaw of your favorite traveller sir john malcolm of persian memory you should have been there the house is a cabinet of persian curiosities there was the original of the picture of the king of persia in ker porters travels it was given to sir john by the monarch himself there were also two daggers which the king presented with his own hand i think sir john must somehow have mesmerized him then captain m showed me sketches of his fathers country house in the himalaya mountains think of that the alps are commonplace but a country seat in the himalaya mountains is something worth speaking of there were two bricks from babylon and other curiosities innumerable  mrs m went with me to call on lady carlisle she spoke much of the beauty and worth of her character and said that though educated in the gayest circles of court she had always preserved the same unworldly purity mrs m has visited dunrobin and seen the sutherland estates and spoke much of the dukes character as a landlord and his efforts for the improvement of his tenantry  lady carlisle was very affectionate and invited me to visit castle howard on my return to england  thursday i went with lord shaftesbury to see the charity children what a sight the whole central part of the cathedral was converted into an amphitheatre and the children with white caps white handkerchiefs and white aprons looked like a wide flower bed the rustling when they all rose up to prayer was like the rise of a flock of doves and when they chanted the church service it was the warble of a thousand little brooks as spenser says    the angelical soft trembling voices made    unto the instruments respondence meet  during the course of the services when any little one was overcome with sleep or fatigue he was carefully handed down and conveyed in a mans arms to a refreshment room  there was a sermon by the bishop of chester very evangelical and practical on the whole a more peculiar or more lovely scene i never saw the elegant arches of st pauls could have no more beautiful adornment than those immortal flowers  after service we lunched with a large party with mrs milman at the deanery near by mrs jameson was there and mrs gaskell authoress of mary barton and ruth she has a very lovely gentle face and looks capable of all the pathos that her writings show i promised her a visit when i go to manchester thackeray was there with his fine figure and frank cheerful bearing he spoke in a noble and brotherly way of america and seemed to have highly enjoyed his visit in our country  after this we made a farewell call at the lord mayors we found the lady mayoress returned from the queens drawing room from her accounts i should judge the ceremonial rather fatiguing mrs m asked me yesterday if i had any curiosity to see one i confessed i had not merely to see public people in public places in the way of parade and ceremony was never interesting to me i have seen very little of ceremony or show in england well now i have brought you down to this time i have omitted however that i went with lady hatherton to call on mr and mrs dickens and was sorry to find him too unwell to be able to see us mrs dickens who was busy in attending him also excused herself and we saw his sister  tomorrow we gogo to quiet to obscurity to peace to paristo switzerland there we shall find the loneliest glen and as the bible says fall on sleep for our adventures on the way meanwhile i refer you to cs journal     journal  london to paris  june 4 1853 bade adieu with regret to dear surrey parsonage and drove to the great southwestern station house  paris said an official at our cab door paris by folkestone and boulogne was our answer and in a few moments without any inconvenience we were off reached folkestone at nine and enjoyed a smooth passage across the dreaded channel the stewards bowls were paraded in vain at boulogne came the longfeared and abhorred ordeal of passports and police it was nothing we slipped through quite easily a narrow ladder the quay gensdarmes a hall a crowd three whiskers a glance at the passport the unbuckling of a bundle voila tout the moment we issued forth however upon the quay again there was a discharge of forty voices shouting in french for a moment completely stunned i forgot where we were which way going and what we wanted up jumped a lively little gamin  monsieur veut aller à pans nest ce pas going to paris are you not sir  oui  is monsieurs baggage registered  yes  does monsieurs wish to go to the station house  can one find any thing there to eat  yes just as at a hotel  we yielded at discretion and garçon took possession of us  english said garçon as we enjoyed the pleasant walk on the sunny quay  no american we replied  ah his face brightening up and speaking confidentially you have a republic there  we gave the lad a franc dined and were off for paris the ride was delightful cars seating eight clean softcushioned nice the face of the country though not striking was pleasing there were many poplars with their silvery shafts and a mingling of trees of various kinds the foliage has an airy gracea certain spirituelle expressionas if the trees knew they were growing in la belle france and must be refined then the air is so different from the fog and smoke of london there is more oxygen in the atmosphere a pall is lifted we are led out into sunshine fields are red with a scarlet whiteedged poppy or blue with a flower like larkspur wheat fields half covered with this unthrifty beauty but alas the elasticity is in natures works only the works of man breathe over us a dismal sepulchral standstill feeling the villages have the nightmare and men wear wooden shoes the days ride however was memorable with novelty and when we saw mont martre and its mothlike windmills telling us we were coming to paris it was almost with regret at the swiftness of the hours we left the cars and flowed with the tide into the salle dattente to wait till the baggage was sorted then came the famous ceremony of unlocking the officer took my carpet bag first and poked his hand down deep in one end  what is this  that is my collar box  ah ça and he put it back hastily and felt of my travelling gown what is this  only a wrapping gown  ah ça after fumbling a little more he took sister hs bag gave a dive here a poke there and a kind of promiscuous rake with his five fingers and turned to the trunk there he seemed somewhat dubious eying the fine silk and lace dressesfirst one then the otherah ah said he and snuffed a little then he peeped under this corner and cocked his eye under that corner then all at once plunged his arm down at one end of the trunk and brought up a little square box whats that said he he unrolled and was about to open it when suddenly he seemed to be seized with an emotion of confidence non non said he frankly and rolled it up shoved it back stuffed the things down smoothed all over signed my ticket and passed on we locked up gave the baggage to porters and called a fiacre as we left the station two ladies met us  is there any one here expecting to see mrs c said one of them  yes madam said i we do  god bless you said she fervently and seized me by the hand it was mrs c and her sister i gave he into their possession  our troubles were over we were at home we rode through streets whose names were familiar crossed the carrousel passed the seine and stopped before an ancient mansion in the hue de verneuil belonging to m le marquis de brige this faubourg st germain is the part of paris where the ancient nobility lived and the houses exhibit marks of former splendor the marquis is one of those chivalrous legitimists who uphold the claims of henri vi he lives in the country and rents this hotel mrs c occupies the suite of rooms on the lower floor we entered by a ponderous old gateway opened by the concierge passed through a large paved quadrangle traversed a short hall and found ourselves in a large cheerful parlor looking out into a small flower garden there was no carpet but what is called here a parquet floor or mosaic of oak blocks waxed and highly polished the sofas and chairs were covered with a light chintz and the whole air of the apartment shady and cool as a grotto a jardinière filled with flowers stood in the centre of the room and around it a group of living flowersmother sisters and daughtersscarcely less beautiful in five minutes we were at home french life is different from any other elsewhere you do as the world pleases here you do as you please yourself my spirits always rise when i get among the french  sabbath june 5 headache all the forenoon in the afternoon we walked to the madeleine and heard a sermon on charity listened to the chanting and gazed at the fantastic ceremonial of the altar i had anticipated so much from henrys description of the organs that i was disappointed the music was fine but our ideal had outstripped the real the strangest part of the performance was the censer swinging at the altar it was done in certain parts of the chant with rhythmic sweep and glitter and vapor wreath that produced a striking effect there was an immense audiencequiet orderly and to all appearance devout this was the first romish service i ever attended it ought to be impressive here if any where yet i cannot say i was moved by it romeward indeed i felt a kind of puritan tremor of conscience at witnessing such a theatrical pageant on the sabbath we soon saw however as we walked home across the gardens of the tuileries that there is no sabbath in paris according to our ideas of the day  monday june 6 this day was consecrated to knickknacks accompanied by mrs c whom years of residence have converted into a perfect parisienne we visited shop after shop and store after store the politeness of the shopkeepers is inexhaustible i felt quite ashamed to spend a half hour looking at every thing and then depart without buying but the civil frenchman bowed and smiled and thanked us for coming  in the evening we rode to larc de triomphe detoile an immense pile of massive masonry from the top of which we enjoyed a brilliant panorama paris was beneath us from the louvre to the bois de boulogne with its gardens and moving myriads its sports and games and lighthearted mirtha vast vanity fair blazing in the sunlight a deep and strangelyblended impression of sadness and gayety sunk into our hearts as we gazed all is vivacity gracefulness and sparkle to the eye but ah what fires are smouldering below are not all these vines rooted in the lava and ashes of the volcano side  tuesday june 7 a la louvre but first the ladies must shop a little i sit by the counter and watch the pretty parisian shopocracy a lady presides at the desk trim little grisettes serve the customers so deftly that we wonder why awkward men should ever attempt to do such things nay they are so civil so evidently disinterested and solicitous for your welfare that to buy is the most natural thing imaginable  but to the louvre provided with catalogues i abandoned the ladies and strolled along to take a kind of creamskimming look at the whole i was highly elated with one thing there were three madonnas with dark hair and eyes one by murillo another by carracci and another by guido it showed that painters were not so utterly hopeless as a class and given over by common sense to blindness of mind as i had supposed  h begins to recant her heresy in regard to rubens here we find his largest pieces here we find the real originals of several real originals we saw in english galleries it seems as though only upon a picture as large as the side of a parlor could his exuberant genius find scope fully to lay itself out  when i met ii at lastafter finishing the surveyher cheek was flushed and her eye seemed to swim well h said i have you drank deep enough this time  yes said she i have been satisfied for the first time  wednesday june 8 a day on foot in paris surrendered h to the care of our fair hostess attempted to hire a boat at one of the great bathing establishments for a pull on the seine why not on the seine as well as on the thames but the old triton demurred the tide marched too strongil marche trop fort onward then along the quays visiting the curious old book stalls picture stands and flower markets lean over the parapet and gaze upon this modern euphrates rushing between solid walls of masonry through the heart of another babylon the river is the only thing not old these waters are as turbid tumultuous unbridled as when forests covered all these banksfit symbol of peoples and nations in their mad career generation after generation institutions like hewn granite may wall them in and vast arches span their flow and hierarchies domineer over the tide but the scorning waters burst into life unchangeable and sweep impetuous through the heart of vanity fair and dash out again into the future the same grand ungovernable euphrates stream i do not wonder egypt adored her nile and rome her tiber surely the life artery of paris is this seine beneath my feet and there is no scene like this as i gaze upward and downward comprehending in a glance the immense panorama of art and architecturelife motion enterprise pleasure pomp and power beautiful paris what city in the world can compare with thee  and is it not chiefly because either by accident or by instinctive good taste her treasures of beauty and art are so disposed along the seine as to be visible at a glance to the best effect as the instinct of the true parisienne teaches her the mystery of setting off the graces of her person by the fascinations of dress so the instinct of the nation to set off the city by the fascinations of architecture and embellishment hence a chief superiority of paris to london the seine is straight and its banks are laid out in broad terraces on either side called quais lined with her stateliest palaces and gardens the thames forms an elbow and is enveloped in dense smoke and fog london lowers the seine sparkles london shuts down upon the thames and there is no point of view for the whole river panorama paris rises amphitheatrically on either side the seine and the eye from the pont dausterlitz seems to fly through the immense reach like an arrow casting its shadow on every thing of beauty or grandeur paris possesses  rapidly now i sped onward paying brief visits to the palais de justice the hotel de ville and spending a cool half hour in notre dame i love to sit in these majestic fanes abstracting them from the superstition which does but desecrate them and gaze upward to their lofty vaulted arches to drink in the impression of architectual sublimity which i can neither analyze nor express cathedrals do not seem to me to have been built they seem rather stupendous growths of nature like crystals or cliffs of basalt there is little ornament here that roof looks plain and bare yet i feel that the air is dense with sublimity onward i sped crossing a bridge by the hotel dieu and leaving the river plunged into narrow streets explored a quadrangular market surveyed the old church of st geneviève and the newnow the pantheon went onward to the jardin des plantes and explored its tropical bowers many things remind me today of new orleans and its levee its mississippi its cathedral and the luxuriant vegetation of the gulf in fact i seem to be walking in my sleep in a kind of glorified new orleans all the while yet i return to the gardens of the tuileries and the place vendome and in the shadow of napoleons column the illusion vanishes hundreds of battles look down upon me from their blazonry  in the evening i rested from the days fatigue by an hour in the garden of the palais royal i sat by one of the little tables and called for an ice there were hundreds of ladies and gentlemen eating ices drinking wine reading the papers smoking chatting scores of pretty children were frolicking and enjoying the balmy evening here six or eight midgets were jumping the rope while papa and mamma swung it for them pretty little things with their flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes how they did seem to enjoy themselves what parent was ever far from home that did not espy in every group of children his own little oneshis mary or his nelly his henry or charlie so it was with me there was a ring of twenty or thirty singing and dancing with a smaller ring in the centre while old folks and boys stood outside but i heard not a single oath nor saw a rough or rude action during the whole time i was there the boys standing by looked on quietly like young gentlemen the best finale of such a toilsome day of sightseeing was a warm bath in the rue du bac for the trifling sum of fifteen sous the cheapness and convenience of bathing here is a great recommendation of paris life they will bring you a hot bath at your house for twentyfive cents and that without bustle or disorder and nothing so effectually as an evening bath as my experience testifies cures fatigue and propitiates to dreamless slumber  thursday june 9 at the louvre studied three statues half an hour eachthe venus victrix polyhymnia and gladiateur combattant the first is mutilated but if disarmed she conquers all hearts what would she achieve in full panoply as to the gladiator i noted as follows on my catalogue a pugilist antique brown with age attitude leaning forward left hand raised on guard right hand thrown out back ready to strike a side blow right leg bent straight line from the head to the toe of left foot muscles and veins most vividly revealed in intense development a wonderful petrifaction as if he had been smitten to stone at the instant of striking  here are antique mosaics in which colored stones seem liquefied realizing the most beautiful effects of paintingquadrigae warriors arms armor vases streams all lifelike ascending to the hall of french paintings i spent an hour in studying one picturela méduse by géricault it is a shipwrecked crew upon a raft in mid ocean i gazed until all surrounding objects disappeared and i was alone upon the wide atlantic those transparent emerald waves are no fiction they leap madly hungering for their prey that distended sail is filled with the lurid air that dead mans foot hangs off in the seething brine a stark reality what a fixed gaze of despair in that fathers stony eye what a group of deathly living ones around that frail mast while one with intense eagerness flutters a signal to some fardescried bark coleridges ancient mariner has no colors more fearfully faithful to his theme heaven pities them not ocean is all in uproar against them and there is no voice that can summon the distant flying sail so france appeared to that prophet painters eye in the subsiding tempests of the revolution so mens hearts failed them for fear and the dead lay stark and stiff among the living amid the sea and the waves roaring and so mute signals of distress were hung out in the lurid sky to nations afar  for my part i remain a heretic give to these french pictures the mellowing effects of age impregnating not merely the picture but the eye that gazes on it with its subtle quality let them be gazed at through the haze of two hundred years and they willor i cannot see why they will notrival the productions of any past age i do not believe that a more powerful piece ever was painted than yon raft by gericault nor any more beautiful than several in the luxembourg the décadence de rome for example exhibiting the revels of the romans during the decline of the empire let this décadence unroll before the eyes of men the cause that wreck by géricault symbolize the effect in the great career of nations and the two are sublimely matched  after visiting the luxembourg i resorted to the gardens of the tuileries the thermometer was at about eighty degrees in the shade from the number of people assembled one would have thought if it had been in the united states that some great mass convention was coming off under the impenetrable screen of the trees in the dark cool refreshing shade are thousands of chairs for which one pays two cents apiece whole families come locking up their door bringing the baby work dinner or lunch take a certain number of chairs and spend the day as far as eye can reach you see a multitude seated as if in church with other multitudes moving to and fro while boys and girls without number are frolicking racing playing ball driving hoop c but contriving to do it without making a hideous racket how french children are taught to play and enjoy themselves without disturbing every body else is a mystery cest gentil seems to be a talismanic spell and ce nest pas gentil ça is sufficient to check every rising irregularity o that some savant would write a book and tell us how it is done i gazed for half an hour on the spectacle a more charming sight my eyes never beheld there were grayheaded old men and women and invalids and there were beautiful demoiselles working worsted embroidery sewing men reading papers and in fact people doing every thing they would do in their own parlors and all were graceful kind and obliging not a word nor an act of impoliteness or indecency no wonder the french adore paris thought i in no other city in the world is a scene like this possible no wonder that their hearts die within them at thoughts of exile in the fens of cayenne  but under all this there lie as under the cultivated crust of this fair world deep abysses of soul where volcanic masses of molten lava surge and shake the tremulous earth in the gay and bustling boulevards a friend an old resident of paris poised out to me as we rode the bullet marks that scarred the housessignificant tokens of what seems but is not forgotten  at sunset a military band of about seventy performers began playing in front of the tuileries they formed an immense circle the leader in the centre he played the octave flute which also served as a baton for marking time the music was characterized by delicacy precision suppression and subjugation of rebellious material  i imagined a congress of horns clarinets trumpets c conversing in low tones on some important theme nay rather a conspiracy of instruments mourning between whiles their subjugation and ever and anon breaking out in a fierce émeute then repressed hushed dying away as if they had heard of baron munchausens frozen horn and had conceived the idea of yielding their harmonies without touch of human lips yet were sighing and sobbing at their impotence perhaps i detected the pulses of a nations palpitating heart throbbing for liberty but trodden down and sobbing in despair  in the evening mrs c had her salon a fashion of receiving ones friends on a particular night that one wishes could be transplanted to american soil  no invitations are given it is simply understood that on such an evening the season through a lady receives her friends all come that please without ceremony a little table is set out with tea and a plate of cake behind it presides some fairy emma or elizabeth dispensing tea and talk bonbons and bonmots with equal grace the guests enter chat walk about spend as much time or as little as they choose and retire they come when they please and go when they please and there is no notice taken of entree or exit no time wasted in formal greetings and leave takings  up to this hour we had conversed little in french one is naturally diffident at first for if one musters courage to commence a conversation with propriety the problem is how to escape a scylla in the second and a charybdis in the third sentence said one of our fair entertainers when i first began i would think of some sentence till i could say it without stopping and courageously deliver myself to some guest or acquaintance but it was like pulling the string of a shower bath delighted at my correct sentence and supposing me au fait they poured upon me such a deluge of french that i held my breath in dismay considering however that nothing is to be gained by halfway measures i resolved upon a desperate game launching in i talked away right and left up hill and downjumping over genders cases nouns and adjectives floundering through swamps and morasses in a perfect steeple chase of words thanks to the proverbial politeness of my friends i came off covered with glory the more mistakes i made the more complacent they grew  nothing can surpass the ease facility and genial freedom of these soirées conceive of our excellent professor of arabic and sanscrit count m fairly cornered by three wicked fairies and laughing at their stories and swift witticisms till the tears roll down his cheeks behold yonder tall and scarred veteran an old soldier of napoleon capitulating now before the witchery of genius and wit here the noble russian exile forgets his sorrows in those smiles that unlike the aurora warm while they dazzle and our celebrated composer is discomposed easily by alert and nimblefooted mischief and our professor of greek and hebrew roots is rooted to the ground with astonishment at finding himself put through all the moods and tenses of fun in a twinkling ah culpable sirens if the pangs ye have inflicted were reckoned up unto youthe heart aches and side acheshow could ye repose o nights  saturday june 11 versailles when i have written that one word i have said all i ought to stop description is out of the question describe nine miles of painting describe visions of splendor and gorgeousness that cannot be examined in months suffice it to say that we walked from hall to hall until there was no more soul left within us then late in the afternoon we drove away about three miles to the villa of m belloc directeur de lecole imperials de dessein madame belloc has produced assisted by her friend mademoiselle montgolfier the best french translation of uncle toms cabin at this little family party we enjoyed ourselves exceedingly in the heart of genuine domestic life two beautiful married daughters were there with their husbands and the household seemed complete madame b speaks english well and thus with our limited french we got on delightfully together i soon discovered that i had been sinning against all law in admiring any thing at versailles they were all bad paintings there might be one or two good paintings at the luxembourg and one or two good modern paintings at the louvrethe méduse by géricault for example how i rejoiced that i had admired it but all the rest of the modern paintings m belloc declared with an inimitable shrug are poor paintings there is nothing safely admirable i find but the old masters all those battles of all famous french generals from charles hartel to napoleon and the battles in algiers by horace yernet are wholly to be snuffed at in painting as in theology age is the criterion of merit yet vernets paintings though decried by m le directeur i admired and told him so said i in french as lawless as the sentiment monsieur i do not know the rules of painting nor whether the picture is according to them or not i only know that i like it  but who shall describe the social charms of our dinner all wedged together as we were in the snuggest little pigeon hole of a dining room pretty little chattering children and all whom papa held upon his knee and fed with bonbons all the while impressing upon them the absolute necessity of their leaving the table there the salad was mixed by acclamation each member of the party adding a word of advice and each gayly laughing at the advice of the other there a gay red lobster was pulled in pieces among us with infinite gout and madame belloc pathetically expressed her fears that we did not like french cooking she might have saved herself the trouble for we take to it as naturally as ducks take to the water and then when we returned to the parlor we resolved ourselves into a committee of the whole on coffee which was concocted in a trim little hydrostatic engine of latest modern invention before the faces of all and so we right merrily spent the evening h discussed poetry and art with our kind hosts to her hearts content and at a late hour we drove to the railroad and returned to paris     letter xxxi  my dear l  at last i have come into dreamland into the lotuseaters paradise into the land where it is always afternoon i am released from care i am unknown unknowing i live in a house whose arrangements seem to me strange old and dreamy in the heart of a great city i am as still as if in a convent in the burning heats of summer our rooms are shadowy and cool as a cave my time is all my own i may at will lie on a sofa and dreamily watch the play of the leaves and flowers in the little garden into which my room opens or i may go into the parlor adjoining whence i hear the quick voices of my beautiful and vivacious young friends you ought to see these girls emma might look like a madonna were it not for her wicked wit and as to anna and lizzie as they glance by me now and then i seem to think them a kind of sprite or elf made to inhabit shady old houses just as twinkling harebells grow in old castles and then the gracious mamma who speaks french or english like a stream of silveris she not after all the fairest of any of them and there is caroline piquant racy full of conversationsharp as a quartz crystal how i like to hear her talk these people know paris as we say in america like a book they have studied it aesthetically historically socially they have studied french people and french literatureand studied it with enthusiasm as people ever should who would truly understand they are all kindness to me whenever i wish to see any thing i have only to speak or to know i have only to ask at breakfast every morning we compare notes and make up our list of wants my first of course was the louvre it is close by us think of it to one who has starved all a life in vain imaginings of what art might be to know that you are within a stones throw of a museum full of its miracles greek assyrian egyptian roman sculptors and modern painting all there  i scarcely consider myself to have seen any thing of art in england the calls of the living world were so various and exigeant i had so little leisure for reflection that although i saw many paintings i could not study them and many times i saw them in a state of the nervous system too jaded and depressed to receive the full force of the impression a day or two before i left i visited the national gallery and made a rapid survey of its contents there were two of turners masterpieces there which he presented on the significant condition that they should hang side by side with their two finest claudes i thought them all four fine pictures but i liked the turners best yet i did not think any of them fine enough to form an absolute limit to human improvement but till i had been in paris a day or two perfectly secluded at full liberty to think and rest i did not feel that my time for examining art had really come  it was then with a thrill almost of awe that i approached the louvre here perhaps said i to myself i shall answer fully the question that has long wrought within my soul what is art and what can it do here perhaps these yearnings for the ideal will meet their satisfaction the ascent to the picture gallery tends to produce a flutter of excitement and expectation magnificent staircases dim perspectives of frescoes and carvings the glorious hall of apollo rooms with mosaic pavements antique vases countless spoils of art dazzle the eye of the neophyte and prepare the mind for some grand enchantment then opens on one the grand hall of paintings arranged by schools the works of each artist by themselves a wilderness of gorgeous growths  i first walked through the whole offering my mind up aimlessly to see if there were any picture there great and glorious enough to seize and control my whole being and answer at once the cravings of the poetic and artistic element for any such i looked in vain i saw a thousand beauties as also a thousand enormities but nothing of that overwhelming subduing nature which i had conceived most of the men there had painted with dry eyes and cool hearts thinking only of the mixing of their colors and the jugglery of their art thinking little of heroism faith love or immortality yet when i had resigned this longing when i was sure i should not meet there what i sought then i began to enjoy very heartily what there was  in the first place i now saw claudes worthy of the reputation he bore three or four of these were studied with great delight the delight one feels who conscientiously bound to be delighted suddenly comes into a situation to be so i saw now those atmospheric traits those reproductions of the mysteries of air and of light which are called so wonderful and for which all admire claude but for which so few admire him who made claude and who every day creates around us in the commonest scenes effects far more beautiful how much even now my admiration of claude was genuine i cannot say how can we ever be sure on this point when we admire what has prestige and sanction not to admire which is an argument against ourselves certainly however i did feel great delight in some of these works  one of my favorites was rembrandt i always did admire the gorgeous and solemn mysteries of his coloring rembrandt is like hawthorne he chooses simple and everyday objects and so arranges light and shadow as to give them a sombre richness and a mysterious gloom the house of seven gables is a succession of rembrandt pictures done in words instead of oils now this pleases us because our life really is a haunted one the simplest thing in it is a mystery the invisible world always lies round us like a shadow and therefore this dreamy golden gleam of rembrandt meets somewhat in our inner consciousness to which it corresponds there were no pictures in the gallery which i looked upon so long and to which i returned so often and with such growing pleasure as these i found in them if not a commanding a drawing influence a full satisfaction for one part of my nature  there were raphaels there which still disappointed me because from raphael i asked and expected more i wished to feel his hand on my soul with a stronger grasp these were too passionless in their serenity and almost effeminate in their tenderness  but rubens the great joyous fullsouled allpowerful rubensthere he was full as ever of triumphant abounding life disgusting and pleasing making me laugh and making me angry defying me to dislike him dragging me at his chariot wheels in despite of my protests forcing me to confess that there was no other but he  this medici gallery is a succession of gorgeous allegoric paintings done at the instance of mary of medici to celebrate the praise and glory of that family i was predetermined not to like them for two reasons first that i dislike allegorical subjects and second that i hate and despise that medici family and all that belongs to them so no sympathy with the subjects blinded my eyes and drew me gradually from all else in the hall to contemplate these it was simply the love of power and of fertility that held me astonished which seemed to express with nonchalant ease what other painters attain by laborious efforts it occurred to me that other painters are famous for single heads or figures and that were the striking heads and figures with which these pictures abound to be parcelled out singly any one of them would make a mans reputation any animal of rubens alone would make a mans fortune in that department his fruits and flowers are unrivalled for richness and abundance his old mens leads are wonderful and when he chooses which he does not often he can even create a pretty woman generally speaking his women are his worst productions it would seem that he had revolted with such fury from the meagre pale cadaverous outlines of womankind painted by his predecessors the van eyks whose women resembled potato sprouts grown in a cellar that he altogether overdid the matter in the opposite direction his exuberant soul abhors leanness as nature abhors a vacuum and hence all his women seem bursting their bodices with fulness like overgrown carnations breaking out of their green calyxes he gives you venuses with arms fit to wield the hammer of vulcan vigorous graces whose dominion would be alarming were they indisposed to clemency his weakness in fact his besetting sin is too truly described by moses    but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked    thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick    thou art covered with fatness  scornfully he is determined upon it he will none of your scruples his women shall be fat as he pleases and you shall like him nevertheless  in this medici gallery the fault appears less prominent than elsewhere many of the faces are portraits and there are specimens among them of female beauty so delicate as to demonstrate that it was not from any want of ability to represent the softer graces that he so often becomes hard and coarse my friend m belloc made the remark that the genius of rubens was somewhat restrained in these pictures and chastened by the rigid rules of the french school and hence in them he is more generally pleasing  i should compare rubens to shakspeare for the wonderful variety and vital force of his artistic power i know no other mind he so nearly resembles like shakspeare he forces you to accept and to forgive a thousand excesses and uses his own faults as musicians use discords only to enhance the perfection of harmony there certainly is some use even in defects a faultless style sends you to sleep defects rouse and excite the sensibility to seek and appreciate excellences some of shakspeares finest passages explode all grammar and rhetoric like skyrocketsthe thought blows the language to shivers  as to murillo there are two splendid specimens of his style here as exquisite as any i have seen but i do not find reason to alter the judgment i made from my first survey  here is his celebrated picture of the assumption of the virgin which we have seen circulated in print shops in america but which appears of a widely different character in the painting the virgin is rising in a flood of amber light surrounded by clouds and indistinct angel figures she is looking upward with clasped hands as in an ecstasy the crescent moon is beneath her feet the whole tone of the picture the clouds the drapery her flowing hairare pervaded with this amber tint sublimated and spiritual do i then like it no does it affect me not at all why so because this is a subject requiring earnestness yet after all there is no earnestness of religious feeling expressed it is a surface picture exquisitely paintedthe feeling goes no deeper than the canvas but how do i know murillo has no earnestness in the religious idea of this piece how do i know when reading popes messiah that he was not in earnestthat he was only most exquisitely reproducing what others had thought does he not assume in the most graceful way the language of inspiration and holy rapture but through it all we feel the satisfied smirk of the artist and the fine sharp touch of his diamond file what is done from a genuine strong inward emotion whether in writing or painting always mesmerizes the paper or the canvas and gives it a power which every body must feel though few know why the reason why the bible has been omnipotent in all ages has been because there were the emotions of god in it and of paintings nothing is more remarkable than that some preserve in them such a degree of genuine vital force that one can never look on them with indifference while others in which every condition of art seems to be met inspire no strong emotion  yet this picture is immensely popular hundreds stand enchanted before it and declare it imbodies their highest ideal of art and religion and i suppose it does but so it always is the man who has exquisite gifts of expression passes for more popularly than the man with great and grand ideas who utters but imperfectly there are some pictures here by correggioa sleeping venus and cupida marriage of the infant jesus and st catharine this correggio is the poet of physical beauty light and shadow are his god what he lives for is to catch and reproduce fitting phases of these the moral is nothing to him and in his own world he does what he seeks he is a great popular favorite since few look for more in a picture than exquisite beauty understood between us that his sphere is to be earth and not heaven were he to attempt profanely to represent heavenly things i must rebel i should as soon want tom moore to write me a prayer book  a large saloon is devoted to the masters of the french school the works of no living artists are admitted there are some large paintings by david he is my utter aversion i see in him nothing but the driest imitation of the classics it would be too much praise to call it reproduction david had neither heart nor soul how could he be and artisthe who coolly took his portfolio to the guillotine to take lessons on the dying agonies of its victimshow could he ever paint any thing to touch the heart  in general all french artists appear to me to have been very much injured by a wrong use of classic antiquity nothing could be more glorious and beautiful than the grecian development nothing more unlike it that the stale wearisome repetitious imitations of it in modern times the greek productions themselves have a living power to this day but all imitations of them are cold and tiresome these old greeks made such beautiful things because they did not imitate that mysterious vitality which still imbues their remains and which seems to enchant even the fragments of their marbles is the mesmeric vitality of fresh original conception art built upon this is just like what the shadow of a beautiful woman is to the woman one gets tired in these galleries of the classic band and the classic headdress and the classic attitude and the endless repetition of the classic urn and vase and lamp as if nothing else were ever to be made in the world except these things  again in regard to this whole french gallery there is much of a certain quality which i find it very difficult to describe in any one worda dramatic smartness a searching for striking and peculiar effects which render the pictures very likely to please on first sight and to weary on longer acquaintance it seems to me to be the work of a race whose senses and perceptions of the outward have been cultivated more than the deep inward emotions few of the pictures seem to have been the result of strong and profound feeling of habits of earnest and concentrated thought there is an abundance of beautiful little phases of sentiment pointedly expressed there is a great deal of what one should call the picturesque of the morale but few of its foundation ideas i must except from these remarks the very strong and earnest painting of the méduse by géricault which c has described that seems to me to be the work of a man who had not seen human life and suffering merely on the outside but had felt in the very depths of his soul the surging and earthquake of those mysteries of passion and suffering which underlie our whole existence in this world to me it was a picture too mighty and too painfulwhose power i confessed but which i did not like to contemplate  on the whole french painting is to me an exponent of the great difficulty and danger of french life that passion for the outward and visible which all their education all the arrangements of their social life every thing in their art and literature tends continually to cultivate and increase hence they have become the leaders of the world in what i should call the minor artisticsall those little particulars which render life beautiful hence there are more pretty pictures and popular lithographs from france than from any other country in the world but it produces very little of the deepest and highest style of art  in this connection i may as well give you my luxembourg experience as it illustrates the same idea i like paul de la roche on the whole although i think he has something of the fault of which i speak he has very great dramatic power but it is more of the kind shown by walter scott than of the kind shown by shakspeare he can reproduce historical characters with great vividness and effect and with enough knowledge of humanity to make the verisimilitude admirably strong but as to the deep knowledge with which shakspeare searches the radical elements of the human soul he has it not his death of queen elizabeth is a strong walter scott picture so are his execution of strafford and his charles i which i saw in england  as to horace vernet i do not think he is like either scott or shakspeare in him this french capability for rendering the outward is wrought to the highest point and it is outwardness as pure from any touch of inspiration or sentiment as i ever remember to have seen he is graphic to the utmost extreme his horses and his men stand from the canvas to the astonishment of all beholders all is vivacity bustle dazzle and show i think him as perfect of his kind as possible though it is a kind of art with which i do not sympathize  the picture of the décadence de rome indicates to my mind a painter who has studied and understood the classical forms vitalizing them by the reproductive force of his own mind so as to give them the living power of new creations in this picture is a most grand and melancholy moral lesson the classical forms are evidently not introduced because they are classic but in subservience to the expression of the moral in the orgies of the sensualists here represented he gives all the grace and beauty of sensuality without its sensualizing effect nothing could be more exquisite than the introduction of the busts of the departed heroes of the old republic looking down from their pedestals on the scene of debauchery below it is a noble picture which i wish was hung up in the capitol of our nation to teach our haughty people that as pride and fulness of bread and laxness of principle brought down the old republics so also ours may fall although the outward in this painting and the classical is wrought to as fine a point as in any french picture it is so subordinate to the severity of the thought that while it pleases it does not distract  but to return to the louvre the halls devoted to paintings of which i have spoken give you very little idea of the treasures of the institution gallery after gallery is filled with greek roman assyrian and egyptian sculptures coins vases and antique remains of every description there is also an apartment in which i took a deep interest containing the original sketches of ancient masters here one may see the pen and ink drawings of claude divided into squares to prepare them for the copyist one compares here with interest the manners of the different artists in jotting down their ideas as they rose some by chalk some by crayon some by pencil some by water colors and some by a heterogeneous mixture of all mozarts scrap bag of musical jottings could not have been more amusing  on the whole cravings of mere ideality have come nearer to meeting satisfaction by some of these old mutilated remains of greek sculpture than any thing which i have met yet in the paintings even of the most celebrated masters there are often things which are excessively annoying to me i scarcely remember a master in whose works i have not found a hand or foot or face or feature so distorted or coloring at times so unnatural or something so out of place and proportion in the picture as very seriously to mar the pleasure that i derived from it in this statuary less is attempted and all is more harmonious and ones ideas of proportion are never violated  my favorite among all these remains is a mutilated statue which they call the venus de milon this is a statue which is so called from having been dug up some years ago piecemeal in the island of milos there was quite a struggle for her between a french naval officer the english and the turks the french officer carried her off like another helen and she was given to paris old louis philippe being bridegroom by proxy savans refer the statue to the time of phidias and as this is a pleasant idea to me i go a little further and ascribe her to phidias himself  the statue is much mutilated both arms being gone and part of the foot but there is a majesty and grace in the head and face a union of loveliness with intellectual and moral strength beyond any thing which i have ever seen to me she might represent miltons glorious picture of unfallen perfect womanhood in his eve    yet when i approach    her loveliness so absolute she seems    and in herself complete so well to know    her own that what she wills to do or say    seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best    all higher knowledge in her presence falls    degraded wisdom in discourse with her    loses discountenanced and like folly shows    authority and reason on her wait    as one intended first not after made    occasionally and to consummate all    greatness of mind and nobleness their seat    build in her loveliest and create an awe    about her like a guard angelic placed  compared with this matchless venus that of medici seems as inane and trifling as mere physical beauty always must by the side of beauty baptized and made sacramental as the symbol of that which alone is truly fair  with regard to the arrangements of the louvre they seem to me to be admirable no nation has so perfectly the qualifications to care for keep and to show to best advantage a gallery of art as the french  during the heat of the outburst that expelled louis philippe from the throne the louvre was in some danger of destruction destructiveness is a native element of human nature however repressed by society and hence every great revolutionary movement always brings to the surface some who are for indiscriminate demolition moreover there is a strong tendency in the popular mind where art and beauty have for many years been monopolized as the prerogative of a haughty aristocracy to identify art and beauty with oppression this showed itself in england and scotland in the general storm which wrecked the priceless beauty of the ecclesiastical buildings it was displaying itself in the same manner in germany during the time of the reformation and had not luther been gifted with a nature as strongly aesthetic as progressive would have wrought equal ruin there so in the first burst of popular enthusiasm that expelled the monarchy the cry was raised by some among the people we shall never get rid of kings till we pull down the palaces just the echo of the old cry in scotland pull down the nests and the rooks will fly away the populace rushed in to the splendid halls and saloons of the louvre and a general encampment was made among the pictures in this crisis a republican artist named jeanron saved the louvre saved the people the regret that must have come over them had they perpetrated barbarisms and liberty the shame of having such outrages wrought in her name appointed by the provisional government to the oversight of the louvre and well known among the people as a republican he boldly came to the rescue am i not one of you he said am i not one of the people these splendid works of art are they not ours are they not the pride and glory of our country shall we destroy our most glorious possession in the first hour of its passing into our hands  moved by his eloquence the people decamped from the building and left it in his hands empowered to make all such arrangements for its renovation and embellishment as his artistic taste should desire he conducted important repairs in the building rearranged the halls had the pictures carefully examined cleaned when necessary and distributed in schools with scientific accuracy he had an apartment prepared where are displayed those first sketches by distinguished masters which form one of the most instructive departments of the louvre to a student of art the government seconded all his measures by liberal supplies of money and the louvre is placed in its present perfect condition by the thoughtful and cherishing hand of the republic  these facts have been communicated to me from a perfectly reliable source as an american and a republican i cannot but take pleasure in them i mention them because it is often supposed from the destructive effects which attend the first advent of democratic principles where they have to explode their way into existence through masses of ancient rubbish that popular liberty is unfavorable to art it never could be so in france because the whole body of the people are more thoroughly artistic in their tastes and feelings than in most countries they are almost slaves to the outwardly beautiful taken captive by the eye and the ear and only the long association of beauty with tyranny with suffering want and degradation to themselves could ever have inspired any of them with even a momentary bitterness against it     journalcontinued  monday june 13 went this morning with h and mrs c to the studio of m belloc found a general assembly of heads arms legs and every species of nude and other humanity pertaining to a studio also an agreeable jumble of old pictures and new picture frames canvas brushes boxes unfinished sketches easels palettes a sofa some cushions a chair or two bottles papers a stove rusty and fireless and all things most charmingly innocent of any profane clarin up times whatsoever  the first question which m belloc proposed with a genuine french air was the question of pose or position it was concluded that as other pictures had taken h looking at the spectator this should take her looking away m belloc remarked that m charpentier said h appeared always with the air of an observerwas always looking around on every thing hence m belloc would take her en observatrice mais pas en curieusewith the air of observation but not of curiosity  at it he went i stood behind and enjoyed rapid creative sketching in chalk and charcoal then a chaos of colors and clouds put on now with brushes now with fingers god began with chaos said he quoting prudhon we cannot expect to do better than god  with intensest enjoyment i watched the chaotic clouds forming on the canvas round a certain nucleus gradually resolving themselves into shape and lightening up with tints and touches until a head seemed slowly emerging from amidst the shadows  meanwhile an animated conversation was proceeding m belloc in his rich glorious french rolling out like music from an organ discussed the problems of his art while we ever and anon excited him by our speculations our theories our heresies h talked in english and mrs c translated and i put in a french phrase sidewise every now and then  by and by m charpentier came in who is more voluble more ore rotundo grandiose than m belloc he began panegyrizing uncle tom and this led to a discussion of the ground of its unprecedented success in his thirtyfive years experience as a bookseller he had known nothing like it it surpassed all modern writers at first he would not read it his taste was for old masters of a century or two ago like m belloc in painting said i at length he found his friend m alfred de musée the first intelligence of the age reading it  what you too said he  ah ah said de musée say nothing about this book there is nothing like it this leaves us all behindall all miles behind  m belloc said the reason was because there was in it more genuine faith than in any book and we branched off into florid eloquence touching paganism christianity and art  christianity m belloc said has ennobled man but not made him happier the christian is not so happy as the old greek the old greek mythology is full of images of joy of lightness and vivacity nymphs and fauns dryads and hamadryads and all sportive creations the arts that grow up out of christianity are all tinged with sorrow  this is true in part replied h because the more you enlarge a persons general capacity of feeling and his quantity of being the more you enlarge his capacity of suffering a man can suffer more than an oyster christianity by enlarging the scope of mans heart and dignifying his nature has deepened his sorrow  m belloc referred to the paintings of eustache le soeur in the louvre in illustration of his ideaa series based on the experience of st bruno and representing the effects of maceration and ghostly penance with revolting horrors  this h replied is not my idea of christianity religion is not asceticism but a principle of love to god that beautifies and exalts common life and fills it with joy  m belloc ended with a splendid panegyric upon the ancient greeks the eloquence of which i will not mar by attempting to repeat  ever and anon h was amused at the pathetic air at once genuinely french and thoroughly sincere with which the master assured her that he was désolé to put her to so much trouble  as to christianity not making men happier methinks m belloc forgets that the old greek tragedies are filled with despair and gloom as their prevailing characteristic and that nearly all the music of the world before christ was in the minor scale as since christ it has come to be in the major the whole creation has indeed groaned and travailed in pain together until now but the mighty anthem has modulated since the cross and the requiem of jesus has been the worlds birthsong of approaching jubilee  music is a far better test moreover on such a point than painting for just where painting is weakest namely in the expression of the highest moral and spiritual ideas there music is most sublimely strong  altogether this morning in the painters studio was one of the most agreeable we ever spent but what shall i say then of the evening in a salon musicale with the first violoncello playing in the world and the princess czartoryski at the piano we were invited at eight but it was nine before we entered our carriage we arrived at the hotel of mrs erskine a sister of lord dundalk and found a very select party there were chairs and sofas enough for all without crowding  there was frankomm of the conservatoire with his stradivarius an instrument one hundred and fifty years old which cost six thousand dollars there was his son a little lad of twelve who played almost as well as his father i wish f and m could have seen this he was but a year older than f and yet played with the most astonishing perfection among other things the little fellow performed a morceau of his own composition which was full of pathos and gave tokens of uncommon ability his father gave us sonatas of mozart chopin c and a polonaise the princess czartoryski accompanied on the piano with extraordinary ability  that was an evening to be remembered a lifetime one heard probably the best music in the world of its kind performed under prepared circumstances the most perfectly adapted to give effect there was no whispering no noise all felt and heard and enjoyed i conversed with the princess and with frankomm the former speaks english the latter none i interpreted for h and she had quite a little conversation with him about his son and about music she told him she hoped the day was coming when art would be consecrated to express the best and purest emotions of humanity he had read uncle tom and when he read it he exclaimed this is genuine christianityceci est la vraie christianisme  the attentions shown to h were very touching and agreeable there is nothing said or done that wearies or oppresses her she is made to feel perfectly free at large at ease and the regard felt for her is manifested in a way so delicate so imperceptibly fine and considerate that she is rather strengthened by it than exhausted this is owing no doubt to the fact that we came determined to be as private as possible and with an explicit understanding with mrs c to that effect instead of trying to defeat her purpose and force her into publicity the few who know of her presence seem to try to help her carry it out and see how much they can do for her consistently therewith  tuesday june 14 today we dined at six p m and read till nine then drove to an evening salonquite an early little party at mrs putnams saw there peter parley and la rochejaquelin the only one of the old nobility that joined louis napoleon peter parley is consul no longer it seems we discussed the empire a very little to be or not to be that is the question opinions are various as the circles every circle draws into itself items of information that tend to indicate what it wishes to be about to happen still peter parley and i and some other equally cautious people think that this cannot always last by this of course we mean this thingthis empire so called sooner or later it must end in revolution and then what said a gentleman the other day nothing holds him up but fear of the red footnote that is fear of the red republicans  after chatting a while weston and i slipped out and drove to the jardin mabille a garden in the champs elysées whither thousands go every night we entered by an avenue of poplars and other trees and shrubs so illuminated by jets of gas sprinkled amongst the foliage as to give it the effect of enchantment it was neither moonlight nor daylight but a kind of spectral aurora that made every thing seem unearthly  as we entered the garden we found flower beds laid out in circles squares lozenges and every conceivable form with diminutive jets of gas so distributed as to imitate flowers of the softest tints and the most perfect shape this too seemed unearthly weird we seemed in an instant transported into some thalabas cave infinitely beyond the common sights and sounds of everyday life in the centre of these grounds there is a circle of pillars on the top of each of which is a pot of flowers with gas jets and between them an arch of gas jets this circle is very large in the midst of it is another circle forming a pavilion for musicians also brilliantly illuminated and containing a large cotillion band of the most finished performers  around this you find thousands of gentlemen and ladies strolling singly in pairs or in groups there could not be less than three thousand persons present while the musicians repose they loiter sauntering round or recline on seats  but now a lively waltz strikes the ear in an instant twenty or thirty couples are whirling along floating like thistles in the wind around the central pavilion their feet scarce touch the smoothtrodden earth round and round in a vortex of life beauty and brilliancy they go a whirlwind of delight eyes sparkling cheeks flushing and gauzy draperies floating by while the crowds outside gather in a ring and watch the giddy revel there are countless forms of symmetry and grace faces of wondrous beauty both among the dancers and among the spectators  there too are feats of agility and elasticity quite aerial one lithe and active dancer grasped his fair partner by the waist she was dressed in a red dress was small elastic agile and went by like the wind and now and then in the course of every few seconds he would give her a whirl and a lift sending her spinning through the air around himself as an axis full four feet from the ground  then the music ceases the crowd dissolves and floats and saunters away on every hand are games of hazard and skill with balls tops wheels c where for five cents a trial one might seek to gain a choice out of glittering articles exposed to view  then the band strike up again and the whirling dance renews its vortex and so it goes on from hour to hour till two or three in the morning not that we staid till then we saw all we wanted to see and left by eleven but it is a scene perfectly unearthly or rather perfectly parisian and just as earthly as possible yet a scene where earthliness is worked up into a style of sublimation the most exquisite conceivable  entrance to this paradise can be had for gentlemen a dollar ladies free this tells the whole story nevertheless do not infer that there are not any respectable ladies there it is a place so remarkable that very few strangers stay long in paris without taking a look at it and though young ladies residing in paris never go and matrons very seldom yet occasionally it is the case that some ladies of respectability look in the best dancers those who exhibit such surprising feats of skill and agility are professionalpaid by the establishment  nevertheless aside from the impropriety inherent in the very nature of waltzing there was not a word look or gesture of immorality or impropriety the dresses were all decent and if there was vice it was vice masked under the guise of polite propriety  how different i could not but reflect is all this from the gin palaces of london there there is indeed a dazzling splendor of gas light but there is nothing artistic nothing refined nothing appealing to the imagination there are only hogsheads and barrels and the appliances for serving out strong drink and there for one sole end the swallowing of fiery stimulant come the nightly thousandsfrom the gay and well dressed to the haggard and tattered in the last stage of debasement the end is the sameby how different paths here they dance along the path to ruin with flowers and music there they cast themselves bodily as it were into the lake of fire  wednesday june 15 went in the forenoon to m bellocs studio and read while h was sitting  then we drove to madame rogers who is one of the leaders of paris taste and legislation in dress and who is said to have refused to work for a duchess who neglected to return her husbands bow i sat in the outer courts while some mysterious affairs were being transacted in the inner rooms of state  then we drove to the louvre and visited the remains from nineveh they are fewer in number than those in the british museum which i have not yet seen but the pair of humanheaded winged bulls are said to be equal in size to any  i was very much impressed not only by the solemn grandeur of the thought that thirty centuries were looking down upon me out of those stony eyes but by what i have never seen noticed the magnificent phrenological development of the heads the brow is absolutely prodigiousbroad high projecting massive it is the brow of a divinity indeed or of a cherub which i am persuaded is the true designation of these creatures they are to me but the earliest known attempts to preserve the cherubim that formed the fiery portals of the eden temple until quenched in the purges of the deluge  out of those eyes of serene benign profound reflection therefore not thirty but sixty centuries look down upon me i seem to be standing at those mysterious eden gates where adam and eve first guided the worship of a world amid the sad yet sublime symbols of a previous existence in heavenly realms  after leaving the louvre h and i took a calèche or open twoseat carriage and drove from thence to the madeleine and thence the whole length of the boulevards circling round crossing the pont dausterlitz and coming back by the avenue de lobservatoire and the luxembourg  then we saw theatres the port st denis port st martin the site of the bastille and the most gay beautiful and bustling boulevards of the metropolis  as we were proceeding along the boulevard des italiens i saw the street beginning to line with people the cabs and carriages drawing to either side and stopping police officers commanding directing people running pushing looking this way and that qu y atil said i standing up by the driverwhats the matter  the emperor is coming said he  well said i draw to one side and turn a little so that we can see  he did so and h and i both stood up looking round we saw several outriders in livery on the full trot followed by several carriages they came very fast the outriders calling to the people to get out of the way in the first carriage sat the emperor and the empresshe cold stiff stately and homely she pale beautiful and sad they rode not two rods from us there was not a hat taken off not a single shout not a vive lempereur without a single token of greeting or applause he rode through the everforming everdissolving avenue of peoplethe abhorred the tolerated tyrant why do they not cry out i said to the coachman why do they not cry vive lempereur a most expressive shrug was the answer and i do not know i suppose because they do not choose  thursday june 16 immediately after breakfast we were to visit chateau de corbeville the carriage came and h mrs c and w entered i mounted the box with the cocker as usual to be shut up in a box and peep out at the window while driving through such scenes is horrible by the way our party would have been larger but for the arrest of monsieur f an intimate friend of the family which took place at five oclock in the morning  he was here yesterday in fine spirits and he and his wife were to have joined our party his arrest is on some political suspicion and as the result cannot be foreseen it casts a shadow over the spirits of our household  we drove along through the bright fresh morningi enjoying the panorama of paris exceedinglyto the western railway station where we took tickets for versailles  we feel as much at home now in these continental railroad stations as in our ownnay more so every thing is so regulated here there is almost no possibility of going wrong and there is always somebody at hand whose business it is to be very polite and tell you just what to do  a very pleasant half hours ride brought us to versailles there we took a barouche for the day and started for the chateau in about an hour and a half through very pleasant scenery we came to the spot where we were met by madame v and her daughter and alighting walked to the chateau through a long avenue dark with overarching trees we were to have a second breakfast at about one oclock in the day so we strolled out to a seat on the terrace commanding a fine and very extensive prospect  madame v is the wife of an eminent lawyer who held the office of intendant of the civil list of louis philippe and has had the settlement of that gentlemans pecuniary affairs since his death at the time of the coup détat being then a representative he was imprisoned and his wife showed considerable intrepidity in visiting him walking on foot through the prison yard amongst the soldiers sitting drunk on the cannon at present monsieur v is engaged in his profession in paris  madame v is a pleasantlooking french woman of highlycultivated mind and agreeable manners accomplished in music and in painting her daughter about fifteen plays well and is a good specimen of a welleducated french demoiselle not yet out they are simply ciphers except as developed in connection with and behind shelter of their mother she performed some beautiful things beautifully and then her mother played a duet with her we took a walk through the groves and sat on the bank on the brow of a commanding eminence  a wide landscape was before us characterized by every beauty of foliage conceivable but by none more admirable to my eye than the poplars which sustain the same relation to french scenery that spruces do to that of maine reclining there we could almost see besides the ancient territory of the duke dorsay the celebrated valley of chartreuse where was the famous abbey of port royal a valley filled with historic associations if it had not been for a hill which stood in the way we should have seen it at our leisure we discussed painting before us a perfect landscape around us a deep solitude and stillness broken by the sighing of ancient aristocratic shades and the songs of birds within us emotions of lassitude and dreamy delight  we had found a spot where existence was a blessing a spot where to exist was enough where the to be was for a moment disjoined from the inexorable to do or to suffer how agreeable to converse with cultivated and refined artistic minds how delightful to find people to whom the beautiful has been a study and art a world in which they could live move and have their being and yet it was impossible to prevent a shade of deep sadness from resting on all thingsa tinge of melancholy whywhy this veil of dim and indefinable anguish at sight of whatever is most fair at hearing whatever is most lovely is it the exiled spirit yearning for its own is it the captive to whom the ray of heavens own glory comes through the crevice of his dungeon walls but this is a digression returning we examined the mansion a fine specimen of the old french chateau squarebuilt with high norman roof and a round conicaltopped tower at each corner in front was a garden curiously laid out in beds and knots of flowers with a fountain in the centre this garden was enclosed on all sides by beech trees clipped into lofty walls of green the chateau had once been fortified but now the remains of the fortifications are made into terraces planted with roses and honeysuckles here we heard for the first time in our lives the nightingales song a gurgling warble with an occasional crescendo à la jenny lind  at five we dined took carriage at seven cars at nine and arrived in paris at ten  friday june 17 at twelve oclock i started for versailles to visit the camp at sartory where i understood the emperor was to review the troops  at versailles i mounted the top of an omnibus with two parisian gentlemen as i opened my umbrella one of them complimented me on having it i replied that it was quite a necessary of life he answered and we were soon quite chatty i inquired about the camp at sartory and whether the emperor was to be there he said he had heard so  he then asked me if we had not a camp near london showing that he took me for an englishman i replied that there was a camp there though i had not seen it and that i was an american in reply he congratulated me that the americans were far ahead of the english  i complimented him then in turn on versailles and its galleries and told him there was not a nation on earth that had such monuments of its own history and greatness they were highly elated at this and we rode along in the best possible humor together nothing will make a frenchman thoroughly your friend sooner than heartily to praise his country it is for this i love them  arrived at sartory i had a long walk to reach the camp and instead of inquiring as i ought to have done whether the review was to take place i took it for granted i saw bodies of soldiers moving in various directions officers galloping about and flying artillery trundling along and heard drums trumpets and bands and thought it was all right  a fifteen minutes walk brought me to the camp where tents for some twentyfive thousand whiten the plain far as the eye can reach there too i saw distant masses of infantry moving i might have known by their slouchy way that they were getting home from parade not preparing for it but i thought the latter and lying down under a tree waited for the review to begin  it was almost three oclock i waited and waited the soldiers did not come i waited and waited and waited the soldiers seemed to have gone more and more the throne where the emperor was to sit remained unoccupied at last it was four oclock thought i i will just ask these redcaps here about this  messieurs said i will you be so good as to inform me if the emperor is to be here today  no they replied he comes on sunday  and what is to be done here then i asked  here they replied today nothing cest finiit is all over the review was at one oclock  there i had been walking from versailles and waiting for a parade some two hours after it was all over among crowds of people who could have told me at once if i had not been so excessively modest as not to ask  about that time an american might have been seen precipitately seeking the railroad i had not seen the elephant it was hot dusty and there was neither cab nor calèche in reach  i arrived at the railroad station just in time to see the train go out at one end as i came in at the other this was conducive to a frame of mind that scarcely needs remark out of that depot it was half past four and at six they dine in paris with augmented zeal and decision i pitched into a cab  a lautre station vite viteto the other station quick quick he mounted the box and commenced lashing his rosinante who was a subject for crows to mourn over because they could hope for nothing in trying to pick him and in an ambling scrambling pace composed of a trot a canter and a kick we made a descent like an avalanche into the station yard there richard was himself again i assumed at once the air of a gentleman who had seen the review and walked about with composure and dignity no doubt i had seen the emperor and all the troops i succeeded in getting home just in the middle of dinner and by dint of hard eating caught up at the third course with the rest  that i consider a very white day some might call it green but i mark such days with white always  in the evening we attended the salon of lady elgin a friend of our hostess found there the marquis de m whose book on the spiritual rappings comes out next week we conversed on the rappings ad nauseam  by the way her ladyship rents the hotel de la rochefoucauld in the rue de varenne faubourg st germain  st germain is full of these princely aristocratic mansions mournfully beautifuldesolately grand out of the stern stony street we entered a wide square court under a massive arched gateway then through the rezdechaussée or lower suite of rooms passed out into the rear of the house to find ourselves in the garden or rather a kind of park with tall trees flooded in moonlight bathed in splendors and with their distant leafy arches cut with artistic skill reminding one of a gothic temple such a magnificent forest scene in the very heart of paris  saturday june 18 after breakfast rode out to arc de triomphede letoile and thence round the exterior barriers and boulevards to père la chaise  at every entrance to the city past the barriers which are now only a street there is a gate and a building marked octroi which means customs  no carriage can pass without being examined though the examination is a mere form  père la chaise did not interest me much except that from the top of the hill i gained a good view of the city it is filled with tombs and monuments and laid out in streets the houses of the dead are smaller than the houses of the living but they are made like houses with doors windows and an empty place inside for an altar crucifix lamps wreaths c tombs have no charm for me i am not at all interested or inspired by them they do not serve with me the purpose intended viz of calling up the memory of the departed on the contrary their memory is associated with their deeds their works the places where they wrought and the monuments of themselves they have left here however in the charnel house is commemorated but the event of their deepest shame and degradation their total vanquishment under the dominion of death the triumph of corruption  here all that was visible of them is insulted by the last enemy in the deepest most humiliating posture of contumely  from père la chaise i came home to dinner at six h meanwhile had been sitting to m belloc  after dinner h and the two misses c rode out to the bois de boulogne the fashionable drive of paris  we saw all the splendid turnouts and all the not splendid our horse was noted for the springhalt it is well to have something to attract attention about one you know  sabbath june 19 after breakfast went with miss w to the temple st marie to hear adolphe monod was able to understand him very well gained a new idea of the capabilities of the french language as the vehicle of religious thought and experience i had thought that it was a language incapable of being made to express the hebrew mind and feeling of scripture i think differently the language of canaan can make its way through all languages and in the french it has a pathos point and simplicity which are wonderful there were thoughts in the sermon which i shall never forget i feel myself highly rewarded for going  the congregation was as large as the church could possibly hold and composed of very interesting and intelligentlooking people his subject was if any man lack wisdom let him ask of god who giveth willingly and without upbraiding c it was most touchingly adapted to the wants of the unhappy french and of all poor sinners and it came home to me in particular as if it had been addressed to me singly so that i could not help crying  the afternoon and evening spent at home reading h went in the morning with madame de t to the catholic service at the church st germaine lauxerrois and her companion pointed out the different parts of the service  h said she was moved with compassion towards these multitudes who seem so very earnest and solemn their prayer books contain much that is excellent if it was not mixed with so much that is idolatrous  monday june 20 went to have our passport viséd the sky was black and the rain pouring in torrents as i reached the quay the seine was rushing dark and turbidly foaming i crept into a fiacre and was amused as we rattled on to see the plight of gay and glittering paris one poor organ grinder on the pont national sat with his umbrella over his head and his body behind the parapet grinding away in the howling storm it was the best use for a hand organ i ever saw the gardens of the tuileries presented a sorry sight the sentries slunk within their boxes the chairs were stacked and laid on their sides the paths were flooded and the classic statues looked as though they had a dismal time of it in the general shower bath  my passport went through the office of the american embassy prefecture of the police and the bureau des affaires étrangères and the swiss legation and we were all right for the frontier  our fair hostesses are all alpine mountaineers posted up in mountain lore they make you look blank one moment with horror at some escape of theirs from being dashed down a precipice the next they run you a rig indeed over the righi anon you shamble through chamounix and break your neck over the coldebalme and before you are aware are among the lacking at interlachen  wednesday june 22 adieu to paris ho for chalons sur saone after affectionate farewells of our kind friends by eleven oclock we were rushing in the pleasantest of cars over the smoothest of rails through burgundy that was i reading to h out of dumas impressions de voyage going over our very route we arrived at chalons at nine in the evening and were soon established in the hotel du park in two small brickfloored chambers looking out upon the steamboat landing  thursday 23 eight oclock a m since five we have had a fine bustle on the quay below our windows there lay three steamers shaped for all the world like our last nights rolls one would think ichabod crane might sit astride one of them and dip his feet in the water they ought to be swift lhirondelle the swallow flew at five another at six we leave at nine  eleven oclock here we go down the saone cabin thirty feet by ten papered and varnished in invitation of maple ladies knitting netting nodding napping gentlemen yawning snoring children frolicking dogs whining overhead a constant tramping stamping and screeching of the steam valve h suggests an excursion forward we heave up from hades and cautiously thread the crowded al sirat of a deck the day is fine the air is filled with golden beams  more and more beautiful grows the scene as we approach the rhonethe river broader hills more commanding and architecture tinged with the italian bradshaw says it equals the rhine  at lyons there was a scene of indescribable confusion out of the hold a man with a rope and hook was hauling baggage up a smooth board three hundred people were sorting their goods without checks porters were shouldering immense loads four or five heavy trunks at once corded together and stalking off atlantean hatboxes bandboxes and valises burst like a meteoric shower out of a crater a moi à moi was the cry from old men young women soldiers shopkeepers and prêtres scuffling and shoving together careless at once of grammar and of grace i pulled and shouted with the best till at length our plunder was caught corded and poised on an herculean neck we followed in the wake h trembling lest the cord should break and we experience a prealpine avalanche at length however we breathed more freely in rooms au quatrième of hotel de lunivers  after dinner we drove to the cathedral it was st johns eve at twelve oclock tonight said h the spirits of all who are to die this year will appear to any who will go alone into the dark cathedral and summon them we were charmed with the interior twilight hid all the dirt cobwebs and tawdry tinsel softened the outlines and gave to the immense arches columns and stained windows a strange and thrilling beauty the distant tapers seeming remoter than reality the kneeling crowds the heavy vesper chime all combined to realize h said her dreams of romance more perfectly than ever before we could not tear ourselves away but the clash of the sextons keys as he smote them together was the signal to be gone one after another the tapers were extinguished the kneeling figures rose and shadowily we flitted forth as from some gorgeous cave of grammarye  saturday june 25 lyons to genève as this was our first experience in the diligence line we noticed particularly every peculiarity a diligence is a large heavy stronglybuilt wellhung stage consisting of five distinct departmentscoupé berline omnibus banquette and baggage top  illustration of a diligence coach drawn by four horses  after setting up housekeeping in our berline and putting all to rights the whips cracked bells jingled and away we thundered by the arrowy rhone i had had the idea that a diligence was a rickety slowmoulded antediluvian nondescript toiling patiently along over impassable roads at a snails pace judge of my astonishment at finding it a fullblooded vigorous monster of unscrupulous railway momentum and imperturbable equipoise of mind  down the macadamized slopes we thundered at a prodigious pace up the hills we trotted with six horses three abreast madly through the little towns we burst like a whirlwind crashing across the pebbled streets and out upon the broad smooth road again before we had well considered the fact that we were out of lyons we stopped to change horses done in a jiffy and whoop crick crack whack rumble bump whirr whisk away we blazed till ere we knew it another change and another  really h said i this is not slow the fact is we are going ahead i call this travellingnever was so comfortable in my life  nor i quoth she and besides we are unwinding the rhone all along  and sure enough we were ever and anon getting a glimpse of him spread mazily all abroad in some beautiful vale like a midguard anaconda done in silver  at nantua a sordid town with a squalid inn we dined at two deliciously on a red shrimp soup no not soup it was a potage no a stew no a creamy unctuous mess muss or whatever you please to call it sancho panza never ate his olla podrida with more relish success to mine host of the jolly inn of nantua  then we thunderbolted along again shot through a grim fortress crossed a boundary line and were in switzerland vive switzerland land of alps glaciers and freemen  as evening drew on a wind sprang up and a storm seemed gathering on the jura the rain dashed against the panes of the berime as we rode past the grimfaced monarch of the misty shroud a cold wind went sweeping by and the rhone was rushing far below discernible only in the distance as a rivulet of flashing foam it was night as we drove into geneva and stopped at the messagerie i heard with joy a voice demanding if this were monsieur besshare i replied not without some scruples of conscience oui monsieur cest moi though the name did not sound exactly like the one to which i had been wont to respond in half an hour we were at home in the mansion of monsieur fazy  genève monday june 27 the day dawned clear over this palace of enchantment the mountains the lake the entire landscape on every side revealed itself from our lofty windows with transparent brilliancy this house is built on high ground at the end of the lake near where the rhone flows out it is very high in the rooms and we are in the fourth story and have distant views on all four sides the windows are very large and open in leaves on hinges like doors leaving the entire window clear as a frame for the distant picture  in the afternoon we rode out across the rhone where it breaks from the lake and round upon the ascending shore it is seldom here that the alps are visible the least mist hides them completely so that travellers are wont to record it in their diaries as a great event i saw mont blanc today yesterday there was nothing but clouds and thick gloom but now we had not ridden far before h sprang suddenly as if she had lost her sensesher cheeks flushed and her eye flashing i was frightened there said she pointing out of the side of the carriage across the lake there he istheres mont blanc pooh said i no such thing and some trees for a moment intervened and shut out the view presently the trees opened and h cried there that white dont you seetherethere pointing with great energy as if she were getting ready to fly i looked and saw sure enough behind the dark mass of the mole a huge blueblack mountain in the foreground the granite ranges rising gradually and grim as we rode but further still behind those gray and ghastly barriers all bathed and blazing in the suns fresh splendors undimmed by a cloud unveiled even by a filmy fleece of vapor and oh so whiteso intensely blindingly white against the darkblue sky the needles the spires the solemn pyramid the transfiguration cone of mont blanc higher and still higher those apocalyptic splendors seemed lifting their spectral spiritual forms seeming to rise as we rose seeming to start like giants hidden from behind the black brow of intervening ranges opening wider the amphitheatre of glory until as we reached the highest point in our road the whole unearthly vision stood revealed in sublime perspective the language of the revelation came rushing through my soul this is as it were a door opened in heaven here are some of those everlasting mountain ranges whose light is not of the sun nor of the moon but of the lord god and of the lamb here is as it were a great white throne on which one might sit before whose face heaven and earth might flee and here a sea of glass mingled with fire nay rather here are some faint shadows some dim and veiled resemblances which bring our earthimprisoned spirits to conceive remotely what the disencumbered eye of the ecstatic apostle gazed upon  with solemn thankfulness we gazedthankfulness to god for having withdrawn his veil of clouds from this threshold of the heavenly vestibule and brought us across the atlantic to behold and as our eyes blinded by the dazzling visionwhich we might reside here years without beholding in such perfectionfilled with tears we were forced to turn them away and hide them or fasten them upon the dark range of jura on the other side of us until they were able to gaze again thus we rode onward obtaining new points of view new effects and deeper emotions nor can time efface the impressions we received in the depths of our souls  a lady at whose door we alighted for a moment to obtain a particular point of view told us that at sunset the mountain assumed a peculiar transparency with most mysterious hues of blue and purple so that she had seen irreligious natures frivolous and light when suddenly called out to look stand petrified or rather exalted above themselves and irresistibly turning their faces their thoughts their breathings of adoration up to god  i do not wonder that the eternal home of the glorified should be symbolized by a mount zion i do not wonder that the psalmist should say i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help for surely earth cannot present nor unassisted fancy conceive an object more profoundly significant of divine majesty than these mountains in their linen vesture of everlasting snow  tuesday june 28 the morning dawned clear warm and cloudless a soft haze rested on the distant landscape without however in the least dimming its beauty  at about eleven we set off with two horses in an open carriage by the left shore to visit st cergue and ascend the jura all our way was gradually ascending and before us or rather across the lake on one side stood the glorious new jerusalem scene we were highly favored every moment diminished the intervening mountains and lifted the gorgeous pageant higher into the azure  every step every turn presented it in some new point of view and extended the range of observation new alps were continually rising and diamondpointed peaks glancing up behind sombre granite bulwarks  at noon cocher stopped at a village to refresh his horses we proceeded to a cool terrace filled with trees and lulled by the splash of a fountain from whence the mountain was in full view here we investigated the mysteries of a certain basket which our provident hostess had brought with her  after due refreshment and repose we continued our route ascending the jura towards the dôle which is the highest mountain of that range a macadamized road coiled up the mountain side affording us at every turning a new and more splendid view of the other shore of the lake at length we reached st cergue and leaving the carriage h and i guided by a peasant girl went through the woods to the highest point where were the ruins of the ancient chateau far be it from me to describe what we saw i feel that i have already been too presumptuous we sat down and each made a hasty sketch of mont blanc  we took tea at the hotel which reminded us by the neatness of its scoured chambers with their white bedspreads of the apartments of some outoftheway new england farm house  the people of the neighborhood having discovered who h was were very kind and full of delight at seeing her it was scotland over again we have had to be unflinching to prevent her being overwhelmed both in paris and geneva by the same demonstrations of regard to this we were driven as a matter of life and death it was touching to listen to the talk of these secluded mountaineers the good hostess even the servant maids hung about h expressing such tender interest for the slave all had read uncle tom and it had apparently been an era in their lifes monotony for they said o madam do write another remember our winter nights here are very long  the proprietor of the inn not the landlord was a gentleman of education and polished demeanor he had lost an eva he said and he spoke with deep emotion he thanked h for what she had written and at parting said have courage the sacred cause of liberty will yet prevail through the world  ah they breathe a pure air these generous swiss among these mountain tops may their simple words be a prophecy divine  at about six we returned and as we slowly wound down the mountain side we had a full view of all the phenomena of color attending the suns departure the mountainthe city ratherfor so high had it risen that i could imagine a new jerusalem of pearly white with mont blanc for the central citadel or templethe city was all aglow the air behind the sky became of a delicate apple green the snow before so incandescent in whiteness assumed a rosy tint we paused we sat in silence to witness these miraculous transformations charley said h sing that hymn of yours the new jerusalem and in the hush of the mountain solitudes we sang together    we are on our journey home      where christ our lord is gone    we will meet around his throne      when he makes his people one        in the new jerusalem     we can see that distant home      though clouds rise oft between    faith views the radiant dome      and a lustre flashes keen        from the new jerusalem     o glory shining far      from the neversetting sun    o trembling morning star      our journeys almost done        to the new jerusalem     our hearts are breaking now      those mansions fair to see    o lord thy heavens bow      and raise us up with thee        to the new jerusalem  the echoes of our voices died along the mountain sides as slowly we wended our downward way the rosy flush began to fade a rich creamy or orange hue seemed to imbue the scene and finally as the shadows from the jura crept higher and covered it with a pall it assumed a startling deathlike pallor of chalky white mont blanc was dead mont blanc was walking as a ghost upon the granite ranges but as darkness came on and as the sky over the jura where the sun had set obtained a deep rosy tinge mont blanc revived a little and a flush of delicate transparent pink tinged his cone and mont blanc was asleep good night to mont blanc  wednesday morning june 29 the day is intensely hot the weather is exceedingly fair but mont blanc is not visible not a vestigenot a trace all vanished it does not seem possible there do not seem to exist the conditions for such celestial pageant to have stood there what therewhere my eyes now look steadily and piercingly into the blue into the seemingly fathomless azurethere will they tell me i saw that enraptured vision as it were the city descending from god out of heaven as a bride adorned for her husband incredible it must be a dream a vision of the night  evening after the heat of the day our whole household old and young set forth for a boating excursion on the lake dividing our party in two boats we pulled about a mile up the left shore lake leman was before us in all its loveliness and we were dipping our oar where byron had floated past scenes which scarce need to become classic to possess a superior charm the sun was just gone behind the jura leaving a glorious sky mont blanc stood afar behind a hazy veil like a spirit half revealed we saw it pass before our eyes as we moved it stood still but we could not discern the form thereof as we glided on past boats uncounted winged or manyfooted motionless or still we softly sung    think of me oft at twilight hour      and i will think of thee    remembering how we felt its power      when thou wast still with me     dear is that hour for day then sleeps      upon the gray clouds breast    and not a voice or sound eer keeps      his wearied eyes from rest  the surface of the lake was unruffled the air was still an occasional burst from the band in the garden of rousseau came softened in the distance enveloped in her thick shawl h reclined in the stern and gave herself to the influences of the hour  darkness came down upon the deep and in the gloom we turned our prows towards the manytwinkling quays far in the distance we bent to the oar in emulous contest and our barks foamed and hissed through the water in a few moments we were passing through the noisy crowd on the quay towards our quiet home     letter xxxii  dear children  i promised to write from chamouni so to commence at the commencement fancy me on a broiling day in july panting with the heat gazing from my window in geneva upon lake leman which reflects the sun like a burning glass and thinking whether in america or any where else it was ever so hot before this was quite a new view of the subject to me who had been warned in paris only of the necessity of blanket shawls and had come to switzerland with my head full of glaciers and my trunk full of furs  while arranging my travelling preparations madame f enters  have you considered how cold it is up there she inquires  i am glad if it is cold any where said i  ah you will find it dreadful you will need to be thoroughly guarded  i suggested tippets flannels and furs of which i already possessed a moderate supply but no these were altogether insufficient it was necessary that i should buy two immense fur coats one for c and one for myself  i assure you that such preparations made with the thermometer between eighty and ninety impress one with a kind of awe what regions must they be thought i to myself thus sealed up in eternal snows while the country at their feet lies scorching in the very fire a shadow of incredulity mingled itself with my reflections on the whole i bought but one fur coat  at this moment c came up to tell me that w s and g had all come back from italy so that our party was once more together  it was on the 5th of july that s and i took our seats in the coupé of the diligence now this coupé is low and narrow enough so that our condition reminded me slightly of the luckless fowls which i have sometimes seen riding to the cincinnati market in coupés of about equal convenience nevertheless it might be considered a peaceable and satisfactory style of accommodation in an ordinary country but to ride among the wonders of the alps in such a vehicle is something like contemplating infinity through the nose of a bottle it was really very tantalizing and provoking to me till c was so obliging as to resign his seat on top in my favor and descend into sheol as he said then i began to live for i could see to the summit of the immense walls of rock under which we were passing by and by we were reminded by the examination of our passports that we had entered sardinia and the officers being duly satisfied that we were not going to chamouni to levy an army among the glaciers or raise a sedition among the avalanches let us pass free the discretion and wisdom of this passport system can never be sufficiently admired it must be entirely owing to this that the alps do not break out on europe generally and tear it in pieces  but the mountainshow shall i give you the least idea of them old sombre haggard genii half veiled in clouds belted with pines worn and furrowed with storms and avalanches but not as yet crowned with snow for many miles after leaving geneva the mole is the principal object its blueblack outline veering and shifting taking on a thousand strange varieties of form as you approach it others again as you recede  it is a cloudy day and heavy volumes of vapor are wreathing and unwreathing themselves around the gaunt forms of the everlasting rocks like human reasonings desires and hopes around the ghastly realities of life and death graceful undulating and sometimes gleaming out in silver or rosy wreaths still they are nothing but mist the dread realities are just where they were before it is odd though to look at these cloud caperings quite as interesting in its way as to read new systems of transcendental philosophy and perhaps quite as profitable yonder is a great whiteheaded cloud slowly unrolling himself in the bosom of a black pine forest across the other side of the road a huge granite cliff has picked up a bit of gauzy silver which he is winding round his scraggy neck and now here comes a cascade right over our heads a cascade not of water but of cloud for the poor little brook that makes it faints away before it gets down to us it falls like a shimmer of moonlight or a shower of powdered silver while a tremulous rainbow appears at uncertain intervals like a halfseen spirit  illustration of waterfalls  the cascade here as in mountains generally is a neverfailing source of life and variety water joyous buoyant son of nature is calling to you leaping sparkling mocking at you between bushes and singing as he goes down the dells a thousand little pictures he makes among the rocks as he goes like the little sketch which i send you  then the bizarre outline of the rocks well does goethe call them the giantsnouted crags and as the diligence winds slowly on they seem to lean and turn and bend now they close up like a wall in front now open in piny and cloudy vistas now they embrace the torrent in their great black arms and now flashing laughter and babbling defiance through rifted rocks and uprooted pines the torrent shoots past them down into some fathomless abyss these old alp mothers cannot hold their offspring back from abysses any better than poor earth mothers  there are phases in nature which correspond to every phase of human thought and emotion and this stern cloudy scenery answers to the melancholy fatalism of greek tragedy or the kindred mournfulness of the book of job  these dark channelled rocks worn as with eternal tearsthese traces so evident of ancient and vast desolationssuggest the idea of boundless power and inexorable will before whose course the most vehement of human feelings are as the fine spray of the cataract    for surely the mountain falling cometh to nought    the rock is remored out of his place    the waters wear the stones    thou washest away the things that grow out of the earth    and thou destroyest the hopes of man    thou prevailest against him and he passeth    thou changest his countenance and sendest him away  the sceptical inquirer into the mysteries of eternal things might here if ever feel the solemn irony of eliphaz the temanite    should a wise man utter vain knowledge    should he reason with unprofitable talk    or with speeches that can do no good    art thou the first man that ever was born    or wast thou made before the hills  there are some of my fellowtravellers by the by who if they had been made before the hills would never have been much wiser all through these solemn passages and gorges they are discussing hotels champagne wine and cigars i presume they would do the same thing at the gates of the celestial city if they should accidentally find themselves there it is one of the dark providences that multitudes of this calibre of mind find leisure and means to come among these scenes while many to whom they would be an inspiration in whose souls they would unseal ceaseless fountains of beauty are forever excluded by poverty and care  at noon we stopped at sallenches famous for two things first as the spot where people get dinner and second where they take the char a carriage used when the road is too steep for the diligence here s who had been feeling ill all the morning became too unwell to proceed so that we had to lie by an hour or two and did not go on with the caravan i sat down at the room window to study and sketch a mountain that rose exactly opposite i thought to myself now would it be possible to give to one that had not seen it an idea of how this looks let me try if words can paint it right above the fiat roof of the houses on the opposite side of the street rose this immense mountain wall the lower tier seemed to be a turbulent swell of pasture land rolling into every imaginable shape green billows and dells rising higher and higher in the air as you looked upward dyed here and there in bright yellow streaks by the wild crocus and spotted over with cattle dark clumps and belts of pine now and then rise up among them and scattered here and there in the heights among green hollows were cottages that looked about as big as hickory nuts  above all this region was still another of black pines and crags the pines going up and up and up till they looked no larger than pin feathers and surmounting all straight castellated turrets of rock looking out of swathing bands of cloud a narrow dazzling line of snow crowned the summit  you see before you three distinct regionsof pasture of pine of bare eternal sterility on inquiring the name of the mountain i was told that it was the aiguille something i forget what but i discovered that almost all the peaks in this region of the alps are called aiguille needle i suppose from the straight sharp points that rise at their summits  there is a bridge here in sallenches from which in clear weather one of the best views of mont blanc can be obtainedso they tell us today it is as much behind the veil and as absolutely a matter of faith as heaven itself looking in that direction you could not believe that there ever had been or could be a mountain there the concealing clouds look as gray as cool and as absolutely unconscious of any world of glory behind them as our dull cold everyday life does of a heaven which is perhaps equally near us as we were passing the bridge however a gust of icy wind swept down the course of the river whose chilly breath spoke of glaciers and avalanches  our driver was one of those merry souls to be found the world over whose hearts yearn after talk and when i volunteered to share the outside seat with him that i might see better he inquired anxiously if mademoiselle understood french that he might have the pleasure of enlightening her on the localities of course mademoiselle could do no less than be exceedingly grateful since a peasant on his own ground is generally better informed than a philosopher from elsewhere  our path lay along the banks of the arve a raving brawling turbulent stream of muddy water a wide belt of drifted pebbly land on either side of it showed that at times the torrent had a much wider sweep than at present  in fact my guide informed me that the arve like most other mountain streams had many troublesome and inconvenient personal habits such as rising up all of a sudden some night and whisking off houses cattle pine trees in short getting up sailing parties in such a promiscuous manner that it is neither safe nor agreeable to live in his neighborhood he showed me from time to time the traces of such kuhleborn pranks  we were now descending rapidly through the valley of chamouni by a winding road the scenery becoming every moment more and more impressive the path was so steep and so stony that our guide was well enough contented to have us walk i was glad to walk on alone for the scenery was so wonderful that human sympathy and communion seemed to be out of the question the effect of such scenery to our generally sleeping and drowsy souls bound with the double chain of earthliness and sin is like the electric touch of the angel on peter bound and sleeping they make us realize that we were not only made to commune with god but also what a god he is with whom we may commune we talk of poetry we talk of painting we go to the ends of the earth to see the artists and great men of this world but what a poet what an artist is god truly said michael angelo the true painting is only a copy of the divine perfectionsa shadow of his pencil  i was sitting on a mossy trunk of an old pine looking up admiringly on the wonderful heights around mecrystal peaks sparkling over dark pine treesshadowy airy distances of mountain heights rising crystalline amid manycolored masses of cloud while looking out over my head from green hollows i saw the small cottages so tiny in their airy distance that they seemed scarcely bigger than a squirrels nut which he might have dropped in his passage a pretty savoyard girl i should think about fifteen years old came up to me  madame admires the mountains she said  i assented  yes she added strangers always admire our mountains  and dont you admire them said i looking i suppose rather amused into her bright eyes  no she said laughing strangers come from hundreds of miles to see them all the time but we peasants dont care for them no more than the dust of the road  i could but half believe the bright little puss when she said so but there was a lumpish soggy fellow accompanying her whose nature appeared to be sufficiently unleavened to make almost any thing credible in the line of stupidity in fact it is one of the greatest drawbacks to the pleasure with which one travels through this beautiful country to see what kind of human beings inhabit it here in the alps heaven above and earth beneath tree rock water light and shadow every form and agent and power of nature seem to be exerting themselves to produce a constant and changing poem and romance every thing is grand noble free and yet beautiful in all these regions there is nothing so repulsive as a human dwelling  a little further on we stopped at a village to refresh the horses the auberge where we stopped was built like a great barn with an earth floor desolate and comfortless the people looked poor and ground down as if they had not a thought above the coarsest animal wants the dirty children with their hair tangled beyond all hope of combing had the begging whine and the trick of raising their hands for money when one looked at them which is universal in the catholic parts of switzerland indeed all the way from the sardinian frontier we had been dogged by beggars continually parents seemed to look upon their children as valuable only for this purpose the very baby in arms is taught to make a pitiful little whine and put out its fat hand if your eye rests on it the fact is they are poorpoor because invention enterprise and intellectual vigorall that surrounds the new england mountain farmer with competence and comfortare quenched and dead by the combined influence of a religion and government whose interest it is to keep people stupid that they may be manageable yet the savoyards as a race it seems to me are naturally intelligent and i cannot but hope that the liberal course lately adopted by the sardinian government may at last reach them my heart yearns over many of the bright pretty children whose little hands have been up from time to time around our carriage i could not help thinking what good schools and good instruction might do for them it is not their fault poor little things that they are educated to whine and beg and grow up rude uncultured to bring forth another set of children just like themselves but what to do with them is the question one generally begins with giving money but a day or two of experience shows that it would be just about as hopeful to feed the locusts of egypt on a loaf of bread but it is hard to refuse children especially to a mother who has left five or six at home and who fancies she sees in some of these little eager childish faces something now and then that reminds her of her own for my part i got schooled so that i could stand them all except the little toddling threeyear oldsthey fairly overcame me so i supplied my pocket with a quantity of sugar lozenges for the relief of my own mind i usually found the little fellows looked exceedingly delighted when they discovered the nature of the coin children are unsophisticated and like sugar better than silver any day  in this auberge was a little chamois kid of which fact we were duly apprised when we got out by a board put up which said here one can see a live chamois the little live representative of chamoisdom came skipping out with the most amiable unconsciousness and went through his paces for our entertainment with as much propriety as a new england child says his catechism he hopped up on a table after some green leaves which were then economically used to make him hop down again the same illusive prospect was used to make him jump over a stick and perform a number of other evolutions i could not but admire the sweetness of temper with which he took all this tantalizing and the innocence with which he chewed his cabbage leaf after he got it not harboring a single revengeful thought at us for the trouble we had given him of course the issue of the matter was that we all paid a few sous for the sightnot to the chamois which would have been the most equitable way but to those who had appropriated his gifts and graces to eke out their own convenience  wheres his mother said i desiring to enlarge my sphere of natural history as much as possible  on a tué sa merethey have killed his mother was the reply cool enough  there we had the whole story his enterprising neighbors had invaded the domestic hearth shot his mother and eaten her up made her skin into chamois leather and were keeping him till he got big enough for the same disposition using his talents meanwhile to turn a penny upon yet not a word of all this thought he not a bit the less heartily did he caper never speculated a minute on why it was on the origin of evil or any thing of the sort or if he did at least never said a word about it i gave one good look into his soft round glassy eyes and could see nothing there but the most tranquil contentment he had finished his cabbage leaf and we had finished our call so we will go on  it was now drawing towards evening and the air began to be sensibly and piercingly cold one effect of this mountain air on myself is to bring on the most acute headache that i ever recollect to have felt still the increasing glory and magnificence of the scenery overcame bodily fatigue mont blanc and his army of whiterobed brethren rose before us in the distance glorious as the four and twenty elders around the great white throne the wonderful gradations of coloring in this alpine landscape are not among the least of its charms how can i describe it imagine yourself standing with me on this projecting rock overlooking a deep piny gorge through which flow the brawling waters of the arve on the other side of this rise mountains whose heaving swells of velvet green cliffs and dark pines are fully made out and colored behind this mountain rises another whose greens are softened and shaded and seem to be seen through a purplish veil behind that rises another of a decided cloudlike purple and in the next still the purple tint changes to rosy lilac while above all like another world up in the sky mingling its tints with the passing clouds sometimes obscured by them and then breaking out between them lie the glacier regions these glaciers in the setting sun look like rivers of light pouring down from the clouds such was the scene which i remember with perfect distinctness as enchaining my attention on one point of the road  we had now got up to the valley of chamouni i looked before me and saw lying in the lap of the green valley a gigantic pile of icy pillars which seen through the trees at first suggested the idea of a cascade  what is that said i to the guide  the glacier de boisson  i may as well stop here and explain to you once for all what a glacier is you see before you as in this case say thirty or forty mountain peaks and between these peaks what seem to you frozen rivers the snow from time to time melting and dripping down the sides of the mountain and congealing in the elevated hollows between the peaks forms a halffluid massa river of icewhich is called a glacier  as it lies upon the slanting surface and is not entirely solid throughout the whole mass is continually pushing with a gradual but imperceptible motion down into the valleys below  at a distance these glaciers as i have said before look like frozen rivers when one approaches nearer or where they press downward into the valley like this glacier de boisson they look like immense crystals and pillars of ice piled together in every conceivable form the effect of this pile of ice lying directly in the lap of green grass and flowers is quite singular the village of chamouni itself has nothing in particular to recommend it the buildings and every thing about it have a rough coarse appearance before we had entered the valley this evening the sun had gone down the sky behind the mountains was clear and it seemed for a few moments as if darkness was rapidly coming on on our right hand were black jagged furrowed walls of mountain and on our left mont blanc with his fields of glaciers and worlds of snow they seemed to hem us in and almost press us down but in a few moments commenced a scene of transfiguration more glorious than any thing i had witnessed yet the cold white dismal fields of ice gradually changed into hues of the most beautiful rose color a bank of white clouds which rested above the mountains kindled and glowed as if some spirit of light had entered into them you did not lose your idea of the dazzling spiritual whiteness of the snow yet you seemed to see it through a rosy veil the sharp edges of the glaciers and the hollows between the peaks reflected wavering tints of lilac and purple the effect was solemn and spiritual above every thing i have ever seen these words which had been often in my mind through the day and which occurred to me more often than any others while i was travelling through the alps came into my mind with a pomp and magnificence of meaning unknown beforefor by him were all things created in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things are by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things subsist  in this dazzling revelation i saw not that cold distant unfeeling fate or that crushing regularity of power and wisdom which was all the ancient greek or modern deist can behold in god but i beheld as it were crowned and glorified one who had loved with our loves and suffered with our sufferings those shining snows were as his garments on the mount of transfiguration and that serene and ineffable atmosphere of tenderness and beauty which seemed to change these dreary deserts into worlds of heavenly light was to me an image of the light shed by his eternal love on the sins and sorrows of time and the dread abyss of eternity     letter xxxiii  my dear  well i waked up this morning and the first thought was here i am in the valley of chamouni right under the shadow of mont blanc that i have studied about in childhood and found on the atlas i sprang up and ran to the window to see if it was really there where i left it last night yes true enough there it was right over our heads as it were blocking up our very existence filling our minds with its presence that colossal pyramid of dazzling snow its lower parts concealed by the roofs only the three rounded domes of the summit cut their forms with icy distinctness on the intense blue of the sky  on the evening before i had taken my last look at about nine oclock and had mentally resolved to go out before daybreak and repeat coleridges celebrated hymn but i advise any one who has any such liturgic designs to execute them over night for after a day of climbing one acquires an aptitude for sleep that interferes with early rising when i left last evening its countenance was filled with rosy light and they tell us that hours before it is daylight in the valley this mountain top breaks into brightness like that pillar of fire which enlightened the darkness of the israelites  i rejoice every hour that i am among these scenes in my familiarity with the language of the bible in it alone can i find vocabulary and images to express what this world of wonders excites mechanically i repeat to myself the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlasting but as straws chips and seaweed play in a thousand fantastic figures on the face of the ocean sometimes even concealing the solemn depths beneath so the prose of daily existence mixes itself up with the solemn poetry of life here as elsewhere  you must have a breakfast and then you cannot rush out and up mont blanc ad libitum you must go up in the regular appointed way with mule and guides this matter of guides is perfectly systematized here for the mountains being the great overpowering fact of life it follows that all that enterprise and talent which in other places develop themselves in various forms here take the single channel of climbing mountains in america if a man is a genius he strikes out a new way of cleaning cotton but in chamouni if he is a genius he finds a new way of going up mont blanc  as a sailor knows every timber rope and spar of his ship and seems to identify his existence with her so these guides their mountains the mountains are their calendar their book their newspaper their cabinet herbarium barometer their education and their livelihood  in fine behold us about eight oclock c s w little g and self in all the bustle of fitting out in the front of our hotel two guides balmat and alexandre lead two mules longeared slowfooted considerate brutes who have borne a thousand ladies over a thousand pokerish places and are ready to bear a thousand more equipped with lowbacked saddles they stand their noses down their eyes contemplatively closed their whole appearance impressing one with an air of practical talent and reliableness your mule is evidently safe and stupid as any conservative of any country you may be sure that no erratic fires no new influx of ideas will ever lead him to desert the good old paths and tumble you down precipices the harness they wear is so exceedingly ancient and has such a dilapidated appearance as if held together only by the merest accident that i could not but express a little alarm on mounting  those girthswont they break  o no no mademoiselle said the guides in fact they seem so delighted with their arrangements that i swallow my doubts in silence a third mule being added for the joint use of the gentlemen and all being equipped with ironpointed poles off we start in high spirits  a glorious day air clear as crystal sky with as fixed a blue as if it could not think a cloud guides congratulate us quil fait très beau we pass the lanes of the village our heads almost on a level with the flat stoneladen roofs our mules with their long rolling pace like the waves of the sea give to their riders a facetious wag of the body that is quite striking now the village is passed and see a road banded with green ribands of turf ss mule and guide pass on and head the party g rides another mule c and w leap along trying their alpenstocks stopping once in a while to admire the glaciers as their brilliant forms appear through the pines  here a discussion commences as to where we are going we had agreed among ourselves that we would visit the mer de glâce we fully meant to go there and had so told the guide on starting but it appears he had other views for us there is a regular way of seeing things orthodox and appointed and to get sight of any thing in the wrong way would be as bad as to get well without a scientific physician or any other irregular piece of proceeding  it appeared from the representations of the guide that to visit mer de glâce before we had seen la flégère would no more answer than for jacob to marry rachel before he had married leah determined not to yield as we were we somehow found ourselves vanquished by our guides arguments and soberly going off his way instead of ours doing exactly what we had resolved not to do however the point being yielded we proceeded merrily  as we had some way however to trot along the valley before we came to the ascending place i improved the opportunity to cultivate a little the acquaintance of my guide he was a tall spare man with black eyes black hair and features expressive of shrewdness energy and determination either from paralysis or some other cause he was subject to a spasmodic twitching of the features producing very much the effect that heat lightning does in the summer skyit seemed to flash over his face and be gone in a wink at first this looked to me very odd but so much do our ideas depend on association that after i had known him for some time i really thought that i liked him better with than i should without it it seemed to give originality to the expression of his face he was such a good fatherly man and took such excellent care of me and the mule and showed so much intelligence and dignity in his conversation that i could do no less than like him heat lightning and all  this valley of chamouni through which we are winding now is every where as flat as a parlor floor these valleys in the alps seem to have this peculiaritythey are not hollows bending downward in the middle and imperceptibly sloping upward into the mountains but they lie perfectly flat the mountains rise up around them like walls almost perpendicularly  voilà says my guide pointing to the left to a great bare ravine down there came an avalanche and knocked down those houses and killed several people  ah said i but dont avalanches generally come in the same places every year  generally they do  why do people build houses in the way of them said i  ah this was an unusual avalanche this one here  do the avalanches ever bring rocks with them  no not often nothing but snow  there says my guide pointing to an object about as big as a goodsized fly on the side of a distant mountain theres the auberge on la flégère where we are going  up there say i looking up apprehensively and querying in my mind how my estimable friend the mule is ever to get up there with me on his back  o yes says my guide cheerily and the road is up through that ravine  the ravine is a charming specimen of a road to be sure but no matteron we go  there says a guide those black rocks in the middle of that glacier on mont blanc are the grands mulets where travellers sleep going up mont blanc  we wind now among the pine tree still we come almost under the mer de glâce a most fairylike cascade falls down from under its pillars of ice over the dark rocksa cloud of feathery foamand then streams into the valley below  voilà larveiron says the guide  o is that the arveiron say i happy to make the acquaintance  but now we cross the arve into a grove of pines and direct our way to the ascent we begin to thread a zigzag path on the sides of the mountain  as mules are most determined followers of precedent every one keeps his nose close by the heels of his predecessor the delicate point therefore of the whole operation is keeping the first mule straight the first mule in our party who rejoiced in the name of rousse was selected to head the caravan perhaps because he had more native originality than most mules and was therefore better fitted to lead than to follow a troublesome beast was he from a habit of abstract meditation which was always liable to come on him in most inconvenient localities every now and then simply in accordance with his own sovereign will and pleasure and without consulting those behind him he would stop short and descend into himself in gloomy revery not that he seemed to have any thing in particular on his mindat least nothing of the sort escaped his lipsbut the idea would seem to strike him all of a sudden that he was an illused beast and that hed be hanged if he went another step now as his stopping stopped all the rest wheresoever they might happen to be it often occurred that we were detained in most critical localities just on the very verge of some tremendous precipice or up a rocky stairway in vain did the foremost driver admonish him by thumping his nose with a sharp stick and tugging and pulling upon the bridle rousse was gifted with one of those long india rubber necks that can stretch out indefinitely so that the utmost pulling and jerking only took his head along a little farther but left his heels planted exactly here they were before somewhat after this fashion his eyes meanwhile devoutly closed with an air of meekness overspreading his visage he might have stood as an emblem of conscientious obstinacy  illustration of two men trying to force forward a stubborn mule with a female rider  the fact is that in ascending these mountains there is just enough danger to make ones nerves a little unsteady not by any means as much as on board a rail car at home still it comes to you in a more demonstrable form here you are for instance on a precipice two thousand feet deep pine trees which when you passed them at the foot you saw were a hundred feet high have dwindled to the size of pins no barrier of any kind protects the dizzy edge and your mule is particularly conscientious to stand on the very verge no matter how wide the path may be now under such circumstances though your guide assures you that an accident or a person killed is a thing unknown you cannot help seeing that if the saddle should turn or the girths break or a bit of the crumbling edge cave awayall which things appear quite possibleall would be over with you yet i suppose we are no more really dependent upon gods providence in such circumstances than in many cases where we think ourselves most secure still the thrill of this sensation is not without its pleasure especially with such an image of almighty power and glory constantly before ones eyes as mont blanc our own littleness and helplessness in view of these vast objects which surround us give a strong and pathetic force to the words the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath thee are the everlasting arms  i like best these snowpure glaciers seen through these black pines there is something mysterious about them when you thus catch glimpses and see not the earthly base on which they rest i recollect the same fact in seeing the cataract of niagara through trees where merely the dizzying fall of water was visible with its foam and spray and rainbows it produced an idea of something supernatural  i forgot to say that at the foot of the mountain a party of girls started to ascend with us carrying along bottles of milk and small saucers full of mountain strawberries about half way up the ascent we halted by a spring of water which gushed from the side of the mountain and there we found the advantage of these arrangements the milk is very nice almost as rich as cream i think they told me it was goats milk the strawberries are very small indeed like our field strawberries but not as good one devours them with great relish simply because the keen air of the mountain disposes one to eat something and there is nothing better to be had they were hearty rosylooking girls cheerful and obliging wore the flat swiss hat and carried their knitting work along with them and knit whenever they could  when you asked them the price of their wares they always said au plaisir i e whatever you please but when we came to offer them money we found au plaisir meant so much at any rate and as much more as they could get  there were some children who straggled up with the party who offered us flowers and crystals au plaisir to about the same intent and purpose this cortége of people wanting to sell you something accompanies you every where in the alps the guides generally look upon it with complacency and in a quiet way favor it i suppose that the fact was these were neighbors and acquaintances and the mutual understanding was that they should help each other  it was about twelve oclock when we gained a bare board shanty as near the top of la flégère as it is possible to go on mules  it is rather a discouraging reflection that one should travel three or four hours to get to such a desolate place as these mountain tops generally are nothing but grass rocks and snow a shanty with a show case full of minerals articles of carved wood and engravings of the place for sale in these show cases the alps are brought to market as thoroughly as human ingenuity can do the thing the chamois figures largely there are pouches made of chamois skin walking sticks and alpenstocks tipped with chamois horn sometimes an entire skin horns and all hanging disconsolately downward then all manner of crystals such as are found in the rocks are served upagate pins rings seals bracelets cups and snuffboxesall which are duly urged on your attention so instead of falling into a rapture at the sight of mont blanc the regular routine for a yankee is to begin a bargain for a walking stick or a snuffbox  there is another curious fact and that is that every prospect loses by being made definite as long as we only see a thing by glimpses and imagine that there is a deal more that we do not see the mind is kept in a constant excitement and play but come to a point where you can fairly and squarely take in the whole and there your mind falls listless it is the greatest proof to me of the infinite nature of our minds that we almost instantly undervalue what we have thoroughly attained this sensation afflicted me for i had been reining in my enthusiasm for two days as rather premature and keeping myself in reserve for this ultimate display but now i stood there no longer seeing by glimpses no longer catching rapturous intimations as i turned angles of rock or glanced through windows of pinehere it was all spread out before me like a map not a cloud not a shadow to soften the outlinethere was mont blanc a great alabaster pyramid with a glacier running down each side of it there was the arve and there was the arveiron names most magical in song but now literal geographic realities  but in full possession of the whole my mind gave out like a rocket that will not go off at the critical moment i remember once after finishing a very circumstantial treatise on the nature of heaven being oppressed with a similar sensation of satietythat which hath not entered the heart of man to conceive must not be mapped out hence the wisdom of the dim indefinite imagery of the scriptures they give you no hard outline no definite limit occasionally they part as do the clouds around these mountains giving you flashes and gleams of something supernatural and splendid but never fully unveiling  but la flegerc is doubtless the best point for getting a statistically accurate idea of how the alps lie of any easily accessible to ladies this print you may regard more as a chart than as a picture  our guide pointed out every feature with praiseworthy accuracy midmost is mont blanc on the right the glacier de boisson two or three little black peaks in it are the sleepingplace for travellers ascendingthe zigzag line shows their path on the left of the mountain lies mer de glâce with the arveiron falling from it the arve crosses the valley below us the fall is not indicated in this view the undulations which on near view are fifty feet high seem mere ripples its purity is much soiled by the dust and debris which are constantly blown upon it making it look in some places more like mud than ice its soiled masses contrast with the dazzling whiteness of the upper regions just as human virtue exposed to the wind and dust of earth with the spotless purity of jesus  illustration of a long view of mountains with glacial valley in foreground

explanation of illustration  1 mont blanc 2 deme de goute 3 aiguille de goute 4 grand plateau 5 les grands mulets 6 glacier de tacconnaz 7 glacier de boisson 8 mer de glâce 9 montauvert  these mulets which at this distance appear like black points are needle cliffs rising in a desert of snow thus  illustration of narrow jagged dark rocks about 70 feet across at the base and rising to about 80 feet from the base  coming down i mentally compared mont blanc and niagara as one should compare two grand pictures in different styles of the same master both are of that class of things which mark eras in a minds history and open a new door which no man can shut of the two i think niagara is the most impressive perhaps because those aerial elements of foam and spray give that vague and dreamy indefiniteness of outline which seems essential in the sublime for this reason while niagara is equally impressive in the distance it does not lose on the nearest approachit is always mysterious and therefore stimulating those varying spray wreaths rising like ossians ghosts from its abyss those shimmering rainbows through whose veil you look those dizzying falls of water that seem like clouds poured from the hollow of gods hand and that mystic undertone of sound that seems to pervade the whole being as the voice of the almightyall these bewilder and enchant the discriminative and prosaic part of us and bring us into that cloudy region of ecstasy where the soul comes nearest to him whom no eye hath seen or can see i have sometimes asked myself if in the countless ages of the future the heirs of god shall ever be endowed by him with a creative power by which they shall bring into being things like these in this infancy of his existence man creates pictures statues cathedrals but when he is made ruler over many things will his father intrust to him the building and adorning of worlds the ruling of the glorious dazzling forces of nature  at the foot of the mountain we found again our company of strawberry girls with knitting work and goats milk lying in wait for us they knew we should be thirsty and hungry and wisely turned the circumstance to account some of our party would not buy of them because they said they were sharpers trying to get all they could out of people but if every body who tries to do this is to be called a sharper what is to become of respectable society i wonder  on the strength of this reflection i bought some more goats milk and strawberries and verily found them excellent for as shakspeare says how many things by season seasoned are  we returned to our hotel and after dining and taking a long nap i began to feel fresh once more for the air here acts like an elixir so that one is able to do twice as much as any where else s was too much overcome to go with us but the rest of us started with our guides once more at five oclock this time we were to visit the cascade des pèlérins which comes next on the orthodox list of places to be seen  it was a lovely afternoon the sun had got over the mont blanc side of the world and threw the broad cool shadow of the mountains quite across the valley what a curious kind of thing shadow isthat invisible veil falling so evenly and so lightly over all things bringing with it such thoughts of calmness of coolness and of rest i wonder the old greeks did not build temples to shadow and call her the sister of thought and peace the hebrew writers speak of the overshadowing of the almighty they call his protection the shadow of a great rock in a weary land even as the shadow of mont blanc falls like a sabbath across this valley so falls the sense of his presence across our weary liferoad  as we rode along under the sides of the mountain every thing seemed so beautiful so thoughtful and so calm all the goats and cows were in motion along the mountain paths each one tinkling his little bell and filling the rocks with gentle melodies you can trace the lines of these cattle paths running like threads all along the sides of the mountains we went in the same road that we had gone in the morning how different it seemed in the soberness of this afternoon light from its aspect under the clear crisp sharp light of morning  we pass again through the pine woods in the valley and cross the arve then up the mountain side to where a tiny cascade throws up its feathery spray in a brilliant jet deau every body knows even in our sober new england that mountain brooks are a frisky indiscreet set rattling chattering and capering in defiance of all law and order tumbling over precipices and picking themselves up at the bottom no whit wiser or more disposed to be tranquil than they were at the top in fact seeming to grow more mad and frolicsome with every leap well that is just the way brooks do here in the alps and the people taking advantage of it have built a little shanty where they show up the capers of this child of the mountain as if he tumbled for their special profit here of course in the shanty are the agates and the carved work and so forth and so on and you must buy something for a souvenir  i sat down on the rocks to take not a sketchfor who can sketch a mountain torrentbut to note down on paper a kind of diagram from which afterwards i might reconstruct an image of this feathery frisky son of kuhleborn  and while i was doing this little g seemed to be possessed by the spirit of the brook to caper down into the ravine with a series of leaps far safer for a waterfall than a boy i was thankful when i saw him safely at the bottom  after sketching a little while i rambled off to a point where i looked over towards mont blanc and got a most beautiful view of the glacier de boisson imagine the sky flushed with a rosy light a background of purple mountains with darts of sunlight streaming among them touching point and cliff with gold against this background rises the outline of the glacier like a mountain of the clearest white crystals tinged with blue and against their snowy whiteness in the foreground tall forms of pines i rejoiced in the picture with exceeding joy as long as the guide would let me but in all these places you have to cut short your raptures at the proper season or else what becomes of your supper  i went back to the cottage a rosycheeked girl had held our mules and set a chair for us to get off and now brings them up with au plaisir messieurs to the bearers of our purse half a dozen children had been waiting with the rose des alps which they wanted to sell us au plaisir but which we did not buy  these continual demands on the purse look very alarming only the coin you pay in is of such infinitesimal value that it takes about a pocket full to make a cent such a currency is always a sign of poverty  we had a charming ride down the mountain side in the glow of the twilight we passed through a whole flock of goats which the children were driving home one dear little sturdy savoyard looked so like a certain little charley at home that i felt quite a going forth of soul to him as we rode on i thought i would willingly live and die in such a place but i shall see a hundred such before we leave the alps     journalcontinued  thursday july 7 weather still celestial as yesterday but lo these frail tabernacles betray their earthliness h remarked at breakfast that all the tired of yesterday was piled up into today and s actually pleaded inability and determined to remain at the hotel  however the mer de glâce must be seen so at seven william georgy h and i set off when about half way or more up the mountain we crossed the track of the avalanches a strip or trail which looks from beneath like a mowers swath through a field of tall grass it is a clean path about fifty rods wide without trees with few rocks smooth and steep and with a bottom of ice covered with gravel  hurrah william said i lets have an avalanche  agreed said he theres a big rock  monsieur le guide monsieur le guide i shouted stop a moment h stop we want you to see our avalanche  no cried h i will not here you ask me to stop right on the edge of this precipice to see you roll down a stone  so on she ambled meanwhile william and i were already on foot and our mules were led on by the guides daughter a pretty little lass of ten or twelve who accompanied us in the capacity of mule driver  we found several stones of inferior size and sent them plunging down at last however we found one that weighed some two tons which happened to lie so that by loosening the earth before and under it with our alpenstocks we were able to dislodge it slowly reluctantly as if conscious of the awful race it was about to take the huge mass trembled slid poised and with a crunch and a groan went over at the first plunge it acquired a heavy revolving motion and was soon whirling and dashing down bounding into the air with prodigious leaps and cutting a white and flashing path into the icy way then first i began to realize the awful height at which we stood above the plain tracts which looked as though we could almost step across them were reached by this terrible stone moving with frightful velocity and bound after bound plunge after plunge it made and we held our breath to see each tract lengthen out as if seconds grew into minutes inches into rods and still the mass moved on and the microscopic way lengthened out till at last a curve hid its further progress from our view  what other cliffs we might have toppled over the muse refuses to tell for our faithful guide returned to say that it was not quite safe that there were always shepherds and flocks in the valley and that they might be injured so we remounted and soon overtook h at a fountain sketching a pine tree of special physiognomy  ah said i h how foolish you were you dont know what a sight you have lost  yes said she all c thinks mountains are made for is to roll stones down  and all h thinks trees made for said i is to have ugly pictures made of them  ay she replied you wanted me to stand on the very verge of the precipice and see two foolish boys roll down stones and perhaps make an avalanche of themselves now you know c i could not spare you first because i have not learned french enough yet and next because i dont know how to make change  add to that said i the damages to the bergers and flocks  yes she added no doubt when we get back to the inn we shall have a bill sent in h b s to a b dr to one shepherd and six cows fr  and so we chatted along until we reached the auberge and after resting a few moments descended into the frozen sea  here a scene opened upon us never to be forgotten from the distant gorge of the everlasting alpine ranges issued forth an ocean tide in wild and dashing commotion just as we have seen the waves upon the broad atlantic but all motionless as chaos when smitten by the mace of death and yet not motionless this denser medium this motionless mass is never at rest this flood moves as it seems to move these waves are actually uplifting out of the abyss as they seem to lift the only difference is in the time of motion the rate of change  these prodigious blocks of granite thirty or forty feet long and twenty feet thick which float on this grim sea of ice do float and are drifting drifting down to the valley below where in a few days they must arrive  we walked these valleys ascended these hills leaped across chasms threw stones down the crevasses plunged our alpenstocks into the deep baths of green water and philosophized and poetized till we were tired then we returned to the auberge and rode down the zigzag to our hotel     letter xxxiv  my dear  the mer de glâce is exactly opposite to la flégère where we were yesterday and is reached by the ascent of what is called montanvert or green mountain the path is much worse than the other and in some places makes ones nerves twinge especially that from which c projected his avalanche just think of his wanting to stop me on the edge of a little shelf over that frightful chasm and take away the guide from the head of my mule to help him get up avalanches  i warn you if ever you visit the alps that a travelling companion who has not the slightest idea what fear is will give you many a commotion for instance this mer de glâce is traversed every where by crevasses in the ice which go tonobody knows where down into the under worldgreat gaping bluegreen mouths of hades and c must needs jump across them and climb down into them to the mingled delight and apprehension of the guide who after conscientiously shouting out a reproof would say to me in a lower tone ah hes the man to climb mont blanc he would do well for that  the fact is nothing would suit our guides better this clear bright weather than to make up a party for the top of mont blanc they look longingly and lovingly up to its clear white fields they show us the stages and restingplaces and seem really to think that it is a waste of this beautiful weather not to be putting it to that most sublime purpose  why then do not we go up you say as to us ladies it is a thing that has been done by only two women since the world stood and those very different in their physique from any we are likely to raise in america unless we mend our manners very much these two were a peasant woman of chamouni called marie de mont blanc and mademoiselle henriette dangeville a lady whose acquaintance i made in geneva then as to the gentlemen it is a serious consideration in the first place that the affair costs about one hundred and fifty dollars apiece takes two days of time uses up a weeks strength all to get an experience of some very disagreeable sensations which could not afflict a man in any other case it is no wonder then that gentlemen look up to the mountain lay their hands on their pockets and say no  our guide by the way is the son or grandson of the very first man that ascended mont blanc and of course feels a sort of hereditary property and pride in it  c spoke about throwing our poles down the pools of water in the ice  there is something rather curious about these pools our guide saw us measuring the depth of one of them which was full of greenishblue water colored only by the refraction of the light he took our long alpenstock and poising it sent it down into the water as a man might throw a javelin it disappeared but in a few seconds leaped up at us out of the water as if thrown back again by an invisible hand  a poet would say that a water spirit hurled it back perhaps some old underground gnome just going to dinner had his windows smashed by it and sent it back with a becoming spirit as a gnome should  it was a sultry day and the sun was exercising his power over the whole ice field i sat down by a great ice block about fifty feet long to interrogate it and see what i could make of it by a cool confidential proximity and examination the ice was porous and spongy as i have seen it on the shores of the connecticut when beginning to thaw out under the influence of a spring sun i could see the little drops of water percolating in a thousand tiny streams through it and dropping down on every side putting my ear to it i could hear a fine musical trill and trickle and that still small click and stir as of melting ice which showed that it was surely and gradually giving way and flowing back again  drop by drop the cold iceberg was changing into a stream to flow down the sides of the valley no longer an image of coldness and death but bearing fertility and beauty on its tide and as i looked abroad over all the rifted field of ice i could see that the same change was gradually going on throughout in every blue ravine you can hear the clink of dropping water and those great defiant blocks of ice which seem frozen with uplifted warlike hands are all softening in that beneficent light and destined to pass away in that benignant change so let us hope that those institutions of pride and cruelty which are colder than the glacier and equally vast and hopeless in their apparent magnitude may yet like that be slowly and surely passing away like the silent warfare of the sun on the glacier is that overshadowing presence of jesus whose power so still yet so resistless is now being felt through all the moving earth  those defiant waves of deathcold ice might as well hope to conquer the calm silent sun as the old frozen institutions of human selfishness to resist the influence which he is now breathing through the human heart to liberate the captive to free the slave and to turn the ice of long winters into rivers of life for the new heaven and the new earth  all this we know is coming but we long to see it now and breathe forth our desires with the hebrew prophet o that thou wouldst rend the heavens that thou wouldst come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence  i had while upon this field of ice that strange feeling which often comes over one at the sight of a thing unusually beautiful and sublime of wanting in some way to appropriate and make it a part of myself i looked up the gorge and saw this frozen river lying cradled as it were in the arms of needlepeaked giants of amethystine rock their tops laced with flying silvery clouds the whole air seemed to be surcharged with tints ranging between the palest rose and the deepest violettints never without blue and never without red but varying in the degrees of the two it is this prismatic hue diffused over every object which gives one of the most noticeable characteristics of the alpine landscape  this sea of ice lies on an inclined plane and all the blocks have a general downward curve  i told you yesterday that the lower part of the glacier as seen from la flégère appeared covered with dirt i saw today the reason for this although it was a sultry day in july yet around the glacier a continual high wind was blowing whirling the dust and débris of the sides upon it some of the great masses of ice were so completely coated with sand as to appear at a distance like granite rocks the effect of some of these immense brown masses was very peculiar they seemed like an army of giants bending forward driven as by an invisible power down into the valley  it reminds one of such expressions as these in job  have the gates of death been open to thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death one should read that sublime poem in such scenes as these i remained on the ice as long as i could persuade the guides and party to remain  then we went back to the house where of course we looked at some wood work agates and all the et cetera  then we turned our steps downward we went along the side of the glacier and i desired to climb over as near as possible in order to see the source of the arveiron which is formed by the melting of this glacier its cradle is a ribbed and rocky cavern of blue ice and like a creature born full of vigor and immortality it begins life with an impetuous leap the cold arms of the glaciers cannot retain it it must go to the warm flowery velvet meadows below  the guide was quite anxious about me he seemed to consider a lady as something that must necessarily break in two or come apart like a german doll if not managed with extremest care and therefore to see one bounding through bushes leaping and springing and climbing over rocks at such a rate appeared to him the height of desperation  the good faithful soul wanted to keep me within orthodox limits and felt conscientiously bound to follow me wherever i went and to offer me his hand at every turn i considered on the whole that i ought not to blame him since guides hold themselves responsible for life and limb and any accident to those under their charge is fatal to their professional honor  going down i held some conversation with him on matters and things in general and life in chamouni in particular he inquired with great interest about america which throughout europe i find the working classes regard as a kind of star in the west portending something of good to themselves he had a son he said settled in america near st louis  and dont you want to go to america said i after hearing him praise the good land  ah no he said with a smile  why not said i it is a much easier country to live in  he gave a look at the circle of mountains around and said i love chamouni the good soul i was much of his opinion if i had been born within sight of glorious mont blanc with its apocalyptic clouds and store of visions not all the fat pork and flat prairies of indiana and ohio could tempt me no wonder the swiss die for their native valleys i would if i were they i asked him about education he said his children went to a school kept by catholic sisters who taught reading writing and latin the dialect of chamouni is a patois composed of french and latin he said that provision was very scarce in the winter i asked how they made their living when there were no travellers to be guided up mont blanc he had a trade at which he wrought in winter months and his wife did tailoring  i must not forget to say that the day before there had been some confidential passages between us which began by his expressing interrogatively the opinion that mademoiselle was a young lady he supposed when mademoiselle had assured him on the contrary that she was a venerable matron mother of a thriving family then followed a little comparison of notes as to numbers madame he ascertained to have six and he had four if my memory serves me as it generally does not in matters of figures so you see it is not merely among us new englanders that the unsophisticated spirit of curiosity exists as to ones neighbors indeed i take it to be a wholesome development of human nature in general for my part i could not think highly of any body who could be brought long into connection with another human being and feel no interest to inquire into his history and surroundings  as we stopped going down the descent to rest the mules i looked up above my head into the crags and saw a flock of goats browsing one goat in particular i remember had gained the top of a kind of table rock which stood apart from the rest and which was carpeted with lichens and green moss there he stood looking as unconscious and contemplative as possible the wicked fellow with his long beard he knew he looked picturesque and that is what he stood there for but as they say in new england he did it as natral as a pictur  by the by the girls with strawberries milk and knitting work were on hand on the way down and met us just where a cool spring gushed out at the roots of a pine tree and of course i bought some more milk and strawberries  how dreadfully hot it was when we got down to the bottom for there we had the long shadeless ride home with the burning lenses of the glaciers concentrated upon our defenceless heads i was past admiring any thing and glad enough for the shelter of a roof and a place to lie down  after dinner although the glacier de boisson had been spoken of as the appointed work for the afternoon yet we discovered as the psalm book says that    the force of nature could no farther go  illustration of an ice climbing party scaling a large serac  what is glacier de boisson or glacier any thing else to a person used up entirely with no sense or capability left for any thing but a general aching no the glacier de boisson was given up and i am sorry for it now because it is the commencement of the road up mont blanc and though i could not go to the top thereof i should like to have gone as far as i could in fact i should have been glad to sleep one night at the grands mulets however that was impossible  to look at the apparently smooth surface of the mountain side one would never think that the ascent could be a work of such difficulty and danger yet look at the picture of crossing a crevasse and compare the size of the figures with the dimensions of the blocks of ice madame dangeville told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this by ropes tied under her arms by the guides the depth of some of the crevasses may be conjectured from the fact stated by agassiz that the thickest parts of the glaciers are over one thousand feet in depth     journalcontinued  friday july 8chamouni to martigny by tête noir mules en avant we set off in a calèche after a two hours ride we came to those mules on to the pass of tête noir by paths the most awful as my mule trod within six inches of the verge i looked down into an abyss so deep that tallest pines looked like twigs yet on the opposite side of the pass i looked up the steep precipice to an equal height where giant trees seemed white fluttering fringe a dizzy sight we swept round an angle entered a dark tunnel blasted out through the solid rock emerged and saw before us on our right the farfamed tête noir a black ledge on whose face so high is the opposite cliff the sun never shines a few steps brought us to a hotel william and i rolled down some avalanches by way of getting an appetite while dinner was preparing  illustration of the rearing head and neck of a bridled mule  after dinner we commenced descending towards martigny alternately riding and walking here while i was on foot my mule took it into his head to run away i was never more surprised in my life than to see that staid solemn meditative melancholy beast suddenly perk up both his long ears thus and hop about over the steep paths like a goat not more surprised should i be to see some venerable d d of princeton leading off a dance in the jardin mabille we chased him here and chased him there we headed him and he headed us we said now i have you and he said no you dont until the affair began to grow comically serious il se moque de vous said the guide but at that moment i sprang and caught him by the bridle when presto down went his ears shut went the eyes and over the entire gay brute spread a visible veil of stolidity and down he plodded slunging shambling pivotting round zigzag corners as before in a style which any one that ever navigated such a craft down hill knows without further telling after that i was sure that the old fellow kept up a terrible thinking in spite of his stupid looks and knew a vast deal more than he chose to tell  illustration of a mules head lowered with ears flattened  at length we opened on the rhone valley and at seven we reached hotel de la tour at martigny here h and s managed to get up two flights of stone stairs and sank speechless and motionless upon their beds i must say they have exhibited spirit today or as mr c used to say pluck after settling with our guidesfine fellows whom we hated to losei ordered supper and sought new guides for our route to the convent our only difficulty in reaching there they say is the snow the guides were uncertain whether mules could get through so early in the season only to think today riding broilingly through hayfieldstomorrow stuck in snow drifts     letter xxxv  dear henry  you cannot think how beautiful are these alpine valleys our course all the first morning after we left chamouni lay beside a broad hearty joyous mountain torrent called perhaps from the darkness of its waters eau noire charming meadows skirted its banks all the way along i could think of nothing but bunyans meadows beside the river of life curiously adorned with lilies these were curiously adorned broidered and inwrought with flowers many and brilliant as those in a western prairie were i to undertake to describe them i might make an inventory as long as homers list of the ships there was the canterbury bell of our garden the white meadow sweet the blue and white campanula the tall slender harebell and a little shorttufted variety of the same which our guide tells me is called les clochettes or the little bellsfairies might ring them i thought then there are whole beds of the little blue forgetmenot and a white flower which much resembles it in form i also noticed hanging in the clefts of the rocks around tête noir the long golden tresses of the laburnum it has seemed to me when i have been travelling here as if every flower i ever saw in a garden met me some where in rocks or meadows  there is a strange unsatisfying pleasure about flowers which like all earthly pleasure is akin to pain what can you do with themyou want to do something but what take them all up and carry them with you you cannot do that get down and look at them what keep a whole caravan waiting for your observations that will never do well then pick and carry them along with you that is what in despair of any better resource i did my good old guide was infinite in patience stopping at every new exclamation point of mine plunging down rocks into the meadow land climbing to the points of great rocks and returning with his hands filled with flowers it seemed almost sacrilegious to tear away such fanciful creations that looked as if they were votive offerings on an altar or more likely living existences whose only conscious life was a continued exhalation of joy and praise  these flowers seemed to me to be earths raptures and aspirations her better momentsher lucid intervals like every thing else in our existence they are mysterious  in what mood of mind were they conceived by the great artist of what feelings of his are they the expressionspringing up out of the dust in these gigantic waste and desolate regions where one would think the sense of his almightiness might overpower the soul born in the track of the glacier and the avalanche they seem to say to us that this almighty being is very pitiful and of tender compassion that in his infinite soul there is an exquisite gentleness and love of the beautiful and that if we would be blessed his will to bless is infinite  the greatest men have always thought much of flowers luther always kept a flower in a glass on his writing table and when he was waging his great public controversy with eckius he kept a flower in his hand lord bacon has a beautiful passage about flowers as to shakspeare he is a perfect alpine valleyhe is full of flowers they spring and blossom and wave in every cleft of his mind witness the midsummer nights dream even milton cold serene and stately as he is breaks forth into exquisite gushes of tenderness and fancy when he marshals the flowers as in lycidas and comus  but all this while the sun has been withering the flowers the guide brought me how they look blue and white canterbury bells harebells clochettes all bedraggled and wilted like a young lady who has been up all night at a ball  no no say i to the guide dont pick me any more i dont want them the fact is if they are pretty i cannot help it i must even take it out in looking as i go by  one thing is evident he who made the world is no utilitarian no despiser of the fine arts and no condemner of ornament and those religionists who seek to restrain every thing within the limits of cold bare utility do not imitate our father in heaven  cannot a bonnet cover your head without the ribbon and the flowers say they yes and could not a peach tree bear peaches without a blossom what a waste is all this colored corolla of flowers as if the seed could not mature without them god could have created the fruit in good strong homely bushel baskets if he had been so disposed  turn off my eyes from beholding vanity says a good man when he sees a display of graceful ornament what then must he think of the almighty being all whose useful work is so overlaid with ornament there is not a flys leg nor an insects wing which is not polished and decorated to an extent that we should think positive extravagance in finishing up a childs dress and can we suppose that this being can take delight in dwellings and modes of life or forms of worship where every thing is reduced to cold naked utility i think not the instinct to adorn and beautify is from him it likens us to him and if rightly understood instead of being a siren to beguile our hearts away it will be the closest affiliating band  if this power of producing the beautiful has been always so fascinating that the human race for its sake have bowed down at the feet even of men deficient in moral worth if we cannot forbear loving the painter poet and sculptor how much more shall we love god who with all goodness has also all beauty  but all this while we have been riding on till we have passed the meadows and the fields and are coming into the dark and awful pass of the tête noir which c has described to you  one thing i noticed which he did not when we were winding along the narrow path bearing no more proportion to the dizzy heights above and below than the smallest insect creeping on the wall i looked across the chasm and saw a row of shepherds cottages perched midway on a narrow shelf that seemed in the distance not an inch wide by a very natural impulse i exclaimed what does become of the little children there i should think they would all fall over the precipice  my guide looked up benevolently at me as if he felt it his duty to quiet my fears and said in a soothing tone o no no no  of course i might have known that little children have their angels there as well as every where else when they have funerals there said he they are obliged to carry the dead along that road pointing to a road that resembled a thread drawn on the rocky wall  what a strange ideasuch a life and death it seemed to me that i could see a funeral train creeping along the monks with their black cloaks carrying tapers and singing psalms the whole procession together not larger in proportion than a swarm of black gnats and yet perhaps hearts there wrung with an infinite sorrow in that black moving point may be a soul whose convulsions and agonies cannot be measured or counted by any thing human so impossible is it to measure souls by space  what can they think of these creatures who are born in this strange place half way between heaven and earth to whom the sound of avalanches is a cradle hymn and who can never see the sun above the top of the cliff on either side till he really gets into the zenith  what they can be thinking of i cannot tell life i suppose is made up of the same prosaic material there that it is every where the mother thinks how she shall make her goats milk and black bread hold out the grandmother knits stockings and runs out to see if jaques or pierre have not tumbled over the precipice jaques and pierre in return tangle grandmothers yarn upset mothers milk bucket pull the goats beard tear their clothes to pieces on the bushes and rocks and in short commit incredible abominations daily just as children do every where  in the night how curiously this little nest of houses must look lighted up winking and blinking at the solitary traveller like some mysterious eyes looking out of a great eternity there they all are fast asleep pierre and jaques and grandmother and the goats in the night they hear a tremendous noise as if all nature was going to pieces they half wake open one eye say nothing but an avalanche and go to sleep again  this road through the pass of the tête noir used to be dangerous a very narrow bridlepath undefended by any screen whatever to have passed it in those old days would have had too much of the sublime to be quite agreeable to me the road as it is is wide enough i should think for three mules to go abreast and a tunnel has been blasted through what seemed the most difficult and dangerous point and a little beyond this tunnel is the hotel de la couronne  if any body wanted to stop in the wildest and lonesomest place he could find in the alps so as to be saturated with a sense of savageness and desolation i would recommend this hotel the chambers are reasonably comfortable and the beds of a good qualitya point which s and i tested experimentally soon after our arrival i thought i should like to stay there a week to be left there alone with nature and see what she would have to say to me  but two or three hours ride in the hot sun on a mules back indisposes one to make much of the grandest scenes insomuch that we were glad to go to sleep and on awaking we were glad to get some dinner such as it was  well after our dinner which consisted of a dish of fried potatoes and some fossiliferous bread such as prevails here at the small hotels in switzerland we proceeded onward after an intolerably hot ride for half an hour we began to ascend a mountain called the forclaz  there is something magnificent about going up these mountains appalling as it seems to ones nerves at particular turns and angles of the road where the mule stops you on the very brink of forever as one of the ladies said  well at last we reached the top and began to descend and there at our feet as if we were looking down at it out of a cloud lay the whole beautiful valley of the rhone i did not know then that this was one of the things put down in the guide book that we were expected to admire as i found afterwards it was but nothing that i saw any where through the alps impressed me as this did it seemed to me more like the vision of the land that is very far off than any thing earthly i can see it now just as distinctly as i saw it then one of these flat swiss valleys green as a velvet carpet studded with buildings and villages that looked like dots in the distance and embraced on all sides by these magnificent mountains of which those nearest in the prospect were distinctly made out with their rocks pine trees and foliage  the next in the receding distance were fainter and of a purplish green the next of a vivid purple the next lilac while far in the fading view the crystal summits and glaciers of the oberland alps rose like an exhalation  the afternoon sun was throwing its level beams in between these manycolored ranges and on one of them the ruins of an old roman tower stood picturesquely prominent the simplon road could be seen dividing the valley like an arrow  i had gone on quite ahead of my company and as my mule soberly paced downward in the almost perpendicular road i seemed to be poised so high above the enchanting scene that i had somewhat the same sensation as if i were flying i dont wonder that larks seem to get into such a rapture when they are high up in the air what a dreamlike beauty there is in distance disappearing ever as we approach  as i came down towards martigny into the pasture land of the great mountain it seemed to me that the scenery might pass for that of the delectable mountainssuch beautiful green shadowy hollows amid great clumps of chestnut and apple trees where people were making their hay which smelled so delightfully while cozy little swiss cottages stood in every nook  all were out in the fields men women and children and in one hayfield i saw the babys cradlebaby of course concealed from view under a small avalanche of a feather bed as the general fashion in these parts seems to be the women wore broad flat hats and all appeared to be working rather lazily as it was coming on evening  this place might have done for arcadia or utopia or any other of those places people think of when they want to get rid of what is and get into the region of what might be  i was very far before my party and now got off my mule and sat down on a log to wait till they came up then the drama enacted by cs mule took place which he has described to you i merely saw a distant commotion but did not enter into the merits of the case  as they were somewhat slow coming down i climbed over a log into a hayfield and plucked a long delicate whiteblossomed vine with which i garlanded the top of my flat hat  one is often reminded of a text of scripture in these valleyshe sendeth springs into the valleys which run among the hills  every where are these little lively murmuring brooks falling down the rocks prattling through the hayfields sociably gossiping with each other as they go  here comes the party and now we are going down into martigny how tired we were we had to ride quite through the town then through a long long row of trees to come to the hotel de la tour how delightful it seemed with its stone entries and staircases its bedrooms as inviting as cleanliness could make them the eating saloon opened on to a beautiful garden filled with roses in full bloom there were little tables set about under the trees for people to take their strawberries and cream or tea in the open air if they preferred it a very common and pleasant custom of continental hotels  a trim tidy young woman in a white cap with a bunch of keys at her girdle ushered us up two flights of stone stairs into a very clean nice apartment with white muslin window curtains now there is no feature of a room that speaks to the heart like white muslin window curtains they always shed light on the whole scene  after resting a while we were called down to a supper of strawberries and cream and nice little rolls with honey this honey you find at every hotel in switzerland as one of the inevitables of the breakfast or tea table  here we were to part from our chamouni guides and engage new ones to take us to st bernard i had become so fond of mine that it really went quite to my heart we had an affecting leavetaking in the dark stone entry at the foot of the staircase in the earnestness of my emotion i gave him all the change i had in my pocket to buy souvenirs for his little folks at home for you know i told you we had compared notes on sundry domestic points i really flattered myself that i was doing something quite liberal but this deceitful swiss coin i found when i came to tell c about it that the whole stock only amounted to about twenty cents like a great many things in this world it looked more than it was the good man however seemed as grateful as if i had done something wished all sorts of happiness to me and my children and so we parted peace go with him in his chamouni cottage     journalcontinued  saturday july 9 rose in a blaze of glory rode five mortal hours in a charàbanc sweltering under a burning sun but in less than ten minutes after we mounted the mules and struck into the gorge the ladies muffled themselves in thick shawls we seemed to have passed almost in a moment from the tropics into the frigid zone a fur cloak was suggested to me but as it happened i was adequately calorified without chancing to be the last in the file my mule suddenly stopped to eat  allez allez said i twitching the bridle  i wont said he as plainly as ears and legs could speak  allez thundered i jumping off and bestowing a kick upon his ribs which made me suffer if it did not him  i wont said he stuffily  wont you said i pursuing the same line of inductive argument with rhetorical flourishes of the bridle  never he replied again most mulishly  then if words and kicks wont do said i let us see what virtue there is in stones and suiting the action to the word i showered him with fragments of granite as from a catapult at every concussion he jumped and kicked but kept his nose in the same relative position i redoubled the logical admonition he jumped the more perceptibly finally after an unusually affecting appeal from a piece of granite he fairly budged and i seized the bridle to mount  not at all said he wheeling round to his first position like a true proslavery demagogue  ah said i and went over the same line of argument in a more solid and convincing manner at length the salutary impression seemed permanently fastened on his mind he fairly gave in and i rode on in triumph to overtake the partyhaving no need of a fur coat  horeb sinai and hor what a wilderness what a sudden change nothing but savage awful precipices of naked granite snowy fields and verdureless wastes in every other place in the alps we have looked upon the snow in the remote distance to be dazzled with its sheeny effulgenceourselves meanwhile in the region of verdure and warmth here we march through a horrid desertnot a leaf not a blade of grassover the deep drifts of snow and we find our admiration turns to horror and this is the road that hannibal trod and charlemagne and napoleon they were fit conquerors of rome who could vanquish the sterner despotism of eternal winter  after an hours perilous climbing we reached at last the hospice and in five minutes were sitting at the supper table by a good blazing fire with a lively company chatting with a gentlemanly abbé discussing figs and fun cracking filberts and jokes and regaling ourselves genially but ever and anon drawing with a half shiver a little closer to the roaring fagots in the chimney i thought to myself and this is our midsummer nights dream     letter xxxvi  dear  during breakfast we were discussing whether we could get through the snow to mont st bernard some thought we could and some thought not so it goes here we are gasping and sweltering one hour and plunging through snow banks the next  after breakfast we entered the charàbanc a crablike sideway carriage and were soon on our way our path was cut from the breast of the mountain in a stifling gorge where walls of rock on both sides served as double reflectors to concentrate the heat of the sun on our hapless heads to be sure there was a fine foaming stream at the bottom of the pass and ever so much fine scenery if we could have seen it but our chars opened but one way and that against the perpendicular rock close enough almost to blister our faces and the sun beat in so on our backs that we were obliged to have the curtain down thus we were as uncognizant of the scenery we passed through as if we had been nailed up in a box nothing but the consideration that we were travelling for pleasure could for a moment have reconciled us to such inconveniences as it was i occasionally called out to c in the back carriage to be sure and take good care of the fur coat which always brought shouts of laughter from the whole party the idea of a fur coat seemed so supremely ridiculous to us there was no making us believe we ever should or could want it  that was the most unpleasant days ride i had in the alps we stopped to take dinner in the little wretched village of liddes you have no idea what a disagreeable unsavory concern one of these villages is houses none of which look much better than the log barns in our western states set close together on either side of a street paved with round stones coarse sunburnt women with their necks enlarged by the goitre and dirty children with tangled hair and the same disgusting diseasethese were the principal features of the scene  this goitre prevails so extensively in this region that you seldom see a person with the neck in a healthy condition the worst of the matter is that in many cases of children it induces idiocy cases of this kind were so frequent that after a while whenever i met a child i began to search in its face for indications of the approach of this disease  they are called cretins in many cases the whole head appears swelled and deformed as usual every one you look at puts out the hand to beg the tavern where we stopped to dine seemed more like a great barn or cavern than any thing else we go groping along perfectly dark stone passages stumbling up a stone staircase and gaining light only when the door of a kind of reception room opens upon usa long roughlooking room without any carpet furnished with a table and some chairs and a rude sofa we were shown to a bed room carpetless but tolerably clean with a very high feather bed in each corner under a canopy of white curtains  after dinner we went on towards st pierre a miserable hamlet where the mules were taken out of the chars and we prepared to mount them  it was between three and four oclock our path lay up a desolate mountain gorge after we had ascended some way the cold became intense the mountain torrent by the side of which we went up leaped and tumbled under ribs of ice and through banks of snow  i noticed on either side of the defile that there were high posts put up on the rocks and a cord stretched from one to the other the object of these my guide told me was to show the path when this whole ravine is filled up with deep snow  i could not help thinking how horrible it must be to go up here in the winter  our path sometimes came so near to the torrent as to suggest uncomfortable ideas  in one place it swept round the point of a rock which projected into the foaming flood so that it was completely under water i stopped a little before i came to this and told the guide i wanted to get down he was all accommodation and lifted me from my saddle and then stood to see what i would do next when i made him understand that i meant to walk round the point he very earnestly insisted that i should get back to the saddle again and was so positive that i had only to obey it was well i did so for the mule went round safely enough and could afford to go up to his ankles in water better than i could  as we neared the hospice i began to feel the effects of the rarefied air very sensibly it made me dizzy and sick bringing on a most acute headachea sharp knifelike pain s was still more affected  i was glad enough when the old building came in view though the road lay up an ascent of snow almost perpendicular  at the foot of this ascent we paused our guides who looked a little puzzled held a few moments conversation in which the word fonce was particularly prominent a word which i took to be equivalent to our english slump and indeed the place was suggestive of the idea the snow had so far melted and softened under the influence of the july sun that something of this kind in going up the ascent seemed exceedingly probable the man stood leaning on his alpenstock looking at the thing to be demonstrated there were two paths both equally steep and snowy at last he gathered up the bridle and started up the most direct way the mule did not like it at all evidently and expressed his disgust by occasionally stopping short and snuffing meaning probably to intimate that he considered the whole thing a humbug and that in his opinion we should all slump through together and go tonobody knows where at last when we were almost up the ascent he did slump and went up to his breast in the snow whereat the guide pulled me out of the saddle with one hand and pulled him out of the hole with the other in a minute he had me into the saddle again and after a few moments more we were up the ascent and drawing near the hospicea great square strong stone building standing alone among rocks and snowbanks  as we drove up nearer i saw the little porch in front of it crowded with gentlemen smoking cigars and gazing on our approach just as any set of loafers do from the porch of a fashionable hotel this was quite a new idea of the matter to me we had been flattering ourselves on performing an incredible adventure and lo and behold all the world were there waiting for us  illustration of a large multistory hospice and other buildings in a remotelooking mountain valley a river flows in the foreground  we came up to the steps and i was so crippled with fatigue and so dizzy and sick with the thin air that i hardly knew what i was doing we entered a lowbrowed dark arched stone passage smelling dismally of antiquity and dogs when a brisk voice accosted me in the very choicest of french and in terms of welcome as gay and courtly as if we were entering a salon  keys clashed and we went up stone staircases our entertainer talking volubly all the way as for me all the french i ever knew was buried under an avalanche c had to make answer for me that madame was very unwell which brought forth another stream of condolence as we came into a supper room lighted by a wood fire at one end the long table was stretched out on which they were placing supper here i had light enough to perceive that our entertainer was a young man of a lively intelligent countenance in the augustine monks dress viz a long black camlet frock with a kind of white band over it which looks much like a pair of suspenders worn on the outside he spoke french very purely and had all that warm cordiality and graceful vivacity of manner which seems to be peculiar to the french he appeared to pity us very much and was full of offers of assistance and when he heard that i had a bad headache insisted on having some tea made for me the only drink on the table being wine the supper consisted of codfish stewed apples bread filberts and raisins immediately after we were shown up stone staircases and along stone passages to our rooms of which the most inviting feature was two high single beds covered with white spreads the windows of the rooms were so narrow as to seem only like loopholes there was a looking glass table chair and some glazed prints  a good old woman came to see if we wanted any thing i thought as i stretched myself in the bed with feathers under me and feathers over me what a heaven of rest this place must have seemed to poor travellers benighted and perishing in the snow in the morning i looked out of my loophole on the tall grim rocks and a small lake frozen and covered with snow is this lake always frozen said i to the old serving woman who had come to bring us hot water for washing  sometimes says she about the latter part of august it is thawed  i suppose it thaws the last of august and freezes the first of september  after dressing ourselves we crept down stairs in hopes of finding the fire which we left the night before in the sitting room no such thing the sun was shining and it was what was called a warm day that is to say a day when a little thaw trickles down the south side of snow banks so the fire was out and the windows up and our gay augustine friend coming in congratulated us on our charming day  the fireplace was piled up with wood and kindlings ready to be lighted in the evening but being made to understand that it was a very sultry day we could not of course suggest such an extravagance as igniting the tempting pilean extravagance because every stick of wood has to be brought on the backs of mules from the valleys below at a very great expense of time and money  the same is true of provisions of all sorts and fodder for cattle  well after breakfast i went to the front porch to view the prospect and what did i see there banks of dirty halfmelted snow bones and scraps of offal patches of bare earth for a small space say about fifty feet round and then the whole region shut in by barren inaccessible rocks which cut off all view in every direction  along by the frozen lake there is a kind of causeway path made for a promenade where one might walk to observe the beauties of the season and our cheery entertainer offered to show it to us so we walked out with him under the rocks in one place he showed us a little plat about as large as a closet door which he said laughing was their garden  i asked him if any thing ever really grew there he shrugged his shoulders and said sometimes  we pursued this walk till we came to the end of the lake and there he showed me a stone pillar  there said he beyond that pillar is italy  well said i i believe i shall take a trip into italy so as he turned back to go to the house w and i continued on we went some way into italy down the ravine and i can assure you i was not particularly struck with the country  i observed no indications of that superiority in the fine arts or of that genial climate and soil of which i had heard so much w and i agreed to give ourselves airs on this subject whenever the matter of italy was introduced and to declare that we had been there and had seen none of the things of which people write in books  what a perfectly dismal comfortless place said i but climbing up the rocks to rest me in a sunny place i discovered that they were all enamelled with the most brilliant flowers  illustration of a cluster of small fivepetaled flowers with blunt tips growing very close to the ground  in particular i remarked beds of velvet moss which bore a pink blossom in form somewhat like this then there was a kind of low starry gentian of a bright metallic blue i tried to paint it afterwards but neither ultramarine nor any color i could find would represent its brilliancy it was a kind of living brightness i examined the petals to see how this effect was produced and it seemed to be by a kind of prismatic arrangement of the small round particles of which they were composed the shape of the flower was somewhat like this  illustration of a cluster of small five petaled flowers with sharp points growing on short stalks near the ground  i spread down my pocket handkerchief and proceeded to see how many varieties i could gather and in a very small circle w and i collected eighteen could i have thought when i looked from my window over this bleak region that any thing so perfectly lovely as this little purple witch for example was to be found there it was quite a significant fact there is no condition of life probably so dreary that a lowly and patient seeker cannot find its flowers  illustration of a clump of a small flowering plant attached to what appears to be its rhizome  i began to think that i might be contented even there but while i was looking i was so sickened by headache and disagreeable feelings arising from the air that i often had to lie down on the sunny side of the bank w i found was similarly troubled he said he really thought in the morning he was going to have a fever we went back to the house there were services in the chapel i could hear the organ pealing and the singers responding  seven great dogs were sunning themselves on the porch and as i knew it was a subject particularly interesting to you i made minute inquiries respecting them like many other things they have been much overstated i think by travellers they are of a tawnyyellow color short haired broad chested and strong limbed as to size i have seen much larger newfoundland dogs in boston i made one of them open his mouth and can assure you it was black as night a fact which would seem to imply newfoundland blood in fact the breed originally from spain is supposed to be a cross between the pyrenean and the newfoundland the biggest of them was called pluto here is his likeness which w sketched  illustration of a large lightcolored dog with mediumshort fur at rest and wearing a broad patterned collar  for my part i was a little uneasy among them as they went walloping and frisking around me flouncing and rolling over each other on the stone floor and making every now and then the most hideous noises that it ever came into a dogs head to conceive  as i saw them biting each other in their clumsy frolics i began to be afraid lest they should take it into their heads to treat me like one of the family and so stood ready to run  the man who showed them wished to know if i should like to see some puppies to which in the ardor of natural history i assented so he opened the door of a little stone closet and sure enough there lay madam in state with four little blind snubbednosed pledges as the man picked up one of these and held it up before me in all the helplessness of infancy looking for all the world like a rolypoly pudding with a short tail to it i could not help querying in my mind are you going to be a st bernard dog  one of the large dogs seeing the door open thought now was a good time to examine the premises and so walked briskly into the kennel but was received by the amiable mother with such a sniff of the nose as sent him howling back into the passage apparently a much wiser and better dog than he had been before their principal use is to find paths in the deep snow when the fathers go out to look for travellers as they always do in stormy weather they are not longlived neither man nor animal can stand the severe temperature and the thin air for a long time many of the dogs die from diseases of the lungs and rheumatism besides those killed by accidents such as the falling of avalanches c a little while ago so many died that they were fearful of losing the breed altogether and were obliged to recruit by sending down into the valleys for some they had given away one of the monks told us that when they went out after the dogs in the winter storms all they could see of them was their tails moving along through the snow the monks themselves can stand the climate but a short time and then they are obliged to go down and live in the valleys below while others take their places  they told us that there were over a hundred people in the hospice when we were there they were mostly poor peasants and some beggars one poor man came up to me and uncovered his neck which was a most disgusting sight swollen with goitre i shut my eyes and turned another way like a bad christian while our augustine friend walked up to him spoke in a soothing tone and called him my son he seemed very loving and gentle to all the poor dirty people by whom we were surrounded  i went into the chapel to look at the pictures there was st bernard standing in the midst of a desolate snowy waste with a little child on one arm and a great dog beside him  this st bernard it seems was a man of noble family who lived nine hundred and sixtytwo years after christ almost up to that time a temple to jupiter continued standing on this spot it is said that the founding of this institution finally rooted out the idolatrous worship  on monday we returned to martigny and obtained a voiture for villeneuve drove through the beautiful rhone valley past the celebrated fall of the pissevache and about five oclock reached the hotel byron on the shore of the lake     letter xxxvii  hotel byron  my dear  here i am sitting at my window overlooking lake leman castle chillon with its old conical towers is silently pictured in the still waters it has been a day of a thousand we took a boat with two oarsmen and passed leisurely along the shores under the cool drooping branches of trees to the castle which is scarce a stones throw from the hotel we rowed along close under the walls to the ancient moat and drawbridge there i picked a bunch of blue bells les clochettes which were hanging their aerial pendants from every crevicesome blue some white  illustration of blue bell flowers with sharpbladed leaves  i know not why the old buildings and walls in europe have this vivacious habit of shooting out little flowery ejaculations and soliloquies at every turn one sees it along through france and switzerland every where but never that i remember in america  on the side of the castle wall in a large white heart is painted the inscription liberté et patrie  we rowed along almost touching the castle rock where the wall ascends perpendicularly and the water is said to be a thousand feet deep we passed the loopholes that illuminate the dungeon vaults and an old arch now walled up where prisoners after having been strangled were thrown into the lake  last evening we walked over the castle an interesting swiss woman who has taught herself english for the benefit of her visitors was our cicerone she seemed to have all the old swiss vivacity of attachment for liberté et patrie  illustration of a interior space of hewn stone with high vaulted gothic arches  she took us first into the dungeon with the seven pillars described by byron there was the pillar to which for protecting the liberty of geneva bonnevard was chained there the duke of savoy kept him for six years confined by a chain four feet long he could take only three steps and the stone floor is deeply worn by the prints of those weary steps six years is so easily said but to live them alone helpless a man burning with all the fires of manhood chained to that pillar of stone and those three unvarying steps two thousand one hundred and ninety days rose and set the sun while seedtime and harvest winter and summer and the whole living world went on over his grave for him no sun no moon no star no business no friendship no plansnothing the great millstone of life emptily grinding itself away  what a power of vitality was there in bonnevard that he did not sink in lethargy and forget himself to stone but he did not it is said that when the victorious swiss army broke in to liberate him they cried  bonnevard you are free  et genève  geneva is free also  you ought to have heard the enthusiasm with which our guide told this story  near by are the relics of the cell of a companion of bonnevard who made an ineffectual attempt to liberate him on the wall are still seen sketches of saints and inscriptions by his hand this man one day overcame his jailer locked him in his cell ran into the hall above and threw himself from a window into the lake struck a rock and was killed instantly one of the pillars in this vault is covered with names i think it is bonnevards pillar there are the names of byron hunt schiller and many other celebrities  after we left the dungeons we went up into the judgment hall where prisoners were tried and then into the torture chamber here are the pulleys by which limbs were broken the beam all scorched with the irons by which feet were burned the oven where the irons were heated and there was the stone where they were sometimes laid to be strangled after the torture on that stone our guide told us two thousand jews men women and children had been put to death there was also high up a strong beam across where criminals were hung and a door now walled up by which they were thrown into the lake i shivered twas cruel she said twas almost as cruel as your slavery in america  then she took us into a tower where was the oubliette here the unfortunate prisoner was made to kneel before an image of the virgin while the treacherous floor falling beneath him precipitated him into a well forty feet deep where he was left to die of broken limbs and starvation below this well was still another pit filled with knives into which when they were disposed to a merciful hastening of the torture they let him fall the woman has been herself to the bottom of the first dungeon and found there bones of victims the second pit is now walled up  all this she said was done for the glory of god in the good old times  the glory of god what has not been done in that name yet he keeps silence patient he watches the agelong fever of this world the delirious night shall have a morning ah there is an unsounded depth in that word which says he is longsuffering this it must be at which angels veil their faces  on leaving the castle we offered the woman the customary gratuity no she would have the pleasure of showing it to me as a friend and she ran into a charming little garden full of flowers and brought me a bouquet of lilies and roses which i have had in my room all day  tonight after sunset we rowed to byrons little isle the only one in the lake o the unutterable beauty of these mountainsgreat purple waves as if they had been dashed up by a mighty tempest crested with snowlike foam this purple sky and crescent moon and the lake gleaming and shimmering and twinkling stars while far off up the sides of a snowtopped mountain a light shines like a star some mountaineers candle i suppose  in the dark stillness we rowed again over to chillon and paused under its walls the frogs were croaking in the moat and we lay rocking on the wave and watching the dusky outlines of the towers and turrets then the spirit of the scene seemed to wrap me round like a cloak  back to geneva again this lovely place will ever leave its image on my heart mountains embrace it strength and beauty are its habitation the salève is a peculiar looking mountain striped with different strata of rock which have a singular effect in the hazy distance so is the mole with its dark marked outline looking blacker in clear weather from being set against the snow mountains beyond  there is one peculiarity about the outline of mont blanc as seen from geneva which is quite striking there is in certain positions the profile of a gigantic head visible lying with face upturned to the sky mrs f was the first to point it out to me calling it a head of napoleon like many of these fanciful profiles i was some time in learning to see it and after that it became to me so plain that i wondered i had not seen it before i called it not napoleon however but as it gained on my imagination lying there so motionless cold and still i thought of prometheus on mount caucasus it seemed as if his sorrows ended he had sunk at last to a dreamless sleep on that snowy summit this sketch may perhaps give you some faint idea of how such an outline might be formed in ones imagination  illustration of mont blanc in the distance  we walked out the other evening with m fazy to a beautiful place where servetus was burned soft newmown meadow grass carpets it and a solemn amphitheatre of mountains glowing in the evening sky looked downmont blanc the blueblack mole the saleve never was deed done in a more august presence chamber ere this these two may have conferred together of the tragedy with far other thoughts than then  the world is always unjust to its progressive men if one fragment of past absurdity cleaves to them they celebrate the absurdity as a personal peculiarity hence we hear so much of luthers controversial harshness of calvins burning servetus and of the witch persecutions of new england  luther was the poet of the reformation and calvin its philosopher luther fused the mass calvin crystallized he who fuses makes the most sensation in his day he who crystallizes has a longer and wider power calvinism in its essential features never will cease from the earth because the great fundamental facts of nature are calvinistic and men with strong minds and wills always discover it the predestination of a sovereign will is written over all things the old greek tragedians read it and expressed it so did mahomet napoleon cromwell why they found it so by their own experience they tried the forces of nature enough to find their strength the strong swimmer who breasts the rhone is certain of its current but ranke well said that in those days when the whole earth was in arms against these reformers they had no refuge except in exalting gods sovereignty above all other causes to him who strives in vain with the giant forces of evil what calm in the thought of an overpowering will so that will be crowned by goodness however grim to the distrusting looks this fortress of sovereignty in times of flowery ease yet in times when the waters roar and are troubled and the mountains shake with the swelling thereof it has been always the refuge of gods people all this i say while i fully sympathize with the causes which incline many fine and beautiful minds against the system  the wife of de wette has twice called upon mea good plain motherly pious old lady as any in andover she wanted me to visit her daughter who being recently deprived of her only little girl has since been wholly lost to life the only thing in which she expressed any interest was uncle toms cabin and she was earnestly desiring to see me so i went i found mrs de wette in a charming saloon looking out upon the botanic gardens a very beautiful picture of a young lady hung on the wall that was my poor clara said mrs de wette but she is so altered now  after a while clara came in and i was charmed at a glancea most lovely creature in deep mourning with beautiful manners so much interested for the poor slaves so full of feeling inquiring so anxiously what she could do for them  do ministers ever hold slaves she said  0 yes many  0 but how can they be christians  they reason in this way said i they say these people are not fit to take care of themselves therefore we must hold them and educate them till they are fit to be free  i wish said she looking very pretty and fierce that they might all be sold themselves and see how they would like it  her husband who speaks only french now asked what we were talking about and she repeated the conversation  i would shoot every one of them said he with a significant movement  now see said mrs de wette clara would sell them and her husband would shoot them for my part i would rather convert them we all laughed at this sally  ah said clara the last thing my little darling looked at was the pictures in uncle tom when she came to the death of eva she said now i am weary i will go to sleep and so closed her eyes and never opened them more  clara said she had met the key in turin and milan the cabin is made a school reading book in sardinia for those who wish to learn english with explanatory notes in italian the feeling here on the continent for the slave is no less earnest than in england and scotland i have received most beautiful and feeling letters from many christians of switzerland which i will show you  i am grieved to say that there are american propagandists of slavery here who seem to feel it incumbent on them to recognize this hideous excrescence as a national peculiarity and to consider any reflection upon it on the part of the libertyloving swiss as an insult to the american nation the sophisms by which slaveholding has been justified from the bible have left their slimy track even here alas is it thus america fulfils her high destiny must she send missionaries abroad to preach despotism  walking the other evening with m fazy who is of course french in education we talked of our english literature he had hamlet in frenchjust think of it one never feels the national difference so much as in thinking of shakspeare in french madame de stael says of translation that music written for one instrument cannot be played upon another i asked if he had read milton  yes  and how did you like him  0 with a kind of shiver he is so cold  now i felt that the delicate probe of the french mind had dissected out a shade of feeling of which i had often been conscious there is a coldness about all the luscious exuberance of milton like the wind that blows from the glaciers across these flowery valleys how serene his angels in their adamantine virtue yet what sinning suffering soul could find sympathy in them the utter want of sympathy for the fallen angels in the whole celestial circle is shocking satan is the only one who weeps    for millions of spirits for his fault amerced    and from eternal splendors flung  god does not care nor his angels ah quite otherwise is god revealed in him who wept over jerusalem and is touched with the feeling of our infirmities  i went with mrs fazy the other night to call on mrs cs friend pastor c they were so affectionate so full of beautiful kindness the french language sounds sweetly as a language of affection and sympathy with all its tart vivacity it has a richness in the gentler world of feeling then in the evening i was with a little circle of friends at the house of the sister of merle daubigne and they prayed and sang together it was beautiful the hymn was one on the following of jesus similar to that german one of old godfrey arnold which is your favorite these christians speak with deep sorrow of our slavery it grieves it distresses them for the american church has been to them a beloved object they have leaned towards it as a vine inclines towards a vigorous elm to them it looks incomprehensible that such a thing could gain strength in a free christian republic  i feel really sorry that i have had to withdraw so much from proffered kindness here and to seem unwilling to meet feeling but so it has been yet to me apparently so cold many of these kind genevese have shown most considerate attention fruit and flowers have been sent in anonymously and one gentleman offered to place his garden at my disposal for walks adding that if i wished to be entirely private neither he nor his family would walk there this i thought was too much kindness  one social custom here is new to me the husband by marriage takes the wifes name thus m fazy our host is known as m fazy meyer meyer being his wifes namea thing which at first perplexed me i was often much puzzled about names owing to this circumstance  from the conversation i hear i should think that democracy was not entirely absolute in switzerland i hear much about patrician families particularly at berne and these are said to be quite exclusive yet that the old swiss fire still burns in switzerland i see many indications  the other day i visited beauttes celebrated watch and jewelry store and saw all the process of making watches from the time the case is cut from a sheet of gold on through the enamelling engraving and finishing enamel is metallic paint burned on in a furnace many women are employed in painting the designs the workmen looked intelligent and thoughtful like men who can both think and do some glimpses showed their sympathy with republicanismas one should see fire through a closed door  i have had full reason to observe that difference between protestant and catholic cantons on which horace greeley commented while here they are as different as our slave and free states and in the same ways geneva seems like new englandthe country around is well cultivated and speaks of thrift but still i find no land however beautiful that can compare with homeandover hill with its arched elms its blue distance pointing with spires its merrimac crowned with labor palaces and above all an old stone house brown and queer c good by     journalcontinued  thursday july 14 spent a social evening at mrs la vs on the lake shore mont blanc invisible we met m merle daubigne brother of our hostess and a few other friends returned home and listened to a serenade to h from a glee club of fifty performers of the working men of geneva the songs were mostly in french and the burden of one of them seemed to be in words like these    travaillons travaillez    pour la liberte  friday july 15 mrs c and her two daughters are here from paris they intend to come to madame fazy till we leave  saturday july 16 our whole company resorted to the lake and spent the forenoon on its tranquil waters if this life seem idle we remember that there must be valleys between mountains and as in those vales tired mountaineers love to rest so we by the silver shore of summer leman while away the quiet hours in this interval between great mountain epochs chamouni and oberland  monday july 18 weather suspicious stowed ourselves and our baggage into our voiture and bade adieu to our friends and to geneva ah how regretfully from the marketplace we carried away a basket of cherries and fruit as a consolation dined at lausanne and visited the cathedral and picture gallery where was an exquisite eva slept at meudon  tuesday july 19 rode through payerne to freyburg stopped at the zahringer hofmost romantic of inns our gentlemanly host ushered us forth upon a terrace overhanging the deep gorge of the saärine spanned to the right and left of us by two immense suspension bridges one of which seemed to spring from the hotel itself ruins of ancient walls and watch towers lined the precipice  after dinner we visited the cathedral to hear the celebrated organ the organist performed a piece descriptive of a storm we resigned ourselves to the illusion low mysterious wailings swelling dying away in the distance seeming at first exceedingly remote drew gradually near fitful sighings and sobbings rose as of gusts of wind then low smothered roarings anon came flashes of lightning rattling hail and driving rain succeeded by bursts of storm and howlings of a hurricanefierce furious frightful i felt myself lost in a snow storm in winter on the pass of great st bernard  one note there was of strange terrible clangorbleak dark yet of a lurid firethat seemed to prolong itself through all the uproar like a note of doom cutting its way to the heart as the call of the last archangel yes i felt myself alone lost in a boundless desert beyond the abodes of man and this was a call of terrorstern savage gloomythe call as of fixed fate and absolute despair  then the storm died away in faint and faroff murmurs and we broke as it were from the trance to find ourselves not lost but here among the living we then drove quietly to berne  wednesday july 20 examined not the lions but the bears of berne it is indeed a city of bears as its name imports there are bears on its gates bears on its fountains bears in its parks and gardens bears every where but though berne rejoices in a fountain adorned with an image of saturn eating children nevertheless the old cityquaint quiet and queerlooks as if bearlike it had been hybernating goodnaturedly for a century and were just about to wake up  engaged a voiture and drove to thun dined and drove by the shore of the lake to interlachen arriving just after a brilliant sunset  thursday july 21 s and g remained at the belvedere w ii and i took a guide and voiture for lauterbrunn here we visited byrons apocalyptic horsetail waterfall the staubbach this waterfall is very sublime all except the water and the fall whoever has been under the sheet at niagara will not be particularly impressed here this picture is sufficiently accurate with the exception of the cottage people here do not build cottages under waterfalls  illustration of the waterfall and cliff rising sharply to the left of the roadway a cabin appears to be located very near its base  here we crossed the wengern alps to grindelwald the jungfrau is right over against usher glaciers purer tenderer more dazzlingly beautiful if possible than those of mont blanc slept at grindelwald     letter xxxviii  dear children  today we have been in the wengern alpsthe scenes described in manfred imagine us mounting about ten oclock from the valley of lauterbrunn on horsebackour party of threewith two guides we had first been to see the famous staubbach a beautiful though not sublime object up we began to go among those green undulations which form the lower part of the mountain  illustration of narrow high alpine meadows with grazing livestock  it is haying time a bright day all is cheerful the birds sing men women and children are busy in the field up we go zigzag it grows steeper and steeper now right below me is a field where men are literally working almost on a perpendicular wall cutting hay now we are so high that the houses in the valley look like chips here we stand in a place two thousand feet above the valley there is no shield or screen the horse stands on the very edge the guide stops lets go his bridle and composedly commences an oration on the scene below 0 for mercys sake why do you stop here i say pray go on he looks in my face with innocent wonder takes the bridle on his arm and goes on  now we have come to the little village of wengern whence the wengern alps take their name how beautiful how like fairyland up here midway in air is a green nook with undulating dells and shadowy breezy nests where are the cottages of the haymakers the delectable mountains had no scene more lovely each house has its roof heavily loaded with stones what is that for i ask the whirlwinds says my guide with a significant turn of his hands this is the school house he adds as we pass a building larger than the rest  now the path turns and slopes down a steep bank covered with haycocks to a little nook below likewise covered with new hay if my horse is going to throw me any where i wish it may be here it is not so bad a thing to roll down into that hay but now we mount higher the breezy dells enamelled with flowers and grass become fewer the great black pines take their place right before us in the purest white as a bride adorned for her husband rises the beautiful jungfrau wearing on her forehead the silver horn and the snow horn the silver horn is a peak dazzlingly bright of snow and its crest is now seen in relief against a sky of the deepest blue see also how those dark pines of the foreground contrast with it like the stern mournful realities of life seen against the dazzling hopes of heaven  there is something celestial in these mountains you might think such a vision as that to be a bright footstool of heaven from which the next step would be into an unknown world the pines here begin to show that long white beard of moss which i admire so much in maine now we go right up over their heads there the tall pines are under our feet a little moreand now above us rise the stern naked rocks where only the chamois and the wild goat live but still fair as the moon clear as the sun looks forth the jungfrau  we turn to look down that staubbach which in the valley seemed to fall from an immense precipice higher than we could gaze is now a silver thread far below our feet and the valley of lauterbrunn seems as nothing only bleak purplish crags rising all around us and silent silver mountains looking over them  that one directly before you is the monk says c calling to me from behind and pointing to a great snow peak  our guide with animation introduced us by name to every one of these snowwhite geniithe falhorn the schreckhorn the wetterhorn the great eiger and i cannot remember what besides the guides seem to consider them all as old friends  certainly nothing could be so singular so peculiar as this ascension we have now passed the limit of all but grass and alpine flowers which still with their infinite variety embroider the way and now the auberge is gained good night now and farewell  that is to say there we stoppedon the summit in fair view of the jungfrau a wall of rock crowned with fields of eternal snow whose dazzling brightness almost put my eyes out my head ached too with the thin air of these mountains i thought i should like to stay one night just to hear avalanches fall but i cannot breathe well here and there is a secret sense of horror about these sterile rocks and eternal snows so after dinner i gladly consent to go down to grindelwald  off we starti walkingfor to tell the truth i have no fondness for riding down a path as steep in some places as a wall i leave that to c who never fears any thing so i walked all the way to grindelwald nine miles of a very rough road there was a lady with her husband walking the same pass who had come on foot the whole way from lauterbrunn and did not seem in the least fatigued my guide exhausted all his eloquence to persuade me that it was better to ride at last i settled him by saying why here is a lady who has walked the whole route so he confined himself after that to helping me find flowers and carrying the handkerchief in which i stowed them alas what herbarium of hapless flowers laid out stark stiff and motionless like beauty on its bier and with horrible long names written under them can ever give an idea of the infinite variety and beauty of the floral crown of these mountains  the herbarium resembles the bright living reality no more than the morgue at st bernards is a specimen of mountain travellers yet one thing an herbarium is good for in looking at it you can recall how they looked and glowed and waved in life with all their silvercrowned mountains around them  after we arrived at grindelwald tired as i was i made sketches of nine varieties which i intend to color as soon as we rest long enough so much i did for love of the dear little souls  one noticeable feature is the predominance of yellow flowers these of various kinds so abound as to make a distinct item of coloring in a distant view one of the most common is thisof a vivid chrome yellow sometimes brilliantly striped with orange  illustration of a flowered bract  one thing more as to botanical names what does possess botanists to afflict the most fragile and delicate of earths children with such mountainous and unpronounceable names now there was a dear little flower that i first met at st bernarda little purple bell with a fringe it is more particularly beautiful from its growing just on the verge of avalanches coming up and blossoming through the snow i send you one in this letter which i dug out of a snow bank this morning and this fair creationthis hope upon a death bedthis image of love unchilled and immortalhow i wanted to know it by name  illustration of a tiny plant with a single flowering stem and two simple circular leaves  today at the summit house of the mountain i opened an herbarium and there were three inches of name as hopeless and unpronounceable as the german of our guides piled up on my little flower i shut the herbarium  this morning we started early from grindelwaldthat is by eight oclock an unclouded clear breezy morning the air full of the sounds of cascades and of the little bells of the herds as we began to wind upward into that delectable region which forms the first stage of ascent i said to c the more of beautiful scenery i see the more i appreciate the wonderful poetry of the pilgrims progress the meadows by the river of life the delectable mountains the land of beulah how often have i thought of them from this we went off upon painting and then upon music the freshness of the mountain air inspiring our way at last while we were riding in the very lap of a rolling field full of grass and flowers the sharp blue and white crystals of the glacier rose at once before us  o i want to get down said i and go near them  down i did get and taking what seemed to be the straightest course began running down the hill side towards them  no no back back shouted the guide in unimaginable french and german ici ici  i came back and taking my hand he led me along a path where travellers generally go i went closer and sat down on a rock under them and looked up the clear sun was shining through them clear and blue looked the rifts and arches all dripping and beautiful we went down upon them by steps which a man had cut in the ice there was one rift of ice we looked into which was about fifty feet high going up into a sharp arch the inside of this arch was clear blue ice of the color of crystal of blue vitriol  here immediately under i took a rude sketch just to show you how a glacier looks close at hand  illustration of the broken and chiseled surface of a glacier  c wanted as usual to do all sorts of improper things he wanted to stone down blocks of ice and to go inside the cave and to go down into holes and insisted on standing particularly long on a spot which the guide told him was all undermined in order that he might pelt a cliff of ice that seemed inclined to fall and hear it smash  the poor guide was as distressed as a hen when her ducks take to the water he ran and called and shouted in german french and english and it was not till c had contrived to throw the head of the little boys hatchet down into a crevasse that he gave up there were two francs to pay for this experiment but never mind our guide book says that a clergyman of yevay on this glacier fell into a crevasse several hundred feet deep and was killed so i was glad enough when c came off safe  he ought to have a bell on his neck as the cows do here and apropos to this we leave the glacier and ride up into a land of pastures here we see a hundred cows grazing in the fieldthe field all yellow with buttercups they are a very small breed prettily formed and each had on her neck a bell how many notes there are in these bells quite a diapasonsome very deep toned and so on up to the highest how prettily they sound all going together the bells are made of the best of metal for the tone is of an admirable quality  0 do look off there on that patch of snow under the wetterhorn it is all covered with cows they look no bigger than insects what makes them go there said we to our guides  to be cool was the answer  hark whats that a sudden sound like the rush of a cascade  avalanche avalanche exclaimed the guide and now pouring down the sides of the wetterhorn came a milkwhite cascade looking just like any other cascade melting gracefully over the rocks and spreading like a stream of milk on the soiled snow below  this is a summer avalanchea mere bijoua fancy article got up or rather got down to entertain travellers the winter avalanches are quite other things witness a little further in our track where our guide stops us and points to a place where all the pines have been broken short off by one of them along here some old ghostly pines dead ages ago their white ghastly skeletons bleached by a hundred storms stand stretching out their long bony arms like phantom giants these skeleton pines are a striking image i wonder i have not seen them introduced into pictures  there now a little ahead is a small hut which marks the summit of the grand scheidich our horses come up to it and we dismount some of the party go in to sleepi go out to climb a neighboring peak at the foot of this peak lay a wreath of snow soiled and dirty as halfmelted snow always is but lying amid the green grass and luxuriant flowers it had a strange air it seemed a little spot of death in the green lap of rejoicing lifelike that deathspot which often lies in the human heartamong all seeming flowers cold and cheerless unwarmed by the sunbeam and unmelted by the ray that unfolds thousands of blooms around  now i thought i have read of alpine flowers leaning their cheeks on the snows i wonder if any flowers grow near enough to that snow to touch it i mean to go and see so i went there sure enough my little fringed purple bell to which i have given the name of suspirium was growing not only close to the snow but in it  thus gods grace shining steadily on the waste places of the human heart brings up heavenward sighings and aspirations which pierce through the cold snows of affliction and tell that there is yet life beneath  i climbed up the grassy sides of the peak flowers to the very top there i sat down and looked this is alpine solitude all around me were these deep green dells from which comes up the tinkle of bells like the dropping of rain every where it seems to me the air is more elastic and musical here than below and gives grace to the commonest sound now i look back along the way we have been travelling i look at the strange old cloudy mountains the eiger the wetterhorn the schreckhorn a kind of hazy ether floats around theman indescribable aerial halowhich no painter ever represents who can paint the airthat vivid blue in which these sharp peaks cut their glittering images of all peaks the eiger is the most impressive to me  illustration of the sharp pointed eiger with mountain goats on a pinnacle in the foreground  it is a gigantic ploughshare of rock set up against the sky its thin keen purple blade edged with glittering frost for so sharp is its point that only a dazzling line marks the eternal snow on its head  i walked out as far as i could on a narrow summit and took a last look glaciers snows mountains sunny dells and flowers all good by i am a pilgrim and a stranger  already looking down to the shanty i see the guide like a hen that has lost a chicken shaking her wings and clucking and making a great ado i could stay here all day i would like to stay two or threeto see how it would look at sunrise at sunsetto lie down in one of these sunny hollows and look up into the skyto shut my eyes lazily and open them again and so let the whole impression soak in as mrs h used to say  but no the sleepers have waked up the guide has the horses ready and i must come down so here i descend my hill difficulty into the valley of humiliation we stumble along for the roads here are no turnpikes and we come to a place called the black forest not the black forest but truly a black one i always love pines to all generations i welcome this solemn old brotherhood which stand graybearded like monks old dark solemn sighing a certain mournful soundlike a benedicite through the leaves  about noon we came to rosenlaui as we drew near the hotel the guide struck off upon a path leading up the mountain saying by way of explanation the glacier  now i confess that it was rather too near dinner time and i was too tired at once to appreciate this movement  i regret to say that two glaciers however beautiful on an empty stomach appear rather of doubtful utility so i remonstrated but the guide as all guides do went dead ahead as if i had not said a word c however rode composedly towards the hotel saying that dinner was a finer sight than a glacier and i though only of the same mind thought i would follow my guide just to see  w went with me after a little we had to leave our horses and scramble about a mile up the mountain c was right and we are wrong said my companion sententiously i was just dubious enough to be silent pretty soon we came to a tremendous ravine as if an earthquake had rent a mountain asunder a hundred feet down in this black gorge a stream was roaring in a succession of mad leaps and a bridge crossed it where we stood to gaze down into its dark awful depths then on we went till we came to the glacier what a mass of clear blue ice so very blue so clear this awful chasm runs directly under it and the mountain torrent formed by the melting of the glacier falls in a roaring cascade into it you can go down into a cavern in this rift above your head a roof of clear blue ice below your feet this black chasm with the white flashing foam of the cascade as it leaps away into the darkness on one side of the glacier was a little sort of cell or arched nook up which an old man had cut steps and he helped me up into it i stood in a little gothic shrine of blue glittering ice and looked out of an arched window at the cascade and mountains i thought of coleridges line    a pleasure bower with domes of ice  illustration of a glaciers terminus with animals and small buildings in the foreground  on the whole the glacier of rosenlaui paid for lookingeven at dinner timewhich is saying a good deal     journalcontinued  friday july 22 grindelwald to meyringen on we came to the top of the great schiedich where h and w botanized while i slept thence we rode down the mountain till we reached rosenlaui where i am free to say a dinner was to me a more interesting object than a glacier therefore while h and w went to the latter i turned off to the inn amid their cries and reproaches i waved my cap and made a bow a glaciergo five rods farther to see a glacier catch me in any such folly the fact is alps are good like confections in moderation but to breakfast dine and sup on alps surfeits my digestion  here for example i am writing these notes in the salleàmanger of the inn where other voyagers are eating and drinking and there h is feeding on the green moonshine of an emerald ice cave one would almost think her incapable of fatigue how she skips up and down high places and steep places to the manifest perplexity of honest guide kienholz père who tries to take care of her but does not exactly know how she gets on a pyramid of débris which the edge of the glacier is ploughing and grinding up sits down and fallsnot asleep exactlybut into a trance w and i are ready to go on we shout our voice is lost in the roar of the torrent we send the guide he goes down and stands doubtfully he does not know exactly what to do she hears him and starts to her feet pointing with one hand to yonder peak and with the other to that knifelike edge that seems cleaving heaven with its keen and glistening cimeter of snow reminding one of isaiahs sublime imagery for my sword is bathed in heaven she points at the grizzly rocks with their jags and spear points evidently she is beside herself and thinks she can remember the names of those monsters born of earthquake and storm which cannot be named nor known but by sight and then are known at once perfectly and forever  mountains are natures testimonials of anguish they are the sharp cry of a groaning and travailing creation natures stern agony writes itself on these furrowed brows of gloomy stone these reft and splintered crags stand the dreary images of patient sorrow existing verdureless and stern because exist they must in them hearts that have ceased to rejoice and have learned to suffer find kindred and here an earth worn with countless cycles of sorrow utters to the stars voices of speechless despair  and all this time no dinner all this time h is at the glacier how do i know but she has fallen into a crevasse how do i know but that a cliff one of those ice castles those leaning turrets those frosty spearmen have toppled over upon her i shudder at the reflection i will write no more  i had just written thus far when in came h and w in high feather o i had lost the greatest sight in switzerland there was such a chasm a mountain cut in twain with a bridge and a man to throw a stone down and you could hear it go boom and he held his hat not a doubt of that said i then there was a cavern in the ice and the ice was so green and the water dripped from the roof and a great river rushed out such was the substance of their united enthusiasm  but alas it was not enough to lose the best glacier in switzerland i must needs lose two cascades and a chamois just before coming to meyringen i was composedly riding down a species of stone gridiron set up sidewise called a road when the guide overtook me and requested me to walk as the road was bad stupid fellow he said not a word about cascades and chamois and so i went down like a chamois myself taking the road that seemed best and nearest and reached the inn an hour before the rest after waiting till i became alarmed and was just sending back a messenger to inquire lo in they came and began to tell me of cascades and chamois  what cascade what chamois i have not seen any and then what a burst not seen any what two cascades one glacier and a fouryearold chamois lost in one day what will become of you is this the way you make the tour of switzerland  saturday july 23 rode in a voiture from meyringen to brienz on the opposite end of the lake from interlachen embarked in a rowboat of four immense oars tied by withs two men and one woman pulled three and w and i took turns at the fourth the boat being high built flat bottomed with awning and flagstaff rolled and tipped so easily that soon h with remorseful visage abandoned her attempt to write and lay down there is a fresh and savage beauty about this lake which can only be realized by rowing across  interlachen is underrated in the guide books it has points of unrivalled loveliness the ruins of the old church of rinconberg for example commanding a fine view of both lakes of the country between and the alps around while just at your feet is a little lake in a basin some two hundred feet above the other lakes then too from your window in the belvedere you gaze upon the purity of the jungfrau the church too where on sabbath we attended episcopal service is embowered in foliage and seems like some new england village meeting house  monday july 25 adieu to interlachen ho for lucerne and the righi dined at thun in a thunder storm stopped over night at langnau an outoftheway place h and g painted alpine flowers while i played violin this violin must be of spotless pedigree even as our genevese friend monsieur certified when he reluctantly sold it me none but a genuine amati a hundred years old can possess this mysterious quality that can breathe almost inaudible like a mornbeam in the parlor or predominate imperious and intense over orchestra and choir illuminating with its fire like chain lightning the arches of a vast cathedral enchanted thingwhat nameless spirit impregnates with magnetic ether the fine fibres of thy mechanism  tuesday 26 rode from langnan to lucerne just in time to take the boat for weggis from the door of the hotel de la concorde at weggis the guide chef fitted us out with two chaises à porteur six carriers two mules with grooms making a party of fourteen in all  after ascending a while the scenery became singularly wild and beautiful vast walls and cliffs of conglomerate rose above us up which our path wound in zigzags below us were pines vales fields and hills themselves large enough for mountains there at our feet with its beautiful islands bays capes and headlands gleams the broad lake of the four cantons consecrated by the muse of schiller and the heroism of tell new plains are unrolling new mountain tops sinking below our range of vision we plunged into a sea of mist it rolled and eddied boiling beneath us through its mysterious pall we saw now a skeleton pine stretch out its dark pointing handnow a rock shapeless and uncouth far below like a behemoth petrified in mid ocean then an eddy would sweep a space for the sun to pour a flood of gold on this field far down at our feet on that village on this mountain side with its rosy vaporwreaths upon yon distant lake making it a crater of blinding brightness on we went wrapped in mantles mist and mystery trembling with chilliness and enthusiasm we reached the summit just as the sunsetgazing crowd were dispersing and this is righi kulm  wednesday 27 at half past three in the morning we were aroused by the alpine horn we sprang up groping and dressing in the dark and went out in the frosty air ascending the ridge we looked off upon a sleeping world mists lay beneath like waves clouds like a sea on one side the oberland alps stretched along the horizon their pale bluewhite peaks other mountains indistinct in color and outline chained round the whole horizon yes the sleeping rocks did dream all over the wide expanse as they slumbered on their cloudy pillow and their dream was of the coming dawn twelve lakes leaden pale or steel blue dreamed also under canopies of cloud and the solid land dreamed and all her wilds and forests and in the silence of the dream already the tinge of clairvoyance lit the gray east a dim diffuse aurora while yet the long low clouds hung lustreless above nor could the eye prophesy where should open the door in heaven at length a flush as of shame or joy presaged the pathway tongues of manycolored light vibrated beneath the strata of clouds now dappled mottled streaked with fire those on either hand of a light flaky salmon tint those in the path and portal of the dawn of a gorgeous blending and blazoning of golden glories the mists all abroad stirred uneasily tufts of feathery down came up out of the mass soft floating films lifted from the surface and streamed away dissolving strange hues came out on lake and shore far far below the air the very air became conscious of a coming change and the pale tops of distant alps sparkled like diamonds it was night in the valleys and we heard the cocks crowing below and the uneasy stir of a world preparing to awake so isaiah foresaw a slumbering world while messiahs coming glanced upon the heights of zion and cried    behold darkness shall cover the earth    and gross darkness the people    but the lord shall rise upon thee    and his glory shall be seen upon thee  hushed the immense crowd of spectators waited then he came on the gray edge of the horizon under the emblazoned strata came a sudden coal of fire as shot from the altar of heaven it dazzled it wavered it consumed its lambent lines lengthened sidelong at length not a coal but a shield as the shield of jehovah stood above the east and it was day the vapor sea heaved and broke and rolled up the mountain sides the lakes flashed back the conquering splendor the wide panorama asleep no more was astir with teeming life  tuesday july 28 one of the greatest curiosities in lucerne is the monument to those brave swiss guards who were slain for their unshaken fidelity to the unhappy louis xvi in a sequestered spot the rocky hill side is cut away and in the living strata is sculptured the colossal figure of a dying lion a spear is broken off in his side but in his last struggle he still defends a shield marked with the fleur de lis of france below are inscribed in red letters as if charactered in blood the names of the brave officers of that devoted band from many a crevice in the rock drip down trickling springs forming a pellucid basin below whose dark glossy surface encircled with trees and shrubs reflects the image the design of the monument is by thorwaldsen and the whole effect of it has an inexpressible pathos  illustration of the memorial above the grotto reads    helvetiorum fidei ac virtuti  on the monuments plinth can be read the following    die x augusti ii et iii septembris mdccxcii   haec sunt nomina eorum outne sacra   illegible               illegible   dues xxvi                 duces   rode in our private voiture to basle and rested our weary limbs at the three kings  friday 29 visited the celebrities of basle and took the cars for strasbourg where we arrived in time to visit the minster  saturday 30 left strasbourg by the rhine morning boat a long low slender affair the scenery exceedingly tame like portions of the lower mississippi disembarked at manheim and drove over to heidelberg through a continual garden french is useless here all our negotiations are in german with w s and g as a committee on gutturals     letter xxxix  strasbourg  my dear  we arrived here this evening i left the cars with my head full of the cathedral the first thing i saw on lifting my eyes was a brown spire said i  c do you think that can be the cathedral spire  yes that must be it  i am afraid it is said i doubtfully as i felt within that dissolving of airy visions which i have generally found the first sensation on visiting any celebrated object  the thing looked entirely too low and too broad for what i had heard of its marvellous grace and lightness nay some mischievous elf even whispered the word dumpy hi my ear but being informed in time that this was the spire i resisted the temptation and determined to make the best of it i have since been comforted by reading in goethes autobiography a criticism on its proportions quite similar to my own we climbed the spire we gained the roof what a magnificent terrace a world itself a panoramic view sweeping the horizon here i saw the names of goethe and herder here they have walked many a time i suppose but the insidea forestlike firmament glorious in holiness windows many hued as the hebrew psalms a gloom solemn and pathetic as mans mysterious existence a richness gorgeous and manifold as his wonderful nature in this gothic architecture we see earnest northern races whose nature was a composite of influences from pine forest mountain and storm expressing in vast proportions and gigantic masonry those ideas of infinite duration and existence which christianity opened before them a barbaric wildness mingles itself with fanciful ornate abundance it is the blossoming of northern forests  the ethereal eloquence of the greeks could not express the rugged earnestness of souls wrestling with those fearful mysteries of fate of suffering of eternal existence declared equally by nature and revelation this architecture is hebraistic in spirit not greek it well accords with the deep groundswell of hebrew prophets  lord thou hast been our dwellingplace in all generations  before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god  a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past  and as a watch in the night  the objection to gothic architecture as compared with greek is that it is less finished and elegant so it is it symbolizes that state of mind too earnest for mere polish too deeply excited for laws of exact proportions and architectural refinement it is alpine architecturevast wild and sublime in its foundations yet bursting into flowers at every interval  the human soul seems to me an imprisoned essence striving after somewhat divine there is a struggle in it as of suffocated flame finding vent now through poetry now in painting now in music sculpture or architecture various are the crevices and fissures but the flame is one  moreover as society grows from barbarism upward it tends to inflorescence at certain periods as do plants and trees and some races flower later than others this architecture was the first flowering of the gothic race they had no homers the flame found vent not by imaged words and vitalized alphabets they vitalized stone and their poets were minster builders their epics cathedrals  this is why one cathedrallike strasbourg or notre damehas a thousand fold the power of any number of madeleines the madeleine is simply a building these are poems  i never look at one of them without feeling that gravitation of soul towards its artist which poetry always excites often the artist is unknown here we know him erwin von steinbach poet prophet priest in architecture  we visited his housea house old and quaint and to me full of suggestions and emotions ah if there be as the apostle vividly suggests houses not made with hands strange splendors of which these are but shadows that vast religious spirit may have been finding scope for itself where all the forces of nature shall have been made tributary to the great conceptions of the soul  save this cathedral strasbourg has nothing except peakedroofed houses dotted with six or seven rows of gable windows     letter xl  heidelberg  my dear  today we made our first essay on the rhine switzerland is a poor preparation for admiring any common scenery but the rhine from strasbourg to manheim seemed only a muddy strip of water with low banks poplars and willows if there was any thing better we passed it while i was asleep for i did sleep even on the classic rhine  day before yesterday at basle i went into the museum and there saw some original fragments of the dance of death and many other pictures by holbein with two miniature likenesses of luther and his wife by lucas cranach they are in water colors catharine was no beauty at that time if lucas is to be trusted and luther looks rather savage but i saw a book of autographs and several original letters of luthers i saw the word jesus at the top of one of them thus j u s the handwriting was fair even and delicate i laid my hand on it and thought his hand also had passed over the paper which he has made living with his thoughts melanchthon of whom a far more delicate penmanship might have been expected wrote a coarse rugged hand quite like dr bishops it somehow touched my heart to see this writing of luthers so fair and clean and flowing and to think of his vive and eversurging spirits his conflicts and his victories  we were awakened about eight oclock this morning by the cathedral bell which is near by and by the chanting of the service it was a beautiful sunny morning and i could hear them sing all the time i was dressing i think by the style of the singing it was protestant service it brought to mind the elms of andoverthe dewy exquisite beauty of the sabbath mornings there and i felt more than ever why am i seeking any thing more beautiful than home but today the sweet shadow of gods presence is still over me and the sense of his love and protection falls silently into my soul like dew  at breakfast time professor m and his daughter called as he said to place themselves at our disposal for the castle or whatever we might wish to see i intimated that we would prefer spending the day in our new england manner of retirementa suggestion which he took at once  after breakfast the servant asked us if we should like to have a room commanding a view of the castle to be sure said i so he ushered us into a large elegantlyfurnished apartment looking out immediately upon it there it sat upon its green throne a regal beautiful poetic thing fair and sad  we had singing and prayers and a sermon from c we did not go to the table dhôte for we abominate its longdrawn endless formalities but one part of the arrangements we enjoyed without going i mean the music to me all music is sacred is it not so all real music in its passionate earnest its blendings its wild heartsearching tones is the language of aspiration so it may not be meant yet when we know god so we translate it  in the evening we took tea with professor m in a sociable way much like the salon of paris mrs m sat at a table and poured out tea which a servant passed about on a waiter gradually quite a circle of people dropped inamong them professor mittemeyer who i was told is the profoundest lawyer in germany also there was heinrich von gagen who was head of the convention of the empire in 1848 and prime minister he is tall has a stronglymarked face very dark hair and eyebrows there was also a very young man with quite light hair named fisher who they told me was one of the greatest philosophers of the time but government had taken away his license to lecture on account of his pantheistic principles i understand that this has occasioned much feeling and that some of the professors side with and some against him a lady told me that the theological professors were against him i wonder people do not see that this kind of suppression of opinion is a sword with two edges which may cut orthodoxy equally with pantheism let both grow together says christ the wheat and the tares in america we do this and a nodding crop of all sorts we have the more the better the earth must exhaust herself before the end can come  mr m spoke english as did his very pretty daughter ida his wife only french and german now if you had only been there we might have had quite a brilliant time but my ignorance of german kept me from talking with any but those who could speak english professor mittemeyer summoned english enough to make a long compliment to which i responded as usual by looking very foolish there was a well informed gentleman there who was formerly private secretary to prince albert and who speaks english well he has a bright ingenious mind and knows every thing and seemed particularly willing to give me the benefit of his knowledge for which i was suitably grateful on the whole i spent a very pleasant evening and we parted about nine oclock miss ida promising to be our guide to the castle in the morning  well in the morning i was too unwell to leave the sofa i knew the old symptoms and remained in my room while professor m and daughter with s w and g went up to the castle i lay all day on the sofa until at five oclock at night i felt so much better that i thought we might take a carriage and drive up c accompanied me and cocher took us by a beautiful drive along the valley of the neckar over the hills back of the castle and finally through the old arched gateway into the grounds i had no idea before of the extent or the architectural beauty of the place the terrace behind the castle is a most lovely spot it wanted only silence and solitude to make it perfect it was full of tourists as also was each ruined nook and arch i sauntered about alone for c had a sick headache and was forced to sit on one of the stone benches heidelberg castle is of vast extent and various architecture parts of it a guide book says were designed by michael angelo over one door was a hebrew inscription marshalled in niches in the wall stood statues of electors and knights in armorsilent lonely the effect was quite different from the old gothic ruins i had seen this spoke of courts of princes and the pride and grandeur of the past contrasted with the silence and desertion reminded me of the fable of the city of enchantment where king and court were smitten to stone as they stood a mournful lions head attracted my attention it had such a strange sad look and there was a fountain broken and full of weeds  i looked on the carvings the statues the broken arches where bluebells and wild flowers were waving and it seemed inexpressibly beautiful it haunted me in my dreams and i found myself walking up and down that terrace in a kind of dim beautiful twilight with some friend it was a strange dream of joy but i felt myself very ill even while there and had to take my sofa again as soon as i returned there lying i took my pencil and drew just the view of the castle which i could see from my window as a souvenir of the happiness i had felt at heidelberg  illustration of the authors window view of heidelberg  now i know you will say with me that a day of such hazy dreamy enjoyment is worth a great deal we cannot tell why it is or what it is but one feels like an Æolian breathed on and touched by soft winds  illustration of heidelberg castle  this sketch of the castle gives only about half of it those tiny statues indicated in it on the points of the gables are figures in armor of large size the two little kiosks or summer houses that you see you will find by turning back to the other picture mark the extremities of the terrace there is a singular tinge of the moorish about this architecture which gives me great delight that moorish development always seemed to me strangely exciting and beautiful     journalcontinued  tuesday august 2 we leave heidelberg with regret at the railway station occurred our first loss of baggage as w was making change in the baggage room he missed the basket containing our books and sundries unfortunately the particular word for basket had just then stepped out wo ist meinpannier exclaimed he giving them the french synonyme they shook their heads wo ist meinbasket he cried giving them english they shook their heads still harder wo ist mein  wheww shrieked the steam whistle ding alingling went the bell and leaving his question unfinished w ran for the cars  in our car was an elderly couple speaking french the man was evidently a quiet sort of fellow who by long caudling had subduedwhole volcanos into dumbness within him little did he think what eruption fate was preparing ii sat opposite his hat which he had placed on the empty seat there was a tower or something coming h rose turned round and innocently took a seat on his chapeau such a voice as came out of that meekness personified  in the twinkling of an eyefor there is a peculiar sensation which a person experiences in sitting upon or rather into a hat ages are condensed into moments and between the first yielding of the brittle top and the final crush and jam as between the top of a steeple and the bottom there is room for a lifes reflection to flash through the mindin the twinkling of an eye h agonizingly felt that she was sitting on a hat that the hat was being jammed that it was getting flat and flatter every second that the meek man was howling in french and she was just thinking of her husband and children when she started to her feet and the nightmare was over the meek man having howled out his french sentence sat aghast stroking his poor hat while his wife opposite was in convulsions and we all agog the gentleman then asked h if she proposed sitting where she was saying very significantly if you do ill put my hat there suiting the action to the word we did not recover from this all the way to frankfort  arrived at frankfort we drove to the hotel de russie then after visiting all the lions of the place we rode to see danneckers ariadne it is a beautiful female riding on a panther or a tiger the light is let in through a rosy curtain and the flush as of life falls upon the beautiful form two thoughts occurred to me why when we gaze upon this form so perfect so entirely revealed does it not excite any of those emotions either of shame or of desire which the living reality would excite and again why does not the immediate contact of feminine helplessness with the most awful brute ferocity excite that horror which the sight of the same in real life must awaken why but because we behold under a spell in the transfigured world of art where passion ceases and bestial instincts are felt to be bowed to the law of mind and of ideal truth     letter xli  dear  today we came to frankfort and this afternoon we have been driving out to see the lions and in the first place the house where goethe was born over the door you remember was the family coat of arms well while we were looking i perceived that a little bird had accommodated the crest of the coat to be his own family residence and was flying in and out of a snug nest wherewith he had crowned it little fanciful feathery amateur could nothing suit him so well as goethes coat of arms i could fancy the little thing to be the poets soul come back to have a kind of breezy hovering existence in this real world of oursto sing and perch and soar for i think you told me that his principal grace and characteristic was an exquisite perception and expression of physical beauty goethes house was a very grand one for the times was it not now a sign in the window tells us it is used as a manufactory of porcelain  then we drove through the jews quarters you remember how queer and old they look they have been much modernized since you were there cocher stopped before one house and said something in german about rothschild which c said sounded like here rothschild hung his boots out we laughed and rode on  after this we went to the romer the hall that you have told me of where the emperors were chosen all painted with their portraits in compartments and i looked out on the fountain in front that used on these occasions to flow with wine then i walked around to see all the emperors and to wish i knew more about history charles v is the only one of whom i have any distinct recollection  then we went to a kind of museum cocher stopped at the door and we heard a general sputtering of gutturals between him w and g he telling them something about luther i got it into my head that the manuscript of luthers bible was inside so i rushed forward it was the public library a colossal statue of goethe by an italian artist was the first thing i saw what a head the man had i a jupiter of a head and what a presence the statue is really majestic but was goethe so much really think you that egotistical spirit shown in his diary sets me in doubt shakspeare was not selfconscious and left no trace of egotism if he knew himself he did not care to tell what he knew yet the heads are both great and majestic heads and would indicate a plenary manhood  we went into the library disturbing a quiet good sort of bibliopole there who with some regret put aside his book to guide us  is luthers bible here w and g opened on him  no but he ushered us into a cabinet  there are luthers shoes  shoes we all exclaimed and there was an irreverent laugh yes there they were in a glass casehis shoes large as lifeshoes without heels great clumping thick and black what an idea however there was a genuine picture by lucas cranach and another of catharine by holbein which gave more consolatory ideas of her person than that which i saw before at basle there were also autographs of goethe and schiller as well as of luther and melanchthon  our little bibliopole looked mournfully at us as if we were wasting his time and seemed glad when we went out c thought he was huffy because we laughed at luthers shoes but i think he was only yearning after his book c offered him a fee but he would not take it going down stairs in the entry i saw a picture of the infant goethe on an eagle we rode also to see a bronze statue of him in some street or other and i ate an ice cream there to show my regard for him we are delighted on the whole with frankfort  now after all that i should forget the crown of all our seeings danneckers ariadne it is in a pavilion in a gentlemans garden could mere beauty and grace delight and fill the soul one could not ask for more than the ariadne the beautiful head the throat the neck the bust the hand the arm the whole attitude are exquisite but after all what is it no moral charmmere physical beauty cold as greek mythology i thought of his christ and did not wonder that when he had turned his art to that divine representation he should refuse to sculpture from classic models he who has sculptured a christ cannot sculpture a venus  our hotel here is very beautiful i think it must have been some palace for it is adorned with fine statues and walls of real marble the staircase is beautiful with brass railing and at the foot a marble lion on each side the walls of my bed room are lined with green damask bordered by gilt bands the attendance here is excellent in every hotel of each large city there is a man who speaks english the english language is slowly and surely creeping through europe already it rivals the universality of the french  two things in this city have struck me singularly as peculiarly german one was a longlegged stork which i saw standing on a chimney top reminding me of the oftmentioned dear white stork of german stories why dont storks do so in america i wonder another thing was waking suddenly in the middle of the night and hearing the hymn of the watchman as he announced the hour i think this is a beautiful custom  in the morning i determined to get into the picture gallery now c who espoused to himself an amati at geneva has been like all young bridegrooms very careless about every thing else but his beloved since he got it painting sculpture architecture all must yield to music nor can all the fascinations of raphael or rubens vie in his estimation with the melodies of mozart or the harmonies of beethoven so yesterday when we found the picture gallery shut he profanely remarked what a mercy and this morning i could enlist none of the party but w to go with me we were paid for going there were two or three magnificent pictures of sunrise and sunset in the alps by modern artists never tell me that the old masters have exhausted the world of landscape painting at any rate am i not competent to judge because i am not an artist what do not all persons feel themselves competent to pronounce on the merits of natural landscapes and say which of two scenes is finer and are painters any greater artists than god if they say that we are not competent to judge because we do not understand the mixing of colors the mysteries of foreshortening and all that i would ask them if they understand how god mixes his colors canst thou understand the balancing of the clouds the wondrous ways of him who is perfect in wisdom if therefore i may dare to form a judgment of gods originals i also will dare to judge of mans imitations nobody shall impose old black smoky poussins and salvator rosas on me and so insult my eyesight and common sense as to make me confess they are better than pictures which i can see have all the freshness and bloom of the living reality upon them  so also a most glorious picture here the trial of john huss before the council of constance by lessingone of the few things i have seen in painting which have had power deeply to affect me i have it not in my heart to criticize it as a mere piece of coloring and finish though in these respects i thought it had great merits but the picture had the power which all high art must have of rebuking and silencing these minor inquiries in the solemnity of its morale i believe the highest painter often to be the subject of a sort of inspiration by which his works have a vitality of suggestion so that they sometimes bring to the beholder even more than he himself conceived when he created them in this picture the idea that most impressed me was the representation of that more refined and subtle torture of martyrdom which consists in the incertitude and weakness of an individual against whom is arrayed the whole weight of the religious community if against the martyr only the worldly and dissolute stood arrayed he could bear it but when the church claiming to be the visible representative of christ casts him out when multitudes of pious and holy souls as yet unenlightened in their piety look on him with horror as an infidel and blasphemer then comes the very wrench of the rack as long as the body is strong and the mind clear a consciousless of right may sustain even this but there come weakened hours when worn by prison and rack the soul asks itself can it be that all the religion and respectability of the world is wrong and i alone right such an agony luther expressed in that almost superhuman meditation written the night before the diet at worms such an agony the historian tells us john huss passed through the night before his execution  now for the picture the painter has arrayed with consummate ability in the foreground a representation of the religious respectability of the age italian cardinals in their scarlet robes their keen intellectual thoughtful faces shadowed by their broad hats men whom it were no play to meet in an argument there are grayheaded venerable priests and bishops with their seal rings of officeall that expressed the stateliness and grandeur of what huss had been educated to consider the true church in the midst of them stands huss habited in a simple dark robe his sharpened features and the yellow corpselike pallor of his face tell of prison and of suffering he is defending himself and there is a trembling earnestness in the manner with which his hand grasps the bible with a passionate agony he seems to say am i not right does not this word say it and is it not the word of god  so have i read the moral of this noble picture and in it i felt that i had seen an example of that true mission of art which will manifest itself more and more in this world as christs kingdom comes art which is not a mere juggler of colors a gymnastic display of effects but a solemn inspiring poetry teaching us to live and die for that which it noblest and truest i think this picture much superior to its companion the martyrdom of huss which i had already seen in america     journalcontinued  wednesday august 3 frankfort to cologne hurrah for the rhine at eleven we left the princely palace calling itself hotel de russie whose halls are walled with marble and adorned with antique statues of immense value lo as we were just getting into our carriage the lost parcel basket shawl cloak and all we tore along to the station rode pleasantly over to mayenz made our way on board a steamer loaded down with passengers established ourselves finally in the centre of all things on five stools and deposited our loose change of baggage in the cabin  the steamer was small narrow and poor though swift thus we began to see the rhine under pressure of circumstances  the french and germans chatted merrily the english tourists looked conscientiously careworn papa with three daughters peered alternately into the guide book and out of the loophole in the awning in evident terror lest something they ought to see should slip by them escaping from the jam we made our way to the bow carrying stools umbrellas and books and there on the very beak of all things we had a fine view duly and dutifully we admired bingen coblentz ehrenbreitstein bonn drachenfels and all the other celebrities and read childe harold on the rhine reached cologne at nine  thursday august 4 we drove to the cathedral i shall not recapitulate murray nor give architectural details i was satisfied with what i saw and heard and wished that so magnificent a conception so sublime a blossom of stone sculpture might come to ripe maturity not as a church indeed but rather as a beautiful petrifaction a growth of prolific exuberant nature why should not the yeasty brain of man fermenting froth over in such crestwork of gothic pinnacle spire and column  the only service i appreciated was the organ and chant hidden in the midst of forest arches of stone pouring forth its volumes of harmony as by unseen minstrelsy it seemed to create an atmosphere of sound in which the massive columns seemed transfusednot standing as it were but floatingnot resting as with weight of granite mountains but growing as by a spirit and law of development filled with those vast waves and undulations the immense edifice seemed a creature tremulous with a life a soul an instinct of its own and out of its deepest heart there seemed to struggle upward breathings of unutterable emotion     letter xlii  cologne 10 oclock hotel bellevue  dear  the great old city is before me looming up across the rhine which lies spread out like a molten looking glass all quivering and wavering reflecting the thousand lights of the city we have been on the rhine all day gliding among its picturelike scenes but alas i i had a headache the boat was crowded one and all smoked tobacco and in vain under such circumstances do we see that nature is fair it is not enough to open ones eyes on scenes one must be able to be en rapport with them just so in the spiritual world we sometimes see great truthssee that god is beautiful glorious and surpassingly lovely but at other times we feel both nature and god and 0 how different seeing and feeling to say the truth i have been quite homesick today and leaning my head on the rails pondered an immediate flight a giving up of all engagements on the continent and in england an immediate rush homeward does it not seem absurd that when within a few days journey of what has been the longdesired dream of my heart i should feel sothat i should actually feel that i had rather take some more of our pleasant walks about andover than to see all that europe has to offer  this morning we went to the cologne cathedral in the exterior of both this and strasbourg i was disappointed but in the interior who could be there is a majesty about those upspringing archesthose columns so light so loftyit makes one feel as if rising like a cloud then the innumerable complications and endless perspectives arch above arch and arch within arch all lighted up and colored by the painted glass and all this filled with the waves of the chant and the organ rising and falling like the noise of the sea it was one of the few overpowering things that do not satisfy because they transport you at once beyond the restless anxiety to be satisfied and leave you no time to ask the cold question am i pleased  ah surely i said to myself as i walked with a kind of exultation among those lofty arches and saw the clouds of incense ascending the kneeling priests and heard the pathetic yet grand voices of the chantsurely there is some part in man that calls for such a service for such visible images of grandeur and beauty the wealth spent on these churches is a sublime and beautiful protest against materialismagainst that use of money which merely brings supply to the coarse animal wants of life and which makes of gods house only a bare pen in which a man sits to be instructed in his duties  yet a moment after i had the other side of the question brought forcibly to my mind in an obscure corner was a coarse wooden shrine painted red in which was a doll dressed up in spangles and tinsel to represent the virgin and hung round with little waxen effigies of arms hands feet and legs to represent i suppose some favor which had been accorded to these members of her several votaries through her intercessions before this shrine several poor people were kneeling with clasped hands and bowed heads praying with an earnestness which was sorrowful to see they have taken away their lord and they know not where they have laid him such is the end of this superb idolatry in the illiterate and the poor  yet if we could would we efface from the world such cathedrals as strasbourg and cologne i discussed the question of outward pomp and ritual with myself while i was walking deliberately round a stone balustrade on the roof of the church and looking out through the flying buttresses upon the broad sweep of the rhine and the queer oldtimes houses and spires of the city i thought of the splendors of the hebrew ritual and temple instituted by god himself i questioned where was the text in the gospel that forbade such a ritual provided it were felt to be desirable and then i thought of the ignorance and stupid idolatry of those countries where this ritual is found in greatest splendor and asked whether these are the necessary concomitants of such churches and such forms or whether they do not result from other causes the hebrew ritual in a far more sensuous age had its sculptured cherubim its pictorial and artistic wealth of representation its gorgeous priestly vestments its incense and its chants and they never became so far as we know the objects of idolatrous veneration  but i love to go back over and over the scenes of that cathedral to look up those arches that seem to me in their buoyant lightness to have not been made with hands but to have shot up like an enchantmentto have risen like an aspiration an impersonation of the upward sweep of the soul in its loftiest moods of divine communion there were about five minutes of feeling worth all the discomforts of getting here and it is only for some such short time that we can enjoythen our prison door closes  there are four painted glass windows given by the king of bavaria i have got for h the photograph of two of them representing the birth and death of christ they are gorgeous paintings by the first masters the windows round the choir were painted in a style that reminded me of our forests in autumn  well after our sublimities came a farce we went to st ursulas church to see the bones of the eleven thousand virgins who the chronicle says were slain here because they would not break their vows of chastity i was much amused as we entered the church c remarked impressively it is evident that these virgins have no connection with cologne water the fact was lamentably apparent doleful looking figures of virgins painted in all the colors of the rainbow were looking down upon us from all quarters and in front in a glass frame was a bill of fare in french of the relics which could be served up to order c read the list aloud and then we proceeded to a small side room to see the exhibition the upper portion of the walls was covered with small bones strung on wires and arranged in a kind of fanciful arabesque much as shell boxes are made and the lower part was taken up with busts in silver and gold gilding representing still the interminable eleven thousand a sort of cupboard door half opened showed the shelves all full of skulls adorned with little satin caps coronets and tinsel jewelry which skulls we were informed were the original headpieces of the same redoubtable females  at the other end of the room was a raised stage where the most holy relics of all were being displayed under the devout eye of a priest in a long black robe c and i went upon the stage to be instructed s whom the aforesaid lack of cologne water in the establishment had rendered peculiarly unpropitious stood at a majestic distance but c assuming an air of profound faith stood up to be initiated  that says the priest in a plaintive voice pitched to the exact point between lamentation and veneration is the ring of st ursula  indeed says c her ring  yes says the priest it was found in her tomb  it was found in her tombonly think says c turning gravely to me i had to look another way while the priest proceeded to introduce by name four remarkably yellow skulls with tastefully trimmed red caps on as those of st ursula and sundry of her most intimate friends s looked gloriously indignant and c increasingly solemn  dere said the priest opening an ivory box in which was about a quart of teeth of different sizes dere is de teeth of the eleven thousand  indeed echoes c their teeth  s at this waxed magnificent and as a novel writer would say swept from the apartment i turned round shaking with laughter while the priest went on  dere is a rib of st   ah his rib indeed  and dere is de arrow as pierced the heart of st ursula  h says c here is the arrow that killed st ursula the wicked scamp knew i was laughing  dere is the net that was on her hair  this is what she wore on her hair then says c eyeing the rag with severe and melancholy gravity  and here is some of the blood of the martyr stephen says the priest holding a glass case with some mud in it  in the same way he showed two thorns from the crown of christ and a piece of the virgins petticoat  and here is the waterpot of stone in which our lord made the wine at the marriage in cana  indeed said c examining it with great interest where are the rest of them  the rest says the priest  yes i think there were six of them where are they  the priest only went over the old story this came from rome and the piece broken out of the side is at rome yet  it is to be confessed that i felt in my heart through this disgusting recital some of ss indignation and i could not help agreeing with her that the odor of sanctity as generally developed in the vicinity was any thing but agreeable i did long to look that man once steadily in the eyes to see if he was such a fool as he pretended but the ridiculousness of the whole scene overcame me so that i could not look up and i marched out in silence the whole church is equally full of virgins the altar piece is a vast picture of the slaughter not badly painted through various glass openings you perceive that the walls are full of the bones and skulls did the worship of egypt ever sink lower in horrible and loathsome idolatry i had heard of such things but it is one thing to hear of them and another to see them by the light of this nineteenth century in a city whose streets look much like the streets of any other and where men and women appear much as they do any where else here we saw in one morning the splendor and the rottenness of the romish system from those majestic arches that triumphant chant there is but a step down to the worship of dead mens bones and all uncleanness  we went also into the jesuits church the effect to my eye was that of a profusion of tawdry dirty ornament only the railing of the choir which was a splendid piece of carving out from a single block of carrara marble  the guide book prescribes i think no less than half a dozen churches in cologne as a dose for the faithful but we were satisfied with these three and went back to our hotel as a general thing i would not recommend more than three churches on an empty stomach  the outer wall of cologne is a very fine specimen of fortification i am quoting my guide book and we got a perfect view of it in crossing the bridge of boats to return to our hotel why they have a bridge of boats here i cannot say perhaps on account of the width and swiftness of the river  having heard so much of the dirt and vile smells of cologne i was surprised that our drive took us through streets no way differing from those of most other cities and except in the vicinity of the eleven thousand virgins smelling no worse still there may be vile illsmelling streets but so there are in edinburgh london and new york  from cologne we went at four oclock to dusseldorf a little town celebrated for the head quarters of the dusseldorf school of painting i cannot imagine why they chose this town for a school of the fine arts as it is altogether an indifferent uninteresting place it is about an hours ride from cologne we arrived there in time to go into the exhibition of the works of the artists which is open all summer i dont know how good a specimen it is but i thought it rather indifferent there were some few paintings that interested me but nothing equal to those i have seen in the dusseldorf gallery at home whittridge lives there but unfortunately was gone for eight days  our hotel was pleasantopening on a walk shaded by double rows of trees we ordered a nice little tea in our room arid waxed quite merry over it  this morning we started at seven and here we are tonight in leipsicas uninteresting a country as i have seen yet moreover we had passed beyond the limits of our rhine guide book and as yet had no other and so did not know any thing about the few objects of interest which presented themselves the railroads of course persist in their invariable habit of running you up against a dead wall so that you see nothing where you stop  the city of magdeburg is the only interesting object i have seen i had a fair view of its cathedral which i think though not so imposing yet as picturesque and beautiful as any i remember to have seen and its old wall too we changed cars here going through the wall into the city and i saw just enough to make me wish to see more and now tonight we are in leipsic  morning we are going out now and i must mail this letter tomorrow we spend at halle     journalcontinued  friday august 5 dusseldorf to leipsic three hundred and seventythree miles a very level and apparently fertile country if well governed it ought to increase vastly in riches  saturday august 6 called at the counting house of m tauchnitz the celebrated publisher an hour after accompanied by mrs t he came with two open carriages and took us to see the city and environs we visited the battle ground and saw the spot where napoleon stood during the engagement a slight elevation commanding an immense plain in every direction with the spires of the city rising in the distance after seeing various sights of interest we returned to our hotel where our kind friends took their leave in the afternoon m tauchnitz sent h a package of his entertaining english publications to read in the cars also a murray for germany h and i then took the cars for halle where we hoped to spend the sabbath and meet with dr tholuck travellers sometimes visit chamouni without seeing mont blanc who remains enveloped in clouds during their stay so with us in an hour we were in rooms at the kron prince we sent a note to the professor the waiter returned saying that dr tholuck was at kissengen our theological mont blanc was hid in mist blank enough looked we  h is there no other professor we want to see  i believe not  pensively she read one of the tauchnitz library plaintively my amati sighed condolence  h said i perhaps we might reach dresden tonight  do you think so is it possible is there a train  we can soon ascertain  how amazed they would look  we summoned the maître dhotel ordered tea paid packed raced ran and hurried presto prestissimo into a car half choked with voyagers changed lines at leipsic and shot off to dresden by deep midnight we were thundering over the great stone pont delbe to the hotel de saxe where by one oclock we were lost in dreams  in the morning the question was how to find our party  waiter bring me a directory  there is no directory sir  no directory then how shall we contrive to find our friends  monsieur has friends residing in dresden  no no our party that came last night from leipsic  at what hotel do they stop  that is precisely what i wish to find out  will monsieur allow me to give their description to the police  0 ho thought i that is your directory is it wonder if that is the reason you have none printed non merci said i and set off on foot to visit the principal hotels i knew they would go by murray or bradshaw and lo sure enough they were at the hotel bellevue just sitting down to breakfast s started as if she had seen a ghost  why where did you come from what has happened where is h we thought you were in halle  explanations followed h was speedily transferred to their hotel where they had bespoken rooms for us and we sallied forth to the court church to hear the music of high mass  this music is celebrated throughout germany it is therefore undoubtedly superior the organ is noble the opera company royal but more perfect than all combined are the echoes of the church which though the guide book does not mention it nullify every effect  monday 8 visited the walks and gardens on the banks of the elbe the sky was clear the weather glorious and all nature full of joy we almost think this elbe another seine these bruhlsche gardens and terraces these majestic old bridges and cleft city another paris here too is that outofdoors life life in gardens we admire so much breakfast in the public gardens hundreds of little groups sipping their coffee dinner tea and supper in the gardens with music of birds and bands  visited the picture gallery if one were to chance upon an altar in this german athens inscribed to the unknown god he might be tempted to suggest that that deitys name is decency  the human form is indeed divine as m belloc insists and rightly sacredly drawn cannot offend the purest eye all nature is symbolic the universe itself is a complex symbol of spiritual ideas so in the structure and relation of the human body some of the highest spiritual ideas the divinest mysteries of pure worship are designedly shadowed forth  if then the painter rightly and sacredly conceives the divine meaning and creates upon the canvas or in marble forms of exalted ideal loveliness we cannot murmur even if like adam and eve in eden they are naked and are not ashamed  and yet even sacred things love mystery and holiest emotions claim reserve nature herself seems to tell us that the more sacred some works of art might be the less they should be unveiled there are flowers that will wither in the sun the passion of love when developed according to the divine order is even in its physical relations so holy that it cannot retain its delicacy under the sultry blaze of profane publicity  but it is far otherwise with paintings where the animus is not sacred nor the meaning spiritual no excellences of coloring no marvels of foreshortening no miracles of mechanism can consecrate the salacious images of mythologic abomination  the cheek that can forget to blush at the venus and cupid by titian at leda and her swan at jupiter and io and others of equally evil intent ought never to pretend to blush at any thing such pictures are a disgrace to the artists that painted to the age that tolerates and to the gallery that contains them they are fit for a bagnio rather than a public exhibition  evening dresden is the home of madame jenny lind goldschmidt h sent her card this evening mr g called to express regret that she was unable to see any one on account of her recent confinement he kindly offered us the use of his carriage and assistance in sightseeing h discussed with him the catalogues of the gallery of paintings as to music we learn with regret that it is out of season for concerts oratorios or any thing worth hearing  wednesday august 10 dresden to berlin drove to charlottenburg and saw the monument of queen louisa  thursday 11 visited the picture gallery and various stores and shops  saturday august 13 berlin to wittenberg two hours ride examined the schlosskirche where luther is buried passing on our way through the public square containing his monument  at nine in the evening took cars for erfurt that night ride with the moon and one star hanging beautifully over the horizon was pleasant there is a wild and thrilling excitement in thus plunging through the mysterious night in a land utterly unknown reached erfurt at two in the morning  monday august 15 erfurt to eisenach by eight drove to the wartburg     letter xliii  dresden  dear  i went to dresden as an artpilgrim principally to see raphaels great picture of the madonna di san sisto supposing that to be the best specimen of his genius out of italy on my way i diligently studied the guide book of that indefatigable friend of the traveller mr murray in which descriptions of the finest pictures are given with the observations of artists so that inexperienced persons may know exactly what to think and where to think it my expectations had been so often disappointed that my pulse was somewhat calmer nevertheless the glowing eulogiums of these celebrated artists could not but stimulate anticipation we made our way therefore first to the salon devoted to the works of raphael and correggio and soon found ourselves before the grand painting trembling with eagerness i looked up was that the picture w whispered to me i think we have mistaken the painting  no we have not said i struggling to overcome the disappointment which i found creeping over me the source of this disappointment was the thin and faded appearance of the coloring which at first suggested to me the idea of a watercolored sketch it had evidently suffered barbarously in the process of cleaning a fact of which i had been forewarned this circumstance has a particularly unfavorable effect on a picture of raphaels because his coloring at best is delicate and reserved and as compared with that of rubens approaches to poverty so that he can ill afford to lose any thing in this way  then as to conception and arrangement there was much which annoyed me the virgin and child in the centre are represented as rising in the air on one side below them is the kneeling figure of pope sixtus and on the other that of st barbara now this pope sixtus is in my eyes a very homely old man and as i think no better of homely old men for being popes his presence in the picture is an annoyance st barbara on the other side has the most beautiful head and face that could be represented but then she is kneeling on a cloud with such a judicious and coquettish arrangement of her neck shoulders and face to show every fine point in them as makes one feel that no saint unless with a parisian education could ever have dropped into such a position in the abandon of holy rapture in short she looks like a theatrical actress without any sympathy with the solemnity of the religious conception who is there merely because a beautiful woman was wanted to fill up the picture  then that old faded green curtain which is painted as hanging down on either side of the picture is to my eye a nuisance the whole interest therefore of the piece concentrates in the centre figures the madonna and child and two angel children gazing up from the foot of the picture these angel children were the first point on which my mind rested in its struggle to overcome its disappointment and bring itself en rapport with the artist in order fully to appreciate their spiritual beauty one must have seen an assortment of those things called angels which occur in the works of the old masters generally speaking i know of nothing more calculated to moderate any undue eagerness to go to heaven than the common run of canvas angels far the greater part are roistering ablebodied fellows with wings giving indisputable signs of good living and of a coarseness slightly suggestive of blackguardism far otherwise with these fair creatures with their rainbowcolored wings and their serene upturned eyes of thought baptized with emotion they are the first things i have seen worthy of my ideas of raphael  as to the madonna i think that when wilkie says she is nearer the perfection of female elegance and grace than any thing in painting he does not speak with discrimination mere physical beauty and grace are not the characteristics of the figure many more perfect forms can be found both on canvas and in marble but the merits of the figure to my mind are first its historic accuracy in representing the darkeyed jewish maiden second the wonderful fulness and depth of expression thrown into the face and third the mysterious resemblance and sympathy between the face of the mother and that of the divine child to my eye this picture has precisely that which murillos assumption in the louvre wants it has an unfathomable depth of earnestness the murillo is its superior in coloring and grace of arrangement at first sight of the murillo every one exclaims at once plow beautifulat sight of this they are silent many are at first disappointed but the picture fastens the attention and grows upon the thoughts while that of murillo is dismissed with the words of admiration on the lips  this picture excited my ponderings and inquiries there was a conflict of emotion in that mothers face and shadowed mysteriously in the childs of which i queried was it fear was it sorrow was it adoration and faith was it a presage of the hour when a sword should pierce through her own soul yet with this was there not a solemn triumph in the thought that she alone of all women had been called to that baptism of anguish and in that infant face there seemed a foreshadowing of the spirit which said now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour  the deepfeeling soul which conceived this picture has spread over the whole divine group a tender and transparent shadow of sorrow it is this idea of sorrow in heavensorrow for the lost in the heart of god himselfwhich forms the most sacred mystery of christianity and into this innermost temple of sorrow had raphael penetrated he is a sacred poet and his poetry has precisely that trait which milton lackstenderness and sympathy this picture so unattractive to the fancy in merely physical recommendations has formed a deeper part of my inner consciousness than any i have yet seen i can recall it with perfect distinctness and often return to ponder it in my heart  in this room there was also the chefdluvre of correggiohis celebrated notte or the nativity of jesus and that you may know what i ought to have thought i will quote you a sentence from wilkie all the powers of art are here united to make a perfect work here the simplicity of the drawing of the virgin and child is shown in contrast with the foreshortening of the group of angelsthe strongest unity of effect with the most perfect system of intricacy the emitting the light from the body of the child though a supernatural illusion is eminently successful the matchless beauty of the virgin and child the group of angels overhead the daybreak in the sky and the whole arrangement of light and shadow give it a right to be considered in conception at least the greatest of his works  i said before that light and shadow were correggios godsthat the great purpose for which he lived moved and had his being was to show up light and shadow now so long as he paints only indifferent objectsnymphs and fauns and mythologic divinitiesi had no objection light and shadow are beautiful things capable of a thousand blendings softenings and harmonizings which one loves to have represented the great artist of all loves light and shadow why else does he play such a magical succession of changes upon them through all creation but for an artist to make the most solemn mystery of religion a mere tributary to the exhibition of a trick of art is a piece of profanity what was in this mans head when he painted this representation of the hour when his maker was made flesh that he might redeem a world nothing but chiaroscuro and foreshortening this overwhelming scene would give him a fine chance to do two things first to represent a phosphorescent light from the body of the child and second to show off some foreshortened angels now as to these angels i have simply to remark that i should prefer a seraphs head to his heels and that a group of archangels kicking from the canvas with such alarming vigor however much it may illustrate foreshortening does not illustrate either glory to god in the highest or peace on earth and good will to men therefore i have quarrelled with correggio as i always expected to do if he profaned the divine mysteries how could any one who had a soul to understand that most noble creation of raphael turn the next moment to admire this  here also are six others of correggios most celebrated paintings they are all mere representations of the physical with little of the moral his picture of the virgin and child represents simply a very graceful beautiful woman holding a fine little child his peculiar excellences in the management of his lights and shades appear in all  in one of the halls we found a magdalen by battoni which gave me more pleasure on first sight than any picture in the gallery it is a lifesized figure of the magdalen stretched upon the ground reading an open bible i like it first because the figure is every way beautiful and well proportioned second on account of an elevated simplicity hi the arrangement and general effect the dark rocky background throws out distinctly the beautiful figure raised on one elbow her long golden hair floating loosely down as she bends forward over her book with parted lips slightly flushed cheek and an air of rapt and pleased attention though the neck and bosom are exposed yet there is an angelic seriousness and gravity in the conception of the piece which would check an earthly thought the woman is of that high class about whom there might seem to be a hovering angelic presencethe perfection of beauty and symmetry without a tinge of sensual attraction  all these rooms are full of artists copying different paintingssome upon slabs of dresden chinaproducing pictures of exquisite finish and very pretty as boudoir ornaments  after exhausting this first room we walked through the galleries which i will name to give you some idea of their extent  two rooms of old german and dutch masters are curiousas exhibiting the upward struggles of art many of the pictures are hard as a tavern sign and as ill drawn but they mark the era of dawning effort  then a long corridor of dutch paintings in which rubens figures conspicuously displaying as usual all manner of scarlet abominations mixed with most triumphant successes he has a boar hunt here which is absolutely terrific rubens has a power peculiar to himself of throwing into the eyes of animals the phosphorescent magnetic gleam of life and passion here also was a sketch of his for a large picture at munich of the last judgment in which the idea of physical torture is enlarged upon with a most revolting vigor of imagery  then a small room devoted to the spanish and italian schools containing pictures by murillo and velasquez then the french hall where were two magnificent claudes the finest i had yet seen they were covered with glass a bad arrangement which rendered one of them almost entirely unseeable i studied these long with much interest the combinations were poetical the foregrounds minutely finished even to the painting of flowers and the fine invisible veil of ether that covers the natural landscape given as i have never before seen it the peculiarity of these pieces is that they are painted in greena most common arrangement in gods landscapes but very uncommon in those of great masters painters give us trees and grounds brown yellow red chocolate any color in short but green the reason of this is that green is an exceedingly difficult color to manage i have seen sometimes in spring set against a deepblue sky an array of greens from lightest yellow to deepest blue of the pines tipped and glittering with the afternoons sun yet so swathed in some invisible harmonizing medium that the strong contrasts of color jarred upon no sense all seemed to be bound by the invisible cestus of some celestial venus yet what painter would dare attempt the same herein lies the particular triumph of claude it is said that he took his brush and canvas into the fields and there studied hour after hour into the mysteries of that airy medium which lies between the eye and the landscape as also between the foreground and the background hence he more than others succeeds in giving the green landscape and the blue sky the same effect that god gives them if then other artists would attain a like result let them not copy claude but claudes master would that our american artists would remember that gods pictures are nearer than italy to them it might be said as to the christian the word is nigh thee when we shall see a new england artist with his easel in the fields seeking hour after hour to reproduce on the canvas the magnificent glories of an elm with its firmament of boughs and brancheswhen he has learned that there is in it what is worth a thousand claudesthen the morning star of art will have risen on our hills god send us an artist with a heart to reverence his own native mountains and fields and to veil his face in awe when the great master walks before his cottage door when shall arise the artist whose inspiration shall be in prayer and in communion with godwhose eye unsealed to behold his beauty in the natural world shall offer up on canvas landscapes which shall be hymns and ascriptions  by a strange perversity people seem to think that the author of nature cannot or will not inspire art but he that formed the eye shall he not see he that planted the ear shall he not hear are not gods works the great models and is not sympathy of spirit with the master necessary to the understanding of the models  but to continue our walk we entered another dutch apartment embellished with works by dietrich prettily colored and laboriously minute then into a corridor devoted chiefly to the works of rembrandt and scholars in this also were a number of those minute culinary paintings in which cabbages brass kettles onions potatoes c are reproduced with praiseworthy industry many people are enraptured with these but for my part i have but a very little more pleasure in a turnip onion or potato in a picture than out and always wish that the industry and richness of color had been bestowed upon things in themselves beautiful the great master it is true gives these models but he gives them not to be looked at but eaten if painters could only contrive to paint vegetables cheaply so that they could be eaten i would be willing  two small saloons are next devoted to the modern dutch and german school in these is denners head of an old woman which cowper celebrates in a pretty poema marvel of faithful reproduction one would think the old lady must have sat at least a year till he had daguerreotyped every wrinkle and twinkle how much better all this labor spent on the head of a good old woman than on the head of a cabbage  and now come a set of italian rooms in which we have some curious specimens of the romish development in religion as for instance the fathers gregory augustine and jerome meditating on the immaculate conception of the virgin think of a painter employing all his powers in representing such a fog bank  next comes a room dedicated to the works of titian in which two nude venuses of a very different character from the de milon are too conspicuous titian is sensuous a greek but not of the highest class  the next room is devoted to paul veronese this paul has quite a character of his owna grand old venetian with his head full of stateliness and court ceremony and gorgeous conventionality half oriental in his passion for gold and gems and incense as a specimen of the subjects in which his soul delights take the following which he has wrought up into a mammoth picture faith love and hope presenting to the virgin mary a member of the old venetian family of concina who after having listened to the doctrines of the reformation had become reconciled to the church here is pauls piety naively displayed by giving to the virgin all the courtly graces of a highborn signorina he paints too the adoration of the magi because it gives such a good opportunity to deal with camels jewels turbans and all the trappings of oriental royalty the virgin and child are a small part of the affair i like paul because he is so innocently unconscious of any thing deep to be expressed so honestly intent on clothes jewels and colors he is a magnificent master of ceremonies and ought to have been kept by some king desirous of going down to posterity to celebrate his royal praise and glory  another room is devoted to the works of guido one or two of the ecce homo are much admired to me they are as compared with my conceptions of jesus more than inadequate it seems to me that if jesus christ should come again on earth and walk through a gallery of paintings and see the representations of sacred subjects he would say again as he did of old in the temple take these things hence  how could men who bowed down before art as an idol and worshipped it as an ultimate end and thus sensualized it represent these holy mysteries into which angels desired to look  there are many representations of christ here set forth in the guide book as full of grace and majesty which any soul who has ever felt his infinite beauty would reject as a libel and as to the virgin mother ones eye becomes wearied in following the countless catalogue of the effeminate inane representations  there is more pathos and beauty in those few words of the scripture now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother than in all these galleries put together the soul that has learned to know her from the bible loving without idolizing hoping for blest communion with her beyond the veil seeking to imitate only the devotion which stood by the cross in the deepest hour of desertion cannot be satisfied with these insipidities  only once or twice have i seen any thing like an approach towards the representations of the scriptural idea one is this painting by raphael another is by him and is called madonna maison dalba of this i have seen only a copy it might have been painted on the words now mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart the figure is that of a young jewess between girl and womanhood in whose air and eye are expressed at once the princess of the house of david the poetess and the thoughtful sequestered maiden she is sitting on the ground the book of the prophets in one hand lying listless at her side the other hand is placed beneath the chin of her infant son who looks inquiringly into her face she does not see himher eye has a sorrowful fardarting look as if beyond this flowery childhood she saw the dim image of a cross and a sepulchre this was mary i have often thought that in the reaction from the idolatry of romanism we protestants were in danger of forgetting the treasures of religious sweetness which the bible has given us in her brief history  it seems to me the time demands the forming of a new school of art based upon protestant principles for whatever vigor and originality there might once be in art based on romanism it has certainly been worn threadbare by repetition  apropos to this during the time i was in paris i formed the acquaintance of schoeffer whose christus consolator and remumrator and other works have made him known in america i went with a lady who has for many years been an intimate friend and whose head has been introduced into several of his paintings on the way she gave me some interesting particulars of him and his family his mother was an artista woman of singularly ethereal and religious character there are three brothers devoted to art of these ary is the one best known in america and the most distinguished for some time while they were studying they were obliged to be separated and the mother to keep up the sympathy between them used to copy the design of the one with whom she resided for the other two a singular strength of attachment unites the family  we found schoeffer in retired lodgings in the outskirts of paris and were presented to his very pretty and agreeable english wife in his studio we saw a picture of his mother a most lovely and delicate woman dressed in white like one of the saints in the revelation  then we saw his celebrated picture francisca rimini representing a cloudy dark infernal region in which two hapless lovers are whirled round and round in mazes of neverending wrath and anguish his face is hid from view his attitude expresses the extreme of despair but she clinging to his bosomwhat words can tell the depths of love of an anguish and of endurance unconquerable written in her pale sweet face the picture smote to my heart like a dagger thrust i felt its mournful exquisite beauty as a libel on my father in heaven  no it is not god who eternally pursues undying patient love with storms of vindictive wrath alas well said jesus o righteous father the world hath not known thee the day will come when it will appear that in earths history the sorrowing invincible tenderness has been all on his part and that the strange word longsuffering means just what it says  nevertheless the power and pathos of this picture cannot be too much praised the coloring is beautiful and though it pained me so much i felt that it was one of the most striking works of art i had seen  schoeffer showed us a large picture about half finished in which he represents the gradual rise of the soul through the sorrows of earth to heaven it consisted of figures grouped together those nearest earth bowed down and overwhelmed with the most crushing and hopeless sorrow above them are those who are beginning to look upward and the sorrow in their faces is subsiding into anxious inquiry still above them are those who having caught a gleam of the sources of consolation express in their faces a solemn calmness and still higher rising in the air figures with clasped hands and absorbed upward gaze to whose eye the mystery has been unveiled the enigma solved and sorrow glorified one among these higher than the rest with a face of rapt adoration seems entering the very gate of heaven  he also showed us an unfinished picture of the temptation of christ upon a clear aerial mountain top satan a thunderscarred unearthly figure kneeling points earnestly to the distant view of the kingdoms of this world there is a furtive and peculiar expression of eager anxiety betrayed in his face as if the bitterness of his own blasted eternity could find a momentary consolation in this success it is the expression of a general who has staked all his fortune on one die of the figure of jesus i could not judge in its unfinished state whether the artist will solve the problem of uniting energy with sweetness the godhead with the manhood remains to be seen  the paintings of jesus are generally unsatisfactory but schoefier has approached nearer towards expressing my idea than any artist i have yet seen  the knowing ones are much divided about schoeffer some say he is no painter nothing seems to me so utterly without rule or compass as this world of art divided into little cliques each with his shibboleth artists excommunicate each other as heartily as theologians and a neophyte who should attempt to make up a judgment by their help would be obliged to shift opinions with every circle  i therefore look with my own eyes for if not the best that might be they are the best that god has given me  schoeffer is certainly a poet of a high order his ideas are beautiful and religious and his power of expression quite equal to that of many old masters who had nothing very particular to express  i should think his chief danger lay in falling into mannerism and too often repeating the same idea he has a theory of coloring which is in danger of running out into coldness and poverty of effect his idea seems to be that in the representation of spiritual subjects the artist should avoid the sensualism of color and give only the most chaste and severe tone hence he makes much use of white pale blue and cloudy grays avoiding the gorgeousness of the old masters but it seems probable that in the celestial regions there is more rather than less of brilliant coloring than on earth what can be more brilliant than the rainbow yet what more perfectly free from earthly grossness nevertheless in looking at the pictures of schoeffer there is such a serene and spiritual charm spread over them that one is little inclined to wish them other than they are no artist that i have ever seen not even raphael has more power of glorifying the human face by an exalted and unearthly expression his head of joan of arc at versailles is a remarkable example it is a commentary on that scriptureand they beheld his face as it were the face of an angel  schoeffer is fully possessed with the idea of which i have spoken of raising protestant art above the wearisome imitations of romanism the object is noble and important i feel that he must succeed  his best award is in the judgments of the unsophisticated heart a painter who does not burn incense to his palette and worship his brushes who reverences ideas above mechanism will have all manner of evil spoken against him by artists but the human heart will always accept him     letter xliv  berlin august 10  my dear  here we are in berlina beautiful city these places that kings build have of course more general uniformity and consistency of style than those that grow up by chance the prevalence of the greek style of architecture the regularity and breadth of the streets the fine trees especially in the unter den linden on which are our rooms struck me more than any thing i have seen since paris why paris charms me so much more than other cities of similar recommendations i cannot say any more than a man can tell why he is fascinated by a lady love no fairer to his reason than a thousand others perhaps it is the reflected charm of the people i knew there that makes it seem so sunny  this afternoon we took a guide and went first through the royal palace the new chapel which is being built by the present prince is circular in form with a dome one hundred and thirty feet high the space between the doors is occupied by three circular recesses with figures of prophets and apostles in fresco over one door is the nativityover the other the resurrectionalso in fresco on the walls around were pictures somewhat miscellaneous i thought for example john huss st cecilia melanchthon luther several women saints apostles and evangelists these paintings are all by the first german artists the floor is a splendid mosaic and the top of the dome is richly adorned with frescoes  still though beautiful the chapel seemed to me deficient in unity of effect one admires the details too much to appreciate it as a whole we passed through the palace rooms its paintings are far inferior to those of windsor the finest royal paintings have gone to adorn the walls of the museum there was one magnificent vandyke into which he has introduced a large dogsome relief from his eternal horses there was davids picture of bonaparte crossing the alps of which mrs p has the engraving and you can tell her that it is much more impressive than the painting opposite to this picture hangs blucher looking about as amiable as one might suppose a captain of a regiment of mastiffs our guide pointing to the portrait of napoleon with evident pride said blucher brought that from paris he said napoleon had carried so many pictures from other countries to paris that now he should be carried away himself  there were portraits of queen louisa very beautiful of queen victoria a present one of the empress of russia also a statue of the latter the ball room contained a statue of victory by ranch a beautiful female figure the model of which we were told is his own daughter he had the grace to allow her some clothing which was fatherly for an artist the palace rooms were very magnificent the walls were covered with a damask of silk and gold into which was inwrought the prussian eagle in the crowning room was an immense quantity of plate in solid gold and silver the guide seemed not a little proud of our king princes and palace men will attach themselves to power and splendor as naturally as moss will grow on a rock there is perhaps a foundation for this in human nature witness the israelites of old who could not rest till they obtained a king the guide told us there were nine hundred rooms in the palace but that he should only take us through the best we were duly sensible of the mercy  then we drove to charlottenburg to see the mausoleum i know not when i have been more deeply affected than there and yet not so much by the sweet lifelike statue of the queen as by that of the king her husband executed by the same hand such an expression of longdesired rest after suffering and toil is shed over the faceso sweet so heavenly there where he has prayed year after yearhoping yearning longingthere at last he rests lifes long anguish over my heart melted as i looked at these two so long dividedhe so long a mourner she so long mournednow calmly resting side by side in a sleep so tranquil  we went through the palace we saw the present kings writing desk and table in his study just as he left them his writing establishment is about as plain as yours men who really mean to do any thing do not use fancy tools his bed room also is in a style of severe simplicity there were several engravings fastened against the wall and in the anteroom a bust and medallion of the empress eugeniea thing which i should not exactly have expected in a born kings palace but beauty is sacred and kings cannot call it parvenu then we went into the queens bed room finished in green and then through the rooms of queen louisa those marks of her presence which you saw during the old kings lifetime are now removed we saw no traces of her dresses gloves or books in one room draped in white muslin over pink we were informed the empress of russia was born  in going out to charlottenburg we rode through the thiergarten the tuileries of berlin in one of the most quiet and sequestered spots is the monument erected by the people of berlin to their old king the pedestal is carrara marble sculptured with beautiful scenes called garden pleasureschildren in all manner of outdoor sports and parents fondly looking on it is graceful and peculiarly appropriate to those grounds where parents and children are constantly congregating the whole is surmounted by a statue of the king in white marblethe finest representation of him i have ever seen thoughtful yet benign the old king seems like a good father keeping a grave and affectionate watch over the pleasures of his children in their garden frolics there was something about these mossgrown gardens that seemed so rural and pastoral that i at once preferred them to all i had seen in europe choice flowers are planted in knots here and there in sheltered nooks as if they had grown by accident and an air of sweet natural wildness is left amid the most careful cultivation the people seemed to be enjoying themselves less demonstratively and with less vivacity than in france but with a calm inwardness each nation has its own way of being happy and the style of life in each bears a certain relation of appropriateness to character the trim gay dressy animated air of the tuileries suits admirably with the mobile sprightly vivacity of society there both in their way are beautiful but this seems less formal and more according to nature  as we were riding home our guide who was a full feathered monarchist told us with some satisfaction the number of palaces in prussia suddenly to my astonishment young america struck into the conversation in the person of little g  we do things more economically in america our president dont have sixty palaces he has to be satisfied with one white house  the guide entered into an animated defence of king and country these palacesdid not the king keep them for the people did he not bear all the expense of caring for them that they might furnish public pleasure grounds and exhibition rooms had we not seen the people walking about in them and enjoying themselves  this was all true enough and we assented the guide continued did not the king take the public money to make beautiful museums for the people where they could study the fine artsand did our government do any such thing  i thought of our surplus revenue and laid my hand on my mouth but yet there is a progress of democratic principle indicated by this very understanding that the king is to hold things for the benefit of the people times are altered since louis xiv was instructed by his tutor as he looked out on a crowd of people these are all yours and since he said lélot cest moi  our guide seemed to feel bound however to exhaust himself in comparison of our defects with their excellences  some prussians went over to america to live he said and had to come back again they could not live there  why not said i  o they said there was nothing done there but working and going to church  thats a fact said w with considerable earnestness  yes said our guide they said we have but one life to live and we want to have some comfort in it  it is a curious fact that just in proportion as a country is free and selfgoverned it has fewer public amusements america and scotland have the fewest of any and italy the most nevertheless i am far from thinking that this is either necessary or desirable the subject of providing innocent public amusements for the masses is one that we ought seriously to consider in berlin and in all other german cities there are gardens and public grounds in which there are daily concerts of a high order and various attractions to which people can gain admittance for a very trifling sum these refine the feelings and cultivate the taste they would be particularly useful in america in counteracting that tendency to a sordid materialism which is one of our great national dangers  we went over the berlin museum in general style greekbut greek vitalized by the infusion of the german mind in its general arrangements one of the most gorgeous and impressive combinations of art which i have seen here are the great frescoes of kaulbach cornelius and other german artists who have so grafted grecian ideas into the german stock that the growth has the foliage and coloring of a new plant one set of frescoes representing the climate and scenery of greece had on me a peculiar and magical effect alas there never has been the greece that we conceive we see it under the soft purple veil of distance like an alpine valley embraced by cloudy mountains but there was the same coarse dust and débris of ordinary life there as with us the true arcadia lies beyond the grave the collection of pictures is rich in historic curiositiesvaluable as marking the progress of art one claude lorraine here was a matchless specimena perfect victory over all the difficulties of green landscape painting     letter xlv  wittenberg  my dear  i am here in the station house at wittenberg i have been seeing and hearing today for you and now sit down to put on paper the results of my morning what make you from wittenberg wittenberg name of the dreamy past dimly associated with hamlet denmark the moonlight terrace and the baltic sea by one line of shakspeare but made more living by those who have thought loved and died here nay by those who cannot die and whose life has been life to all coming ages  how naturally on reaching a place long heard of and pondered do we look round for something uncommon quaint and striking nothing of the kind was here only the dead flat of this most level scenery with its dreary prairielike sameness certainly it was not this scenery that stirred up a soul in luther and made him nail up his theses on the wittenberg church door  but at any rate let us go to wittenberg said i get a guide a carriage cannot you as i walked to one window of the station house and another and looked out to see something wonderful nothing was in sight however and after the usual sputter of gutturals which precedes any arrangement in this country we were mounted in a high awkward carriage and rode to the town two ancient round tower and a wall first met my eye then a drawbridge arched passage and portcullis under this passage we passed and at our right hand was the church where once was laid the worn form that had stood so many whirlwindswhere in short luther was buried but this we did not then know so we drove by and went to a hotel talked english and got german talked french with no better success at last between w g and the dictionary managed to make it understood that we wanted a guide to the luther relics a guide was after a time forthcoming in the person of a little woman who spoke no english whom guide book in hand we followed  the church is ancient and externally impressive enough inside it is wide cold whitewashed prosaic whoever gets up feeling does it against wind and tide so far as appearances are concerned we advance to the spot in the floor where our guide raises a trap door and shows us underneath the plate inscribed with the name of luther and by it the plate recording the restingplace of his wellbeloved philip melanchthon then to the grave of the elector of saxony and john the steadfast on one side a full length of luther by lucas cranach on the other one of melanchthon by the same hand well we have seen this is all he is not here he is risen is this all all says our guide and we go out i look curiously at the old door where luther nailed up his theses but even this is not the identical door that was destroyed by the french still under that arched doorway he stood hammer and nails in hand he held up his paper he fitted it straight rap rapthere one nailanotherit is up and he stands looking at it these very stones were over that head that are now over mine this very ground beneath his feet as i turned away i gave an earnest look at the old church grass is growing on its buttresses it has a desolate look though strong and well kept the party pass on and i make haste to overtake them  down we go doing penance over the round paving stones and our next halt is momentary in the marketplace before the town house a huge threegabled building like a beast of three horns stands luthers bronze monument apple women and pear women onion and beet women are thickly congregated around selling as best they may there stands luther looking benignantly holding and pointing to the open bible the women meanwhile thinking we want fruit hold up their wares and talk german but our conductress has a regular guides trot inexorable as fate so on we go  wittenberg is now a mean little town all looks poor and low yet it seems like a place that has seen better days houses now used as paltry shops have some of them carved oaken doors with antic freaks of architecture which seem to signify that their former owners were able to make a figure in the world in fact the houses seem a sort of phantasmagoria of decayed gentlefolk in the faded tarnished oldfashioned finery of the past our guide halts her trot suddenly before a house which she announces as that of louis cranach then on she goes louis is dead and magdalen his wife also so there is no one there to welcome us on we go also once louis was a man of more consequence  now we come to luthers housea part of the old convent wide yawns the stone doorway of the court a grinning masque grotesquely looks down from its centre and odd carvings from the sides a colony of swallows have established their nests among the queer old carvings and gnomelike faces and are twittering in and out superintending their domestic arrangements we enter a court surrounded with buildings then ascend through a strange doorway a winding staircase passing small lozengeshaped window up these stairs he oft trod in all the moods of that manifold and wonderful naturegay joyous jocose fervent defiant imploring and up these stairs have trod wondering visitors thronging from all parts of the world to see the man of the age up these stairs come philip melanchthon lucas cranach and their wives to see how fares luther after some short journey or some new movement now all past all solitary the stairs dirty the windows dim  illustration of luthers room  and this is luthers room it was a fine one in its day that is plain the arched recesses of the windows the roof divided in squares and like the walls and cornice painted in fresco the windows with their quaint round panesall though now so soiled and dim speak plainly of a time when life was here and all things wore a rich and joyous glow in this room that great heart rejoiced in the blessedness of domestic life and poured forth some of those exulting strains glorifying the family state which yet remain here his little magdalen his little jacky and the rest made joyous uproar  there stands his writing table a heavy mass of wood clumsy as the time and its absurdities rougher now than ever in its squalid old age and partly chipped away by relic seekers here he sat here lay his paper over this table was bent that head whose brain power was the earthquake of europe here he wrote books which he says were rained hailed and snowed from the press in every language and tongue kings and emperors could not bind the influence from this writing table and yet here doubtless he wrestled struggled prayed and such tears as only he could shed fell upon it nothing of all this says the table it only stands a poor ungainly relic of the past the inspiring angel is gone upward  catharines nicelycarved cabinet with its huge bunches of oaken flowers hanging down between its glass panels shows luthers drinking cup there is also his embroidered portrait on which doubtless she expended much thought as she evidently has much gold thread i seem to see her conceiving the bold designshe will work the doctors likeness she asks magdalen cranachs opinion and magdalen asks lucass and there is a deal of discussion and lucas makes wise suggestions in the course of many fireside chats the thing grows philip and his kate dropping in are shown it little jacky and magdalen looking shyly over their mothers shoulder are wonderfully impressed with the likeness and think their mother a great woman luther takes it in hand and passes some jests upon it which make them laugh all round and so at last it grows to be a veritable likeness poor faded tarnished thing it looks like a ghost now  in one corner is a work of art by lutherno less than a stove planned after his own pattern it is a high black iron pyramid panelled each panel presenting in relief some scripture subject considering the remote times this stove is quite an affair the figures are some of them spirited and well conceived though now its lustre like all else here is obscured by dust and dirt why do the germans leave this place so dirty the rooms of shakspeare are kept clean and in repair the catholics enshrine in gold and silver the relics of their saints but this protestant mecca is left literally to the moles and the bats  i slipped aside a panel in the curious old windows and looked down into the court surrounded by the university buildings i fancied the old times when students with their scholastic caps and books were momently passing and repassing i thought of the stir there was here when the popes bull against luther came out and of the pattering of feet and commotion there were in this court when luther sallied out to burn the popes bull under the oak just beyond the city wall near by the students thought it good fun students are always progressive they admired the old boy for his spirit they threw up caps and shouted and went out to see the ceremony with a will philip melanchthon wondered if brother martin was not going a little too fast but hoped it would be overruled and that all would be for the best so coming out i looked longingly beyond the city gate and wanted to go to the place of the oak tree where the ceremony was performed but the party had gone on  illustration of melanchthons house  coming back i made a pause opposite the house on which is seen the inscription here melanchthon lived labored and died a very good house it was too in its day in architecture it was not unlike this i went across the street to take a good look at it then i came over and as the great arched door stood open i took the liberty of walking in like other continental houses this had an arched passage running through to a back court and a side door a stone stairway led up from this into the house and a small square window with little round panes looked through into the passage a young child was toddling about there and i spoke to it a man came out and looked as if he rather wondered what i might be about so i retreated then i threaded my way past queer peakedroofed buildings to a paved court where stood the old churchsomething like that in halle a great gothic structure with two high towers connected by a gallery i entered like the other church it has been whitewashed and has few architectural attractions it is very large with two galleries one over the other and might hold i should think five thousand people  here luther preached these walls now so silent rung to the rare melody of that voice to which the roman catholic writers attributed some unearthly enchantment so did it sway all who listened here clustering round these pillars standing on these flags were myriads of human beings and what heartbeatings what surgings of thought what tempests of feeling what aspirations what strivings what conflicts shook that multitude and possessed them as he spoke i preach he said not for professor this or that nor for the elector or prince but for poor jack behind the door and so striking only on the chords common to all hearts he bowed all for he who can inspire the illiterate and poor callous with ignorance and toil can move also the better informed here also that voice of his which rose above the choir and organ sang the alto in those chorals which he gave to the world monmouth sung in this great church by five thousand voices must needs have a magnificent sound  the altarpiece is a lords supper by louis cranach who appears in the foreground as a servant on each side are the pictures of the sacraments in baptism melanchthon stands by a laver holding a dripping baby whom he has just immersed one of luthers children i suppose for he is standing by a venerable personage in a long beard holds the towel to receive the little neophyte from all i know of babies i should think this form of baptism liable to inconvenient accessories and consequences on the other side luther is preaching and opposite foremost of his audience are catharine and her little son every thing shows how strictly intimate were luther melanchthon and cranach good sociable times they had together a slab elaborately carved in the side of the church marks the last rest of lucas and magdalen cranach  i passed out of the church and walked slowly down to the hotel purchasing by the way at a mean little shop some tolerable engravings of luthers room the church c to show how immutable every thing has been in wittenberg since luther died let me mention that on coming back through the marketplace we found spread out for sale upon a cloth about a dozen pairs of shoes of the precise pattern of those belonging to luther which we had seen in frankfortclumsy rude and heelless i have heard that swedenborg said that in his visit to the invisible world he encountered a class of spirits who had been there fifty years and had not yet found out that they were dead these wittenbergers i think must be of the same conservative turn of mind  failing to get a carriage to the station we started to walk i paused a moment before the church to make some little corrections and emendations in my engravings and thought as i was doing so of that quite other scene years ago when the body of luther was borne through this gate by a concourse of weeping thousands these stones on which i was standing then echoed all night to the tread of a closelypacked multitudea muffled sound like the patter of rain among leaves there rose through the long dark hours alternately the unrestrained sobbings of the throng and the grand choral of luthers psalms words and music of his own never since the world began was so strange a scene as that i felt a kind of shadow from it as i walked homeward gazing on the flat dreamy distance a great windmill was creaking its sombre lazy vanes round and roundstrange goblin things these windmillsand i thought of one of luthers sayings the heart of a human creature is like the millstones if corn be shaken thereon it grindeth the corn and maketh good meal but if no corn be there then it grindeth away itself luther tried the latter process all the first part of his life but he got the corn at last and a magnificent grist he made  arrived at the station we found we must wait till half past five in the afternoon for the train this would have been an intolerable doom in the disconsolate precincts of an english or american station but not in a german one as usual this had a charming garden laid out with exquisite taste and all glowing and fragrant with plats of verbena fuschias heliotropes mignonette pansies while rows of hothouse flowers set under the shelter of neatly trimmed hedges gave brightness to the scene among all these pretty grounds were seats and walks and a gardener with his dear pipe in his mouth was moving about watering his dear flowers thus combining the two delights of a german flowers and smoke these germans seem an odd race a mixture of clay and spiritwhat with their beer drinking and smoking and their slow stolid ways you would think them perfectly earthly but an ethereal fire is all the while working in them and bursting out in most unexpected little jets of poetry and sentiment like blossoms on a cactus  the station room was an agreeable one painted prettily in frescoes with two sofas so we arranged ourselves in a party s and i betook ourselves to our embroidery and c read aloud to us or tried the amati and when we were tired of reading and music we strolled in the garden and i wrote to you  i wonder why we anglosaxons cannot imitate the liberality of the continent in the matter of railroad stations and give the traveller something more agreeable than the grim bare forbidding places which now obtain in england and america this wittenberg is but a paltry town and yet how much care is spent to make the station house comfortable and comely i may here say that nowhere in europe is railway travelling so entirely convenient as in germany particularly in prussia all is systematic and orderly no hurrying or shoving or disagreeable fuss at stations the second class cars are in most points as good as the first class in england the conductors are dignified and gentlemanly you roll on at a most agreeable pace from one handsome station house to another finding yourself disposed to be pleased with every thing  there is but one drawback to all this and that is the smoking mythologically represented these germans might be considered as a race born of chimneys with a necessity for smoking in their very nature a german walking without his pipe is only a dormant volcano it is in him to smoke all the while you may be sure the crater will begin to fume before long smoking is such an acknowledged attribute of manhood that the gentler sex seem to have given in to it as one of the immutable things of nature consequently all the public places where both sexes meet are redolent of tobacco you see a gentleman doing the agreeable to a lady cigar in mouth treating her alternately to an observation and a whiff both of which seem to her equally matters of course in the cars some attempt at regulation subsists there are cars marked nich rauchen into which we were always very careful to get but even in these it is not always possible to make a german suspend an operation which is to him about the same as breathing  on our way from frankfort to halle in a nich rauchen car too a jolly old gentleman whose joyous and abundant german sounded to me like the clatter of a thousand of brick wound up a kind of promiscuous avalanche of declamation by pulling a matchbox from his pocket and proceeding deliberately to light his pipe the tobacco was detestable now if a man must smoke i think he is under moral obligation to have decent tobacco i began to turn ill and c attacked the offender in french not a word did he understand and puffed on tranquil and happy the idea that any body did not like smoke was probably the last that could ever be made to enter his head even in a language that he did understand c then enlisted the next neighbor who understood french and got him to interpret that smoke made the lady ill the chimneydescended man now took his pipe out and gazed at it and me alternately with an air of wondering incredulity and seemed trying to realize some vast conception but failing in the effort put his pipe back and smoked as before some old ladies now amiably offered to change places with me evidently regarding me as the victim of some singular idiosyncrasy as i changed a light seemed to dawn on the old chimneys minda goodnatured one he was he looked hard at me and his whiffs became fainter till at last they ceased and he never smoked more till i was safe out of the cars     letter xlvi  erfurt saturday evening  my dear  i have just been to luthers cell in the old augustine convent and if my pilgrimage at wittenberg was less interesting by the dirt and discomfort of the actual present here were surroundings less calculated to jar on the frame the scene should inspire it was about sunseta very golden and beautiful one and c and i drove through various streets of this old town i believe i am peculiarly alive to architectural excitements for these old houses with their strange windows odd chimneys and quaint carvings delight me wonderfully many of them are almost gnomelike in their uncouthness they please me none the less for that  we drove first to the cathedral which with an old deserted church seemingly part of itself forms a pile of gothic architecture a wilderness of spires minarets arches and what not more picturesque than any cathedral i have seen it stands high on a sort of platform overlooking a military parade ground and reached by a long flight of steps  the choir is very beautiful i cannot describe how these lofty arches with their stained glass windows touch my heart architecture never can and never will produce their like again they give us aspiration in its highest form and noblest symbol and wonderful was that mind which conceived them this choir so darkly bright its stalls and seats carved in black oak its flamelike arches gorgeous with evening light were a preparation and excitement of mind yet its remarkable about these oldtime cathedrals that while their is every grand and solemn effect of architecture there is also always an abundance of subordinate parts mean tawdry revolting just like the whole system they represent out of this beautiful choir i wanted to tear all the tinsel fixtures on its altar except two very good pictures and leave it in it noble simplicity  i remarked here a black oak chandelier which the guide said was taken from the cathedral of cologne it was the very perfection of gothic carving and resembled frostwork in its lightness the floor of the cathedral was covered with effigies in stone trod smooth by the feet of worshippers so we living ones are ever walking above the dead though we do not always as here see the outward sign thereof  from the cathedral we passed out and stopped a moment to examine the adjoining church now deserted but whose three graceful spires have a peculiar beauty after a turn upon the platform we descended and drove to the augustine convent now used as an orphan asylum we ascended through a court yard full of little children by some steps into a gallery where a woman came out with her keys we passed first into a great hall the walls of which were adorned with holbeins dance of death  from this hall we passed into luthers rooma little cell ten feet square the walls covered with inscriptions from his writings there we saw his inkstand his pocket testament a copy of the bible that was presented to him by whom i could not understand splendidly bound and illuminated but it was the cell itself which affected me the windows looking out into what were the cloisters of the monastery here was that strugglethat mortal agonythat giant soul convulsing and wearing down that strong frame these walls to what groans to what prayers had they listened could we suppose a living human form imperishable capable of struggling and suffering but not of dying buried beneath the whole weight of one of these gloomy cathedrals suffocating in mortal agony hearing above the tramp of footsteps the peal of organs the triumphant surge of chants and vainly striving to send up its cries under all this loadsuch it would seem was the suffering of this mighty soul the whole pomp and splendor of this gorgeous prison house was piled up on his breast and his struggles rent the prison for the world  on a piece of parchment which is here kept framed is inscribed in luthers handwriting in latin death is swallowed up in victory nothing better could be written on the walls of this cell  this afternoon i walked out a little to observe the german sabbath not like the buoyant voluble social sunday of paris though still consecrated to leisure and family enjoyment more than to religious exercises as i walked down the streets the doors were standing open men smoking their pipes women knitting and children playing one place of resort was the graveyard of an antiquated church a graveyard here is quite different from the solitary dismal place where we lay our friends as if to signify that all intercourse with them is at an end each grave was trimmed and garlanded with flowers fastened with long strings of black or white ribbon around and among the graves men women and children were walking the men smoking and chatting not noisily but in a cheerful earnest way it seems to me that this way of treating the dead might lessen the sense of separation i believe it is generally customary to attend some religious exercise once on sunday and after that the rest of the day is devoted to this sort of enjoyment  illustration of the wartburg  the morning we started for eisenach was foggy and rainy this was unfortunate as we were changing from a dead level country to one of extreme beauty the thuringian forest with its high wooded points crowned here and there with many a castle and many a ruin loomed up finely through the mist and several times i exclaimed there is the wartburg or that must be the wartburg long before we were near it it was raining hard when we reached eisenach station and engaged a carriage to take us to the wartburg the mist which wreathed thickly around showed us only glimpses as we wound slowly up the castle hillenough however to pique the imagination and show how beautiful it might be in fair weather  the grounds are finely kept winding paths invite to many a charming stroll when about half way up as the rain had partially subsided i left the carriage and toiled up the laborious steep on foot that i might observe better you approach the castle by a path cut through the rock for about thirty or forty feet at last i stood under a low archway of solid stone masonry about twenty feet thick there had evidently been three successive doors the outer one was gone and the two inner were wonderfully massive braced with iron and having each a smaller wicket door swung back on its hinges  as my party were a little behind i had time to stop and meditate i fancied a dark misty night and the tramp of a party of horsemen coming up the rocky path to the gateway the parley at the wicket the unbarred doors creaking on their rusty hingesone two threeare opened in clatters the cavalcade in the midst of armed men with visors down a monk in cowl and gown and with that firm look about the lips which is so characteristic in luthers portraits but here our party came up and the vision was dispelled as none of us knew a word of german we stood rather irresolutely looking at the buildings which in all shapes and varieties surround the court i went into one roomit was a pantry into anotherit was a wash room into a thirdit was a sitting room garnished with antlers and hung round with hard old portraits of princes and electors and occupied by germans smoking and drinking beer one is sure that in this respect one cannot fail of seeing the place as it was in luthers time if they were germans of course they drank beer out of tall narrow beer glasses that is as immutable a fact as the old stones of the battlement  h said c did the germans use to smoke in luthers day  no why  0 nothing only what could they do with themselves  i do not know unless they drank the more beer  but what could they do with their chimneyhood  so saying the saucy fellow prowled about promiscuously a while assailing one and another in french to about as much purpose as one might have tried to storm the walls with discharges of thistle down all smoked and drank as before but as several other visitors arrived and it became evident that if we did not come to see the castle it was not likely we came for any thing else a man was fished up from some depths unknown with a promising bunch of keys he sallied forth to that part of the castle which is undergoing repairs  passing through bricks and mortar under scaffolds c we came to the armory full of old knights and steeds in complete armor that is to say the armor was there and without peeping between the crevices one could hardly tell that their owners were not at home in their iron houses there sat the elector of saxony in full armor on his horse which was likewise cased in steel there was the suit of armor in which constable bourbon fell under the walls of rome and other celebrated suits some covered with fine engraved work and some gilded a quantity of banners literally hung in tatters dropping to pieces with age here were the middle ages all standing  then we passed up to a grand hall which is now being restored with great taste after the style of that daya long lofty room with an arched roof and a gallery on one side and beyond a row of romanesque arched windows commanding a view of the country around having finished the tour of this part we went back ascended an old rude staircase and were ushered into luthers patmos about ten or twelve feet square the window looked down the rocky sides into an ocean of seething mist i opened it but could see nothing of all those scenes he describes so graphically from this spot i thought of his playful letter on the diet of the rooks but there was not a rook at hand to illustrate antiquity there was his bedstead and footstool a mammoth vertebra and his writing table a sculptured chair the back of which is carved into a cherubs head bending forward and shadowing with its wings the head of the sitter was said to be of the time of luther but not his chair there were some of his books and a rude ironstudded clothes press  thus ended for me the lutheran pilgrimage i had now been perseveringly to all the shrines and often inquired of myself whether our conceptions are helped by such visitations i decided the question in the affirmative that they are if from the dust of the present we can recreate the past and bring again before us the forms as they then lived moved and had their being for me i seem to have seen luther cranach melanchthon and all the rest of themto have talked with them by the by i forgot to mention the portraits of luthers father and mother which are in his cell they show that his mother was no common woman she puts me in mind of the mother of samuel j millsa strong shrewd bright new england character  i must not forget to notice too a little glitter of effecta little shadowy fanciful phase of feelingthat came over me when in luthers cell at erfurt the time as i told you was golden twilight and little birds were twittering and chirping around the casement and i thought how he might have sat there in some golden evening sad and dreamy hearing the birds chirp and wondering why he alone of all creation should be so sad i have not a doubt he has done that very thing in this very spot     journalcontinued  monday august 15 from eisenach where we dined cozily in the railroad station house we took the cars for cassel after we had established ourselves comfortably in a nich rauchen car a gentleman followed by a friend came to the door with a cigar in his mouth seeing ladies he inquired if he could smoke comprehending his look and gesture we said no but as we spoke very gently he misunderstood us and entered seeing by our looks that something was amiss he repeated the question more emphatically in german can i smoke yes or no no we answered in full chorus discomfited he retired with rather a flushed cheek we saw him prospecting up and down the train hunting for a seat followed by his fidus achates finally a guard took him in tow and after navigating a while brought him to our door but the gentleman recoiled said something in german and passed on again they made the whole circuit of the train and then we saw the guard coming with rather a fierce determined air straight to our door he opened it very decidedly and ordered the gentleman to enter he entered cigar and all his friend followed  well said h in english i suppose he must either smoke or die  ah yes i replied for the sake of saving his life we will even let him smoke  hope the tobacco is good added h and we went on reading our villette which was very amusing just then the gentleman had his match already lighted and was just in the act of puffing preliminarily when h first spoke i thought i saw a peculiar expression on his friends face he dropped a word or two in german as if quite incidentally and i soon observed that the smoking made small progress pie kept the cigar in his mouth it is true for a while just to show he would smoke if he chose but his whiffs were fewer and fainter every minute and after reading several chapters happening to cast my eye that way the cigar had disappeared not long after the friend sitting opposite me addressed w in good english and they were soon well agoing in a friendly discussion of our route the winged word had hit the mark that time  we passed the night in an agreeable hotel roi de prusse at cassel by the way it occurred to us that this was where the hessians came from in the old revolutionary times  tuesday august 16 a long dull ride from cassel to dusseldorf  wednesday august 17 whittridge came at breakfast the same mellow friendly goodhumored voice and genial soul i had loved years ago in the heart of indiana we had a brief festival of talk about old times art artists and friends and the tide of time rolled in and swept us asunder success to his pencil in the enchanted glades of germany america will yet be proud of his landscapes as italy of claude or england of turner  ho for anvers antwerp through aixlachapelle liége malines till nine at night  thursday august 18 what gnomes cave is this antwerp where i have been hearing such strange harmonies in the air all night we drive to the cathedral whose tower reminded napoleon of mechlin lace what a shower of sprinkling music drops comes from the sky above us we must go up and see about this we spiralize through a tubular stairway to an immense heighta tube of stone like a titanic organ pipe filled with waves of sound pouring down like a deluge undulations tremendous yet not intolerable we soon learned their origin reaching a small door i turned aside and came where the great bell was hung which twenty men were engaged in ringing it was a fête day i crept inside the frame and stood actually under the colossal mass as it swung like a world in its spheric chime a new sense was developed such as i had heard of the deaf possessing i seemed existing in a new medium i felt the sound in my lungs in my bones on all my nerves to the minutest fibre and yet it did not stupefy nor stun me with a harsh clangor it was deep deep it was an abyss gorgeously illuminated of velvet softness in which i floated the sound was fluid like water about me i closed my eyes where was i had some prodigious monster swallowed me and like another jonah had i gone down beneath the bottoms of the mountains i escaped from that perilous womb of sound and ascended still higher there was the mystery of that nocturnal minstrelsy seventythree bells in chromatic diapasonwith their tinkling ringing tolling knolling peal was not that a chime a chime of chimes and all these goblin hammers like hands and feet of sprites rising and falling by magic by hidden mechanism  of all german cactus blossoms this is the most ethereal what head conceived those harmonies so ghostlike every ten minutes if you lie wakeful they wind you up in a net of silver wirework and swing you in the clouds and the next time they swing you higher and the next higher and when the round hour is full the giant bell strikes at the gate of heaven to bring you home  but this is dreaming fie fie let us come down to pictures masses and common sense we came down we entered the room and sat before the descent from the cross where the dead body of jesus seems an actual reality before you the waves of the high mass came rolling in muffled by intervening walls columns corridors in a low mysterious murmur then organ orchestra and choir with rising voices urged the mighty acclaim till the waves seemed beating down the barriers upon us the combined excitement of the chimes the painting the music was too much i seemed to breathe ether treading on clouds as it were i entered the cathedral and the illusion vanished  friday august 19 antwerp to paris  saturday august 20 h and i take up our abode at the house of m belloc where we find every thing so pleasant that we sigh to think how soon we must leave these dear friends the rest of our party are at the hotel bedford     letter xlvii  antwerp  my dear  of all quaint places this is one of the most charming i have been rather troubled that antiquity has fled before me where i have gone it is a fatality of travelling that the sense of novelty dies away so that we do not realize that we are seeing any thing extraordinary i wanted to see something as quaint as nuremberg in longfellows poem and have but just found it these highgabled old flemish houses nine steps to each gable the cathedral too affects me more in externals than any yet and the spire looks as i expected that of strasbourg would as to the grammarye of bells and chimes i deliver that over to charlie buti have seen rubenss painting before i came to europe longfellow said to me you must go to antwerp to see rubens  i do not think i shall like rubens was my reply  but you will though yet never judge till you have been to antwerp  so during our various meanders i kept my eye with a steady resolve on this place i confess i went out to see the painting without much enthusiasm my experience with correggios notte and some of the celebrities of dresden was not encouraging i was weary too with sightseeing i expected to find an old dim picture half spoiled by cleaning which i should be required to look into shape by an exercise of my jaded imagination  alter coming down from hearing the chimes we went into a side room and sat down before the painting my first sensation was of astonishment blank absolute overwhelming after all that i had seen i had no idea of a painting like this i was lifted off my feet as much as by cologne cathedral or niagara falls so that i could neither reason nor think whether i was pleased or not it is difficult even now to analyze the sources of this wonderful power the excellence of this picture does not lie like raphaels in a certain ideal spirituality by which the scene is raised above earth to the heavenly sphere but rather in a power strong human almost homely by which not an ideal but the real scene is forced home upon the heart  christ is deaddead to your eye as he was to the eye of mary and of john death absolute hopeless is written in the faded majesty of that face peaceful and weary death in every relaxed muscle and surely in painting this form some sentiment of reverence and devotion softened into awestruck tenderness that hand commonly so vigorous for instead of the almost coarse vitality which usually pervades his manly figures there is shed over this a spiritualized refinement not less but more than human as if some heavenly voice whispered this is the lamb slain from the foundation of the world the figures of the disciples are real and individual in expression the sorrow is homely earnest unpicturesque and grievously heart broken the cheek of the kneeling mary at his feet is wet with tears you cannot ask yourself whether she is beautiful or not you only see and sympathize with her sorrow but the apostle john who receives into his arms the descending form is the most wonderful of all painters that i have seen represent him too effeminately they forget the ardent soul whom jesus rebuked for wishing to bring down fire from heaven on his enemies they forget that it was john who was called the son of thunder and that his emblem in the early church was the eagle from the spiritualized softness of his writings we have formed another picture forgetting that these are the writings of an aged man in whom the ardor of existence has been softened by long experience of suffering and habits of friendship with a suffering lord  rubenss conception of john is that of a vigorous and plenary manhood whose rush is like that of a torrent in the very moment when his great heart is breaking he had loved his master with a love like an eternity he had believed him heart and soul mind and strengthall had he given to that kingdom which he was to set up and he had seen him diedie by lingering torture and at this moment he feels it all there is no christ no kingdomnothing all is over we trusted it had been he who should have redeemed israel with that miraculous lifelike power that only rubens has he shows him to us in this moment of suppressed agony the blood choking his heart the veins swollen and every muscle quivering with the grief to which he will not give way o for this wonderful and deep conception this almost divine insight into the mysteries of that hour one might love rubens this picture cannot be engraved no engraving is more than a diagram to show the places of the figures for besides its mesmeric life which no artist can reproduce there is a balancing of colors a gorgeousness about it as if he had learned coloring from the great master himself even in the overpowering human effect of this piece it is impossible not to perceive that every difficulty which artists vaunt themselves on vanquishing has in this piece been conquered with apparently instinctive ease simply because it was habitual to do so and without in the least distracting the attention from the great moral magical foreshortenings and wonderful effects of color appear to be purely incidental to the expression of a great idea i left this painting as one should leave the work of a great religious master thinking more of jesus and of john than of rubens  after this we went through many galleries and churches devoted to his works for antwerp is rubenss shrine none of them impressed me as compared with this one of his madonnas however i must not forget to describe it was a conceit so just like him instead of the pale downcast or upturned faces which form the general types of madonna he gives her to us in one painting as a gorgeous oriental sultana leaning over a balcony with full dark eye and jewelled turban and rounded outlines sustaining on her hand a brilliant paroquet ludicrous as this conception appears in a scriptural point of view i liked it because there was life in it because he had painted it from an internal sympathy not from a chalky secondhand tradition  and now farewell to antwerp art has satisfied me at last i have been conquered and that is enough  tomorrow for paris adieu     letter xlviii  paris saturday august 20  my dear  i am seated in my snug little room at m bellocs the weather is overpoweringly hot but these parisian houses seem to have seized and imprisoned coolness french household ways are delightful i like their seclusion from the street by these deeppaved quadrangles i like these cool smooth waxed floors so much that i one day queried with my friends the cs whether we could not introduce them into america l who is a yankee housekeeper answered with spirit no indeed not while the mistress of the house has every thing to do as in america i think i see myself in addition to all my cares on my knees waxing up one of these floors  ah says caroline the thing is managed better in paris the frotteur comes in before we are up in the morning shod with great brushes and dances over the floors till they shine  i am sure said i here is fourriers system in one particular we enjoy the floors and the man enjoys the dancing  madame belloc had fitted up my room with the most thoughtful care a large bouquet adorns the table fancy writing materials are displayed and a waiter with sirups and an extempore soda fount one of parisian household refinements stands just at my elbow above all my walls are hung with beautiful engravings from claude and zuccarelli  this house pertains to the government and is held by m belloc in virtue of his situation as director of the imperial school of design to which institution about one half of it is devoted a public examination is at hand in preparing for which m belloc is heart and soul engaged this school is a government provision for the gratuitous instruction of the working classes in art i went into the rooms where the works of the scholars are arranged for the inspection of the judges the course of instruction is excellentcommencing with the study of nature around the room various plants are growing which serve for models interspersed with imitations in drawing or modelling by the pupils i noticed a hollyhock and thistle modelled with singular accuracy as some pupils can come only at evening m belloc has prepared a set of casts of plants which he says are plaster daguerreotypes by pouring warm gelatine upon a leaf a delicate mould is made from which these casts are taken he showed me bunches of leaves and branches of the vine executed by them which were beautiful in like manner the pupil commences the study of the human figure with the skeleton which he copies bone by bone gutta percha muscles are added in succession till finally he has the whole form besides each student has particular objects given him to study for a certain period after which he copies them from memory the same course is pursued with prints and engravings  when an accurate knowledge of forms is gained the pupil receives lessons in combination such subjects as these are given a vase of flowers a mediæval or classic vase shields helmets escutcheons c of different styles the first prize composition was a hunting frieze modelled in which were introduced fanciful combinations of leaf and scroll work dogs hunters and children figures of almost every animal and plant were modelled the drawings and modellings from memory were wonderful and showed in their combination great richness of fancy scattered about the room were casts of the best classic figures of the louvre placed there as m belloc gracefully remarked not as models but as inspirations to cultivate the sense of beauty  i was shown moreover their books of mathematical studies which looked intricate and learned but of which i appreciated only the delicate chirography and where said i are these young mechanics taught to read and write in the brothers schools he said paris is divided into regular parishes centring round different churches and connected with each church is a parochial school for boys and girls taught by ecclesiastics and nuns  with such thorough training of the sense of beauty it may be easily seen that the facility of french enthusiasm in aesthetics is not as often imagined superficial pretence the nerves of beauty are so exquisitely tuned and strung that they must thrill at every touch  one sees this in french life to the very foundation of society a poor family will give cheerfully a part of their bread money to buy a flower the idea of artistic symmetry pervades every thing from the arrangement of the simplest room to the composition of a picture at the chateau of madame v the whiteheaded butler begged madame to apologize for the central flower basket on the table he had not had time to study the composition  the english and americans seeing the french so serious and intent on matters of beauty fancy it to be mere affectation to be serious on a barrel of flour or a bushel of potatoes we can well understand but to be equally earnest in the adorning of a room or the composition of a bouquet seems ridiculous but did not he who made the appetite for food make also that for beauty and while the former will perish with the body is not the latter immortal with all new englands earnestness and practical efficiency there is a long withering of the souls more ethereal parta crushing out of the beautifulwhich is horrible children are born there with a sense of beauty equally delicate with any in the world in whom it dies a lingering death of smothered desire and pining weary starvation i know because i have felt itone in whom this sense has long been repressed in coming into paris feels a rustling and a waking within him as if the soul were trying to unfold her wings long unused and mildewed instead of scorning then the lighthearted mobile beautyloving french would that we might exchange instructions with themimparting our severer discipline in religious lore accepting their thorough methods in art and teaching and taught study together under the great master of all  i went with m belloc into the gallery of antique sculpture how wonderful these old greeks i what set them out on such a course i wonderanymore for instance than the sandwich islanders this reminds me to tell you that in the berlin museum which the king of prussia is now finishing in high style i saw what is said to be the most complete egyptian collection in the world a whole egyptian temple word for wordpillars paintings and all numberless sarcophagi and mummies ad nauseam they are no more fragrant than the eleven thousand virgins these mummies and my stomach revolts equally from the odor of sanctity and of science  i saw there a mummy of a little baby and though it was black as my shoe and a disgusting dry thing nevertheless the little head was covered with fine soft auburn hair four thousand years ago some mother thought the poor little thing a beauty also i saw mummies of cats crocodiles the ibis and all the other religious bijouterie of egypt with many cases of their domestic utensils ornaments c  the whole view impressed me with quite an idea of barbarism much more so than the assyrian collection about the winged bulls there is a solemn and imposing grandeur they have a mountainous and majestic nature these egyptian things give one an idea of inexpressible ungainliness they had a clumsy elephantine character of mind these egyptians there was not wanting grace but they seemed to pick it up accidentally because among all possible forms some must be graceful they had a kind of grand mammoth civilization gloomy and goblin they seem to have floundered up out of nile mud like that old slimy preadamite brood the whatstheirnamemegalosaurus ichthyosaurus pterodactyle iguanodon and other misshapen abominations with now and then wreaths of lotus and water lilies round their tusks  the human face as represented in assyrian sculptures is a higher type of face than even the greek it is noble and princely the egyptian faces are broad flat and clumsy if egypt gave birth to greece with her beautiful arts then truly this immense clumsy rocs egg hatched a miraculous nest of loves and graces  among the antiques here my two favorites are venus de milon which i have described to you and the diane chasseresse this goddess is represented by the side of a stag and so completely is the marble made alive that one seems to perceive that a tread so airy would not bend a flower every side of the statue is almost equally graceful the small proud head is thrown back with the freedom of a stag there is a gay haughty selfreliance an airy defiance a rejoicing fulness of health and immortal youth in the whole figure you see before you the whole greek conception of an immortala creature full of intellect full of the sparkle and elixir of existence in whom the principle of life seems to be crystallized and concentrated with a dazzling abundance light airy incapable alike of love and of sympathy living for self and self only alas for poor souls who in the heavy anguish of life had only such goddesses to go to how far in advance is even the idolatry of christianity how different the idea of mary from the diana  yet as i walked up and down among these remains of greek art i could not but wonder at the spectacle of their civilization no modern development reproduces it nor ever can or will it is well to cherish and make much of that ethereal past as a specimen of one phase of humanity for it is past forever those isles of greece with their gold and purple haze of light and shadow their exquisite halfspiritual halfbodily formationislands where flesh and blood became semispiritual and where the sense of beauty was an existencehave passed as a vision of glory never to return one scarcely realizes how full of poetry was their mythology all successive ages have drawn on it for images of beauty without exhausting it and painters and artists to this day are fettered and repressed by vain efforts to reproduce it but as a religion for the soul and the heart all this is vain and void all powerless to give repose or comfort one who should seek repose on the bosom of such a mythology is as one who seeks to pillow himself on the manytinted clouds of evening soft and beautiful as they are there is nothing real to them but their dampness and coldness  here m and madame belloc entered and as he wanted my opinion of the diane i let her read this part of the letter to him in french you ought to have seen m belloc with tears in his eyes defending the old greeks and expounding to me with all manner of rainbow illustrations the religious meanings of greek mythology and the morale of greek tragedy such a whole souled devotion to a nation dead and gone could never be found but in france  madame belloc was the translator of maria edgeworth by that ladys desire corresponded with her for years and still has many of her letters her translation of uncle tom has to me all the merit and all the interest of an original composition in perusing it i enjoy the pleasure of reading the story with scarce any consciousness of its ever having been mine in the evening mr and mrs s c hall called they are admirably matchedhe artist she author the one writes stories the other illustrates them madame m also called english by birth she is a true parisienne or rather seems to have both minds as she speaks both languages perfectly her husband being a learned oriental scholar she like some other women enjoying similar privileges has picked up a deal of information which she tosses about in conversation in a gay piquant manner much as a kitten plays with a pin ball  madame remembers mesdames recamier and de stael and told me several funny anecdotes of the former madame r she said was always coquetting with her own funeral conversed with different artists on the arrangements of its details and tempting now one now another with the brilliant hope of the composition of the scene madame m offered me her services as cicerone to paris and so today out we wentfirst to the pantheon of which in her gay and piquant style she gave me the history  begun first in the time of louis xvi as a church in the revolution its destination was altered and it was to be a temple to the manes of great men and accordingly rousseau voltaire and many more are buried here well after the revolution the bourbons said it should not be a temple for great men it should be a church the next popular upset tipped it back to the great men again and it staid under their jurisdiction until louis napoleon who is very pious restored it to the church it is not possible to say how much further this very characteristic rivalry between great men and their creator is going to extend all i have to say is that i should not think the church much of an acquisition to either party he that sitteth in the heavens must laugh sometimes at what man calls worship this pantheon is as one might suppose from its history a hybrid between a church and a theatre and of course good for neitherpurposeless and aimless the madeleine is another of these hybrid churches begun by divry as a church completed as a temple to victory by napoleon and on second thoughts rededicated to god  after strolling about a while the sexton or some official of the church asked us if we did not want to go down into the vaults below as a large party seemed to be going to do the same i said 0 yes by all means let us see it out our guide with his cocked hat and lantern walked ahead apparently in a now of excellent spirits these caverns and tombs appeared to be his particular forte and he magnified his office in showing them down stairs we went none of us knowing what we wanted to see or why our guide steps forth unlocks the gate of hades and we enter a dark vault with a particularly earthy smell bang he shuts the door after him clash he locks it now we are in for it and elevating his lantern he commences a deafening proclamation of some general fact concerning the very unsavory place in which we find ourselves of said proclamation i hear only the thundering voilà at the commencement next he proceeds to open the doors of certain stone vaulted chambers where the great men are buried between whose claims and their creators there seems to be such an uncertainty in france well here they were sure enough maintaining their claim by right of possession  voilà le tombeau de rousseau says the guide all walked in piously and stood to see a wooden tomb painted red at one end the tomb is made in the likeness of little doors which stand half open and a hand is coming out of them holding a flambeau by which it is intimated i suppose that rousseau in his grave is enlightening the world after a short proclamation here we were shown into another stone chamber with voilà le tombeau de voltaire this was of wood also very nicely speckled and painted to resemble some kind of marble each corner of the tomb had a tragic mask on it with that captivating expression of countenance which belongs to the tragic masks generally there was in the room a marble statue of voltaire with that wiry sharp keen yet somewhat spiteful expression which his busts commonly have  but our guide has finished his prelection here and is striding off in the plenitude of his wisdom now we are shown a long set of stone apartments provided for future great men considering the general scarcity of the article in most countries these sleeping accommodations are remarkably ample nobody need be discouraged in his attempts at greatness in paris for fear at last there wont be room to bury him after this we were marched to a place where our guide made a long speech about a stone in the floorvery instructive doubtless if i had known what it was my parisian friend said he spoke with such a german accent she could not understand so we humbly took the stone on trust though it looked to the eye of sense quite like any other  then we were marched into a part of the vault celebrated for its echo our guide here outdid himself first we were commanded to form a line en militaire with our backs to the wall well we did form en militaire i did it in the innocence of my heart entirely ignorant of what was to come next our guide departing from that heroic grandeur of manner which had hitherto distinguished him suddenly commenced screaming and hooting in a most unparalleled style the echo was enough to deafen one to be sure and the first blast of it made us all jump i could think of nothing but apollyon amusing himself at the expense of the poor pilgrims in the valley of the shadow of death for the exhibition was persisted in with a pertinacity inscrutable to any wisdom except his own it ended by a brace of thumps on the wall each of which produced a report equal to a cannon and with this salvo of artillery the exhibition finished  this worthy guide is truly a sublime character long may he live to show the pantheon and when he dies if so disagreeable an event must be contemplated may he have the whole of one of these stone chambers to himself for nothing less could possibly contain him he regretted exceedingly that we could not go up into the dome but i had had enough of stair climbing at strasbourg antwerp and cologne and not even the prospect of enjoying his instructions could tempt me  now this pantheon seems to me a monument of the faults and the weakness of this very agreeable nation its history shows their enthusiasm their hero worship and the want of stable religious convictions nowhere has there been such a want of reverence for the creator unless in the american congress the great men of france have always seemed to be in confusion as to whether they made god or he made them there is a great resemblance in some points between the french and the ancient athenians there was the same excitability the same keen outward life the same passion for ideas the same spending of life in hearing or telling some new thing the same acuteness of philosophical research the old athenians first worshipped and then banished their great menburied them and pulled them up and did generally a variety of things which we anglosaxons should call fantastic there is this difference that the athenians had the advantage of coming first the french nation born after this development are exposed by their very similarity of conformation and their consequent sympathy with the old classic style of feeling to become imitators this betrays itself in their painters and sculptors and it is a constant impulse to a kind of idolatry which is not in keeping with this age and necessarily seems absurd when the greeks built altars to force beauty victory and other abstract ideas they were doing an original thing when the french do it they imitate the greeks apotheosis and hero worship in the old times had a freshness to it it was one of the picturesque effects of the dim and purple shadows of an early dawning when objects imperfectly seen are magnified in their dimensions but the apotheosis in modern times of a man who has worn a dress coat wig and shoes is quite another affair  i do not mean either to say as some do that the french mind has very little of the religious element the very sweetest and softest as well as the most austere and rigid type of piety has been given by the french mind witness fénélon and john calvinfénélon standing as the type of the mystic and calvin of the rationalistic style of religion fénélon with his heart so sweet so childlike so simple and tender was yet essentially french in his nature and represented one part of french mind and what english devotional writer is at all like him john newton had his simplicity and lovingness but wanted that element of gracefulness and classic sweetness which gave so high a tone to the writings of fénélon as to calvin his crystalline clearness of mind his calm cold logic his severe vehemence are french also to this day a french system of theology is the strongest and most coercive over the strongest of countriesscotland and america and yet shallow thinkers flippantly say the french are incapable of religious ideas  after madame m and i had finished the pantheon we drove to the conciergerie for i wanted to see the prison of the hapless marie antoinette that restless architectural mania which never lets any thing alone here is rapidly modernizing it the scaffoldings are up and workmen busy in making it as little historical as possible nevertheless the old gloomy arched gateway and the characteristic peaked norman towers still remain and we stopped our carriage the other side of the seine to get a good look at it we drove to the door and tried to go in but were told that we could not without an order from somebody or other i forget who so we were obliged to content ourselves with an outside view  so we went to take another view of notre dame the very same notre dame whose bells in the good old days could be rung by the waving of michael scotts wand    him listed but his wand to wave    the bells should ring in notre dame  i had been over it once before with mrs c and sitting in a dark corner with my head against a cold stone pillar had heard vespers all in the most approved style of the poetic i went back to it now to see how it looked after the cathedrals of germany the churches of france have suffered dreadfully by the whirlwind spirit of its revolutions at different times the painted glass of this church has been shattered and replaced by common till now there is too much light in it though there are exquisite windows yet remaining these cathedrals must have painted glass it is essential the want of it is terrible the dim religious light is necessary to keep you from seeing the dirty floors hanging cobwebs stacks of little old rushbottomed chairs and the prints where dirty heads and hands have approached too near the stone pillars as i sat hearing vespers in notre dame the first time seeing these all too plainly may i be forgiven but i could not help thinking of lucifers soliloquy in a cathedral in the golden legend    what a darksome and dismal place    i wonder that any man has the face    to call such a hole the house of the lord    and the gate of heavenyet such is the word    ceiling and walls and windows old    covered with cobwebs blackened with mould    dust on the pulpit dust on the stairs    dust on the benches and stalls and chairs                                       however notre dame is a beautiful church but i wish it was under as good care as cologne cathedral and that instead of building madeleines and pantheons france would restore and preserve her cathedralsthose grand memorials of the past i consider the king of prussia as not only a national benefactor but the benefactor of the world cologne when finished will be the great epic of architecture and belong like all great epics to all mankind  well madame m and i wandered up and down the vast aisles she with her lively fanciful remarks to which there was never wanting a vein both of shrewdness and good sense  when we came out of notre dame she chattered about the place there used to be an archbishops palace back of the church in that garden but one day the people took it into their heads to pull it down i saw the silkbottomed chairs floating down the seine they say that somebody came and told thiers do you know the people are rummaging the archbishops palace and he shrugged his shoulders and said let em work thats the say you know mind i dont say it is true well he got enough of it at last the fact is that with the french destructiveness is as much developed as constructiveness and they are as good at one as the other  as we were passing over one of the bridges we saw a flower market a gay show of flowers of all hues and a very brisk trade going on about them madame told me that there was a flower market every day in the week in different parts of the city the flower trade was more than usually animated today because it is a saints fête the fête of st louis the patron of paris  the streets every where showed men women and children carrying their pots of blooming flowers every person in paris named louis or louise after this saint has received this day little tokens of affection from their friends generally bouquets or flowers madame belloc is named louise and her different friends and children called and brought flowers and a beautiful india china vase  the life of paris indeed of the continent is floral to an extent of which the people in the united states can form no conception flowers are a part of all their lives the churches are dressed with flowers and on fête days are fragrant with them a jardinière forms a part of the furniture of every parlor a jardinière is a receptacle made in various fanciful forms for holding pots of flowers these pots are bought at the daily flower market for a trifle in full bloom and high condition they are placed in the jardinière the spaces around them filled with sand and covered with moss  again there are little hanging baskets suspended from the ceilings and filled with flowers these things give a graceful and festive air to apartments when the plants are out of bloom the porter of the house takes them waters prunes and tends them then sells them again meanwhile the parlor is ornamented with fresh ones along the streets on saints days are little booths where small vases of artificial flowers are sold to dress the altars i stopped to look at one of these stalls all brilliant with cheaplymade showy vases of flowers that sell for one or two sous  we went also to the national academy of fine arts a government school for the gratuitous instruction of artists a grecian building with a row of all the distinguished painters in front  in the doorway as we came in was an antique headless statue of minerva literally it was minervas gown standing upa pillar of drapery nothing more and drapery soiled tattered and battered but then it was an antique and that is enough now when antique things are ugly i do not like them any better for being antique and i should rather have a modern statue than minervas old gown we went through all the galleries in this school in one of which the prize pieces of scholars are placed whoever gets one of these prizes is sent to study in rome at the expense of the government we passed through the hall where the judges sit to decide upon pictures and through various others that i cannot remember i was particularly interested in the apartment devoted to the casts from the statuary in the louvre and in other palaces these casts are taken with mathematical exactness and subjected to the inspection of a committee who order any that are defective to be broken proof casts of all the best works ancient and modern are thus furnished at a small price and so brought within the reach of the most moderate means  this morning m and madame belloc took me with them to call on béranger the poet he is a charming old man very animated with a face full of feeling and benevolence and with that agreeable simplicity and vivacity of manner which is peculiarly french it was eleven oclock but he had not yet breakfasted we entreated him to waive ceremony and so his maid brought in his chop and coffee and we all plunged into an animated conversation béranger went on conversing with shrewdness mingled with childlike simplicity a blending of the comic the earnest and the complimentary conversation in a french circle seems to me like the gambols of a thistle down or the rainbow changes in soap bubbles one laughs with tears in ones eyes one moment confounded with the absolute childhood of the simplicity in the next one is a little afraid of the keen edge of the shrewdness this call gave me an insight into a french circle which both amused and delighted me coming home m belloc enlarged upon berangers benevolence and kindness of heart no man he said is more universally popular with the common people he has exerted himself much for the families of the unfortunate deportes to cayenne then he added laughing a mechanic one of my model sitters was dilating upon his goodnesswhat a man what sublime virtue how is he beloved could i live to see his funeral quelle spectacle quelle grande emotion  at tea madame m commented on the manners of a certain english lady of our acquaintance  shes an actress shes too affected  madame belloc and i defended her  ah said m belloc you cannot judge the french are never natural in england nor the english in france frenchmen in england are stupid and cross trying to be dignified and when the english come to france its all guitar playing and capering in trying to have esprit  but it is hard to give a conversation in which the salient points are made by a rapid pantomime which effervesces like champagne  madame belloc and madame m agree that the old french salon is no more that none in the present iron age can give the faintest idea of the brilliancy of the institution in its palmiest days the horrors and reverses of successive revolutions have thrown a pall over the french heart  i have been now in all about a month in this gay and flowery city seeing the french people not in hotels and cafes but in the seclusion of domestic life received when introduced not with ceremonious distance as a stranger but with confidence and affection as a friend  though according to the showing of my friends paris is empty of many of her most brilliant ornaments yet i have been so fortunate as to make the acquaintance of many noble and justly celebrated people and to feel as if i had gained a real insight into the french heart  i liked the english and the scotch as well as i could like any thing and now i equally like the french exact opposites you will say for that reason all the more charming the goodness and beauty of the divine mind is no less shown in the traits of different races than of different tribes of fruits and flowers and because things are exact opposites is no reason why we should not like both the eye is not like the hand nor the ear like the foot yet who condemns any of them for the difference so i regard nations as parts of a great common body and national differences as necessary to a common humanity  i thought when in english society that it was as perfect and delightful as it could be there was worth of character strength of principle true sincerity and friendship charmingly expressed i have found all these too among the french and besides them something which charms me the more because it is peculiar to the french and of a kind wholly different from any i have ever had an experience of before there is an irislike variety and versatility of nature a quickness in catching and reflecting the various shades of emotion or fancy a readiness in seizing upon ones own halfexpressed thoughts and running them out in a thousand graceful little tendrils which is very captivating  i know a general prejudice has gone forth that the french are all mere outside without any deep reflection or emotion this may be true of many no doubt that the strength of that outward life that acuteness of the mere perceptive organization and that tendency to social exhilaration which prevail will incline to such a fault in many cases an english reserve inclines to moroseness and scotch perseverance to obstinacy so this aerial french nature may become levity and insincerity but then it is neither the sullen englishman the dogged scotchman nor the shallow frenchman that we are to take as the national ideal in each country we are to take the very best as the specimen  now it is true that here in france one can find people as judicious quiet discreet and religious as any where in the world with views of life as serious and as earnest not living for pretence or show but for the most rational and religious ends now when all this goodness is silvered over as it were reflecting like motherofpearl or opal a thousand fanciful shades and changes is not the result beautiful some families into which i have entered some persons with whom i have talked have left a most delightful impression upon my mind and i have talked by means of imperfect english french and interpretations with a good many they have made my heart bleed over the history of this most beautiful country it is truly mournful that a people with so many fine impulses so much genius appreciation and effective power should by the influence of historical events quite beyond the control of the masses so often have been thrown into a false position before the world and been subjected to such a series of agonizing revulsions and revolutions  o the french are half tiger half monkey said a cultivated american to me the other day such remarks cut me to the heart as if they had been spoken of a brother and when they come from the mouth of an american the very shade of lafayette it would seem might rise and say et tu brute  it is true it is a sarcasm of voltaires but voltaire though born a frenchman neither imbodied nor was capable of understanding the true french ideal the french head he had but not the french heart and from his bitter judgment we might appeal to a thousand noble names the generous henri iv the noble sully and bayard the knight sans peur et sans reproche were these half tiger and half monkey were john calvin and fénélon half tiger and half monkey laplace geoffroy st hilaire cuvier des cartes malebranche aragowhat were they the tree of history is enriched with no nobler and fairer boughs and blossoms than have grown from the french stock  it seems a most mysterious providence that some nations without being wickeder than others should have a more unfortunate and disastrous history  the woes of france have sprung from the fact that a jezebel de medici succeeded in exterminating from the nation that portion of the people corresponding to the puritans of scotland england and germany the series of persecutions which culminated in the massacre of st bartholomew and ended with the dragonades under louis xiv drained france of her lifeblood other nations have profited by the treasures then cast out of her and she has remained poor for want of them some of the best blood in america is of the old huguenot stock huguenots carried arts and manufactures into england an expelled french refugee became the theological leader of puritanism in england scotland and america and wherever john calvins system of theology has gone civil liberty has gone with it so that we might almost say of france as the apostle said of israel if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness  when the english and americans sneer at the instability turbulence and convulsions of the french nation for the last century let us ask ourselves what our history would have been had the gunpowder plot succeeded and the whole element of the reformation been exterminated it is true vitality and reactive energy might have survived such a process but that vitality would have shown itself just as it has in francein struggles and convulsions the frequent revolutions of france are not a thing to be sneered at they are not evidences of fickleness but of constancy they are in fact a prolonged struggle for liberty in which there occur periods of defeat but in which after every interval of repose the strife is renewed their great difficulty has been that the destruction of the reformed church in france took out of the country entirely that element of religious rationalism which is at once conservative and progressive  there are three forces which operate in society that of blind faith of reverent religious freedom and of irreverent scepticism now since the human mind is so made that it must have religion when this middle element of reasonable religious freedom is withdrawn society vibrates like a pendulum between scepticism and superstition the extreme of superstition reacting to scepticism and then the barrenness of scepticism reacting again into superstition when the persecutions in france had succeeded in extinguishing this middle element then commenced a series of oscillations between religious despotism and atheistic license which have continued ever since the suppression of all reasonable religious inquiry and the consequent corruption of the church produced the school of voltaire and his followers the excesses of that school have made devout catholics afraid of the very beginning of religious rationalism and these causes act against each other to this day  the revolution in england under cromwell succeeded because it had an open bible and liberty of conscience for its foundation and united both the elements of faith and of reason the french revolution had as lamartine says plutarchs lives for its bible and the great unchaining of human passion had no element of religious control plad france in the time of her revolution had leaders like admiral coligny her revolution might have prospered as did englands under cromwell but these revolutions needlessly terrible as they have been still have accomplished something without them france might have died away into what spain is as it is progress has been made though at a fearful sacrifice no country has been swept cleaner of aristocratic institutions and the old bastiles and prisons of a past tyranny the aspiration for democratic freedom has been so thoroughly sown in france that it never will be rooted up again how to get it and how to keep it when it is got they do not yet clearly see but they will never rest till they learn there is a liberty of thought and of speech in france which the tonguetied state of the press cannot indicate could france receive the biblecould it be put into the hands of all the common peoplethat might help her and france is receiving the bible spite of all efforts to the contrary the curiosity of the popular mind has been awakened the yearnings of the popular heart are turning towards it and therein lie my best hopes for france  one thing more i would say since i have been here i have made the french and continental mode of keeping sunday a matter of calm dispassionate inquiry and observation i have tried to divest myself of the prejudicesif you so please to call themof my new england educationto look at the matter sympathetically in the french or continental point of view and see whether i have any occasion to revise the opinions in which i had been educated i fully appreciate all the agreeableness the joyousness and vivacity of a day of recreation and social freedom spent in visiting picture galleries and public grounds in social réunions and rural excursions i am far from judging harshly of the piety of those who have been educated in these views and practices but viewing the subject merely in relation to things of this life i am met by one very striking fact there is not a single nation possessed of a popular form of government which has not our puritan theory of the sabbath protestant switzerland england scotland and america cover the whole ground of popular freedom and in all these this idea of the sabbath prevails with a distinctness about equal to the degree of liberty nor do i think this result an accidental one if we notice that the lutheran branch of the reformation did not have this element and the calvinistic branch which spread over england and america did have it and compare the influence of these two in sustaining popular rights we shall be struck with the obvious inference  now there are things in our mode of keeping the sabbath which have a direct tendency to sustain popular government for the very element of a popular government must be selfcontrol in the individual there must be enough intensity of individual selfcontrol to make up for the lack of an extraneous pressure from government the idea of the sabbath as observed by the puritans is the voluntary dissevering of the thoughts and associations from the things of earth for one day in seen and the concentrating of the mind on purely spiritual subjects in all this there is a weekly recurring necessity for the greatest selfcontrol no way could be devised to educate a community to be thoughtful and reflective better than the weekly recurrence of a day when all stimulus both of business and diversion shall be withdrawn and the mind turned in upon itself the weekly necessity of bringing all business to a close tends to give habits of system and exactness the assembling together for divine worship and for instruction in the duties of christianity is a training of the highest and noblest energies of the soul even that style of abstract theologizing prevailing in new england and scotland which has grown out of sabbath sermonizing has been an incalculable addition to the strength and selfcontrolling power of the people  ride through france you see the laborer in his wooden shoes with scarce a thought beyond his daily toil his sunday is a féte for dancing and recreation go through new england and you will find the laborer as he lays his stone fence discussing the consistency of foreordination with free will or perchance settling some more practical mooted point in politics on sunday this laborer gets up his wagon and takes his wife and family to church to hear two or three sermons in each of which there are more elements of mental discipline than a french peasant gets in a whole lifetime it is a shallow view of theological training to ask of what practical use are its metaphysical problems of what practical value to most students is geometry on the whole i think it is the puritan idea of the sabbath as it prevails in new england that is one great source of that individual strength and selfcontrol which have supported so far our democratic institutions  in regard to the present state of affairs here it has been my lot to converse unreservedly with some of all parties sufficiently to find the key note of their thoughts there are first the bourbonistsmediaeval peoplebelievers in the divine right of kings in general and of the bourbons in particular there are many of them exceedingly interesting there is something rather poetic and graceful about the antique cast of their ideas their chivalrous loyalty to an exiled family and their devout belief of the catholic religion these for the most part keep out of paris entirely ignore the present court and remain in their chateaus in the country a gentleman of this class with whom i talked thought the present emperor did very well in keeping other parties out till the time should come to strike a blow for the true king  then there are the partisans and friends of the orleans family i heard those who spoke even with tears of louis philippe and his dynasty they were patrons of letters and of arts they say of virtue and of religion and these good faithful souls cling lovingly to their memory  and then there are the republicansmen of the real olden time capable of sacrificing every thing that heart holds dear for a principle such republicans as were our fathers in all save their religion and because lacking that losing the chief element of popular control nevertheless grander men have never been than some of these modern republicans of france americans might learn many lessons from them  besides all these there is another class comparatively small having neither the prestige of fashion rank or wealth but true humble evangelical christians in whom the simplicity and spirituality of the old huguenot church seems revived these men are laboring at the very foundation of things laboring to bring back the forgotten bible beginning where christ began with preaching the gospel to the poor if any would wish to see christianity in its loveliest form they would find it in some of these humble laborers one with whom i conversed devotes his time to the chiffoniers rag pickers he gave me an account of his labors speaking with such tenderness and compassion that it was quite touching my poor people he said they are very ignorant but they are not so very bad and when i asked him who supports you in your labors he looked upward with one of those quick involuntary glances by which the french express themselves without words there was the same earnestness in him as in one of our city missionaries but a touching grace peculiarly national it was the piety of fénélon and st john and i cannot believe that god who loves all nations alike and who knows how beautifully the french mind is capable of reflecting the image of jesus will not yet shine forth upon france to give the light of the knowledge of his glory in the face of christ  it was the testimony of all with whom i conversed that the national mind had become more and more serious for many years past said a french gentleman to me one evening the old idea of lhomme desprit of louis xivs time the man of bonmots bows and salons is almost passed away there is only now and then a specimen of it left the french are becoming more earnest and more religious in the roman catholic churches which i attended i saw very full audiences and great earnestness and solemnity i have talked intimately also with roman catholics in whom i felt that religion was a real and vital thing one of them a most lovely lady presented me with the imitation of christ by thomas à kempis as a ground on which we could both unite  i have also been interested to see in these french catholics in its most fervent form the exhibition of that antislavery spirit which in other ages was the boast of that church one charming friend took me to the church of st germain lauxerrois pointing out with great interest the statues and pictures of saints who had been distinguished for their antislavery efforts in france in a note expressing her warm interest in the cause of the african slave she says it is a tradition of our church that of the three kings which came to worship jesus in bethlehem one was black and if christians would kneel oftener before the manger of bethlehem they would think less of distinctions of caste and color  madame belloc received a day or two since a letter from a lady in the old town of orleans which gave name to joan of arc expressing the most earnest enthusiasm in the antislavery cause her prayers she says will ascend night and day for those brave souls in america who are conflicting with this mighty injustice  a lady a few days since called on me all whose property was lost in the insurrection at hayti but who is nevertheless a most earnest advocate of emancipation  a catholic lady in a letter inquired earnestly why in my key i had not included the romish clergy of the united states among the friends of emancipation as that she said had been always the boast of their church i am sorry to be obliged to make the reply that in america the catholic clergy have never identified themselves with the antislavery cause but in their influence have gone with the multitude  i have received numerous calls from members of the old french abolition society which existed here for many years among these i met with great interest m dutrone its president also m  who presented me with his very able ethnological work on the distinctive type of the negro race one gentleman greatly distressed in view of the sufferings of the negro race in america said naively enough to mrs c that he had heard that the negroes had great capability for music dancing and the fine arts and inquired whether something could not be done to move sympathy in their behalf by training them to exhibit characteristic dances and pantomimes mrs c quoted to him the action of one of the great ecclesiastical bodies in america in the same breath declining to condemn slavery but denouncing dancing as so wholly of the world lying in wickedness as to require condign ecclesiastical censure the poor man was wholly lost in amazement  in this connection i cannot but notice to the credit of the french republican provisional government how much more consistent they were in their attachment to the principles of liberty than ever our own has been what do we see in our own history our northern free states denouncing slavery as a crime confessedly inconsistent with their civil and religious principles yet for commercial and pecuniary considerations deliberately entering into a compact with slaveholders tolerating a twenty years perpetuation of the african slave trade the rendition of fugitives the suppression of servile insurrections and allowing to the slaveholders a virtual property basis of representation it should qualify the contempt which some americans express of the french republic that when the subject of the slave colonies was brought up and it was seen that consistency demanded immediate emancipation they immediately emancipated and not only so but conferred at once on the slaves the elective franchise  this point strongly illustrates the difference in one respect between the french and the anglosaxons as a race the french are less commercial more ideal more capable of devotion to abstract principles and of following them out consistently irrespective of expediency  there is one thing which cannot but make one indignant here in paris and which i think is keenly felt by some of the best among the french and that is the indifference of many americans while here to their own national principles of liberty they seem to come to paris merely to be hangers on and applauders in the train of that tyrant who has overthrown the hopes of france to all that cruelty and injustice by which thousands of hearts are now bleeding they appear entirely insensible they speak with heartless levity of the revolutions of france as of a pantomime got up for their diversion their time and thoughts seem to be divided between defences of american slavery and efforts to attach themselves to the skirts of french tyranny they are the parasites of parasitesdelighted if they can but get to an imperial ball and beside themselves if they can secure an introduction to the man who figured as a roué in the streets of new york nobleminded men of all parties here who have sacrificed all for principle listen with suppressed indignation while young america fresh from the theatres and gambling saloons declares between the whiffs of his cigar that the french are not capable of free institutions and that the government of louis napoleon is the best thing france could have thus from the plague spot at her heart has america become the propagandist of despotism in europe nothing weighs so fearfully against the cause of the people of europe as this kind of american influence through almost every city of europe are men whose great glory it appears to be to proclaim that they worship the beast and wear his name in their foreheads i have seen sometimes in the forests a vigorous young sapling which had sprung up from the roots of an old decaying tree so unless the course of things alters much in america a purer civil liberty will spring up from her roots in europe while her national tree is blasted with despotism it is most affecting in moving through french circles to see what sadness what anguish of heart lies under that surface which seems to a stranger so gay each revolution has cut its way through thousands of families ruining fortunes severing domestic ties inflicting wounds that bleed and will bleed for years i once alluded rather gayly to the numerous upsets of the french government in conversation with a lady and she laughed at first but in a moment her eyes filled with tears and she said ah you have no idea what these things are among us in conversation nothing was more common than the remark i shall do so and so provided things hold out but then there is no telling what will come next  on the minds of some there lie deep dejection and discouragement some surrounded by their growing families though they abhor the tyranny of the government acquiesce wearily and even dread change lest something worse should arise  we know not in america how many atrocities and cruelties that attended the coup detat have been buried in the grave which intombed the liberty of the press i have talked with eye witnesses of those scenes men who have been in the prisons and heard the work of butchery going on in the prison yards in the night while we have been here a gentleman to whom i had been introduced was arrested taken from bed by the police and carried off without knowing of what he was accused his friends were denied access to him and on making application to the authorities the invariable reply was be very quiet about it if you make a commotion his doom is sealed when his wife was begging permission for a short interview the jailer wearied with her importunities at last exclaimed unguardedly madam there are two hundred here in the same position what would you have me do footnote that man has remained in prison to this day  at that very time an american traveller calling on us expatiated at length on the peaceful state of things in parison the evident tranquillity and satisfaction universally manifest     journalcontinued  saturday august 27 left paris with h the rest of our party having been detained reached boulogne in safety and in high spirits made our way on board the steamer deposited our traps below came on deck and prepared for the ordeal a high northwester had been blowing all day and as we ran along behind the breakwater i could see over it the white and green waves fiendishly running and showing their malign eyes sparkling with hungry expectation come out come out they seemed to say come out you little black imp of a steamer dont be hiding behind there like a coward we dare you to come out here and give us a chance at youwe will eat you up as so many bears would eat a lamb  and sure enough the moment her bows passed beyond the pier the sea struck her and tossed her like an eggshell and the deck from stem to stern was drenched in a moment and running with floods as if she had been under water for a few moments h and i both enjoyed the motion we stood amidships she in her shawl i in a great tarpauling which i had borrowed of jack and every pitch sent the spray over us we exulted that we were not going to be sick suddenly however so suddenly that it was quite mysterious conscience smote me a profound a deepseated remorse developed itself just exactly in the deepest centre of the pit of my stomach  h said i with a decided grave air im going to be seasick  so am i said she as if struck by the same convictions that had been impressed on me we turned and made our way along the leeward quarter to a seat by the bulwarks i stood holding on by the railrope and every now and then addressing a few incoherent and rather guttural not to say pectoral remarks to the green and gloomy sea as i leaned over the rail after every paroxysm of communicativeness for in seasickness the organ of secretiveness gives way i regained my perpendicular and faced the foe with a determination that i would stand it throughthat the grinning howling brine should get no more secrets out of me and in fact it did not  meanwhile what horrorswhat complicated horrorsdid not that crowded deck present did the priestly miscreants of the middle ages ever represent among the torments of purgatory the deck of a channel steamer if not then they forgot the lower deep that satan doubtless thought about according to milton  there were men and women of every age and complexion with faces of every possible shade of expression defiance resolute and stern desperate resolves never to give in and that very same defiant determination sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought a deep abyss of abdominal discontent revealing afar the shadow the penumbra of the approaching retch and there were bouleversements and hoarse confidences to the sea of every degree of misery the wind was really risen quite to a gale and the sea ran with fearful power two sailors standing near said i wouldnt say it only to you jack but in all the time ive crossed this here channel ive seen nothin like this  nor i neither was the reply  about mid channel a wave struck the windward quarter just behind the wheel with a stroke like a rock from a ballista smashed in the bulwarks stove the boat which fell and hung in the water by one end and sent the ladies who were sitting there with boxes baskets shawls hats spectacles umbrellas cloaks down to leeward in a pond of water one girl i saw with a bruise on her forehead as large as an egg and the blood streaming from her nostrils shrieks resounded and for a few moments we had quite a tragic time  about this time h gave in and descended to tartarus where the floor was compactly densely stowed with one mass of heaving wretches with nothing but washbowls to relieve the sombre mosaic how h fared there she may tell i cannot i stood by the bulwark with my boots full of water my eyes full of salt spray and my heart full of the most poignant regret that ever i was born alas was that channel a channel at all had it two shores was england over there where i saw nothing but monstrous leaping maddening billows saying we are glad of it we want you come on here we are waiting for you we will serve you up  at last i seriously began to think of tartarus myself and of a calm repose flat on my back such as h told of in his memorable passage but just then dim and faint on the horizon i thought i discerned the long line of a bank of land it was this was a channel that was the shore england had not sunk i stood my ground and in an hour we came running bounding and rolling towards the narrow mouth of the folkstone pier heads     letter xlix  london  my dear  our last letters from home changed all our plans we concluded to hurry away by the next steamer if at that late hour we could get passage we were all in a bustle the last shoppings for aunts cousins and little folks were to be done by us all the palais royal was to be rummaged bronzes vases statuettes bonbons playthingsall that the endless fertility of france could showwas to be looked over for the folks at home  you ought to have seen our rooms at night the last evening we spent in paris when the whole gleanings of a continental tour were brought forth for packing and compared with the dimensions of original trunksah what an hour was that who should reconcile these incongruous elementsbronzes bonnets ribbons and flowers plaster casts books muslins and laceselements as irreconcilable as fate and freedom who should harmonize them and i so tired  ah said jladame b it is all quite easy you must have a packer  a packer  yes he will come look at your things provide whatever may be necessary and pack them all  so said so done the man came saw conquered he brought a trunk twine tacks wrapping paper and i stood by in admiration while he folded dresses arranged bonnets caressingly enveloped flowers in silk paper fastened refractory bronzes and muffled my plaster animals with reference to the critical points of ears and nosesin short reduced the whole heterogeneous assortment to place and proportion shut locked corded labelled handed me the keys and it was done the charge for all this was quite moderate  how we sped across the channel c relates we are spending a few very pleasant days with our kind friends the ls in london  on board the arctic wednesday september 7  on thursday september 1 we reached york and visited the beautiful ruins of st marys abbey and the magnificent cathedral how individual is every cathedral york is not like westminster nor like strasbourg nor cologne any more than shakspeare is like milton or milton like homer in london i attended morning service in westminster and explored its labyrinths of historic memories the reading of the scriptures in the english tongue and the sound of the chant affected me deeply in contrast with the pictorial and dramatic effects of romanism in continental churches  as a simple matter of taste protestantism has made these buildings more impressive by reducing them to a stricter unity the multitude of shrines candlesticks pictures statues and votive offerings which make the continental churches resemble museums are constantly at variance with the majestic grandeur of the general impression therein they typify the church to which they belong which has indeed the grand historic basis and framework of christianity though overlaid with extraneous and irrelevant additions  this cathedral of york has a severe grandeur peculiar to itself i saw it with a deep undertone of feeling for it was the last i should behold  no one who has appreciated the wonders of a new world of art and association can see without emotion the door closing upon it perhaps forever i lingered long here and often turned to gaze again and after going out went back once more to fill my soul with a last long look in which i bade adieu to all the historic memories of the old world i thought of the words we have a building of god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens  these glorious arches this sublime mystery of human power and skill is only a shadow of some eternal substance which in the ages to come god will yet reveal to us  it rained with inflexible pertinacity during all the time we were at york and the next day it rained still when we took the cars for castle howard station  in riding through the park from the station we admired an avenue composed of groups of magnificent beeches sixteen or eighteen in a group disposed at intervals on either hand  the castle a building in the italian style rose majestically on a slight eminence in the centre of a green lawn we alighted in the crisis of one of the most driving gusts of wind and rain so that we really seemed to be fleeing for shelter but within all was bright and warm  lady carlisle welcomed us most affectionately and we learned that had we not been so reserved at the york station in concealing our names we should have received a note from her however as we were safely arrived it was of no consequence  several of the family were there among the rest lady dover and mr and mrs e howard they urged us to remain over night but as we had written to leeds that we should be there in the evening train we were obliged to decline we were shown over the castle which is rich in works of art there was a gallery of antiques and a collection of paintings from old masters in one room i saw tapestry exactly like that which so much interested us in windsor representing scenes from the book of esther it seemed to be of a much more ancient date i was also interested in a portrait of an ancestor of the family the identical belted will who figures in scotts lay    belted will howard shall come with speed    and william of deloraine good at need  in one of the long corridors we were traversing we heard the voice of merriment and found a gay party of young people and children amusing themselves at games i thought what a grand hideandgoseek place the castle must bewhole companies might lose themselves among the rooms the central hall of the building goes up to the roof and is surmounted by a dome the architecture is in the italian style which i think much more suited to the purposes of ordinary life than for strictly religious uses i never saw a church in that style that produced a very deep impression on me this hall was gorgeously frescoed by italian masters the door commands the view of a magnificent sweep of green lawn embellished by an artificial lake it is singular in how fine and subtle a way different nationalities express themselves in landscape gardening while employing the same materials i have seen no grounds on the continent that express the particular shade of ideas which characterize the english there is an air of grave majesty about the wide sweep of their outlinesa quality suggestive of ideas of strength and endurance which is appropriate to their nationality  illustration of castle howard with the artificial lake in the foreground  in lord carlisles own room we saw pictures of sumner prescott and others of his american friends this custom of showing houses which prevails over europe is i think a thing which must conduce greatly to national improvement a plea for the beautiful is constantly put in by thema model held up before the community whose influence cannot be too highly estimated before one of the choicest paintings stood the easel of some neighboring artist who was making a copy he was quite unknown to the family but comes and goes at his pleasure the picture being as freely at his service as if it were an outside landscape  after finishing our survey i went with lady carlisle into her own boudoir there i saw a cabinet fulllength picture of her mother the duchess of devonshire she is represented with light hair and seemed to have been one whose beauty was less that of regular classic model than the fascination of a brilliant and buoyant spirit inspiring a graceful form lady carlisle showed me an album containing a kind of poetical record made by her during a passage through the alps which she crossed on horseback in days when such an exploit was more difficult and dangerous than at present i particularly appreciated some lines in closing addressed to her children expressing the eagerness with which she turned from all that nature and art could offer in prospect of meeting them once more  lord carlisle is still in turkey and will probably spend the winter in greece his mother had just received a letter from him and he thinks that war is inevitable  in one of the rooms that we traversed i saw an immense vase of bog oak and gold which was presented to lord carlisle by those who favored his election on the occasion of his defeat on the cornlaw question the sentiment expressed by the givers was that a defeat in a noble undertaking was worthy of more honor than a victory in an ignoble one  after lunch having waited in vain for the rain to cease and give us a sunny interval in which to visit the grounds we sallied out hooded and cloaked to get at some of the most accessible points of view the wind was unkindly and discourteous enough and seemed bent on baffling the hospitable intentions of our friends if the beauties of an english landscape were set off by our clear sky and sun then patriotism i fancy would run into extravagance i could see that even one gracious sunset smile might produce in these lawns and groves an effect of enchantment  i was pleased with what is called the kitchen garden which i expected to find a mere collection of vegetables but found to be a genuine oldfashioned garden which like eden brought forth all that was pleasant to the eye and good for food  there were wide walks bordered with flowers enclosing portions devoted to fruit and vegetables and best of all this windy day the whole enclosed by a high solid stone wall which bade defiance to the storm and made this the most agreeable portion of our walk  our friends spoke much of sumner and prescott who had visited there also of mr lawrence our former ambassador who had visited them just before his return  after a very pleasant day we left with regret the warmth of this hospitable circle thus breaking one more of the links that bind us to the english shore  nine oclock in the evening found us sitting by a cheerful fire in the parlor of mr e baines at leeds the father of our host was one of the most energetic parliamentary advocates of the repeal of the corn laws mr b spoke warmly of lord carlisle and gave me the whole interesting history of the campaign which the vase at castle howard commemorated and read me the speech of lord c on that occasion  it has occurred to me that the superior stability of the english aristocracy as compared with that of other countries might be traced in part to their relations with the representative branch of the government the eldest son and heir is generally returned to the house of commons by the vote of the people before he is called to take his seat in the house of peers thus the same ties bind them to the people which bind our own representativesa peculiarity which i believe never existed permanently with the nobles in any other country by this means the nobility when they enter the house of lords are better adapted to legislate wisely for the interests not of a class but of the whole people  the next day the house was filled with company and the leeds offering was presented the account of which you will see in the papers every thing was arranged with the greatest consideration i saw many interesting people and was delighted with the strong religious interest in the cause of liberty pervading all hearts truly it may be said that wilberforce and clarkson lighted a candle which will never go out in england  monday we spent in a delightful visit to fountains abbey less rich in carvings than melrose but wider in extent and of a peculiar architectural beauty we lunched in what was the side gallery of the refectory where some drowsy old brother used to read the lives of saints to the monks eating below we walked over the graves of abbots and through the scriptorium which reminded me of the exquisite scene in the golden legend of the old monk in the scriptorium busily illuminating a manuscript  in the course of the afternoon a telegraph came from the mayor of liverpool to inquire if our party would accept a public breakfast at the town hall before sailing as a demonstration of sympathy with the cause of freedom remembering the time when clarkson began his career amid such opposition in liverpool we could not but regard such an evidence of its present public sentiment as full of encouragement although the state of my health and engagements rendered it necessary for me to decline  tuesday we parted from our excellent friends in leeds and soon found ourselves once more in the beautiful dingle our first and our last restingplace on english shores  sad letters from home met us there yet not sad since they only told us of friends admitted before us to that mystery of glory for which we are longingof which all that we have seen in art or nature are but dim suggestions and images  a deputation from ireland here met me presenting a beautiful bog oak casket lined with gold and carved with appropriate national symbols containing an offering for the cause of the oppressed they read a beautiful address and touched upon the importance of inspiring with the principles of emancipation the irish nation whose influence in our land is becoming so great had time and strength permitted it had been my purpose to visit ireland to revisit scotland and to see more of england but it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps  and now came parting leave taking last letters notes and messages  the mayor of liverpool and the rev dr raffles breakfasted with us and after breakfast dr r commended us in prayer to god could we feel in this parting that we were leaving those whom we had known for so brief a space never have i so truly felt the unity of the christian church that oneness of the great family in heaven and on earth as in the experience of this journey a large party accompanied us to the wharf and went with us on board the tender the shores were lined with sympathizing friends who waved their adieus to us as we parted and thus almost sadly as a child might leave its home i left the shores of kind strong old englandthe mother of us all  the end
