chapter i  out to sea   i had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me or to any other  i may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale  when my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much and that i was prone to doubtfulness his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript and dry official records of the british colonial office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative  i do not say the story is true for i did not witness the happenings which it portrays but the fact that in the telling of it to you i have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it may be true  the yellow mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead and the records of the colonial office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host and so i give you the story as i painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies  if you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique remarkable and interesting  from the records of the colonial office and from the dead mans diary we learn that a certain young english nobleman whom we shall call john clayton lord greystoke was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a british west coast african colony from whose simple native inhabitants another european power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the congo and the aruwimi  the natives of the british colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises but that few if any ever returned to their families  the englishmen in africa went even further saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers and they were told that they had yet several years to serve  and so the colonial office appointed john clayton to a new post in british west africa but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black british subjects by the officers of a friendly european power  why he was sent is however of little moment to this story for he never made an investigation nor in fact did he ever reach his destination  clayton was the type of englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefieldsa strong virile manmentally morally and physically  in stature he was above the average height his eyes were gray his features regular and strong his carriage that of perfect robust health influenced by his years of army training  political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the colonial office and so we find him still young entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the queen  when he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled  the preferment seemed to him in the nature of a wellmerited reward for painstaking and intelligent service and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility but on the other hand he had been married to the hon alice rutherford for scarce a three months and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical africa that appalled him  for her sake he would have refused the appointment but she would not have it so  instead she insisted that he accept and indeed take her with him  there were mothers and brothers and sisters and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject but as to what they severally advised history is silent  we know only that on a bright may morning in 1888 john lord greystoke and lady alice sailed from dover on their way to africa  a month later they arrived at freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel the fuwalda which was to bear them to their final destination  and here john lord greystoke and lady alice his wife vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men  two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of freetown a half dozen british war vessels were scouring the south atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of st helena which convinced the world that the fuwalda had gone down with all on board and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years  the fuwalda a barkentine of about one hundred tons was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern atlantic their crews composed of the offscourings of the seaunhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation  the fuwalda was no exception to the rule  her officers were swarthy bullies hating and hated by their crew  the captain while a competent seaman was a brute in his treatment of his men  he knew or at least he used but two arguments in his dealings with thema belaying pin and a revolvernor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else  so it was that from the second day out from freetown john clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea  it was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man  two sailors were washing down the decks of the fuwalda the first mate was on duty and the captain had stopped to speak with john clayton and lady alice  the men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors  closer and closer they came until one of them was directly behind the captain  in another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded  but just that instant the officer turned to leave lord and lady greystoke and as he did so tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck overturning the waterpail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents  for an instant the scene was ludicrous but only for an instant  with a volley of awful oaths his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage the captain regained his feet and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck  the man was small and rather old so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated  the other seaman however was neither old nor smalla huge bear of a man with fierce black mustachios and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders  as he saw his mate go down he crouched and with a low snarl sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow  from scarlet the officers face went white for this was mutiny and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career  without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him but quick as he was john clayton was almost as quick so that the bullet which was intended for the sailors heart lodged in the sailors leg instead for lord greystoke had struck down the captains arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun  words passed between clayton and the captain the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and lady greystoke remained passengers  the captain was on the point of making an angry reply but thinking better of it turned on his heel and black and scowling strode aft  he did not care to antagonize an english official for the queens mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate and which he fearedenglands farreaching navy  the two sailors picked themselves up the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise  the big fellow who was known among his mates as black michael tried his leg gingerly and finding that it bore his weight turned to clayton with a word of gruff thanks  though the fellows tone was surly his words were evidently well meant  ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation  they did not see him again for several days nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them  they took their meals in his cabin as they had before the unfortunate occurrence but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time  the other officers were coarse illiterate fellows but little above the villainous crew they bullied and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished english noble and his lady so that the claytons were left very much to themselves  this in itself accorded perfectly with their desires but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy  there was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that undefinable something which presages disaster  outwardly to the knowledge of the claytons all went on as before upon the little vessel but that there was an undertow leading them toward some unknown danger both felt though they did not speak of it to each other  on the second day after the wounding of black michael clayton came on deck just in time to see the limp body of one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate a heavy belaying pin in his hand stood glowering at the little party of sullen sailors  clayton asked no questionshe did not need toand the following day as the great lines of a british battleship grew out of the distant horizon he half determined to demand that he and lady alice be put aboard her for his fears were steadily increasing that nothing but harm could result from remaining on the lowering sullen fuwalda  toward noon they were within speaking distance of the british vessel but when clayton had nearly decided to ask the captain to put them aboard her the obvious ridiculousness of such a request became suddenly apparent  what reason could he give the officer commanding her majestys ship for desiring to go back in the direction from which he had just come  what if he told them that two insubordinate seamen had been roughly handled by their officers  they would but laugh in their sleeves and attribute his reason for wishing to leave the ship to but one thingcowardice  john clayton lord greystoke did not ask to be transferred to the british manofwar  late in the afternoon he saw her upper works fade below the far horizon but not before he learned that which confirmed his greatest fears and caused him to curse the false pride which had restrained him from seeking safety for his young wife a few short hours before when safety was within reacha safety which was now gone forever  it was midafternoon that brought the little old sailor who had been felled by the captain a few days before to where clayton and his wife stood by the ships side watching the ever diminishing outlines of the great battleship  the old fellow was polishing brasses and as he came edging along until close to clayton he said in an undertone  ells to pay sir on this ere craft an mark my word for it sir ells to pay  what do you mean my good fellow asked clayton  wy hasnt ye seen wats goin on  hasnt ye eard that devils spawn of a capting an is mates knockin the bloomin lights outen arf the crew  two busted eads yesteday an three today  black michaels as good as new agin an es not the bully to stand fer it not e an mark my word for it sir  you mean my man that the crew contemplates mutiny asked clayton  mutiny exclaimed the old fellow  mutiny  they means murder sir an mark my word for it sir  when  hits comin sir hits comin but im not asayin wen an ive said too damned much now but ye was a good sort tother day an i thought it no moren right to warn ye  but keep a still tongue in yer ead an when ye ear shootin git below an stay there  thats all only keep a still tongue in yer ead or theyll put a pill between yer ribs an mark my word for it sir and the old fellow went on with his polishing which carried him away from where the claytons were standing  deuced cheerful outlook alice said clayton  you should warn the captain at once john  possibly the trouble may yet be averted she said  i suppose i should but yet from purely selfish motives i am almost prompted to keep a still tongue in my ead whatever they do now they will spare us in recognition of my stand for this fellow black michael but should they find that i had betrayed them there would be no mercy shown us alice  you have but one duty john and that lies in the interest of vested authority  if you do not warn the captain you are as much a party to whatever follows as though you had helped to plot and carry it out with your own head and hands  you do not understand dear replied clayton  it is of you i am thinkingthere lies my first duty  the captain has brought this condition upon himself so why then should i risk subjecting my wife to unthinkable horrors in a probably futile attempt to save him from his own brutal folly  you have no conception dear of what would follow were this pack of cutthroats to gain control of the fuwalda  duty is duty john and no amount of sophistries may change it  i would be a poor wife for an english lord were i to be responsible for his shirking a plain duty  i realize the danger which must follow but i can face it with you  have it as you will then alice he answered smiling  maybe we are borrowing trouble  while i do not like the looks of things on board this ship they may not be so bad after all for it is possible that the ancient mariner was but voicing the desires of his wicked old heart rather than speaking of real facts  mutiny on the high sea may have been common a hundred years ago but in this good year 1888 it is the least likely of happenings  but there goes the captain to his cabin now  if i am going to warn him i might as well get the beastly job over for i have little stomach to talk with the brute at all  so saying he strolled carelessly in the direction of the companionway through which the captain had passed and a moment later was knocking at his door  come in growled the deep tones of that surly officer  and when clayton had entered and closed the door behind him  well  i have come to report the gist of a conversation i heard today because i feel that while there may be nothing to it it is as well that you be forearmed  in short the men contemplate mutiny and murder  its a lie roared the captain  and if you have been interfering again with the discipline of this ship or meddling in affairs that dont concern you you can take the consequences and be damned  i dont care whether you are an english lord or not  im captain of this here ship and from now on you keep your meddling nose out of my business  the captain had worked himself up to such a frenzy of rage that he was fairly purple of face and he shrieked the last words at the top of his voice emphasizing his remarks by a loud thumping of the table with one huge fist and shaking the other in claytons face  greystoke never turned a hair but stood eying the excited man with level gaze  captain billings he drawled finally if you will pardon my candor i might remark that you are something of an ass  whereupon he turned and left the captain with the same indifferent ease that was habitual with him and which was more surely calculated to raise the ire of a man of billings class than a torrent of invective  so whereas the captain might easily have been brought to regret his hasty speech had clayton attempted to conciliate him his temper was now irrevocably set in the mold in which clayton had left it and the last chance of their working together for their common good was gone  well alice said clayton as he rejoined his wife i might have saved my breath  the fellow proved most ungrateful  fairly jumped at me like a mad dog  he and his blasted old ship may hang for aught i care and until we are safely off the thing i shall spend my energies in looking after our own welfare  and i rather fancy the first step to that end should be to go to our cabin and look over my revolvers  i am sorry now that we packed the larger guns and the ammunition with the stuff below  they found their quarters in a bad state of disorder  clothing from their open boxes and bags strewed the little apartment and even their beds had been torn to pieces  evidently someone was more anxious about our belongings than we said clayton  lets have a look around alice and see whats missing  a thorough search revealed the fact that nothing had been taken but claytons two revolvers and the small supply of ammunition he had saved out for them  those are the very things i most wish they had left us said clayton and the fact that they wished for them and them alone is most sinister  what are we to do john asked his wife  perhaps you were right in that our best chance lies in maintaining a neutral position  if the officers are able to prevent a mutiny we have nothing to fear while if the mutineers are victorious our one slim hope lies in not having attempted to thwart or antagonize them  right you are alice  well keep in the middle of the road  as they started to straighten up their cabin clayton and his wife simultaneously noticed the corner of a piece of paper protruding from beneath the door of their quarters  as clayton stooped to reach for it he was amazed to see it move further into the room and then he realized that it was being pushed inward by someone from without  quickly and silently he stepped toward the door but as he reached for the knob to throw it open his wifes hand fell upon his wrist  no john she whispered  they do not wish to be seen and so we cannot afford to see them  do not forget that we are keeping to the middle of the road  clayton smiled and dropped his hand to his side  thus they stood watching the little bit of white paper until it finally remained at rest upon the floor just inside the door  then clayton stooped and picked it up  it was a bit of grimy white paper roughly folded into a ragged square  opening it they found a crude message printed almost illegibly and with many evidences of an unaccustomed task  translated it was a warning to the claytons to refrain from reporting the loss of the revolvers or from repeating what the old sailor had told themto refrain on pain of death  i rather imagine well be good said clayton with a rueful smile about all we can do is to sit tight and wait for whatever may come     chapter ii  the savage home   nor did they have long to wait for the next morning as clayton was emerging on deck for his accustomed walk before breakfast a shot rang out and then another and another  the sight which met his eyes confirmed his worst fears  facing the little knot of officers was the entire motley crew of the fuwalda and at their head stood black michael  at the first volley from the officers the men ran for shelter and from points of vantage behind masts wheelhouse and cabin they returned the fire of the five men who represented the hated authority of the ship  two of their number had gone down before the captains revolver  they lay where they had fallen between the combatants  but then the first mate lunged forward upon his face and at a cry of command from black michael the mutineers charged the remaining four  the crew had been able to muster but six firearms so most of them were armed with boat hooks axes hatchets and crowbars  the captain had emptied his revolver and was reloading as the charge was made  the second mates gun had jammed and so there were but two weapons opposed to the mutineers as they bore down upon the officers who now started to give back before the infuriated rush of their men  both sides were cursing and swearing in a frightful manner which together with the reports of the firearms and the screams and groans of the wounded turned the deck of the fuwalda to the likeness of a madhouse  before the officers had taken a dozen backward steps the men were upon them  an ax in the hands of a burly negro cleft the captain from forehead to chin and an instant later the others were down dead or wounded from dozens of blows and bullet wounds  short and grisly had been the work of the mutineers of the fuwalda and through it all john clayton had stood leaning carelessly beside the companionway puffing meditatively upon his pipe as though he had been but watching an indifferent cricket match  as the last officer went down he thought it was time that he returned to his wife lest some members of the crew find her alone below  though outwardly calm and indifferent clayton was inwardly apprehensive and wrought up for he feared for his wifes safety at the hands of these ignorant halfbrutes into whose hands fate had so remorselessly thrown them  as he turned to descend the ladder he was surprised to see his wife standing on the steps almost at his side  how long have you been here alice  since the beginning she replied  how awful john  oh how awful what can we hope for at the hands of such as those  breakfast i hope he answered smiling bravely in an attempt to allay her fears  at least he added im going to ask them  come with me alice  we must not let them think we expect any but courteous treatment  the men had by this time surrounded the dead and wounded officers and without either partiality or compassion proceeded to throw both living and dead over the sides of the vessel  with equal heartlessness they disposed of their own dead and dying  presently one of the crew spied the approaching claytons and with a cry of  heres two more for the fishes rushed toward them with uplifted ax  but black michael was even quicker so that the fellow went down with a bullet in his back before he had taken a half dozen steps  with a loud roar black michael attracted the attention of the others and pointing to lord and lady greystoke cried  these here are my friends and they are to be left alone  dye understand  im captain of this ship now an what i says goes he added turning to clayton  just keep to yourselves and nobodyll harm ye and he looked threateningly on his fellows  the claytons heeded black michaels instructions so well that they saw but little of the crew and knew nothing of the plans the men were making  occasionally they heard faint echoes of brawls and quarreling among the mutineers and on two occasions the vicious bark of firearms rang out on the still air  but black michael was a fit leader for this band of cutthroats and withal held them in fair subjection to his rule  on the fifth day following the murder of the ships officers land was sighted by the lookout  whether island or mainland black michael did not know but he announced to clayton that if investigation showed that the place was habitable he and lady greystoke were to be put ashore with their belongings  youll be all right there for a few months he explained and by that time well have been able to make an inhabited coast somewhere and scatter a bit  then ill see that yer goverments notified where you be an theyll soon send a manowar to fetch ye off  it would be a hard matter to land you in civilization without a lot o questions being asked an none o us here has any very convincin answers up our sleeves  clayton remonstrated against the inhumanity of landing them upon an unknown shore to be left to the mercies of savage beasts and possibly still more savage men  but his words were of no avail and only tended to anger black michael so he was forced to desist and make the best he could of a bad situation  about three oclock in the afternoon they came about off a beautiful wooded shore opposite the mouth of what appeared to be a landlocked harbor  black michael sent a small boat filled with men to sound the entrance in an effort to determine if the fuwalda could be safely worked through the entrance  in about an hour they returned and reported deep water through the passage as well as far into the little basin  before dark the barkentine lay peacefully at anchor upon the bosom of the still mirrorlike surface of the harbor  the surrounding shores were beautiful with semitropical verdure while in the distance the country rose from the ocean in hill and tableland almost uniformly clothed by primeval forest  no signs of habitation were visible but that the land might easily support human life was evidenced by the abundant bird and animal life of which the watchers on the fuwaldas deck caught occasional glimpses as well as by the shimmer of a little river which emptied into the harbor insuring fresh water in plenitude  as darkness settled upon the earth clayton and lady alice still stood by the ships rail in silent contemplation of their future abode  from the dark shadows of the mighty forest came the wild calls of savage beaststhe deep roar of the lion and occasionally the shrill scream of a panther  the woman shrank closer to the man in terrorstricken anticipation of the horrors lying in wait for them in the awful blackness of the nights to come when they should be alone upon that wild and lonely shore  later in the evening black michael joined them long enough to instruct them to make their preparations for landing on the morrow  they tried to persuade him to take them to some more hospitable coast near enough to civilization so that they might hope to fall into friendly hands but no pleas or threats or promises of reward could move him  i am the only man aboard who would not rather see ye both safely dead and while i know thats the sensible way to make sure of our own necks yet black michaels not the man to forget a favor  ye saved my life once and in return im goin to spare yours but thats all i can do  the men wont stand for any more and if we dont get ye landed pretty quick they may even change their minds about giving ye that much show ill put all yer stuff ashore with ye as well as cookin utensils an some old sails for tents an enough grub to last ye until ye can find fruit and game  with yer guns for protection ye ought to be able to live here easy enough until help comes  when i get safely hid away ill see to it that the british goverment learns about where ye be for the life of me i couldnt tell em exactly where for i dont know myself  but theyll find ye all right  after he had left them they went silently below each wrapped in gloomy forebodings  clayton did not believe that black michael had the slightest intention of notifying the british government of their whereabouts nor was he any too sure but that some treachery was contemplated for the following day when they should be on shore with the sailors who would have to accompany them with their belongings  once out of black michaels sight any of the men might strike them down and still leave black michaels conscience clear  and even should they escape that fate was it not but to be faced with far graver dangers  alone he might hope to survive for years for he was a strong athletic man  but what of alice and that other little life so soon to be launched amidst the hardships and grave dangers of a primeval world  the man shuddered as he meditated upon the awful gravity the fearful helplessness of their situation  but it was a merciful providence which prevented him from foreseeing the hideous reality which awaited them in the grim depths of that gloomy wood  early next morning their numerous chests and boxes were hoisted on deck and lowered to waiting small boats for transportation to shore  there was a great quantity and variety of stuff as the claytons had expected a possible five to eight years residence in their new home thus in addition to the many necessities they had brought there were also many luxuries  black michael was determined that nothing belonging to the claytons should be left on board  whether out of compassion for them or in furtherance of his own selfinterests it would be difficult to say  there was no question but that the presence of property of a missing british official upon a suspicious vessel would have been a difficult thing to explain in any civilized port in the world  so zealous was he in his efforts to carry out his intentions that he insisted upon the return of claytons revolvers to him by the sailors in whose possession they were  into the small boats were also loaded salt meats and biscuit with a small supply of potatoes and beans matches and cooking vessels a chest of tools and the old sails which black michael had promised them  as though himself fearing the very thing which clayton had suspected black michael accompanied them to shore and was the last to leave them when the small boats having filled the ships casks with fresh water were pushed out toward the waiting fuwalda  as the boats moved slowly over the smooth waters of the bay clayton and his wife stood silently watching their departurein the breasts of both a feeling of impending disaster and utter hopelessness  and behind them over the edge of a low ridge other eyes watchedclose set wicked eyes gleaming beneath shaggy brows  as the fuwalda passed through the narrow entrance to the harbor and out of sight behind a projecting point lady alice threw her arms about claytons neck and burst into uncontrolled sobs  bravely had she faced the dangers of the mutiny with heroic fortitude she had looked into the terrible future but now that the horror of absolute solitude was upon them her overwrought nerves gave way and the reaction came  he did not attempt to check her tears  it were better that nature have her way in relieving these longpent emotions and it was many minutes before the girllittle more than a child she wascould again gain mastery of herself  oh john she cried at last the horror of it  what are we to do what are we to do  there is but one thing to do alice and he spoke as quietly as though they were sitting in their snug living room at home and that is work  work must be our salvation  we must not give ourselves time to think for in that direction lies madness  we must work and wait  i am sure that relief will come and come quickly when once it is apparent that the fuwalda has been lost even though black michael does not keep his word to us  but john if it were only you and i she sobbed we could endure it i know but  yes dear he answered gently i have been thinking of that also but we must face it as we must face whatever comes bravely and with the utmost confidence in our ability to cope with circumstances whatever they may be  hundreds of thousands of years ago our ancestors of the dim and distant past faced the same problems which we must face possibly in these same primeval forests  that we are here today evidences their victory  what they did may we not do  and even better for are we not armed with ages of superior knowledge and have we not the means of protection defense and sustenance which science has given us but of which they were totally ignorant  what they accomplished alice with instruments and weapons of stone and bone surely that may we accomplish also  ah john i wish that i might be a man with a mans philosophy but i am but a woman seeing with my heart rather than my head and all that i can see is too horrible too unthinkable to put into words  i only hope you are right john  i will do my best to be a brave primeval woman a fit mate for the primeval man  claytons first thought was to arrange a sleeping shelter for the night something which might serve to protect them from prowling beasts of prey  he opened the box containing his rifles and ammunition that they might both be armed against possible attack while at work and then together they sought a location for their first nights sleeping place  a hundred yards from the beach was a little level spot fairly free of trees here they decided eventually to build a permanent house but for the time being they both thought it best to construct a little platform in the trees out of reach of the larger of the savage beasts in whose realm they were  to this end clayton selected four trees which formed a rectangle about eight feet square and cutting long branches from other trees he constructed a framework around them about ten feet from the ground fastening the ends of the branches securely to the trees by means of rope a quantity of which black michael had furnished him from the hold of the fuwalda  across this framework clayton placed other smaller branches quite close together  this platform he paved with the huge fronds of elephants ear which grew in profusion about them and over the fronds he laid a great sail folded into several thicknesses  seven feet higher he constructed a similar though lighter platform to serve as roof and from the sides of this he suspended the balance of his sailcloth for walls  when completed he had a rather snug little nest to which he carried their blankets and some of the lighter luggage  it was now late in the afternoon and the balance of the daylight hours were devoted to the building of a rude ladder by means of which lady alice could mount to her new home  all during the day the forest about them had been filled with excited birds of brilliant plumage and dancing chattering monkeys who watched these new arrivals and their wonderful nest building operations with every mark of keenest interest and fascination  notwithstanding that both clayton and his wife kept a sharp lookout they saw nothing of larger animals though on two occasions they had seen their little simian neighbors come screaming and chattering from the nearby ridge casting frightened glances back over their little shoulders and evincing as plainly as though by speech that they were fleeing some terrible thing which lay concealed there  just before dusk clayton finished his ladder and filling a great basin with water from the nearby stream the two mounted to the comparative safety of their aerial chamber  as it was quite warm clayton had left the side curtains thrown back over the roof and as they sat like turks upon their blankets lady alice straining her eyes into the darkening shadows of the wood suddenly reached out and grasped claytons arms  john she whispered look  what is it a man  as clayton turned his eyes in the direction she indicated he saw silhouetted dimly against the shadows beyond a great figure standing upright upon the ridge  for a moment it stood as though listening and then turned slowly and melted into the shadows of the jungle  what is it john  i do not know alice he answered gravely it is too dark to see so far and it may have been but a shadow cast by the rising moon  no john if it was not a man it was some huge and grotesque mockery of man  oh i am afraid  he gathered her in his arms whispering words of courage and love into her ears  soon after he lowered the curtain walls tying them securely to the trees so that except for a little opening toward the beach they were entirely enclosed  as it was now pitch dark within their tiny aerie they lay down upon their blankets to try to gain through sleep a brief respite of forgetfulness  clayton lay facing the opening at the front a rifle and a brace of revolvers at his hand  scarcely had they closed their eyes than the terrifying cry of a panther rang out from the jungle behind them  closer and closer it came until they could hear the great beast directly beneath them  for an hour or more they heard it sniffing and clawing at the trees which supported their platform but at last it roamed away across the beach where clayton could see it clearly in the brilliant moonlighta great handsome beast the largest he had ever seen  during the long hours of darkness they caught but fitful snatches of sleep for the night noises of a great jungle teeming with myriad animal life kept their overwrought nerves on edge so that a hundred times they were startled to wakefulness by piercing screams or the stealthy moving of great bodies beneath them     chapter iii  life and death   morning found them but little if at all refreshed though it was with a feeling of intense relief that they saw the day dawn  as soon as they had made their meager breakfast of salt pork coffee and biscuit clayton commenced work upon their house for he realized that they could hope for no safety and no peace of mind at night until four strong walls effectually barred the jungle life from them  the task was an arduous one and required the better part of a month though he built but one small room  he constructed his cabin of small logs about six inches in diameter stopping the chinks with clay which he found at the depth of a few feet beneath the surface soil  at one end he built a fireplace of small stones from the beach  these also he set in clay and when the house had been entirely completed he applied a coating of the clay to the entire outside surface to the thickness of four inches  in the window opening he set small branches about an inch in diameter both vertically and horizontally and so woven that they formed a substantial grating that could withstand the strength of a powerful animal  thus they obtained air and proper ventilation without fear of lessening the safety of their cabin  the ashaped roof was thatched with small branches laid close together and over these long jungle grass and palm fronds with a final coating of clay  the door he built of pieces of the packingboxes which had held their belongings nailing one piece upon another the grain of contiguous layers running transversely until he had a solid body some three inches thick and of such great strength that they were both moved to laughter as they gazed upon it  here the greatest difficulty confronted clayton for he had no means whereby to hang his massive door now that he had built it  after two days work however he succeeded in fashioning two massive hardwood hinges and with these he hung the door so that it opened and closed easily  the stuccoing and other final touches were added after they moved into the house which they had done as soon as the roof was on piling their boxes before the door at night and thus having a comparatively safe and comfortable habitation  the building of a bed chairs table and shelves was a relatively easy matter so that by the end of the second month they were well settled and but for the constant dread of attack by wild beasts and the ever growing loneliness they were not uncomfortable or unhappy  at night great beasts snarled and roared about their tiny cabin but so accustomed may one become to oft repeated noises that soon they paid little attention to them sleeping soundly the whole night through  thrice had they caught fleeting glimpses of great manlike figures like that of the first night but never at sufficiently close range to know positively whether the halfseen forms were those of man or brute  the brilliant birds and the little monkeys had become accustomed to their new acquaintances and as they had evidently never seen human beings before they presently after their first fright had worn off approached closer and closer impelled by that strange curiosity which dominates the wild creatures of the forest and the jungle and the plain so that within the first month several of the birds had gone so far as even to accept morsels of food from the friendly hands of the claytons  one afternoon while clayton was working upon an addition to their cabin for he contemplated building several more rooms a number of their grotesque little friends came shrieking and scolding through the trees from the direction of the ridge  ever as they fled they cast fearful glances back of them and finally they stopped near clayton jabbering excitedly to him as though to warn him of approaching danger  at last he saw it the thing the little monkeys so fearedthe manbrute of which the claytons had caught occasional fleeting glimpses  it was approaching through the jungle in a semierect position now and then placing the backs of its closed fists upon the grounda great anthropoid ape and as it advanced it emitted deep guttural growls and an occasional low barking sound  clayton was at some distance from the cabin having come to fell a particularly perfect tree for his building operations  grown careless from months of continued safety during which time he had seen no dangerous animals during the daylight hours he had left his rifles and revolvers all within the little cabin and now that he saw the great ape crashing through the underbrush directly toward him and from a direction which practically cut him off from escape he felt a vague little shiver play up and down his spine  he knew that armed only with an ax his chances with this ferocious monster were small indeedand alice o god he thought what will become of alice  there was yet a slight chance of reaching the cabin  he turned and ran toward it shouting an alarm to his wife to run in and close the great door in case the ape cut off his retreat  lady greystoke had been sitting a little way from the cabin and when she heard his cry she looked up to see the ape springing with almost incredible swiftness for so large and awkward an animal in an effort to head off clayton  with a low cry she sprang toward the cabin and as she entered gave a backward glance which filled her soul with terror for the brute had intercepted her husband who now stood at bay grasping his ax with both hands ready to swing it upon the infuriated animal when he should make his final charge  close and bolt the door alice cried clayton  i can finish this fellow with my ax  but he knew he was facing a horrible death and so did she  the ape was a great bull weighing probably three hundred pounds  his nasty closeset eyes gleamed hatred from beneath his shaggy brows while his great canine fangs were bared in a horrid snarl as he paused a moment before his prey  over the brutes shoulder clayton could see the doorway of his cabin not twenty paces distant and a great wave of horror and fear swept over him as he saw his young wife emerge armed with one of his rifles  she had always been afraid of firearms and would never touch them but now she rushed toward the ape with the fearlessness of a lioness protecting its young  back alice shouted clayton for gods sake go back  but she would not heed and just then the ape charged so that clayton could say no more  the man swung his ax with all his mighty strength but the powerful brute seized it in those terrible hands and tearing it from claytons grasp hurled it far to one side  with an ugly snarl he closed upon his defenseless victim but ere his fangs had reached the throat they thirsted for there was a sharp report and a bullet entered the apes back between his shoulders  throwing clayton to the ground the beast turned upon his new enemy there before him stood the terrified girl vainly trying to fire another bullet into the animals body but she did not understand the mechanism of the firearm and the hammer fell futilely upon an empty cartridge  almost simultaneously clayton regained his feet and without thought of the utter hopelessness of it he rushed forward to drag the ape from his wifes prostrate form  with little or no effort he succeeded and the great bulk rolled inertly upon the turf before himthe ape was dead  the bullet had done its work  a hasty examination of his wife revealed no marks upon her and clayton decided that the huge brute had died the instant he had sprung toward alice  gently he lifted his wifes still unconscious form and bore her to the little cabin but it was fully two hours before she regained consciousness  her first words filled clayton with vague apprehension  for some time after regaining her senses alice gazed wonderingly about the interior of the little cabin and then with a satisfied sigh said  o john it is so good to be really home  i have had an awful dream dear  i thought we were no longer in london but in some horrible place where great beasts attacked us  there there alice he said stroking her forehead try to sleep again and do not worry your head about bad dreams  that night a little son was born in the tiny cabin beside the primeval forest while a leopard screamed before the door and the deep notes of a lions roar sounded from beyond the ridge  lady greystoke never recovered from the shock of the great apes attack and though she lived for a year after her baby was born she was never again outside the cabin nor did she ever fully realize that she was not in england  sometimes she would question clayton as to the strange noises of the nights the absence of servants and friends and the strange rudeness of the furnishings within her room but though he made no effort to deceive her never could she grasp the meaning of it all  in other ways she was quite rational and the joy and happiness she took in the possession of her little son and the constant attentions of her husband made that year a very happy one for her the happiest of her young life  that it would have been beset by worries and apprehension had she been in full command of her mental faculties clayton well knew so that while he suffered terribly to see her so there were times when he was almost glad for her sake that she could not understand  long since had he given up any hope of rescue except through accident with unremitting zeal he had worked to beautify the interior of the cabin  skins of lion and panther covered the floor  cupboards and bookcases lined the walls  odd vases made by his own hand from the clay of the region held beautiful tropical flowers  curtains of grass and bamboo covered the windows and most arduous task of all with his meager assortment of tools he had fashioned lumber to neatly seal the walls and ceiling and lay a smooth floor within the cabin  that he had been able to turn his hands at all to such unaccustomed labor was a source of mild wonder to him  but he loved the work because it was for her and the tiny life that had come to cheer them though adding a hundredfold to his responsibilities and to the terribleness of their situation  during the year that followed clayton was several times attacked by the great apes which now seemed to continually infest the vicinity of the cabin but as he never again ventured outside without both rifle and revolvers he had little fear of the huge beasts  he had strengthened the window protections and fitted a unique wooden lock to the cabin door so that when he hunted for game and fruits as it was constantly necessary for him to do to insure sustenance he had no fear that any animal could break into the little home  at first he shot much of the game from the cabin windows but toward the end the animals learned to fear the strange lair from whence issued the terrifying thunder of his rifle  in his leisure clayton read often aloud to his wife from the store of books he had brought for their new home  among these were many for little childrenpicture books primers readersfor they had known that their little child would be old enough for such before they might hope to return to england  at other times clayton wrote in his diary which he had always been accustomed to keep in french and in which he recorded the details of their strange life  this book he kept locked in a little metal box  a year from the day her little son was born lady alice passed quietly away in the night  so peaceful was her end that it was hours before clayton could awake to a realization that his wife was dead  the horror of the situation came to him very slowly and it is doubtful that he ever fully realized the enormity of his sorrow and the fearful responsibility that had devolved upon him with the care of that wee thing his son still a nursing babe  the last entry in his diary was made the morning following her death and there he recites the sad details in a matteroffact way that adds to the pathos of it for it breathes a tired apathy born of long sorrow and hopelessness which even this cruel blow could scarcely awake to further suffering   my little son is crying for nourishmento alice alice what shall i do   and as john clayton wrote the last words his hand was destined ever to pen he dropped his head wearily upon his outstretched arms where they rested upon the table he had built for her who lay still and cold in the bed beside him  for a long time no sound broke the deathlike stillness of the jungle midday save the piteous wailing of the tiny manchild     chapter iv  the apes   in the forest of the tableland a mile back from the ocean old kerchak the ape was on a rampage of rage among his people  the younger and lighter members of his tribe scampered to the higher branches of the great trees to escape his wrath risking their lives upon branches that scarce supported their weight rather than face old kerchak in one of his fits of uncontrolled anger  the other males scattered in all directions but not before the infuriated brute had felt the vertebra of one snap between his great foaming jaws  a luckless young female slipped from an insecure hold upon a high branch and came crashing to the ground almost at kerchaks feet  with a wild scream he was upon her tearing a great piece from her side with his mighty teeth and striking her viciously upon her head and shoulders with a broken tree limb until her skull was crushed to a jelly  and then he spied kala who returning from a search for food with her young babe was ignorant of the state of the mighty males temper until suddenly the shrill warnings of her fellows caused her to scamper madly for safety  but kerchak was close upon her so close that he had almost grasped her ankle had she not made a furious leap far into space from one tree to anothera perilous chance which apes seldom if ever take unless so closely pursued by danger that there is no alternative  she made the leap successfully but as she grasped the limb of the further tree the sudden jar loosened the hold of the tiny babe where it clung frantically to her neck and she saw the little thing hurled turning and twisting to the ground thirty feet below  with a low cry of dismay kala rushed headlong to its side thoughtless now of the danger from kerchak but when she gathered the wee mangled form to her bosom life had left it  with low moans she sat cuddling the body to her nor did kerchak attempt to molest her  with the death of the babe his fit of demoniacal rage passed as suddenly as it had seized him  kerchak was a huge king ape weighing perhaps three hundred and fifty pounds  his forehead was extremely low and receding his eyes bloodshot small and close set to his coarse flat nose his ears large and thin but smaller than most of his kind  his awful temper and his mighty strength made him supreme among the little tribe into which he had been born some twenty years before  now that he was in his prime there was no simian in all the mighty forest through which he roved that dared contest his right to rule nor did the other and larger animals molest him  old tantor the elephant alone of all the wild savage life feared him notand he alone did kerchak fear  when tantor trumpeted the great ape scurried with his fellows high among the trees of the second terrace  the tribe of anthropoids over which kerchak ruled with an iron hand and bared fangs numbered some six or eight families each family consisting of an adult male with his females and their young numbering in all some sixty or seventy apes  kala was the youngest mate of a male called tublat meaning broken nose and the child she had seen dashed to death was her first for she was but nine or ten years old  notwithstanding her youth she was large and powerfula splendid cleanlimbed animal with a round high forehead which denoted more intelligence than most of her kind possessed  so also she had a great capacity for mother love and mother sorrow  but she was still an ape a huge fierce terrible beast of a species closely allied to the gorilla yet more intelligent which with the strength of their cousin made her kind the most fearsome of those aweinspiring progenitors of man  when the tribe saw that kerchaks rage had ceased they came slowly down from their arboreal retreats and pursued again the various occupations which he had interrupted  the young played and frolicked about among the trees and bushes  some of the adults lay prone upon the soft mat of dead and decaying vegetation which covered the ground while others turned over pieces of fallen branches and clods of earth in search of the small bugs and reptiles which formed a part of their food  others again searched the surrounding trees for fruit nuts small birds and eggs  they had passed an hour or so thus when kerchak called them together and with a word of command to them to follow him set off toward the sea  they traveled for the most part upon the ground where it was open following the path of the great elephants whose comings and goings break the only roads through those tangled mazes of bush vine creeper and tree  when they walked it was with a rolling awkward motion placing the knuckles of their closed hands upon the ground and swinging their ungainly bodies forward  but when the way was through the lower trees they moved more swiftly swinging from branch to branch with the agility of their smaller cousins the monkeys  and all the way kala carried her little dead baby hugged closely to her breast  it was shortly after noon when they reached a ridge overlooking the beach where below them lay the tiny cottage which was kerchaks goal  he had seen many of his kind go to their deaths before the loud noise made by the little black stick in the hands of the strange white ape who lived in that wonderful lair and kerchak had made up his brute mind to own that deathdealing contrivance and to explore the interior of the mysterious den  he wanted very very much to feel his teeth sink into the neck of the queer animal that he had learned to hate and fear and because of this he came often with his tribe to reconnoiter waiting for a time when the white ape should be off his guard  of late they had quit attacking or even showing themselves for every time they had done so in the past the little stick had roared out its terrible message of death to some member of the tribe  today there was no sign of the man about and from where they watched they could see that the cabin door was open  slowly cautiously and noiselessly they crept through the jungle toward the little cabin  there were no growls no fierce screams of ragethe little black stick had taught them to come quietly lest they awaken it  on on they came until kerchak himself slunk stealthily to the very door and peered within  behind him were two males and then kala closely straining the little dead form to her breast  inside the den they saw the strange white ape lying half across a table his head buried in his arms and on the bed lay a figure covered by a sailcloth while from a tiny rustic cradle came the plaintive wailing of a babe  noiselessly kerchak entered crouching for the charge and then john clayton rose with a sudden start and faced them  the sight that met his eyes must have frozen him with horror for there within the door stood three great bull apes while behind them crowded many more how many he never knew for his revolvers were hanging on the far wall beside his rifle and kerchak was charging  when the king ape released the limp form which had been john clayton lord greystoke he turned his attention toward the little cradle but kala was there before him and when he would have grasped the child she snatched it herself and before he could intercept her she had bolted through the door and taken refuge in a high tree  as she took up the little live baby of alice clayton she dropped the dead body of her own into the empty cradle for the wail of the living had answered the call of universal motherhood within her wild breast which the dead could not still  high up among the branches of a mighty tree she hugged the shrieking infant to her bosom and soon the instinct that was as dominant in this fierce female as it had been in the breast of his tender and beautiful motherthe instinct of mother lovereached out to the tiny manchilds halfformed understanding and he became quiet  then hunger closed the gap between them and the son of an english lord and an english lady nursed at the breast of kala the great ape  in the meantime the beasts within the cabin were warily examining the contents of this strange lair  once satisfied that clayton was dead kerchak turned his attention to the thing which lay upon the bed covered by a piece of sailcloth  gingerly he lifted one corner of the shroud but when he saw the body of the woman beneath he tore the cloth roughly from her form and seized the still white throat in his huge hairy hands  a moment he let his fingers sink deep into the cold flesh and then realizing that she was already dead he turned from her to examine the contents of the room nor did he again molest the body of either lady alice or sir john  the rifle hanging upon the wall caught his first attention it was for this strange deathdealing thunderstick that he had yearned for months but now that it was within his grasp he scarcely had the temerity to seize it  cautiously he approached the thing ready to flee precipitately should it speak in its deep roaring tones as he had heard it speak before the last words to those of his kind who through ignorance or rashness had attacked the wonderful white ape that had borne it  deep in the beasts intelligence was something which assured him that the thunderstick was only dangerous when in the hands of one who could manipulate it but yet it was several minutes ere he could bring himself to touch it  instead he walked back and forth along the floor before it turning his head so that never once did his eyes leave the object of his desire  using his long arms as a man uses crutches and rolling his huge carcass from side to side with each stride the great king ape paced to and fro uttering deep growls occasionally punctuated with the earpiercing scream than which there is no more terrifying noise in all the jungle  presently he halted before the rifle  slowly he raised a huge hand until it almost touched the shining barrel only to withdraw it once more and continue his hurried pacing  it was as though the great brute by this show of fearlessness and through the medium of his wild voice was endeavoring to bolster up his courage to the point which would permit him to take the rifle in his hand  again he stopped and this time succeeded in forcing his reluctant hand to the cold steel only to snatch it away almost immediately and resume his restless beat  time after time this strange ceremony was repeated but on each occasion with increased confidence until finally the rifle was torn from its hook and lay in the grasp of the great brute  finding that it harmed him not kerchak began to examine it closely he felt of it from end to end peered down the black depths of the muzzle fingered the sights the breech the stock and finally the trigger  during all these operations the apes who had entered sat huddled near the door watching their chief while those outside strained and crowded to catch a glimpse of what transpired within  suddenly kerchaks finger closed upon the trigger  there was a deafening roar in the little room and the apes at and beyond the door fell over one another in their wild anxiety to escape  kerchak was equally frightened so frightened in fact that he quite forgot to throw aside the author of that fearful noise but bolted for the door with it tightly clutched in one hand  as he passed through the opening the front sight of the rifle caught upon the edge of the inswung door with sufficient force to close it tightly after the fleeing ape  when kerchak came to a halt a short distance from the cabin and discovered that he still held the rifle he dropped it as he might have dropped a red hot iron nor did he again attempt to recover itthe noise was too much for his brute nerves but he was now quite convinced that the terrible stick was quite harmless by itself if left alone  it was an hour before the apes could again bring themselves to approach the cabin to continue their investigations and when they finally did so they found to their chagrin that the door was closed and so securely fastened that they could not force it  the cleverly constructed latch which clayton had made for the door had sprung as kerchak passed out nor could the apes find means of ingress through the heavily barred windows  after roaming about the vicinity for a short time they started back for the deeper forests and the higher land from whence they had come  kala had not once come to earth with her little adopted babe but now kerchak called to her to descend with the rest and as there was no note of anger in his voice she dropped lightly from branch to branch and joined the others on their homeward march  those of the apes who attempted to examine kalas strange baby were repulsed with bared fangs and low menacing growls accompanied by words of warning from kala  when they assured her that they meant the child no harm she permitted them to come close but would not allow them to touch her charge  it was as though she knew that her baby was frail and delicate and feared lest the rough hands of her fellows might injure the little thing  another thing she did and which made traveling an onerous trial for her  remembering the death of her own little one she clung desperately to the new babe with one hand whenever they were upon the march  the other young rode upon their mothers backs their little arms tightly clasping the hairy necks before them while their legs were locked beneath their mothers armpits  not so with kala she held the small form of the little lord greystoke tightly to her breast where the dainty hands clutched the long black hair which covered that portion of her body  she had seen one child fall from her back to a terrible death and she would take no further chances with this     chapter v  the white ape   tenderly kala nursed her little waif wondering silently why it did not gain strength and agility as did the little apes of other mothers  it was nearly a year from the time the little fellow came into her possession before he would walk alone and as for climbingmy but how stupid he was  kala sometimes talked with the older females about her young hopeful but none of them could understand how a child could be so slow and backward in learning to care for itself  why it could not even find food alone and more than twelve moons had passed since kala had come upon it  had they known that the child had seen thirteen moons before it had come into kalas possession they would have considered its case as absolutely hopeless for the little apes of their own tribe were as far advanced in two or three moons as was this little stranger after twentyfive  tublat kalas husband was sorely vexed and but for the females careful watching would have put the child out of the way  he will never be a great ape he argued  always will you have to carry him and protect him  what good will he be to the tribe  none only a burden  let us leave him quietly sleeping among the tall grasses that you may bear other and stronger apes to guard us in our old age  never broken nose replied kala  if i must carry him forever so be it  and then tublat went to kerchak to urge him to use his authority with kala and force her to give up little tarzan which was the name they had given to the tiny lord greystoke and which meant whiteskin  but when kerchak spoke to her about it kala threatened to run away from the tribe if they did not leave her in peace with the child and as this is one of the inalienable rights of the jungle folk if they be dissatisfied among their own people they bothered her no more for kala was a fine cleanlimbed young female and they did not wish to lose her  as tarzan grew he made more rapid strides so that by the time he was ten years old he was an excellent climber and on the ground could do many wonderful things which were beyond the powers of his little brothers and sisters  in many ways did he differ from them and they often marveled at his superior cunning but in strength and size he was deficient for at ten the great anthropoids were fully grown some of them towering over six feet in height while little tarzan was still but a halfgrown boy  yet such a boy  from early childhood he had used his hands to swing from branch to branch after the manner of his giant mother and as he grew older he spent hour upon hour daily speeding through the tree tops with his brothers and sisters  he could spring twenty feet across space at the dizzy heights of the forest top and grasp with unerring precision and without apparent jar a limb waving wildly in the path of an approaching tornado  he could drop twenty feet at a stretch from limb to limb in rapid descent to the ground or he could gain the utmost pinnacle of the loftiest tropical giant with the ease and swiftness of a squirrel  though but ten years old he was fully as strong as the average man of thirty and far more agile than the most practiced athlete ever becomes  and day by day his strength was increasing  his life among these fierce apes had been happy for his recollection held no other life nor did he know that there existed within the universe aught else than his little forest and the wild jungle animals with which he was familiar  he was nearly ten before he commenced to realize that a great difference existed between himself and his fellows  his little body burned brown by exposure suddenly caused him feelings of intense shame for he realized that it was entirely hairless like some low snake or other reptile  he attempted to obviate this by plastering himself from head to foot with mud but this dried and fell off  besides it felt so uncomfortable that he quickly decided that he preferred the shame to the discomfort  in the higher land which his tribe frequented was a little lake and it was here that tarzan first saw his face in the clear still waters of its bosom  it was on a sultry day of the dry season that he and one of his cousins had gone down to the bank to drink  as they leaned over both little faces were mirrored on the placid pool the fierce and terrible features of the ape beside those of the aristocratic scion of an old english house  tarzan was appalled  it had been bad enough to be hairless but to own such a countenance  he wondered that the other apes could look at him at all  that tiny slit of a mouth and those puny white teeth  how they looked beside the mighty lips and powerful fangs of his more fortunate brothers  and the little pinched nose of his so thin was it that it looked half starved  he turned red as he compared it with the beautiful broad nostrils of his companion  such a generous nose  why it spread half across his face  it certainly must be fine to be so handsome thought poor little tarzan  but when he saw his own eyes ah that was the final blowa brown spot a gray circle and then blank whiteness  frightful not even the snakes had such hideous eyes as he  so intent was he upon this personal appraisement of his features that he did not hear the parting of the tall grass behind him as a great body pushed itself stealthily through the jungle nor did his companion the ape hear either for he was drinking and the noise of his sucking lips and gurgles of satisfaction drowned the quiet approach of the intruder  not thirty paces behind the two she crouchedsabor the huge lionesslashing her tail  cautiously she moved a great padded paw forward noiselessly placing it before she lifted the next  thus she advanced her belly low almost touching the surface of the grounda great cat preparing to spring upon its prey  now she was within ten feet of the two unsuspecting little playfellowscarefully she drew her hind feet well up beneath her body the great muscles rolling under the beautiful skin  so low she was crouching now that she seemed flattened to the earth except for the upward bend of the glossy back as it gathered for the spring  no longer the tail lashedquiet and straight behind her it lay  an instant she paused thus as though turned to stone and then with an awful scream she sprang  sabor the lioness was a wise hunter  to one less wise the wild alarm of her fierce cry as she sprang would have seemed a foolish thing for could she not more surely have fallen upon her victims had she but quietly leaped without that loud shriek  but sabor knew well the wondrous quickness of the jungle folk and their almost unbelievable powers of hearing  to them the sudden scraping of one blade of grass across another was as effectual a warning as her loudest cry and sabor knew that she could not make that mighty leap without a little noise  her wild scream was not a warning  it was voiced to freeze her poor victims in a paralysis of terror for the tiny fraction of an instant which would suffice for her mighty claws to sink into their soft flesh and hold them beyond hope of escape  so far as the ape was concerned sabor reasoned correctly  the little fellow crouched trembling just an instant but that instant was quite long enough to prove his undoing  not so however with tarzan the manchild  his life amidst the dangers of the jungle had taught him to meet emergencies with selfconfidence and his higher intelligence resulted in a quickness of mental action far beyond the powers of the apes  so the scream of sabor the lioness galvanized the brain and muscles of little tarzan into instant action  before him lay the deep waters of the little lake behind him certain death a cruel death beneath tearing claws and rending fangs  tarzan had always hated water except as a medium for quenching his thirst  he hated it because he connected it with the chill and discomfort of the torrential rains and he feared it for the thunder and lightning and wind which accompanied them  the deep waters of the lake he had been taught by his wild mother to avoid and further had he not seen little neeta sink beneath its quiet surface only a few short weeks before never to return to the tribe  but of the two evils his quick mind chose the lesser ere the first note of sabors scream had scarce broken the quiet of the jungle and before the great beast had covered half her leap tarzan felt the chill waters close above his head  he could not swim and the water was very deep but still he lost no particle of that selfconfidence and resourcefulness which were the badges of his superior being  rapidly he moved his hands and feet in an attempt to scramble upward and possibly more by chance than design he fell into the stroke that a dog uses when swimming so that within a few seconds his nose was above water and he found that he could keep it there by continuing his strokes and also make progress through the water  he was much surprised and pleased with this new acquirement which had been so suddenly thrust upon him but he had no time for thinking much upon it  he was now swimming parallel to the bank and there he saw the cruel beast that would have seized him crouching upon the still form of his little playmate  the lioness was intently watching tarzan evidently expecting him to return to shore but this the boy had no intention of doing  instead he raised his voice in the call of distress common to his tribe adding to it the warning which would prevent wouldbe rescuers from running into the clutches of sabor  almost immediately there came an answer from the distance and presently forty or fifty great apes swung rapidly and majestically through the trees toward the scene of tragedy  in the lead was kala for she had recognized the tones of her best beloved and with her was the mother of the little ape who lay dead beneath cruel sabor  though more powerful and better equipped for fighting than the apes the lioness had no desire to meet these enraged adults and with a snarl of hatred she sprang quickly into the brush and disappeared  tarzan now swam to shore and clambered quickly upon dry land  the feeling of freshness and exhilaration which the cool waters had imparted to him filled his little being with grateful surprise and ever after he lost no opportunity to take a daily plunge in lake or stream or ocean when it was possible to do so  for a long time kala could not accustom herself to the sight for though her people could swim when forced to it they did not like to enter water and never did so voluntarily  the adventure with the lioness gave tarzan food for pleasurable memories for it was such affairs which broke the monotony of his daily lifeotherwise but a dull round of searching for food eating and sleeping  the tribe to which he belonged roamed a tract extending roughly twentyfive miles along the seacoast and some fifty miles inland  this they traversed almost continually occasionally remaining for months in one locality but as they moved through the trees with great speed they often covered the territory in a very few days  much depended upon food supply climatic conditions and the prevalence of animals of the more dangerous species though kerchak often led them on long marches for no other reason than that he had tired of remaining in the same place  at night they slept where darkness overtook them lying upon the ground and sometimes covering their heads and more seldom their bodies with the great leaves of the elephants ear  two or three might lie cuddled in each others arms for additional warmth if the night were chill and thus tarzan had slept in kalas arms nightly for all these years  that the huge fierce brute loved this child of another race is beyond question and he too gave to the great hairy beast all the affection that would have belonged to his fair young mother had she lived  when he was disobedient she cuffed him it is true but she was never cruel to him and was more often caressing him than chastising him  tublat her mate always hated tarzan and on several occasions had come near ending his youthful career  tarzan on his part never lost an opportunity to show that he fully reciprocated his foster fathers sentiments and whenever he could safely annoy him or make faces at him or hurl insults upon him from the safety of his mothers arms or the slender branches of the higher trees he did so  his superior intelligence and cunning permitted him to invent a thousand diabolical tricks to add to the burdens of tublats life  early in his boyhood he had learned to form ropes by twisting and tying long grasses together and with these he was forever tripping tublat or attempting to hang him from some overhanging branch  by constant playing and experimenting with these he learned to tie rude knots and make sliding nooses and with these he and the younger apes amused themselves  what tarzan did they tried to do also but he alone originated and became proficient  one day while playing thus tarzan had thrown his rope at one of his fleeing companions retaining the other end in his grasp  by accident the noose fell squarely about the running apes neck bringing him to a sudden and surprising halt  ah here was a new game a fine game thought tarzan and immediately he attempted to repeat the trick  and thus by painstaking and continued practice he learned the art of roping  now indeed was the life of tublat a living nightmare  in sleep upon the march night or day he never knew when that quiet noose would slip about his neck and nearly choke the life out of him  kala punished tublat swore dire vengeance and old kerchak took notice and warned and threatened but all to no avail  tarzan defied them all and the thin strong noose continued to settle about tublats neck whenever he least expected it  the other apes derived unlimited amusement from tublats discomfiture for broken nose was a disagreeable old fellow whom no one liked anyway  in tarzans clever little mind many thoughts revolved and back of these was his divine power of reason  if he could catch his fellow apes with his long arm of many grasses why not sabor the lioness  it was the germ of a thought which however was destined to mull around in his conscious and subconscious mind until it resulted in magnificent achievement  but that came in later years     chapter vi  jungle battles   the wanderings of the tribe brought them often near the closed and silent cabin by the little landlocked harbor  to tarzan this was always a source of neverending mystery and pleasure  he would peek into the curtained windows or climbing upon the roof peer down the black depths of the chimney in vain endeavor to solve the unknown wonders that lay within those strong walls  his childlike imagination pictured wonderful creatures within and the very impossibility of forcing entrance added a thousandfold to his desire to do so  he could clamber about the roof and windows for hours attempting to discover means of ingress but to the door he paid little attention for this was apparently as solid as the walls  it was in the next visit to the vicinity following the adventure with old sabor that as he approached the cabin tarzan noticed that from a distance the door appeared to be an independent part of the wall in which it was set and for the first time it occurred to him that this might prove the means of entrance which had so long eluded him  he was alone as was often the case when he visited the cabin for the apes had no love for it the story of the thunderstick having lost nothing in the telling during these ten years had quite surrounded the white mans deserted abode with an atmosphere of weirdness and terror for the simians  the story of his own connection with the cabin had never been told him the language of the apes had so few words that they could talk but little of what they had seen in the cabin having no words to accurately describe either the strange people or their belongings and so long before tarzan was old enough to understand the subject had been forgotten by the tribe  only in a dim vague way had kala explained to him that his father had been a strange white ape but he did not know that kala was not his own mother  on this day then he went directly to the door and spent hours examining it and fussing with the hinges the knob and the latch finally he stumbled upon the right combination and the door swung creakingly open before his astonished eyes  for some minutes he did not dare venture within but finally as his eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the interior he slowly and cautiously entered  in the middle of the floor lay a skeleton every vestige of flesh gone from the bones to which still clung the mildewed and moldered remnants of what had once been clothing  upon the bed lay a similar gruesome thing but smaller while in a tiny cradle nearby was a third a wee mite of a skeleton  to none of these evidences of a fearful tragedy of a long dead day did little tarzan give but passing heed  his wild jungle life had inured him to the sight of dead and dying animals and had he known that he was looking upon the remains of his own father and mother he would have been no more greatly moved  the furnishings and other contents of the room it was which riveted his attention  he examined many things minutelystrange tools and weapons books paper clothingwhat little had withstood the ravages of time in the humid atmosphere of the jungle coast  he opened chests and cupboards such as did not baffle his small experience and in these he found the contents much better preserved  among other things he found a sharp hunting knife on the keen blade of which he immediately proceeded to cut his finger  undaunted he continued his experiments finding that he could hack and hew splinters of wood from the table and chairs with this new toy  for a long time this amused him but finally tiring he continued his explorations  in a cupboard filled with books he came across one with brightly colored picturesit was a childs illustrated alphabet                a is for archer               who shoots with a bow               b is for boy               his first name is joe   the pictures interested him greatly  there were many apes with faces similar to his own and further over in the book he found under m some little monkeys such as he saw daily flitting through the trees of his primeval forest  but nowhere was pictured any of his own people in all the book was none that resembled kerchak or tublat or kala  at first he tried to pick the little figures from the leaves but he soon saw that they were not real though he knew not what they might be nor had he any words to describe them  the boats and trains and cows and horses were quite meaningless to him but not quite so baffling as the odd little figures which appeared beneath and between the colored picturessome strange kind of bug he thought they might be for many of them had legs though nowhere could he find one with eyes and a mouth  it was his first introduction to the letters of the alphabet and he was over ten years old  of course he had never before seen print or ever had spoken with any living thing which had the remotest idea that such a thing as a written language existed nor ever had he seen anyone reading  so what wonder that the little boy was quite at a loss to guess the meaning of these strange figures  near the middle of the book he found his old enemy sabor the lioness and further on coiled histah the snake  oh it was most engrossing  never before in all his ten years had he enjoyed anything so much  so absorbed was he that he did not note the approaching dusk until it was quite upon him and the figures were blurred  he put the book back in the cupboard and closed the door for he did not wish anyone else to find and destroy his treasure and as he went out into the gathering darkness he closed the great door of the cabin behind him as it had been before he discovered the secret of its lock but before he left he had noticed the hunting knife lying where he had thrown it upon the floor and this he picked up and took with him to show to his fellows  he had taken scarce a dozen steps toward the jungle when a great form rose up before him from the shadows of a low bush  at first he thought it was one of his own people but in another instant he realized that it was bolgani the huge gorilla  so close was he that there was no chance for flight and little tarzan knew that he must stand and fight for his life for these great beasts were the deadly enemies of his tribe and neither one nor the other ever asked or gave quarter  had tarzan been a fullgrown bull ape of the species of his tribe he would have been more than a match for the gorilla but being only a little english boy though enormously muscular for such he stood no chance against his cruel antagonist  in his veins though flowed the blood of the best of a race of mighty fighters and back of this was the training of his short lifetime among the fierce brutes of the jungle  he knew no fear as we know it his little heart beat the faster but from the excitement and exhilaration of adventure  had the opportunity presented itself he would have escaped but solely because his judgment told him he was no match for the great thing which confronted him  and since reason showed him that successful flight was impossible he met the gorilla squarely and bravely without a tremor of a single muscle or any sign of panic  in fact he met the brute midway in its charge striking its huge body with his closed fists and as futilely as he had been a fly attacking an elephant  but in one hand he still clutched the knife he had found in the cabin of his father and as the brute striking and biting closed upon him the boy accidentally turned the point toward the hairy breast as the knife sank deep into its body the gorilla shrieked in pain and rage  but the boy had learned in that brief second a use for his sharp and shining toy so that as the tearing striking beast dragged him to earth he plunged the blade repeatedly and to the hilt into its breast  the gorilla fighting after the manner of its kind struck terrific blows with its open hand and tore the flesh at the boys throat and chest with its mighty tusks  for a moment they rolled upon the ground in the fierce frenzy of combat  more and more weakly the torn and bleeding arm struck home with the long sharp blade then the little figure stiffened with a spasmodic jerk and tarzan the young lord greystoke rolled unconscious upon the dead and decaying vegetation which carpeted his jungle home  a mile back in the forest the tribe had heard the fierce challenge of the gorilla and as was his custom when any danger threatened kerchak called his people together partly for mutual protection against a common enemy since this gorilla might be but one of a party of several and also to see that all members of the tribe were accounted for  it was soon discovered that tarzan was missing and tublat was strongly opposed to sending assistance  kerchak himself had no liking for the strange little waif so he listened to tublat and finally with a shrug of his shoulders turned back to the pile of leaves on which he had made his bed  but kala was of a different mind in fact she had not waited but to learn that tarzan was absent ere she was fairly flying through the matted branches toward the point from which the cries of the gorilla were still plainly audible  darkness had now fallen and an early moon was sending its faint light to cast strange grotesque shadows among the dense foliage of the forest  here and there the brilliant rays penetrated to earth but for the most part they only served to accentuate the stygian blackness of the jungles depths  like some huge phantom kala swung noiselessly from tree to tree now running nimbly along a great branch now swinging through space at the end of another only to grasp that of a farther tree in her rapid progress toward the scene of the tragedy her knowledge of jungle life told her was being enacted a short distance before her  the cries of the gorilla proclaimed that it was in mortal combat with some other denizen of the fierce wood  suddenly these cries ceased and the silence of death reigned throughout the jungle  kala could not understand for the voice of bolgani had at last been raised in the agony of suffering and death but no sound had come to her by which she possibly could determine the nature of his antagonist  that her little tarzan could destroy a great bull gorilla she knew to be improbable and so as she neared the spot from which the sounds of the struggle had come she moved more warily and at last slowly and with extreme caution she traversed the lowest branches peering eagerly into the moonsplashed blackness for a sign of the combatants  presently she came upon them lying in a little open space full under the brilliant light of the moonlittle tarzans torn and bloody form and beside it a great bull gorilla stone dead  with a low cry kala rushed to tarzans side and gathering the poor bloodcovered body to her breast listened for a sign of life  faintly she heard itthe weak beating of the little heart  tenderly she bore him back through the inky jungle to where the tribe lay and for many days and nights she sat guard beside him bringing him food and water and brushing the flies and other insects from his cruel wounds  of medicine or surgery the poor thing knew nothing  she could but lick the wounds and thus she kept them cleansed that healing nature might the more quickly do her work  at first tarzan would eat nothing but rolled and tossed in a wild delirium of fever  all he craved was water and this she brought him in the only way she could bearing it in her own mouth  no human mother could have shown more unselfish and sacrificing devotion than did this poor wild brute for the little orphaned waif whom fate had thrown into her keeping  at last the fever abated and the boy commenced to mend  no word of complaint passed his tight set lips though the pain of his wounds was excruciating  a portion of his chest was laid bare to the ribs three of which had been broken by the mighty blows of the gorilla  one arm was nearly severed by the giant fangs and a great piece had been torn from his neck exposing his jugular vein which the cruel jaws had missed but by a miracle  with the stoicism of the brutes who had raised him he endured his suffering quietly preferring to crawl away from the others and lie huddled in some clump of tall grasses rather than to show his misery before their eyes  kala alone he was glad to have with him but now that he was better she was gone longer at a time in search of food for the devoted animal had scarcely eaten enough to support her own life while tarzan had been so low and was in consequence reduced to a mere shadow of her former self     chapter vii  the light of knowledge   after what seemed an eternity to the little sufferer he was able to walk once more and from then on his recovery was so rapid that in another month he was as strong and active as ever  during his convalescence he had gone over in his mind many times the battle with the gorilla and his first thought was to recover the wonderful little weapon which had transformed him from a hopelessly outclassed weakling to the superior of the mighty terror of the jungle  also he was anxious to return to the cabin and continue his investigations of its wondrous contents  so early one morning he set forth alone upon his quest  after a little search he located the cleanpicked bones of his late adversary and close by partly buried beneath the fallen leaves he found the knife now red with rust from its exposure to the dampness of the ground and from the dried blood of the gorilla  he did not like the change in its former bright and gleaming surface but it was still a formidable weapon and one which he meant to use to advantage whenever the opportunity presented itself  he had in mind that no more would he run from the wanton attacks of old tublat  in another moment he was at the cabin and after a short time had again thrown the latch and entered  his first concern was to learn the mechanism of the lock and this he did by examining it closely while the door was open so that he could learn precisely what caused it to hold the door and by what means it released at his touch  he found that he could close and lock the door from within and this he did so that there would be no chance of his being molested while at his investigation  he commenced a systematic search of the cabin but his attention was soon riveted by the books which seemed to exert a strange and powerful influence over him so that he could scarce attend to aught else for the lure of the wondrous puzzle which their purpose presented to him  among the other books were a primer some childs readers numerous picture books and a great dictionary  all of these he examined but the pictures caught his fancy most though the strange little bugs which covered the pages where there were no pictures excited his wonder and deepest thought  squatting upon his haunches on the table top in the cabin his father had builthis smooth brown naked little body bent over the book which rested in his strong slender hands and his great shock of long black hair falling about his wellshaped head and bright intelligent eyestarzan of the apes little primitive man presented a picture filled at once with pathos and with promisean allegorical figure of the primordial groping through the black night of ignorance toward the light of learning  his little face was tense in study for he had partially grasped in a hazy nebulous way the rudiments of a thought which was destined to prove the key and the solution to the puzzling problem of the strange little bugs  in his hands was a primer opened at a picture of a little ape similar to himself but covered except for hands and face with strange colored fur for such he thought the jacket and trousers to be beneath the picture were three little bugs                boy   and now he had discovered in the text upon the page that these three were repeated many times in the same sequence  another fact he learnedthat there were comparatively few individual bugs but these were repeated many times occasionally alone but more often in company with others  slowly he turned the pages scanning the pictures and the text for a repetition of the combination boy  presently he found it beneath a picture of another little ape and a strange animal which went upon four legs like the jackal and resembled him not a little  beneath this picture the bugs appeared as                a boy and a dog   there they were the three little bugs which always accompanied the little ape  and so he progressed very very slowly for it was a hard and laborious task which he had set himself without knowing ita task which might seem to you or me impossiblelearning to read without having the slightest knowledge of letters or written language or the faintest idea that such things existed  he did not accomplish it in a day or in a week or in a month or in a year but slowly very slowly he learned after he had grasped the possibilities which lay in those little bugs so that by the time he was fifteen he knew the various combinations of letters which stood for every pictured figure in the little primer and in one or two of the picture books  of the meaning and use of the articles and conjunctions verbs and adverbs and pronouns he had but the faintest conception  one day when he was about twelve he found a number of lead pencils in a hitherto undiscovered drawer beneath the table and in scratching upon the table top with one of them he was delighted to discover the black line it left behind it  he worked so assiduously with this new toy that the table top was soon a mass of scrawly loops and irregular lines and his pencilpoint worn down to the wood  then he took another pencil but this time he had a definite object in view  he would attempt to reproduce some of the little bugs that scrambled over the pages of his books  it was a difficult task for he held the pencil as one would grasp the hilt of a dagger which does not add greatly to ease in writing or to the legibility of the results  but he persevered for months at such times as he was able to come to the cabin until at last by repeated experimenting he found a position in which to hold the pencil that best permitted him to guide and control it so that at last he could roughly reproduce any of the little bugs  thus he made a beginning of writing  copying the bugs taught him another thingtheir number and though he could not count as we understand it yet he had an idea of quantity the base of his calculations being the number of fingers upon one of his hands  his search through the various books convinced him that he had discovered all the different kinds of bugs most often repeated in combination and these he arranged in proper order with great ease because of the frequency with which he had perused the fascinating alphabet picture book  his education progressed but his greatest finds were in the inexhaustible storehouse of the huge illustrated dictionary for he learned more through the medium of pictures than text even after he had grasped the significance of the bugs  when he discovered the arrangement of words in alphabetical order he delighted in searching for and finding the combinations with which he was familiar and the words which followed them their definitions led him still further into the mazes of erudition  by the time he was seventeen he had learned to read the simple childs primer and had fully realized the true and wonderful purpose of the little bugs  no longer did he feel shame for his hairless body or his human features for now his reason told him that he was of a different race from his wild and hairy companions  he was a man they were apes and the little apes which scurried through the forest top were monkeys  he knew too that old sabor was a lioness and histah a snake and tantor an elephant  and so he learned to read  from then on his progress was rapid  with the help of the great dictionary and the active intelligence of a healthy mind endowed by inheritance with more than ordinary reasoning powers he shrewdly guessed at much which he could not really understand and more often than not his guesses were close to the mark of truth  there were many breaks in his education caused by the migratory habits of his tribe but even when removed from his books his active brain continued to search out the mysteries of his fascinating avocation  pieces of bark and flat leaves and even smooth stretches of bare earth provided him with copy books whereon to scratch with the point of his hunting knife the lessons he was learning  nor did he neglect the sterner duties of life while following the bent of his inclination toward the solving of the mystery of his library  he practiced with his rope and played with his sharp knife which he had learned to keep keen by whetting upon flat stones  the tribe had grown larger since tarzan had come among them for under the leadership of kerchak they had been able to frighten the other tribes from their part of the jungle so that they had plenty to eat and little or no loss from predatory incursions of neighbors  hence the younger males as they became adult found it more comfortable to take mates from their own tribe or if they captured one of another tribe to bring her back to kerchaks band and live in amity with him rather than attempt to set up new establishments of their own or fight with the redoubtable kerchak for supremacy at home  occasionally one more ferocious than his fellows would attempt this latter alternative but none had come yet who could wrest the palm of victory from the fierce and brutal ape  tarzan held a peculiar position in the tribe  they seemed to consider him one of them and yet in some way different  the older males either ignored him entirely or else hated him so vindictively that but for his wondrous agility and speed and the fierce protection of the huge kala he would have been dispatched at an early age  tublat was his most consistent enemy but it was through tublat that when he was about thirteen the persecution of his enemies suddenly ceased and he was left severely alone except on the occasions when one of them ran amuck in the throes of one of those strange wild fits of insane rage which attacks the males of many of the fiercer animals of the jungle  then none was safe  on the day that tarzan established his right to respect the tribe was gathered about a small natural amphitheater which the jungle had left free from its entangling vines and creepers in a hollow among some low hills  the open space was almost circular in shape  upon every hand rose the mighty giants of the untouched forest with the matted undergrowth banked so closely between the huge trunks that the only opening into the little level arena was through the upper branches of the trees  here safe from interruption the tribe often gathered  in the center of the amphitheater was one of those strange earthen drums which the anthropoids build for the queer rites the sounds of which men have heard in the fastnesses of the jungle but which none has ever witnessed  many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes and some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of the wild weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle but tarzan lord greystoke is doubtless the only human being who ever joined in the fierce mad intoxicating revel of the dumdum  from this primitive function has arisen unquestionably all the forms and ceremonials of modern church and state for through all the countless ages back beyond the uttermost ramparts of a dawning humanity our fierce hairy forebears danced out the rites of the dumdum to the sound of their earthen drums beneath the bright light of a tropical moon in the depth of a mighty jungle which stands unchanged today as it stood on that long forgotten night in the dim unthinkable vistas of the long dead past when our first shaggy ancestor swung from a swaying bough and dropped lightly upon the soft turf of the first meeting place  on the day that tarzan won his emancipation from the persecution that had followed him remorselessly for twelve of his thirteen years of life the tribe now a full hundred strong trooped silently through the lower terrace of the jungle trees and dropped noiselessly upon the floor of the amphitheater  the rites of the dumdum marked important events in the life of the tribea victory the capture of a prisoner the killing of some large fierce denizen of the jungle the death or accession of a king and were conducted with set ceremonialism  today it was the killing of a giant ape a member of another tribe and as the people of kerchak entered the arena two mighty bulls were seen bearing the body of the vanquished between them  they laid their burden before the earthen drum and then squatted there beside it as guards while the other members of the community curled themselves in grassy nooks to sleep until the rising moon should give the signal for the commencement of their savage orgy  for hours absolute quiet reigned in the little clearing except as it was broken by the discordant notes of brilliantly feathered parrots or the screeching and twittering of the thousand jungle birds flitting ceaselessly amongst the vivid orchids and flamboyant blossoms which festooned the myriad mosscovered branches of the forest kings  at length as darkness settled upon the jungle the apes commenced to bestir themselves and soon they formed a great circle about the earthen drum  the females and young squatted in a thin line at the outer periphery of the circle while just in front of them ranged the adult males  before the drum sat three old females each armed with a knotted branch fifteen or eighteen inches in length  slowly and softly they began tapping upon the resounding surface of the drum as the first faint rays of the ascending moon silvered the encircling tree tops  as the light in the amphitheater increased the females augmented the frequency and force of their blows until presently a wild rhythmic din pervaded the great jungle for miles in every direction  huge fierce brutes stopped in their hunting with uppricked ears and raised heads to listen to the dull booming that betokened the dumdum of the apes  occasionally one would raise his shrill scream or thunderous roar in answering challenge to the savage din of the anthropoids but none came near to investigate or attack for the great apes assembled in all the power of their numbers filled the breasts of their jungle neighbors with deep respect  as the din of the drum rose to almost deafening volume kerchak sprang into the open space between the squatting males and the drummers  standing erect he threw his head far back and looking full into the eye of the rising moon he beat upon his breast with his great hairy paws and emitted his fearful roaring shriek  onetwicethrice that terrifying cry rang out across the teeming solitude of that unspeakably quick yet unthinkably dead world  then crouching kerchak slunk noiselessly around the open circle veering far away from the dead body lying before the altardrum but as he passed keeping his little fierce wicked red eyes upon the corpse  another male then sprang into the arena and repeating the horrid cries of his king followed stealthily in his wake  another and another followed in quick succession until the jungle reverberated with the now almost ceaseless notes of their bloodthirsty screams  it was the challenge and the hunt  when all the adult males had joined in the thin line of circling dancers the attack commenced  kerchak seizing a huge club from the pile which lay at hand for the purpose rushed furiously upon the dead ape dealing the corpse a terrific blow at the same time emitting the growls and snarls of combat  the din of the drum was now increased as well as the frequency of the blows and the warriors as each approached the victim of the hunt and delivered his bludgeon blow joined in the mad whirl of the death dance  tarzan was one of the wild leaping horde  his brown sweatstreaked muscular body glistening in the moonlight shone supple and graceful among the uncouth awkward hairy brutes about him  none was more stealthy in the mimic hunt none more ferocious than he in the wild ferocity of the attack none who leaped so high into the air in the dance of death  as the noise and rapidity of the drumbeats increased the dancers apparently became intoxicated with the wild rhythm and the savage yells  their leaps and bounds increased their bared fangs dripped saliva and their lips and breasts were flecked with foam  for half an hour the weird dance went on until at a sign from kerchak the noise of the drums ceased the female drummers scampering hurriedly through the line of dancers toward the outer rim of squatting spectators  then as one the males rushed headlong upon the thing which their terrific blows had reduced to a mass of hairy pulp  flesh seldom came to their jaws in satisfying quantities so a fit finale to their wild revel was a taste of fresh killed meat and it was to the purpose of devouring their late enemy that they now turned their attention  great fangs sunk into the carcass tearing away huge hunks the mightiest of the apes obtaining the choicest morsels while the weaker circled the outer edge of the fighting snarling pack awaiting their chance to dodge in and snatch a dropped tidbit or filch a remaining bone before all was gone  tarzan more than the apes craved and needed flesh  descended from a race of meat eaters never in his life he thought had he once satisfied his appetite for animal food and so now his agile little body wormed its way far into the mass of struggling rending apes in an endeavor to obtain a share which his strength would have been unequal to the task of winning for him  at his side hung the hunting knife of his unknown father in a sheath selffashioned in copy of one he had seen among the pictures of his treasurebooks  at last he reached the fast disappearing feast and with his sharp knife slashed off a more generous portion than he had hoped for an entire hairy forearm where it protruded from beneath the feet of the mighty kerchak who was so busily engaged in perpetuating the royal prerogative of gluttony that he failed to note the act of lesemajeste  so little tarzan wriggled out from beneath the struggling mass clutching his grisly prize close to his breast  among those circling futilely the outskirts of the banqueters was old tublat  he had been among the first at the feast but had retreated with a goodly share to eat in quiet and was now forcing his way back for more  so it was that he spied tarzan as the boy emerged from the clawing pushing throng with that hairy forearm hugged firmly to his body  tublats little closeset bloodshot pigeyes shot wicked gleams of hate as they fell upon the object of his loathing  in them too was greed for the toothsome dainty the boy carried  but tarzan saw his arch enemy as quickly and divining what the great beast would do he leaped nimbly away toward the females and the young hoping to hide himself among them  tublat however was close upon his heels so that he had no opportunity to seek a place of concealment but saw that he would be put to it to escape at all  swiftly he sped toward the surrounding trees and with an agile bound gained a lower limb with one hand and then transferring his burden to his teeth he climbed rapidly upward closely followed by tublat  up up he went to the waving pinnacle of a lofty monarch of the forest where his heavy pursuer dared not follow him  there he perched hurling taunts and insults at the raging foaming beast fifty feet below him  and then tublat went mad  with horrifying screams and roars he rushed to the ground among the females and young sinking his great fangs into a dozen tiny necks and tearing great pieces from the backs and breasts of the females who fell into his clutches  in the brilliant moonlight tarzan witnessed the whole mad carnival of rage  he saw the females and the young scamper to the safety of the trees  then the great bulls in the center of the arena felt the mighty fangs of their demented fellow and with one accord they melted into the black shadows of the overhanging forest  there was but one in the amphitheater beside tublat a belated female running swiftly toward the tree where tarzan perched and close behind her came the awful tublat  it was kala and as quickly as tarzan saw that tublat was gaining on her he dropped with the rapidity of a falling stone from branch to branch toward his foster mother  now she was beneath the overhanging limbs and close above her crouched tarzan waiting the outcome of the race  she leaped into the air grasping a lowhanging branch but almost over the head of tublat so nearly had he distanced her  she should have been safe now but there was a rending tearing sound the branch broke and precipitated her full upon the head of tublat knocking him to the ground  both were up in an instant but as quick as they had been tarzan had been quicker so that the infuriated bull found himself facing the manchild who stood between him and kala  nothing could have suited the fierce beast better and with a roar of triumph he leaped upon the little lord greystoke  but his fangs never closed in that nut brown flesh  a muscular hand shot out and grasped the hairy throat and another plunged a keen hunting knife a dozen times into the broad breast  like lightning the blows fell and only ceased when tarzan felt the limp form crumple beneath him  as the body rolled to the ground tarzan of the apes placed his foot upon the neck of his lifelong enemy and raising his eyes to the full moon threw back his fierce young head and voiced the wild and terrible cry of his people  one by one the tribe swung down from their arboreal retreats and formed a circle about tarzan and his vanquished foe  when they had all come tarzan turned toward them  i am tarzan he cried  i am a great killer  let all respect tarzan of the apes and kala his mother  there be none among you as mighty as tarzan  let his enemies beware  looking full into the wicked red eyes of kerchak the young lord greystoke beat upon his mighty breast and screamed out once more his shrill cry of defiance     chapter viii  the treetop hunter   the morning after the dumdum the tribe started slowly back through the forest toward the coast  the body of tublat lay where it had fallen for the people of kerchak do not eat their own dead  the march was but a leisurely search for food  cabbage palm and gray plum pisang and scitamine they found in abundance with wild pineapple and occasionally small mammals birds eggs reptiles and insects  the nuts they cracked between their powerful jaws or if too hard broke by pounding between stones  once old sabor crossing their path sent them scurrying to the safety of the higher branches for if she respected their number and their sharp fangs they on their part held her cruel and mighty ferocity in equal esteem  upon a lowhanging branch sat tarzan directly above the majestic supple body as it forged silently through the thick jungle  he hurled a pineapple at the ancient enemy of his people  the great beast stopped and turning eyed the taunting figure above her  with an angry lash of her tail she bared her yellow fangs curling her great lips in a hideous snarl that wrinkled her bristling snout in serried ridges and closed her wicked eyes to two narrow slits of rage and hatred  with backlaid ears she looked straight into the eyes of tarzan of the apes and sounded her fierce shrill challenge  and from the safety of his overhanging limb the apechild sent back the fearsome answer of his kind  for a moment the two eyed each other in silence and then the great cat turned into the jungle which swallowed her as the ocean engulfs a tossed pebble  but into the mind of tarzan a great plan sprang  he had killed the fierce tublat so was he not therefore a mighty fighter  now would he track down the crafty sabor and slay her likewise  he would be a mighty hunter also  at the bottom of his little english heart beat the great desire to cover his nakedness with clothes for he had learned from his picture books that all men were so covered while monkeys and apes and every other living thing went naked  clothes therefore must be truly a badge of greatness the insignia of the superiority of man over all other animals for surely there could be no other reason for wearing the hideous things  many moons ago when he had been much smaller he had desired the skin of sabor the lioness or numa the lion or sheeta the leopard to cover his hairless body that he might no longer resemble hideous histah the snake but now he was proud of his sleek skin for it betokened his descent from a mighty race and the conflicting desires to go naked in prideful proof of his ancestry or to conform to the customs of his own kind and wear hideous and uncomfortable apparel found first one and then the other in the ascendency  as the tribe continued their slow way through the forest after the passing of sabor tarzans head was filled with his great scheme for slaying his enemy and for many days thereafter he thought of little else  on this day however he presently had other and more immediate interests to attract his attention  suddenly it became as midnight the noises of the jungle ceased the trees stood motionless as though in paralyzed expectancy of some great and imminent disaster  all nature waitedbut not for long  faintly from a distance came a low sad moaning  nearer and nearer it approached mounting louder and louder in volume  the great trees bent in unison as though pressed earthward by a mighty hand  farther and farther toward the ground they inclined and still there was no sound save the deep and awesome moaning of the wind  then suddenly the jungle giants whipped back lashing their mighty tops in angry and deafening protest  a vivid and blinding light flashed from the whirling inky clouds above  the deep cannonade of roaring thunder belched forth its fearsome challenge  the deluge cameall hell broke loose upon the jungle  the tribe shivering from the cold rain huddled at the bases of great trees  the lightning darting and flashing through the blackness showed wildly waving branches whipping streamers and bending trunks  now and again some ancient patriarch of the woods rent by a flashing bolt would crash in a thousand pieces among the surrounding trees carrying down numberless branches and many smaller neighbors to add to the tangled confusion of the tropical jungle  branches great and small torn away by the ferocity of the tornado hurtled through the wildly waving verdure carrying death and destruction to countless unhappy denizens of the thickly peopled world below  for hours the fury of the storm continued without surcease and still the tribe huddled close in shivering fear  in constant danger from falling trunks and branches and paralyzed by the vivid flashing of lightning and the bellowing of thunder they crouched in pitiful misery until the storm passed  the end was as sudden as the beginning  the wind ceased the sun shone forthnature smiled once more  the dripping leaves and branches and the moist petals of gorgeous flowers glistened in the splendor of the returning day  and soas nature forgot her children forgot also  busy life went on as it had been before the darkness and the fright  but to tarzan a dawning light had come to explain the mystery of clothes  how snug he would have been beneath the heavy coat of sabor and so was added a further incentive to the adventure  for several months the tribe hovered near the beach where stood tarzans cabin and his studies took up the greater portion of his time but always when journeying through the forest he kept his rope in readiness and many were the smaller animals that fell into the snare of the quick thrown noose  once it fell about the short neck of horta the boar and his mad lunge for freedom toppled tarzan from the overhanging limb where he had lain in wait and from whence he had launched his sinuous coil  the mighty tusker turned at the sound of his falling body and seeing only the easy prey of a young ape he lowered his head and charged madly at the surprised youth  tarzan happily was uninjured by the fall alighting catlike upon all fours far outspread to take up the shock  he was on his feet in an instant and leaping with the agility of the monkey he was he gained the safety of a low limb as horta the boar rushed futilely beneath  thus it was that tarzan learned by experience the limitations as well as the possibilities of his strange weapon  he lost a long rope on this occasion but he knew that had it been sabor who had thus dragged him from his perch the outcome might have been very different for he would have lost his life doubtless into the bargain  it took him many days to braid a new rope but when finally it was done he went forth purposely to hunt and lie in wait among the dense foliage of a great branch right above the wellbeaten trail that led to water  several small animals passed unharmed beneath him  he did not want such insignificant game  it would take a strong animal to test the efficacy of his new scheme  at last came she whom tarzan sought with lithe sinews rolling beneath shimmering hide fat and glossy came sabor the lioness  her great padded feet fell soft and noiseless on the narrow trail  her head was high in ever alert attention her long tail moved slowly in sinuous and graceful undulations  nearer and nearer she came to where tarzan of the apes crouched upon his limb the coils of his long rope poised ready in his hand  like a thing of bronze motionless as death sat tarzan  sabor passed beneath  one stride beyond she tooka second a third and then the silent coil shot out above her  for an instant the spreading noose hung above her head like a great snake and then as she looked upward to detect the origin of the swishing sound of the rope it settled about her neck  with a quick jerk tarzan snapped the noose tight about the glossy throat and then he dropped the rope and clung to his support with both hands  sabor was trapped  with a bound the startled beast turned into the jungle but tarzan was not to lose another rope through the same cause as the first  he had learned from experience  the lioness had taken but half her second bound when she felt the rope tighten about her neck her body turned completely over in the air and she fell with a heavy crash upon her back  tarzan had fastened the end of the rope securely to the trunk of the great tree on which he sat  thus far his plan had worked to perfection but when he grasped the rope bracing himself behind a crotch of two mighty branches he found that dragging the mighty struggling clawing biting screaming mass of ironmuscled fury up to the tree and hanging her was a very different proposition  the weight of old sabor was immense and when she braced her huge paws nothing less than tantor the elephant himself could have budged her  the lioness was now back in the path where she could see the author of the indignity which had been placed upon her  screaming with rage she suddenly charged leaping high into the air toward tarzan but when her huge body struck the limb on which tarzan had been tarzan was no longer there  instead he perched lightly upon a smaller branch twenty feet above the raging captive  for a moment sabor hung half across the branch while tarzan mocked and hurled twigs and branches at her unprotected face  presently the beast dropped to the earth again and tarzan came quickly to seize the rope but sabor had now found that it was only a slender cord that held her and grasping it in her huge jaws severed it before tarzan could tighten the strangling noose a second time  tarzan was much hurt  his welllaid plan had come to naught so he sat there screaming at the roaring creature beneath him and making mocking grimaces at it  sabor paced back and forth beneath the tree for hours four times she crouched and sprang at the dancing sprite above her but might as well have clutched at the illusive wind that murmured through the tree tops  at last tarzan tired of the sport and with a parting roar of challenge and a wellaimed ripe fruit that spread soft and sticky over the snarling face of his enemy he swung rapidly through the trees a hundred feet above the ground and in a short time was among the members of his tribe  here he recounted the details of his adventure with swelling chest and so considerable swagger that he quite impressed even his bitterest enemies while kala fairly danced for joy and pride     chapter ix  man and man   tarzan of the apes lived on in his wild jungle existence with little change for several years only that he grew stronger and wiser and learned from his books more and more of the strange worlds which lay somewhere outside his primeval forest  to him life was never monotonous or stale  there was always pisah the fish to be caught in the many streams and the little lakes and sabor with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one spent upon the ground  often they hunted him and more often he hunted them but though they never quite reached him with those cruel sharp claws of theirs yet there were times when one could scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his smooth hide  quick was sabor the lioness and quick were numa and sheeta but tarzan of the apes was lightning  with tantor the elephant he made friends  how  ask not  but this is known to the denizens of the jungle that on many moonlight nights tarzan of the apes and tantor the elephant walked together and where the way was clear tarzan rode perched high upon tantors mighty back  many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his father where still lay untouched the bones of his parents and the skeleton of kalas baby  at eighteen he read fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes on the shelves  also could he write with printed letters rapidly and plainly but script he had not mastered for though there were several copy books among his treasure there was so little written english in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this other form of writing though he could read it laboriously  thus at eighteen we find him an english lordling who could speak no english and yet who could read and write his native language  never had he seen a human being other than himself for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of the interior  high hills shut it off on three sides the ocean on the fourth  it was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous snakes  its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its frontier  but as tarzan of the apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book the ancient security of his jungle was broken forever  at the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung in single file over the brow of a low hill  in advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires and long bows and poisoned arrows  on their backs were oval shields in their noses huge rings while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers  across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of color and on each breast three concentric circles  their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance  following them were several hundred women and children the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking pots household utensils and ivory  in the rear were a hundred warriors similar in all respects to the advance guard  that they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was evidenced by the formation of the column and such was the fact for they were fleeing from the white mans soldiers who had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of his black troops  for many days they had gorged themselves on meat but eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades  that night the black soldiers of the white man had had meat aplenty and this little remnant of a once powerful tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the unknown and freedom  but that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to many of the wild denizens of their new home  for three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the heart of this unknown and untracked forest until finally early in the fourth day they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river which seemed less thickly overgrown than any ground they had yet encountered  here they set to work to build a new village and in a month a great clearing had been made huts and palisades erected plantains yams and maize planted and they had taken up their old life in their new home here there were no white men no soldiers nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for cruel and thankless taskmasters  several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the territory surrounding their new village  several had already fallen prey to old sabor and because the jungle was so infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats and with lions and leopards the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves far from the safety of their palisades  but one day kulonga a son of the old king mbonga wandered far into the dense mazes to the west  warily he stepped his slender lance ever ready his long oval shield firmly grasped in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body  at his back his bow and in the quiver upon his shield many slim straight arrows well smeared with the thick dark tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick  night found kulonga far from the palisades of his fathers village but still headed westward and climbing into the fork of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself for sleep  three miles to the west slept the tribe of kerchak  early the next morning the apes were astir moving through the jungle in search of food  tarzan as was his custom prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by the time he reached the beach  the apes scattered by ones and twos and threes in all directions but ever within sound of a signal of alarm  kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi when the faintest shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention  for fifty yards before her the trail was straight and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a strange and fearful creature  it was kulonga  kala did not wait to see more but turning moved rapidly back along the trail  she did not run but after the manner of her kind when not aroused sought rather to avoid than to escape  close after her came kulonga  here was meat  he could make a killing and feast well this day  on he hurried his spear poised for the throw  at a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again upon another straight stretch  his spear hand went far back the muscles rolled lightninglike beneath the sleek hide  out shot the arm and the spear sped toward kala  a poor cast  it but grazed her side  with a cry of rage and pain the sheape turned upon her tormentor  in an instant the trees were crashing beneath the weight of her hurrying fellows swinging rapidly toward the scene of trouble in answer to kalas scream  as she charged kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an arrow with almost unthinkable quickness  drawing the shaft far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart of the great anthropoid  with a horrid scream kala plunged forward upon her face before the astonished members of her tribe  roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward kulonga but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a frightened antelope  he knew something of the ferocity of these wild hairy men and his one desire was to put as many miles between himself and them as he possibly could  they followed him racing through the trees for a long distance but finally one by one they abandoned the chase and returned to the scene of the tragedy  none of them had ever seen a man before other than tarzan and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of creature it might be that had invaded their jungle  on the far beach by the little cabin tarzan heard the faint echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the direction of the sound  when he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering about the dead body of his slain mother  tarzans grief and anger were unbounded  he roared out his hideous challenge time and again  he beat upon his great chest with his clenched fists and then he fell upon the body of kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart  to lose the only creature in all his world who ever had manifested love and affection for him was the greatest tragedy he had ever known  what though kala was a fierce and hideous ape  to tarzan she had been kind she had been beautiful  upon her he had lavished unknown to himself all the reverence and respect and love that a normal english boy feels for his own mother he had never known another and so to kala was given though mutely all that would have belonged to the fair and lovely lady alice had she lived  after the first outburst of grief tarzan controlled himself and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed the killing of kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary could convey  it was enough however for his needs  it told him of a strange hairless black ape with feathers growing upon its head who launched death from a slender branch and then ran with the fleetness of bara the deer toward the rising sun  tarzan waited no longer but leaping into the branches of the trees sped rapidly through the forest  he knew the windings of the elephant trail along which kalas murderer had flown and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous detours of the trail  at his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire and across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope  in an hour he struck the trail again and coming to earth examined the soil minutely  in the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made but much larger than his his heart beat fast  could it be that he was trailing a manone of his own race  there were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions  so his quarry had already passed on his return along the trail  as he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to the bottom of its shallow depressionah the trail was very fresh his prey must have but scarcely passed  tarzan swung himself to the trees once more and with swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail  he had covered barely a mile when he came upon the black warrior standing in a little open space  in his hand was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing arrows  opposite him across the little clearing stood horta the boar with lowered head and foam flecked tusks ready to charge  tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath himso like him in form and yet so different in face and color  his books had portrayed the negro but how different had been the dull dead print to this sleek thing of ebony pulsing with life  as the man stood there with taut drawn bow tarzan recognized him not so much the negro as the archer of his picture book                a stands for archer   how wonderful  tarzan almost betrayed his presence in the deep excitement of his discovery  but things were commencing to happen below him  the sinewy black arm had drawn the shaft far back horta the boar was charging and then the black released the little poisoned arrow and tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar  scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere kulonga had fitted another to it but horta the boar was upon him so quickly that he had no time to discharge it  with a bound the black leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in hortas back  then kulonga sprang into a nearby tree  horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more a dozen steps he took then he staggered and fell upon his side  for a moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively then he lay still  kulonga came down from his tree  with a knife that hung at his side he cut several large pieces from the boars body and in the center of the trail he built a fire cooking and eating as much as he wanted  the rest he left where it had fallen  tarzan was an interested spectator  his desire to kill burned fiercely in his wild breast but his desire to learn was even greater  he would follow this savage creature for a while and know from whence he came he could kill him at his leisure later when the bow and deadly arrows were laid aside  when kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond a near turning of the path tarzan dropped quietly to the ground  with his knife he severed many strips of meat from hortas carcass but he did not cook them  he had seen fire but only when ara the lightning had destroyed some great tree  that any creature of the jungle could produce the redandyellow fangs which devoured wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised tarzan greatly and why the black warrior had ruined his delicious repast by plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him  possibly ara was a friend with whom the archer was sharing his food  but be that as it may tarzan would not ruin good meat in any such foolish manner so he gobbled down a great quantity of the raw flesh burying the balance of the carcass beside the trail where he could find it upon his return  and then lord greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon his naked thighs and took up the trail of kulonga the son of mbonga the king while in faroff london another lord greystoke the younger brother of the real lord greystokes father sent back his chops to the clubs chef because they were underdone and when he had finished his repast he dipped his fingerends into a silver bowl of scented water and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask  all day tarzan followed kulonga hovering above him in the trees like some malign spirit  twice more he saw him hurl his arrows of destructiononce at dango the hyena and again at manu the monkey in each instance the animal died almost instantly for kulongas poison was very fresh and very deadly  tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his quarry  he knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle who were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with their jungle neighbors yet as often recovered as not  no there was something mysterious connected with these tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere scratch  he must look into the matter  that night kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree and far above him crouched tarzan of the apes  when kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared the black warrior was furious and frightened but more frightened than furious  he searched the ground below the tree and he searched the tree above the ground but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder  kulonga was panicstricken  his spear he had hurled at kala and had not recovered and now that his bow and arrows were gone he was defenseless except for a single knife  his only hope lay in reaching the village of mbonga as quickly as his legs would carry him  that he was not far from home he was certain so he took the trail at a rapid trot  from a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away emerged tarzan of the apes to swing quietly in his wake  kulongas bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up  thus tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches  as kulonga continued his journey tarzan closed on him until he traveled almost over the blacks head  his rope he now held coiled in his right hand he was almost ready for the kill  the moment was delayed only because tarzan was anxious to ascertain the black warriors destination and presently he was rewarded for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing at one end of which lay many strange lairs  tarzan was directly over kulonga as he made the discovery  the forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village  tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone but tarzans life training left so little space between decision and action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even room for the shadow of a thought between  so it was that as kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of mbonga and ere the kings son had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his neck  so quickly did tarzan of the apes drag back his prey that kulongas cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe  hand over hand tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by his neck in midair then tarzan climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering verdure of the tree  here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch and then descending plunged his hunting knife into kulongas heart  kala was avenged  tarzan examined the black minutely for he had never seen any other human being  the knife with its sheath and belt caught his eye he appropriated them  a copper anklet also took his fancy and this he transferred to his own leg  he examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast  he marveled at the sharp filed teeth  he investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress and then he prepared to get down to business for tarzan of the apes was hungry and here was meat meat of the kill which jungle ethics permitted him to eat  how may we judge him by what standards this apeman with the heart and head and body of an english gentleman and the training of a wild beast  tublat whom he had hated and who had hated him he had killed in a fair fight and yet never had the thought of eating tublats flesh entered his head  it would have been as revolting to him as is cannibalism to us  but who was kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as horta the boar or bara the deer  was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger  suddenly a strange doubt stayed his hand  had not his books taught him that he was a man  and was not the archer a man also  did men eat men  alas he did not know  why then this hesitancy once more he essayed the effort but a qualm of nausea overwhelmed him he did not understand  all he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black man and thus hereditary instinct ages old usurped the functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant  quickly he lowered kulongas body to the ground removed the noose and took to the trees again     chapter x  the fearphantom   from a lofty perch tarzan viewed the village of thatched huts across the intervening plantation  he saw that at one point the forest touched the village and to this spot he made his way lured by a fever of curiosity to behold animals of his own kind and to learn more of their ways and view the strange lairs in which they lived  his savage life among the fierce wild brutes of the jungle left no opening for any thought that these could be aught else than enemies similarity of form led him into no erroneous conception of the welcome that would be accorded him should he be discovered by these the first of his own kind he had ever seen  tarzan of the apes was no sentimentalist  he knew nothing of the brotherhood of man  all things outside his own tribe were his deadly enemies with the few exceptions of which tantor the elephant was a marked example  and he realized all this without malice or hatred  to kill was the law of the wild world he knew  few were his primitive pleasures but the greatest of these was to hunt and kill and so he accorded to others the right to cherish the same desires as he even though he himself might be the object of their hunt  his strange life had left him neither morose nor bloodthirsty  that he joyed in killing and that he killed with a joyous laugh upon his handsome lips betokened no innate cruelty  he killed for food most often but being a man he sometimes killed for pleasure a thing which no other animal does for it has remained for man alone among all creatures to kill senselessly and wantonly for the mere pleasure of inflicting suffering and death  and when he killed for revenge or in selfdefense he did that also without hysteria for it was a very businesslike proceeding which admitted of no levity  so it was that now as he cautiously approached the village of mbonga he was quite prepared either to kill or be killed should he be discovered  he proceeded with unwonted stealth for kulonga had taught him great respect for the little sharp splinters of wood which dealt death so swiftly and unerringly  at length he came to a great tree heavy laden with thick foliage and loaded with pendant loops of giant creepers  from this almost impenetrable bower above the village he crouched looking down upon the scene below him wondering over every feature of this new strange life  there were naked children running and playing in the village street there were women grinding dried plantain in crude stone mortars while others were fashioning cakes from the powdered flour  out in the fields he could see still other women hoeing weeding or gathering  all wore strange protruding girdles of dried grass about their hips and many were loaded with brass and copper anklets armlets and bracelets around many a dusky neck hung curiously coiled strands of wire while several were further ornamented by huge nose rings  tarzan of the apes looked with growing wonder at these strange creatures  dozing in the shade he saw several men while at the extreme outskirts of the clearing he occasionally caught glimpses of armed warriors apparently guarding the village against surprise from an attacking enemy  he noticed that the women alone worked  nowhere was there evidence of a man tilling the fields or performing any of the homely duties of the village  finally his eyes rested upon a woman directly beneath him  before her was a small cauldron standing over a low fire and in it bubbled a thick reddish tarry mass  on one side of her lay a quantity of wooden arrows the points of which she dipped into the seething substance then laying them upon a narrow rack of boughs which stood upon her other side  tarzan of the apes was fascinated  here was the secret of the terrible destructiveness of the archers tiny missiles  he noted the extreme care which the woman took that none of the matter should touch her hands and once when a particle spattered upon one of her fingers he saw her plunge the member into a vessel of water and quickly rub the tiny stain away with a handful of leaves  tarzan knew nothing of poison but his shrewd reasoning told him that it was this deadly stuff that killed and not the little arrow which was merely the messenger that carried it into the body of its victim  how he should like to have more of those little deathdealing slivers if the woman would only leave her work for an instant he could drop down gather up a handful and be back in the tree again before she drew three breaths  as he was trying to think out some plan to distract her attention he heard a wild cry from across the clearing  he looked and saw a black warrior standing beneath the very tree in which he had killed the murderer of kala an hour before  the fellow was shouting and waving his spear above his head  now and again he would point to something on the ground before him  the village was in an uproar instantly  armed men rushed from the interior of many a hut and raced madly across the clearing toward the excited sentry  after them trooped the old men and the women and children until in a moment the village was deserted  tarzan of the apes knew that they had found the body of his victim but that interested him far less than the fact that no one remained in the village to prevent his taking a supply of the arrows which lay below him  quickly and noiselessly he dropped to the ground beside the cauldron of poison  for a moment he stood motionless his quick bright eyes scanning the interior of the palisade  no one was in sight  his eyes rested upon the open doorway of a nearby hut  he would take a look within thought tarzan and so cautiously he approached the low thatched building  for a moment he stood without listening intently  there was no sound and he glided into the semidarkness of the interior  weapons hung against the wallslong spears strangely shaped knives a couple of narrow shields  in the center of the room was a cooking pot and at the far end a litter of dry grasses covered by woven mats which evidently served the owners as beds and bedding  several human skulls lay upon the floor  tarzan of the apes felt of each article hefted the spears smelled of them for he saw largely through his sensitive and highly trained nostrils  he determined to own one of these long pointed sticks but he could not take one on this trip because of the arrows he meant to carry  as he took each article from the walls he placed it in a pile in the center of the room  on top of all he placed the cooking pot inverted and on top of this he laid one of the grinning skulls upon which he fastened the headdress of the dead kulonga  then he stood back surveyed his work and grinned  tarzan of the apes enjoyed a joke  but now he heard outside the sounds of many voices and long mournful howls and mighty wailing  he was startled  had he remained too long quickly he reached the doorway and peered down the village street toward the village gate  the natives were not yet in sight though he could plainly hear them approaching across the plantation  they must be very near  like a flash he sprang across the opening to the pile of arrows gathering up all he could carry under one arm he overturned the seething cauldron with a kick and disappeared into the foliage above just as the first of the returning natives entered the gate at the far end of the village street  then he turned to watch the proceeding below poised like some wild bird ready to take swift wing at the first sign of danger  the natives filed up the street four of them bearing the dead body of kulonga  behind trailed the women uttering strange cries and weird lamentation  on they came to the portals of kulongas hut the very one in which tarzan had wrought his depredations  scarcely had half a dozen entered the building ere they came rushing out in wild jabbering confusion  the others hastened to gather about there was much excited gesticulating pointing and chattering then several of the warriors approached and peered within  finally an old fellow with many ornaments of metal about his arms and legs and a necklace of dried human hands depending upon his chest entered the hut  it was mbonga the king father of kulonga  for a few moments all was silent  then mbonga emerged a look of mingled wrath and superstitious fear writ upon his hideous countenance he spoke a few words to the assembled warriors and in an instant the men were flying through the little village searching minutely every hut and corner within the palisades  scarcely had the search commenced than the overturned cauldron was discovered and with it the theft of the poisoned arrows  nothing more they found and it was a thoroughly awed and frightened group of savages which huddled around their king a few moments later  mbonga could explain nothing of the strange events that had taken place  the finding of the still warm body of kulongaon the very verge of their fields and within easy earshot of the villageknifed and stripped at the door of his fathers home was in itself sufficiently mysterious but these last awesome discoveries within the village within the dead kulongas own hut filled their hearts with dismay and conjured in their poor brains only the most frightful of superstitious explanations  they stood in little groups talking in low tones and ever casting affrighted glances behind them from their great rolling eyes  tarzan of the apes watched them for a while from his lofty perch in the great tree  there was much in their demeanor which he could not understand for of superstition he was ignorant and of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception  the sun was high in the heavens  tarzan had not broken fast this day and it was many miles to where lay the toothsome remains of horta the boar  so he turned his back upon the village of mbonga and melted away into the leafy fastness of the forest     chapter xi  king of the apes   it was not yet dark when he reached the tribe though he stopped to exhume and devour the remains of the wild boar he had cached the preceding day and again to take kulongas bow and arrows from the tree top in which he had hidden them  it was a wellladen tarzan who dropped from the branches into the midst of the tribe of kerchak  with swelling chest he narrated the glories of his adventure and exhibited the spoils of conquest  kerchak grunted and turned away for he was jealous of this strange member of his band  in his little evil brain he sought for some excuse to wreak his hatred upon tarzan  the next day tarzan was practicing with his bow and arrows at the first gleam of dawn  at first he lost nearly every bolt he shot but finally he learned to guide the little shafts with fair accuracy and ere a month had passed he was no mean shot but his proficiency had cost him nearly his entire supply of arrows  the tribe continued to find the hunting good in the vicinity of the beach and so tarzan of the apes varied his archery practice with further investigation of his fathers choice though little store of books  it was during this period that the young english lord found hidden in the back of one of the cupboards in the cabin a small metal box  the key was in the lock and a few moments of investigation and experimentation were rewarded with the successful opening of the receptacle  in it he found a faded photograph of a smooth faced young man a golden locket studded with diamonds linked to a small gold chain a few letters and a small book  tarzan examined these all minutely  the photograph he liked most of all for the eyes were smiling and the face was open and frank  it was his father  the locket too took his fancy and he placed the chain about his neck in imitation of the ornamentation he had seen to be so common among the black men he had visited  the brilliant stones gleamed strangely against his smooth brown hide  the letters he could scarcely decipher for he had learned little or nothing of script so he put them back in the box with the photograph and turned his attention to the book  this was almost entirely filled with fine script but while the little bugs were all familiar to him their arrangement and the combinations in which they occurred were strange and entirely incomprehensible  tarzan had long since learned the use of the dictionary but much to his sorrow and perplexity it proved of no avail to him in this emergency  not a word of all that was writ in the book could he find and so he put it back in the metal box but with a determination to work out the mysteries of it later on  little did he know that this book held between its covers the key to his originthe answer to the strange riddle of his strange life  it was the diary of john clayton lord greystokekept in french as had always been his custom  tarzan replaced the box in the cupboard but always thereafter he carried the features of the strong smiling face of his father in his heart and in his head a fixed determination to solve the mystery of the strange words in the little black book  at present he had more important business in hand for his supply of arrows was exhausted and he must needs journey to the black mens village and renew it  early the following morning he set out and traveling rapidly he came before midday to the clearing  once more he took up his position in the great tree and as before he saw the women in the fields and the village street and the cauldron of bubbling poison directly beneath him  for hours he lay awaiting his opportunity to drop down unseen and gather up the arrows for which he had come but nothing now occurred to call the villagers away from their homes  the day wore on and still tarzan of the apes crouched above the unsuspecting woman at the cauldron  presently the workers in the fields returned  the hunting warriors emerged from the forest and when all were within the palisade the gates were closed and barred  many cooking pots were now in evidence about the village  before each hut a woman presided over a boiling stew while little cakes of plantain and cassava puddings were to be seen on every hand  suddenly there came a hail from the edge of the clearing  tarzan looked  it was a party of belated hunters returning from the north and among them they half led half carried a struggling animal  as they approached the village the gates were thrown open to admit them and then as the people saw the victim of the chase a savage cry rose to the heavens for the quarry was a man  as he was dragged still resisting into the village street the women and children set upon him with sticks and stones and tarzan of the apes young and savage beast of the jungle wondered at the cruel brutality of his own kind  sheeta the leopard alone of all the jungle folk tortured his prey the ethics of all the others meted a quick and merciful death to their victims  tarzan had learned from his books but scattered fragments of the ways of human beings  when he had followed kulonga through the forest he had expected to come to a city of strange houses on wheels puffing clouds of black smoke from a huge tree stuck in the roof of one of themor to a sea covered with mighty floating buildings which he had learned were called variously ships and boats and steamers and craft  he had been sorely disappointed with the poor little village of the blacks hidden away in his own jungle and with not a single house as large as his own cabin upon the distant beach  he saw that these people were more wicked than his own apes and as savage and cruel as sabor herself  tarzan began to hold his own kind in low esteem  now they had tied their poor victim to a great post near the center of the village directly before mbongas hut and here they formed a dancing yelling circle of warriors about him alive with flashing knives and menacing spears  in a larger circle squatted the women yelling and beating upon drums it reminded tarzan of the dumdum and so he knew what to expect  he wondered if they would spring upon their meat while it was still alive the apes did not do such things as that  the circle of warriors about the cringing captive drew closer and closer to their prey as they danced in wild and savage abandon to the maddening music of the drums  presently a spear reached out and pricked the victim  it was the signal for fifty others  eyes ears arms and legs were pierced every inch of the poor writhing body that did not cover a vital organ became the target of the cruel lancers  the women and children shrieked their delight  the warriors licked their hideous lips in anticipation of the feast to come and vied with one another in the savagery and loathsomeness of the cruel indignities with which they tortured the still conscious prisoner  then it was that tarzan of the apes saw his chance  all eyes were fixed upon the thrilling spectacle at the stake  the light of day had given place to the darkness of a moonless night and only the fires in the immediate vicinity of the orgy had been kept alight to cast a restless glow upon the restless scene  gently the lithe boy dropped to the soft earth at the end of the village street  quickly he gathered up the arrowsall of them this time for he had brought a number of long fibers to bind them into a bundle  without haste he wrapped them securely and then ere he turned to leave the devil of capriciousness entered his heart  he looked about for some hint of a wild prank to play upon these strange grotesque creatures that they might be again aware of his presence among them  dropping his bundle of arrows at the foot of the tree tarzan crept among the shadows at the side of the street until he came to the same hut he had entered on the occasion of his first visit  inside all was darkness but his groping hands soon found the object for which he sought and without further delay he turned again toward the door  he had taken but a step however ere his quick ear caught the sound of approaching footsteps immediately without  in another instant the figure of a woman darkened the entrance of the hut  tarzan drew back silently to the far wall and his hand sought the long keen hunting knife of his father  the woman came quickly to the center of the hut  there she paused for an instant feeling about with her hands for the thing she sought  evidently it was not in its accustomed place for she explored ever nearer and nearer the wall where tarzan stood  so close was she now that the apeman felt the animal warmth of her naked body  up went the hunting knife and then the woman turned to one side and soon a guttural ah proclaimed that her search had at last been successful  immediately she turned and left the hut and as she passed through the doorway tarzan saw that she carried a cooking pot in her hand  he followed closely after her and as he reconnoitered from the shadows of the doorway he saw that all the women of the village were hastening to and from the various huts with pots and kettles  these they were filling with water and placing over a number of fires near the stake where the dying victim now hung an inert and bloody mass of suffering  choosing a moment when none seemed near tarzan hastened to his bundle of arrows beneath the great tree at the end of the village street  as on the former occasion he overthrew the cauldron before leaping sinuous and catlike into the lower branches of the forest giant  silently he climbed to a great height until he found a point where he could look through a leafy opening upon the scene beneath him  the women were now preparing the prisoner for their cooking pots while the men stood about resting after the fatigue of their mad revel comparative quiet reigned in the village  tarzan raised aloft the thing he had pilfered from the hut and with aim made true by years of fruit and coconut throwing launched it toward the group of savages  squarely among them it fell striking one of the warriors full upon the head and felling him to the ground  then it rolled among the women and stopped beside the halfbutchered thing they were preparing to feast upon  all gazed in consternation at it for an instant and then with one accord broke and ran for their huts  it was a grinning human skull which looked up at them from the ground the dropping of the thing out of the open sky was a miracle well aimed to work upon their superstitious fears  thus tarzan of the apes left them filled with terror at this new manifestation of the presence of some unseen and unearthly evil power which lurked in the forest about their village  later when they discovered the overturned cauldron and that once more their arrows had been pilfered it commenced to dawn upon them that they had offended some great god by placing their village in this part of the jungle without propitiating him  from then on an offering of food was daily placed below the great tree from whence the arrows had disappeared in an effort to conciliate the mighty one  but the seed of fear was deep sown and had he but known it tarzan of the apes had laid the foundation for much future misery for himself and his tribe  that night he slept in the forest not far from the village and early the next morning set out slowly on his homeward march hunting as he traveled  only a few berries and an occasional grub worm rewarded his search and he was half famished when looking up from a log he had been rooting beneath he saw sabor the lioness standing in the center of the trail not twenty paces from him  the great yellow eyes were fixed upon him with a wicked and baleful gleam and the red tongue licked the longing lips as sabor crouched worming her stealthy way with belly flattened against the earth  tarzan did not attempt to escape  he welcomed the opportunity for which in fact he had been searching for days past now that he was armed with something more than a rope of grass  quickly he unslung his bow and fitted a welldaubed arrow and as sabor sprang the tiny missile leaped to meet her in midair  at the same instant tarzan of the apes jumped to one side and as the great cat struck the ground beyond him another deathtipped arrow sunk deep into sabors loin  with a mighty roar the beast turned and charged once more only to be met with a third arrow full in one eye but this time she was too close to the apeman for the latter to sidestep the onrushing body  tarzan of the apes went down beneath the great body of his enemy but with gleaming knife drawn and striking home  for a moment they lay there and then tarzan realized that the inert mass lying upon him was beyond power ever again to injure man or ape  with difficulty he wriggled from beneath the great weight and as he stood erect and gazed down upon the trophy of his skill a mighty wave of exultation swept over him  with swelling breast he placed a foot upon the body of his powerful enemy and throwing back his fine young head roared out the awful challenge of the victorious bull ape  the forest echoed to the savage and triumphant paean  birds fell still and the larger animals and beasts of prey slunk stealthily away for few there were of all the jungle who sought for trouble with the great anthropoids  and in london another lord greystoke was speaking to his kind in the house of lords but none trembled at the sound of his soft voice  sabor proved unsavory eating even to tarzan of the apes but hunger served as a most efficacious disguise to toughness and rank taste and ere long with wellfilled stomach the apeman was ready to sleep again  first however he must remove the hide for it was as much for this as for any other purpose that he had desired to destroy sabor  deftly he removed the great pelt for he had practiced often on smaller animals  when the task was finished he carried his trophy to the fork of a high tree and there curling himself securely in a crotch he fell into deep and dreamless slumber  what with loss of sleep arduous exercise and a full belly tarzan of the apes slept the sun around awakening about noon of the following day  he straightway repaired to the carcass of sabor but was angered to find the bones picked clean by other hungry denizens of the jungle  half an hours leisurely progress through the forest brought to sight a young deer and before the little creature knew that an enemy was near a tiny arrow had lodged in its neck  so quickly the virus worked that at the end of a dozen leaps the deer plunged headlong into the undergrowth dead  again did tarzan feast well but this time he did not sleep  instead he hastened on toward the point where he had left the tribe and when he had found them proudly exhibited the skin of sabor the lioness  look he cried apes of kerchak  see what tarzan the mighty killer has done  who else among you has ever killed one of numas people  tarzan is mightiest amongst you for tarzan is no ape  tarzan is  but here he stopped for in the language of the anthropoids there was no word for man and tarzan could only write the word in english he could not pronounce it  the tribe had gathered about to look upon the proof of his wondrous prowess and to listen to his words  only kerchak hung back nursing his hatred and his rage  suddenly something snapped in the wicked little brain of the anthropoid  with a frightful roar the great beast sprang among the assemblage  biting and striking with his huge hands he killed and maimed a dozen ere the balance could escape to the upper terraces of the forest  frothing and shrieking in the insanity of his fury kerchak looked about for the object of his greatest hatred and there upon a nearby limb he saw him sitting  come down tarzan great killer cried kerchak  come down and feel the fangs of a greater  do mighty fighters fly to the trees at the first approach of danger  and then kerchak emitted the volleying challenge of his kind  quietly tarzan dropped to the ground  breathlessly the tribe watched from their lofty perches as kerchak still roaring charged the relatively puny figure  nearly seven feet stood kerchak on his short legs  his enormous shoulders were bunched and rounded with huge muscles  the back of his short neck was as a single lump of iron sinew which bulged beyond the base of his skull so that his head seemed like a small ball protruding from a huge mountain of flesh  his backdrawn snarling lips exposed his great fighting fangs and his little wicked bloodshot eyes gleamed in horrid reflection of his madness  awaiting him stood tarzan himself a mighty muscled animal but his six feet of height and his great rolling sinews seemed pitifully inadequate to the ordeal which awaited them  his bow and arrows lay some distance away where he had dropped them while showing sabors hide to his fellow apes so that he confronted kerchak now with only his hunting knife and his superior intellect to offset the ferocious strength of his enemy  as his antagonist came roaring toward him lord greystoke tore his long knife from its sheath and with an answering challenge as horrid and bloodcurdling as that of the beast he faced rushed swiftly to meet the attack  he was too shrewd to allow those long hairy arms to encircle him and just as their bodies were about to crash together tarzan of the apes grasped one of the huge wrists of his assailant and springing lightly to one side drove his knife to the hilt into kerchaks body below the heart  before he could wrench the blade free again the bulls quick lunge to seize him in those awful arms had torn the weapon from tarzans grasp  kerchak aimed a terrific blow at the apemans head with the flat of his hand a blow which had it landed might easily have crushed in the side of tarzans skull  the man was too quick and ducking beneath it himself delivered a mighty one with clenched fist in the pit of kerchaks stomach  the ape was staggered and what with the mortal wound in his side had almost collapsed when with one mighty effort he rallied for an instantjust long enough to enable him to wrest his arm free from tarzans grasp and close in a terrific clinch with his wiry opponent  straining the apeman close to him his great jaws sought tarzans throat but the young lords sinewy fingers were at kerchaks own before the cruel fangs could close on the sleek brown skin  thus they struggled the one to crush out his opponents life with those awful teeth the other to close forever the windpipe beneath his strong grasp while he held the snarling mouth from him  the greater strength of the ape was slowly prevailing and the teeth of the straining beast were scarce an inch from tarzans throat when with a shuddering tremor the great body stiffened for an instant and then sank limply to the ground  kerchak was dead  withdrawing the knife that had so often rendered him master of far mightier muscles than his own tarzan of the apes placed his foot upon the neck of his vanquished enemy and once again loud through the forest rang the fierce wild cry of the conqueror  and thus came the young lord greystoke into the kingship of the apes     chapter xii  mans reason   there was one of the tribe of tarzan who questioned his authority and that was terkoz the son of tublat but he so feared the keen knife and the deadly arrows of his new lord that he confined the manifestation of his objections to petty disobediences and irritating mannerisms tarzan knew however that he but waited his opportunity to wrest the kingship from him by some sudden stroke of treachery and so he was ever on his guard against surprise  for months the life of the little band went on much as it had before except that tarzans greater intelligence and his ability as a hunter were the means of providing for them more bountifully than ever before most of them therefore were more than content with the change in rulers  tarzan led them by night to the fields of the black men and there warned by their chiefs superior wisdom they ate only what they required nor ever did they destroy what they could not eat as is the way of manu the monkey and of most apes  so while the blacks were wroth at the continued pilfering of their fields they were not discouraged in their efforts to cultivate the land as would have been the case had tarzan permitted his people to lay waste the plantation wantonly  during this period tarzan paid many nocturnal visits to the village where he often renewed his supply of arrows  he soon noticed the food always standing at the foot of the tree which was his avenue into the palisade and after a little he commenced to eat whatever the blacks put there  when the awestruck savages saw that the food disappeared overnight they were filled with consternation and dread for it was one thing to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil but quite another thing to have the spirit really come into the village and eat it  such a thing was unheard of and it clouded their superstitious minds with all manner of vague fears  nor was this all  the periodic disappearance of their arrows and the strange pranks perpetrated by unseen hands had wrought them to such a state that life had become a veritable burden in their new home and now it was that mbonga and his head men began to talk of abandoning the village and seeking a site farther on in the jungle  presently the black warriors began to strike farther and farther south into the heart of the forest when they went to hunt looking for a site for a new village  more often was the tribe of tarzan disturbed by these wandering huntsmen  now was the quiet fierce solitude of the primeval forest broken by new strange cries  no longer was there safety for bird or beast  man had come  other animals passed up and down the jungle by day and by nightfierce cruel beastsbut their weaker neighbors only fled from their immediate vicinity to return again when the danger was past  with man it is different  when he comes many of the larger animals instinctively leave the district entirely seldom if ever to return and thus it has always been with the great anthropoids  they flee man as man flees a pestilence  for a short time the tribe of tarzan lingered in the vicinity of the beach because their new chief hated the thought of leaving the treasured contents of the little cabin forever  but when one day a member of the tribe discovered the blacks in great numbers on the banks of a little stream that had been their watering place for generations and in the act of clearing a space in the jungle and erecting many huts the apes would remain no longer and so tarzan led them inland for many marches to a spot as yet undefiled by the foot of a human being  once every moon tarzan would go swinging rapidly back through the swaying branches to have a day with his books and to replenish his supply of arrows  this latter task was becoming more and more difficult for the blacks had taken to hiding their supply away at night in granaries and living huts  this necessitated watching by day on tarzans part to discover where the arrows were being concealed  twice had he entered huts at night while the inmates lay sleeping upon their mats and stolen the arrows from the very sides of the warriors but this method he realized to be too fraught with danger and so he commenced picking up solitary hunters with his long deadly noose stripping them of weapons and ornaments and dropping their bodies from a high tree into the village street during the still watches of the night  these various escapades again so terrorized the blacks that had it not been for the monthly respite between tarzans visits in which they had opportunity to renew hope that each fresh incursion would prove the last they soon would have abandoned their new village  the blacks had not as yet come upon tarzans cabin on the distant beach but the apeman lived in constant dread that while he was away with the tribe they would discover and despoil his treasure  so it came that he spent more and more time in the vicinity of his fathers last home and less and less with the tribe  presently the members of his little community began to suffer on account of his neglect for disputes and quarrels constantly arose which only the king might settle peaceably  at last some of the older apes spoke to tarzan on the subject and for a month thereafter he remained constantly with the tribe  the duties of kingship among the anthropoids are not many or arduous  in the afternoon comes thaka possibly to complain that old mungo has stolen his new wife  then must tarzan summon all before him and if he finds that the wife prefers her new lord he commands that matters remain as they are or possibly that mungo give thaka one of his daughters in exchange  whatever his decision the apes accept it as final and return to their occupations satisfied  then comes tana shrieking and holding tight her side from which blood is streaming  gunto her husband has cruelly bitten her  and gunto summoned says that tana is lazy and will not bring him nuts and beetles or scratch his back for him  so tarzan scolds them both and threatens gunto with a taste of the deathbearing slivers if he abuses tana further and tana for her part is compelled to promise better attention to her wifely duties  and so it goes little family differences for the most part which if left unsettled would result finally in greater factional strife and the eventual dismemberment of the tribe  but tarzan tired of it as he found that kingship meant the curtailment of his liberty  he longed for the little cabin and the sunkissed seafor the cool interior of the wellbuilt house and for the neverending wonders of the many books  as he had grown older he found that he had grown away from his people their interests and his were far removed  they had not kept pace with him nor could they understand aught of the many strange and wonderful dreams that passed through the active brain of their human king  so limited was their vocabulary that tarzan could not even talk with them of the many new truths and the great fields of thought that his reading had opened up before his longing eyes or make known ambitions which stirred his soul  among the tribe he no longer had friends as of old  a little child may find companionship in many strange and simple creatures but to a grown man there must be some semblance of equality in intellect as the basis for agreeable association  had kala lived tarzan would have sacrificed all else to remain near her but now that she was dead and the playful friends of his childhood grown into fierce and surly brutes he felt that he much preferred the peace and solitude of his cabin to the irksome duties of leadership amongst a horde of wild beasts  the hatred and jealousy of terkoz son of tublat did much to counteract the effect of tarzans desire to renounce his kingship among the apes for stubborn young englishman that he was he could not bring himself to retreat in the face of so malignant an enemy  that terkoz would be chosen leader in his stead he knew full well for time and again the ferocious brute had established his claim to physical supremacy over the few bull apes who had dared resent his savage bullying  tarzan would have liked to subdue the ugly beast without recourse to knife or arrows  so much had his great strength and agility increased in the period following his maturity that he had come to believe that he might master the redoubtable terkoz in a hand to hand fight were it not for the terrible advantage the anthropoids huge fighting fangs gave him over the poorly armed tarzan  the entire matter was taken out of tarzans hands one day by force of circumstances and his future left open to him so that he might go or stay without any stain upon his savage escutcheon  it happened thus  the tribe was feeding quietly spread over a considerable area when a great screaming arose some distance east of where tarzan lay upon his belly beside a limpid brook attempting to catch an elusive fish in his quick brown hands  with one accord the tribe swung rapidly toward the frightened cries and there found terkoz holding an old female by the hair and beating her unmercifully with his great hands  as tarzan approached he raised his hand aloft for terkoz to desist for the female was not his but belonged to a poor old ape whose fighting days were long over and who therefore could not protect his family  terkoz knew that it was against the laws of his kind to strike this woman of another but being a bully he had taken advantage of the weakness of the females husband to chastise her because she had refused to give up to him a tender young rodent she had captured  when terkoz saw tarzan approaching without his arrows he continued to belabor the poor woman in a studied effort to affront his hated chieftain  tarzan did not repeat his warning signal but instead rushed bodily upon the waiting terkoz  never had the apeman fought so terrible a battle since that longgone day when bolgani the great king gorilla had so horribly manhandled him ere the newfound knife had by accident pricked the savage heart  tarzans knife on the present occasion but barely offset the gleaming fangs of terkoz and what little advantage the ape had over the man in brute strength was almost balanced by the latters wonderful quickness and agility  in the sum total of their points however the anthropoid had a shade the better of the battle and had there been no other personal attribute to influence the final outcome tarzan of the apes the young lord greystoke would have died as he had livedan unknown savage beast in equatorial africa  but there was that which had raised him far above his fellows of the junglethat little spark which spells the whole vast difference between man and brutereason  this it was which saved him from death beneath the iron muscles and tearing fangs of terkoz  scarcely had they fought a dozen seconds ere they were rolling upon the ground striking tearing and rendingtwo great savage beasts battling to the death  terkoz had a dozen knife wounds on head and breast and tarzan was torn and bleedinghis scalp in one place half torn from his head so that a great piece hung down over one eye obstructing his vision  but so far the young englishman had been able to keep those horrible fangs from his jugular and now as they fought less fiercely for a moment to regain their breath tarzan formed a cunning plan  he would work his way to the others back and clinging there with tooth and nail drive his knife home until terkoz was no more  the maneuver was accomplished more easily than he had hoped for the stupid beast not knowing what tarzan was attempting made no particular effort to prevent the accomplishment of the design  but when finally he realized that his antagonist was fastened to him where his teeth and fists alike were useless against him terkoz hurled himself about upon the ground so violently that tarzan could but cling desperately to the leaping turning twisting body and ere he had struck a blow the knife was hurled from his hand by a heavy impact against the earth and tarzan found himself defenseless  during the rollings and squirmings of the next few minutes tarzans hold was loosened a dozen times until finally an accidental circumstance of those swift and everchanging evolutions gave him a new hold with his right hand which he realized was absolutely unassailable  his arm was passed beneath terkozs arm from behind and his hand and forearm encircled the back of terkozs neck  it was the halfnelson of modern wrestling which the untaught apeman had stumbled upon but superior reason showed him in an instant the value of the thing he had discovered  it was the difference to him between life and death  and so he struggled to encompass a similar hold with the left hand and in a few moments terkozs bull neck was creaking beneath a fullnelson  there was no more lunging about now  the two lay perfectly still upon the ground tarzan upon terkozs back  slowly the bullet head of the ape was being forced lower and lower upon his chest  tarzan knew what the result would be  in an instant the neck would break  then there came to terkozs rescue the same thing that had put him in these sore straitsa mans reasoning power  if i kill him thought tarzan what advantage will it be to me will it not rob the tribe of a great fighter  and if terkoz be dead he will know nothing of my supremacy while alive he will ever be an example to the other apes  kagoda hissed tarzan in terkozs ear which in ape tongue means freely translated  do you surrender  for a moment there was no reply and tarzan added a few more ounces of pressure which elicited a horrified shriek of pain from the great beast  kagoda repeated tarzan  kagoda cried terkoz  listen said tarzan easing up a trifle but not releasing his hold i am tarzan king of the apes mighty hunter mighty fighter  in all the jungle there is none so great  you have said  kagoda to me  all the tribe have heard  quarrel no more with your king or your people for next time i shall kill you do you understand  huh assented terkoz  and you are satisfied  huh said the ape  tarzan let him up and in a few minutes all were back at their vocations as though naught had occurred to mar the tranquility of their primeval forest haunts  but deep in the minds of the apes was rooted the conviction that tarzan was a mighty fighter and a strange creature  strange because he had had it in his power to kill his enemy but had allowed him to liveunharmed  that afternoon as the tribe came together as was their wont before darkness settled on the jungle tarzan his wounds washed in the waters of the stream called the old males about him  you have seen again today that tarzan of the apes is the greatest among you he said  huh they replied with one voice tarzan is great  tarzan he continued is not an ape  he is not like his people his ways are not their ways and so tarzan is going back to the lair of his own kind by the waters of the great lake which has no farther shore  you must choose another to rule you for tarzan will not return  and thus young lord greystoke took the first step toward the goal which he had setthe finding of other white men like himself     chapter xiii  his own kind   the following morning tarzan lame and sore from the wounds of his battle with terkoz set out toward the west and the seacoast  he traveled very slowly sleeping in the jungle at night and reaching his cabin late the following morning  for several days he moved about but little only enough to gather what fruits and nuts he required to satisfy the demands of hunger  in ten days he was quite sound again except for a terrible halfhealed scar which starting above his left eye ran across the top of his head ending at the right ear  it was the mark left by terkoz when he had torn the scalp away  during his convalescence tarzan tried to fashion a mantle from the skin of sabor which had lain all this time in the cabin  but he found the hide had dried as stiff as a board and as he knew naught of tanning he was forced to abandon his cherished plan  then he determined to filch what few garments he could from one of the black men of mbongas village for tarzan of the apes had decided to mark his evolution from the lower orders in every possible manner and nothing seemed to him a more distinguishing badge of manhood than ornaments and clothing  to this end therefore he collected the various arm and leg ornaments he had taken from the black warriors who had succumbed to his swift and silent noose and donned them all after the way he had seen them worn  about his neck hung the golden chain from which depended the diamond encrusted locket of his mother the lady alice  at his back was a quiver of arrows slung from a leathern shoulder belt another piece of loot from some vanquished black  about his waist was a belt of tiny strips of rawhide fashioned by himself as a support for the homemade scabbard in which hung his fathers hunting knife  the long bow which had been kulongas hung over his left shoulder  the young lord greystoke was indeed a strange and warlike figure his mass of black hair falling to his shoulders behind and cut with his hunting knife to a rude bang upon his forehead that it might not fall before his eyes  his straight and perfect figure muscled as the best of the ancient roman gladiators must have been muscled and yet with the soft and sinuous curves of a greek god told at a glance the wondrous combination of enormous strength with suppleness and speed  a personification was tarzan of the apes of the primitive man the hunter the warrior  with the noble poise of his handsome head upon those broad shoulders and the fire of life and intelligence in those fine clear eyes he might readily have typified some demigod of a wild and warlike bygone people of his ancient forest  but of these things tarzan did not think  he was worried because he had not clothing to indicate to all the jungle folks that he was a man and not an ape and grave doubt often entered his mind as to whether he might not yet become an ape  was not hair commencing to grow upon his face  all the apes had hair upon theirs but the black men were entirely hairless with very few exceptions  true he had seen pictures in his books of men with great masses of hair upon lip and cheek and chin but nevertheless tarzan was afraid almost daily he whetted his keen knife and scraped and whittled at his young beard to eradicate this degrading emblem of apehood  and so he learned to shaverudely and painfully it is truebut nevertheless effectively  when he felt quite strong again after his bloody battle with terkoz tarzan set off one morning towards mbongas village  he was moving carelessly along a winding jungle trail instead of making his progress through the trees when suddenly he came face to face with a black warrior  the look of surprise on the savage face was almost comical and before tarzan could unsling his bow the fellow had turned and fled down the path crying out in alarm as though to others before him  tarzan took to the trees in pursuit and in a few moments came in view of the men desperately striving to escape  there were three of them and they were racing madly in single file through the dense undergrowth  tarzan easily distanced them nor did they see his silent passage above their heads nor note the crouching figure squatted upon a low branch ahead of them beneath which the trail led them  tarzan let the first two pass beneath him but as the third came swiftly on the quiet noose dropped about the black throat  a quick jerk drew it taut  there was an agonized scream from the victim and his fellows turned to see his struggling body rise as by magic slowly into the dense foliage of the trees above  with frightened shrieks they wheeled once more and plunged on in their efforts to escape  tarzan dispatched his prisoner quickly and silently removed the weapons and ornaments andoh the greatest joy of alla handsome deerskin breechcloth which he quickly transferred to his own person  now indeed was he dressed as a man should be  none there was who could now doubt his high origin  how he should have liked to have returned to the tribe to parade before their envious gaze this wondrous finery  taking the body across his shoulder he moved more slowly through the trees toward the little palisaded village for he again needed arrows  as he approached quite close to the enclosure he saw an excited group surrounding the two fugitives who trembling with fright and exhaustion were scarce able to recount the uncanny details of their adventure  mirando they said who had been ahead of them a short distance had suddenly come screaming toward them crying that a terrible white and naked warrior was pursuing him  the three of them had hurried toward the village as rapidly as their legs would carry them  again mirandos shrill cry of mortal terror had caused them to look back and there they had seen the most horrible sighttheir companions body flying upwards into the trees his arms and legs beating the air and his tongue protruding from his open mouth  no other sound did he utter nor was there any creature in sight about him  the villagers were worked up into a state of fear bordering on panic but wise old mbonga affected to feel considerable skepticism regarding the tale and attributed the whole fabrication to their fright in the face of some real danger  you tell us this great story he said because you do not dare to speak the truth  you do not dare admit that when the lion sprang upon mirando you ran away and left him  you are cowards  scarcely had mbonga ceased speaking when a great crashing of branches in the trees above them caused the blacks to look up in renewed terror the sight that met their eyes made even wise old mbonga shudder for there turning and twisting in the air came the dead body of mirando to sprawl with a sickening reverberation upon the ground at their feet  with one accord the blacks took to their heels nor did they stop until the last of them was lost in the dense shadows of the surrounding jungle  again tarzan came down into the village and renewed his supply of arrows and ate of the offering of food which the blacks had made to appease his wrath  before he left he carried the body of mirando to the gate of the village and propped it up against the palisade in such a way that the dead face seemed to be peering around the edge of the gatepost down the path which led to the jungle  then tarzan returned hunting always hunting to the cabin by the beach  it took a dozen attempts on the part of the thoroughly frightened blacks to reenter their village past the horrible grinning face of their dead fellow and when they found the food and arrows gone they knew what they had only too well feared that mirando had seen the evil spirit of the jungle  that now seemed to them the logical explanation  only those who saw this terrible god of the jungle died for was it not true that none left alive in the village had ever seen him  therefore those who had died at his hands must have seen him and paid the penalty with their lives  as long as they supplied him with arrows and food he would not harm them unless they looked upon him so it was ordered by mbonga that in addition to the food offering there should also be laid out an offering of arrows for this munangokeewati and this was done from then on  if you ever chance to pass that far off african village you will still see before a tiny thatched hut built just without the village a little iron pot in which is a quantity of food and beside it a quiver of welldaubed arrows  when tarzan came in sight of the beach where stood his cabin a strange and unusual spectacle met his vision  on the placid waters of the landlocked harbor floated a great ship and on the beach a small boat was drawn up  but most wonderful of all a number of white men like himself were moving about between the beach and his cabin  tarzan saw that in many ways they were like the men of his picture books  he crept closer through the trees until he was quite close above them  there were ten men swarthy suntanned villainous looking fellows now they had congregated by the boat and were talking in loud angry tones with much gesticulating and shaking of fists  presently one of them a little meanfaced blackbearded fellow with a countenance which reminded tarzan of pamba the rat laid his hand upon the shoulder of a giant who stood next him and with whom all the others had been arguing and quarreling  the little man pointed inland so that the giant was forced to turn away from the others to look in the direction indicated  as he turned the little meanfaced man drew a revolver from his belt and shot the giant in the back  the big fellow threw his hands above his head his knees bent beneath him and without a sound he tumbled forward upon the beach dead  the report of the weapon the first that tarzan had ever heard filled him with wonderment but even this unaccustomed sound could not startle his healthy nerves into even a semblance of panic  the conduct of the white strangers it was that caused him the greatest perturbation  he puckered his brows into a frown of deep thought  it was well thought he that he had not given way to his first impulse to rush forward and greet these white men as brothers  they were evidently no different from the black menno more civilized than the apesno less cruel than sabor  for a moment the others stood looking at the little meanfaced man and the giant lying dead upon the beach  then one of them laughed and slapped the little man upon the back there was much more talk and gesticulating but less quarreling  presently they launched the boat and all jumped into it and rowed away toward the great ship where tarzan could see other figures moving about upon the deck  when they had clambered aboard tarzan dropped to earth behind a great tree and crept to his cabin keeping it always between himself and the ship  slipping in at the door he found that everything had been ransacked his books and pencils strewed the floor  his weapons and shields and other little store of treasures were littered about  as he saw what had been done a great wave of anger surged through him and the new made scar upon his forehead stood suddenly out a bar of inflamed crimson against his tawny hide  quickly he ran to the cupboard and searched in the far recess of the lower shelf  ah  he breathed a sigh of relief as he drew out the little tin box and opening it found his greatest treasures undisturbed  the photograph of the smiling strongfaced young man and the little black puzzle book were safe  what was that  his quick ear had caught a faint but unfamiliar sound  running to the window tarzan looked toward the harbor and there he saw that a boat was being lowered from the great ship beside the one already in the water  soon he saw many people clambering over the sides of the larger vessel and dropping into the boats  they were coming back in full force  for a moment longer tarzan watched while a number of boxes and bundles were lowered into the waiting boats then as they shoved off from the ships side the apeman snatched up a piece of paper and with a pencil printed on it for a few moments until it bore several lines of strong wellmade almost letterperfect characters  this notice he stuck upon the door with a small sharp splinter of wood then gathering up his precious tin box his arrows and as many bows and spears as he could carry he hastened through the door and disappeared into the forest  when the two boats were beached upon the silvery sand it was a strange assortment of humanity that clambered ashore  some twenty souls in all there were fifteen of them rough and villainous appearing seamen  the others of the party were of different stamp  one was an elderly man with white hair and large rimmed spectacles his slightly stooped shoulders were draped in an illfitting though immaculate frock coat and a shiny silk hat added to the incongruity of his garb in an african jungle  the second member of the party to land was a tall young man in white ducks while directly behind came another elderly man with a very high forehead and a fussy excitable manner  after these came a huge negress clothed like solomon as to colors  her great eyes rolled in evident terror first toward the jungle and then toward the cursing band of sailors who were removing the bales and boxes from the boats  the last member of the party to disembark was a girl of about nineteen and it was the young man who stood at the boats prow to lift her high and dry upon land  she gave him a brave and pretty smile of thanks but no words passed between them  in silence the party advanced toward the cabin  it was evident that whatever their intentions all had been decided upon before they left the ship and so they came to the door the sailors carrying the boxes and bales followed by the five who were of so different a class  the men put down their burdens and then one caught sight of the notice which tarzan had posted  ho mates he cried  whats here  this sign was not posted an hour ago or ill eat the cook  the others gathered about craning their necks over the shoulders of those before them but as few of them could read at all and then only after the most laborious fashion one finally turned to the little old man of the top hat and frock coat  hi perfesser he called step forrd and read the bloomin notis  thus addressed the old man came slowly to where the sailors stood followed by the other members of his party  adjusting his spectacles he looked for a moment at the placard and then turning away strolled off muttering to himself  most remarkablemost remarkable  hi old fossil cried the man who had first called on him for assistance did je think we wanted of you to read the bloomin notis to yourself  come back here and read it out loud you old barnacle  the old man stopped and turning back said  oh yes my dear sir a thousand pardons  it was quite thoughtless of me yesvery thoughtless  most remarkablemost remarkable  again he faced the notice and read it through and doubtless would have turned off again to ruminate upon it had not the sailor grasped him roughly by the collar and howled into his ear  read it out loud you blithering old idiot  ah yes indeed yes indeed replied the professor softly and adjusting his spectacles once more he read aloud        this is the house of tarzan the   killer of beasts and many black   men  do not harm the things which   are tarzans  tarzan watches       tarzan of the apes   who the devil is tarzan cried the sailor who had before spoken  he evidently speaks english said the young man  but what does tarzan of the apes mean cried the girl  i do not know miss porter replied the young man unless we have discovered a runaway simian from the london zoo who has brought back a european education to his jungle home  what do you make of it professor porter he added turning to the old man  professor archimedes q porter adjusted his spectacles  ah yes indeed yes indeedmost remarkable most remarkable said the professor but i can add nothing further to what i have already remarked in elucidation of this truly momentous occurrence and the professor turned slowly in the direction of the jungle  but papa cried the girl you havent said anything about it yet  tut tut child tut tut responded professor porter in a kindly and indulgent tone do not trouble your pretty head with such weighty and abstruse problems and again he wandered slowly off in still another direction his eyes bent upon the ground at his feet his hands clasped behind him beneath the flowing tails of his coat  i reckon the daffy old bounder dont know no moren we do about it growled the ratfaced sailor  keep a civil tongue in your head cried the young man his face paling in anger at the insulting tone of the sailor  youve murdered our officers and robbed us  we are absolutely in your power but youll treat professor porter and miss porter with respect or ill break that vile neck of yours with my bare handsguns or no guns and the young fellow stepped so close to the ratfaced sailor that the latter though he bore two revolvers and a villainous looking knife in his belt slunk back abashed  you damned coward cried the young man  youd never dare shoot a man until his back was turned  you dont dare shoot me even then and he deliberately turned his back full upon the sailor and walked nonchalantly away as if to put him to the test  the sailors hand crept slyly to the butt of one of his revolvers his wicked eyes glared vengefully at the retreating form of the young englishman  the gaze of his fellows was upon him but still he hesitated  at heart he was even a greater coward than mr william cecil clayton had imagined  two keen eyes had watched every move of the party from the foliage of a nearby tree  tarzan had seen the surprise caused by his notice and while he could understand nothing of the spoken language of these strange people their gestures and facial expressions told him much  the act of the little ratfaced sailor in killing one of his comrades had aroused a strong dislike in tarzan and now that he saw him quarreling with the finelooking young man his animosity was still further stirred  tarzan had never seen the effects of a firearm before though his books had taught him something of them but when he saw the ratfaced one fingering the butt of his revolver he thought of the scene he had witnessed so short a time before and naturally expected to see the young man murdered as had been the huge sailor earlier in the day  so tarzan fitted a poisoned arrow to his bow and drew a bead upon the ratfaced sailor but the foliage was so thick that he soon saw the arrow would be deflected by the leaves or some small branch and instead he launched a heavy spear from his lofty perch  clayton had taken but a dozen steps  the ratfaced sailor had half drawn his revolver the other sailors stood watching the scene intently  professor porter had already disappeared into the jungle whither he was being followed by the fussy samuel t  philander his secretary and assistant  esmeralda the negress was busy sorting her mistress baggage from the pile of bales and boxes beside the cabin and miss porter had turned away to follow clayton when something caused her to turn again toward the sailor  and then three things happened almost simultaneously  the sailor jerked out his weapon and leveled it at claytons back miss porter screamed a warning and a long metalshod spear shot like a bolt from above and passed entirely through the right shoulder of the ratfaced man  the revolver exploded harmlessly in the air and the seaman crumpled up with a scream of pain and terror  clayton turned and rushed back toward the scene  the sailors stood in a frightened group with drawn weapons peering into the jungle  the wounded man writhed and shrieked upon the ground  clayton unseen by any picked up the fallen revolver and slipped it inside his shirt then he joined the sailors in gazing mystified into the jungle  who could it have been whispered jane porter and the young man turned to see her standing wideeyed and wondering close beside him  i dare say tarzan of the apes is watching us all right he answered in a dubious tone  i wonder now who that spear was intended for if for snipes then our ape friend is a friend indeed  by jove where are your father and mr philander  theres someone or something in that jungle and its armed whatever it is  ho professor  mr philander young clayton shouted  there was no response  whats to be done miss porter continued the young man his face clouded by a frown of worry and indecision  i cant leave you here alone with these cutthroats and you certainly cant venture into the jungle with me yet someone must go in search of your father  he is more than apt to wandering off aimlessly regardless of danger or direction and mr philander is only a trifle less impractical than he  you will pardon my bluntness but our lives are all in jeopardy here and when we get your father back something must be done to impress upon him the dangers to which he exposes you as well as himself by his absentmindedness  i quite agree with you replied the girl and i am not offended at all  dear old papa would sacrifice his life for me without an instants hesitation provided one could keep his mind on so frivolous a matter for an entire instant  there is only one way to keep him in safety and that is to chain him to a tree  the poor dear is so impractical  i have it suddenly exclaimed clayton  you can use a revolver cant you  yes  why  i have one  with it you and esmeralda will be comparatively safe in this cabin while i am searching for your father and mr philander come call the woman and i will hurry on  they cant have gone far  jane did as he suggested and when he saw the door close safely behind them clayton turned toward the jungle  some of the sailors were drawing the spear from their wounded comrade and as clayton approached he asked if he could borrow a revolver from one of them while he searched the jungle for the professor  the ratfaced one finding he was not dead had regained his composure and with a volley of oaths directed at clayton refused in the name of his fellows to allow the young man any firearms  this man snipes had assumed the role of chief since he had killed their former leader and so little time had elapsed that none of his companions had as yet questioned his authority  claytons only response was a shrug of the shoulders but as he left them he picked up the spear which had transfixed snipes and thus primitively armed the son of the then lord greystoke strode into the dense jungle  every few moments he called aloud the names of the wanderers  the watchers in the cabin by the beach heard the sound of his voice growing ever fainter and fainter until at last it was swallowed up by the myriad noises of the primeval wood  when professor archimedes q porter and his assistant samuel t philander after much insistence on the part of the latter had finally turned their steps toward camp they were as completely lost in the wild and tangled labyrinth of the matted jungle as two human beings well could be though they did not know it  it was by the merest caprice of fortune that they headed toward the west coast of africa instead of toward zanzibar on the opposite side of the dark continent  when in a short time they reached the beach only to find no camp in sight philander was positive that they were north of their proper destination while as a matter of fact they were about two hundred yards south of it  it never occurred to either of these impractical theorists to call aloud on the chance of attracting their friends attention  instead with all the assurance that deductive reasoning from a wrong premise induces in one mr samuel t philander grasped professor archimedes q porter firmly by the arm and hurried the weakly protesting old gentleman off in the direction of cape town fifteen hundred miles to the south  when jane and esmeralda found themselves safely behind the cabin door the negresss first thought was to barricade the portal from the inside  with this idea in mind she turned to search for some means of putting it into execution but her first view of the interior of the cabin brought a shriek of terror to her lips and like a frightened child the huge woman ran to bury her face on her mistress shoulder  jane turning at the cry saw the cause of it lying prone upon the floor before themthe whitened skeleton of a man  a further glance revealed a second skeleton upon the bed  what horrible place are we in murmured the awestruck girl  but there was no panic in her fright  at last disengaging herself from the frantic clutch of the still shrieking esmeralda jane crossed the room to look into the little cradle knowing what she should see there even before the tiny skeleton disclosed itself in all its pitiful and pathetic frailty  what an awful tragedy these poor mute bones proclaimed  the girl shuddered at thought of the eventualities which might lie before herself and her friends in this illfated cabin the haunt of mysterious perhaps hostile beings  quickly with an impatient stamp of her little foot she endeavored to shake off the gloomy forebodings and turning to esmeralda bade her cease her wailing  stop esmeralda stop it this minute she cried  you are only making it worse  she ended lamely a little quiver in her own voice as she thought of the three men upon whom she depended for protection wandering in the depth of that awful forest  soon the girl found that the door was equipped with a heavy wooden bar upon the inside and after several efforts the combined strength of the two enabled them to slip it into place the first time in twenty years  then they sat down upon a bench with their arms about one another and waited     chapter xiv  at the mercy of the jungle   after clayton had plunged into the jungle the sailorsmutineers of the arrowfell into a discussion of their next step but on one point all were agreedthat they should hasten to put off to the anchored arrow where they could at least be safe from the spears of their unseen foe  and so while jane porter and esmeralda were barricading themselves within the cabin the cowardly crew of cutthroats were pulling rapidly for their ship in the two boats that had brought them ashore  so much had tarzan seen that day that his head was in a whirl of wonder  but the most wonderful sight of all to him was the face of the beautiful white girl  here at last was one of his own kind of that he was positive  and the young man and the two old men they too were much as he had pictured his own people to be  but doubtless they were as ferocious and cruel as other men he had seen  the fact that they alone of all the party were unarmed might account for the fact that they had killed no one  they might be very different if provided with weapons  tarzan had seen the young man pick up the fallen revolver of the wounded snipes and hide it away in his breast and he had also seen him slip it cautiously to the girl as she entered the cabin door  he did not understand anything of the motives behind all that he had seen but somehow intuitively he liked the young man and the two old men and for the girl he had a strange longing which he scarcely understood  as for the big black woman she was evidently connected in some way to the girl and so he liked her also  for the sailors and especially snipes he had developed a great hatred  he knew by their threatening gestures and by the expression upon their evil faces that they were enemies of the others of the party and so he decided to watch closely  tarzan wondered why the men had gone into the jungle nor did it ever occur to him that one could become lost in that maze of undergrowth which to him was as simple as is the main street of your own home town to you  when he saw the sailors row away toward the ship and knew that the girl and her companion were safe in his cabin tarzan decided to follow the young man into the jungle and learn what his errand might be  he swung off rapidly in the direction taken by clayton and in a short time heard faintly in the distance the now only occasional calls of the englishman to his friends  presently tarzan came up with the white man who almost fagged was leaning against a tree wiping the perspiration from his forehead  the apeman hiding safe behind a screen of foliage sat watching this new specimen of his own race intently  at intervals clayton called aloud and finally it came to tarzan that he was searching for the old man  tarzan was on the point of going off to look for them himself when he caught the yellow glint of a sleek hide moving cautiously through the jungle toward clayton  it was sheeta the leopard  now tarzan heard the soft bending of grasses and wondered why the young white man was not warned  could it be he had failed to note the loud warning  never before had tarzan known sheeta to be so clumsy  no the white man did not hear  sheeta was crouching for the spring and then shrill and horrible there rose from the stillness of the jungle the awful cry of the challenging ape and sheeta turned crashing into the underbrush  clayton came to his feet with a start  his blood ran cold  never in all his life had so fearful a sound smote upon his ears  he was no coward but if ever man felt the icy fingers of fear upon his heart william cecil clayton eldest son of lord greystoke of england did that day in the fastness of the african jungle  the noise of some great body crashing through the underbrush so close beside him and the sound of that bloodcurdling shriek from above tested claytons courage to the limit but he could not know that it was to that very voice he owed his life nor that the creature who hurled it forth was his own cousinthe real lord greystoke  the afternoon was drawing to a close and clayton disheartened and discouraged was in a terrible quandary as to the proper course to pursue whether to keep on in search of professor porter at the almost certain risk of his own death in the jungle by night or to return to the cabin where he might at least serve to protect jane from the perils which confronted her on all sides  he did not wish to return to camp without her father still more he shrank from the thought of leaving her alone and unprotected in the hands of the mutineers of the arrow or to the hundred unknown dangers of the jungle  possibly too he thought the professor and philander might have returned to camp  yes that was more than likely  at least he would return and see before he continued what seemed to be a most fruitless quest  and so he started stumbling back through the thick and matted underbrush in the direction that he thought the cabin lay  to tarzans surprise the young man was heading further into the jungle in the general direction of mbongas village and the shrewd young apeman was convinced that he was lost  to tarzan this was scarcely comprehensible his judgment told him that no man would venture toward the village of the cruel blacks armed only with a spear which from the awkward way in which he carried it was evidently an unaccustomed weapon to this white man  nor was he following the trail of the old men  that they had crossed and left long since though it had been fresh and plain before tarzans eyes  tarzan was perplexed  the fierce jungle would make easy prey of this unprotected stranger in a very short time if he were not guided quickly to the beach  yes there was numa the lion even now stalking the white man a dozen paces to the right  clayton heard the great body paralleling his course and now there rose upon the evening air the beasts thunderous roar  the man stopped with upraised spear and faced the brush from which issued the awful sound the shadows were deepening darkness was settling in  god  to die here alone beneath the fangs of wild beasts to be torn and rended to feel the hot breath of the brute on his face as the great paw crushed down upon his breast  for a moment all was still  clayton stood rigid with raised spear presently a faint rustling of the bush apprised him of the stealthy creeping of the thing behind  it was gathering for the spring  at last he saw it not twenty feet awaythe long lithe muscular body and tawny head of a huge blackmaned lion  the beast was upon its belly moving forward very slowly  as its eyes met claytons it stopped and deliberately cautiously gathered its hind quarters behind it  in agony the man watched fearful to launch his spear powerless to fly  he heard a noise in the tree above him  some new danger he thought but he dared not take his eyes from the yellow green orbs before him there was a sharp twang as of a broken banjostring and at the same instant an arrow appeared in the yellow hide of the crouching lion  with a roar of pain and anger the beast sprang but somehow clayton stumbled to one side and as he turned again to face the infuriated king of beasts he was appalled at the sight which confronted him almost simultaneously with the lions turning to renew the attack a halfnaked giant dropped from the tree above squarely on the brutes back  with lightning speed an arm that was banded layers of iron muscle encircled the huge neck and the great beast was raised from behind roaring and pawing the airraised as easily as clayton would have lifted a pet dog  the scene he witnessed there in the twilight depths of the african jungle was burned forever into the englishmans brain  the man before him was the embodiment of physical perfection and giant strength yet it was not upon these he depended in his battle with the great cat for mighty as were his muscles they were as nothing by comparison with numas  to his agility to his brain and to his long keen knife he owed his supremacy  his right arm encircled the lions neck while the left hand plunged the knife time and again into the unprotected side behind the left shoulder  the infuriated beast pulled up and backwards until he stood upon his hind legs struggled impotently in this unnatural position  had the battle been of a few seconds longer duration the outcome might have been different but it was all accomplished so quickly that the lion had scarce time to recover from the confusion of its surprise ere it sank lifeless to the ground  then the strange figure which had vanquished it stood erect upon the carcass and throwing back the wild and handsome head gave out the fearsome cry which a few moments earlier had so startled clayton  before him he saw the figure of a young man naked except for a loin cloth and a few barbaric ornaments about arms and legs on the breast a priceless diamond locket gleaming against a smooth brown skin  the hunting knife had been returned to its homely sheath and the man was gathering up his bow and quiver from where he had tossed them when he leaped to attack the lion  clayton spoke to the stranger in english thanking him for his brave rescue and complimenting him on the wondrous strength and dexterity he had displayed but the only answer was a steady stare and a faint shrug of the mighty shoulders which might betoken either disparagement of the service rendered or ignorance of claytons language  when the bow and quiver had been slung to his back the wild man for such clayton now thought him once more drew his knife and deftly carved a dozen large strips of meat from the lions carcass  then squatting upon his haunches he proceeded to eat first motioning clayton to join him  the strong white teeth sank into the raw and dripping flesh in apparent relish of the meal but clayton could not bring himself to share the uncooked meat with his strange host instead he watched him and presently there dawned upon him the conviction that this was tarzan of the apes whose notice he had seen posted upon the cabin door that morning  if so he must speak english  again clayton attempted speech with the apeman but the replies now vocal were in a strange tongue which resembled the chattering of monkeys mingled with the growling of some wild beast  no this could not be tarzan of the apes for it was very evident that he was an utter stranger to english  when tarzan had completed his repast he rose and pointing a very different direction from that which clayton had been pursuing started off through the jungle toward the point he had indicated  clayton bewildered and confused hesitated to follow him for he thought he was but being led more deeply into the mazes of the forest but the apeman seeing him disinclined to follow returned and grasping him by the coat dragged him along until he was convinced that clayton understood what was required of him  then he left him to follow voluntarily  the englishman finally concluding that he was a prisoner saw no alternative open but to accompany his captor and thus they traveled slowly through the jungle while the sable mantle of the impenetrable forest night fell about them and the stealthy footfalls of padded paws mingled with the breaking of twigs and the wild calls of the savage life that clayton felt closing in upon him  suddenly clayton heard the faint report of a firearma single shot and then silence  in the cabin by the beach two thoroughly terrified women clung to each other as they crouched upon the low bench in the gathering darkness  the negress sobbed hysterically bemoaning the evil day that had witnessed her departure from her dear maryland while the white girl dry eyed and outwardly calm was torn by inward fears and forebodings she feared not more for herself than for the three men whom she knew to be wandering in the abysmal depths of the savage jungle from which she now heard issuing the almost incessant shrieks and roars barkings and growlings of its terrifying and fearsome denizens as they sought their prey  and now there came the sound of a heavy body brushing against the side of the cabin  she could hear the great padded paws upon the ground outside  for an instant all was silence even the bedlam of the forest died to a faint murmur  then she distinctly heard the beast outside sniffing at the door not two feet from where she crouched instinctively the girl shuddered and shrank closer to the black woman  hush she whispered  hush esmeralda for the womans sobs and groans seemed to have attracted the thing that stalked there just beyond the thin wall  a gentle scratching sound was heard on the door  the brute tried to force an entrance but presently this ceased and again she heard the great pads creeping stealthily around the cabin  again they stoppedbeneath the window on which the terrified eyes of the girl now glued themselves  god she murmured for now silhouetted against the moonlit sky beyond she saw framed in the tiny square of the latticed window the head of a huge lioness  the gleaming eyes were fixed upon her in intent ferocity  look esmeralda she whispered  for gods sake what shall we do look  quick  the window  esmeralda cowering still closer to her mistress took one frightened glance toward the little square of moonlight just as the lioness emitted a low savage snarl  the sight that met the poor womans eyes was too much for the already overstrung nerves  oh gaberelle she shrieked and slid to the floor an inert and senseless mass  for what seemed an eternity the great brute stood with its forepaws upon the sill glaring into the little room  presently it tried the strength of the lattice with its great talons  the girl had almost ceased to breathe when to her relief the head disappeared and she heard the brutes footsteps leaving the window but now they came to the door again and once more the scratching commenced this time with increasing force until the great beast was tearing at the massive panels in a perfect frenzy of eagerness to seize its defenseless victims  could jane have known the immense strength of that door built piece by piece she would have felt less fear of the lioness reaching her by this avenue  little did john clayton imagine when he fashioned that crude but mighty portal that one day twenty years later it would shield a fair american girl then unborn from the teeth and talons of a maneater  for fully twenty minutes the brute alternately sniffed and tore at the door occasionally giving voice to a wild savage cry of baffled rage at length however she gave up the attempt and jane heard her returning toward the window beneath which she paused for an instant and then launched her great weight against the timeworn lattice  the girl heard the wooden rods groan beneath the impact but they held and the huge body dropped back to the ground below  again and again the lioness repeated these tactics until finally the horrified prisoner within saw a portion of the lattice give way and in an instant one great paw and the head of the animal were thrust within the room  slowly the powerful neck and shoulders spread the bars apart and the lithe body protruded farther and farther into the room  as in a trance the girl rose her hand upon her breast wide eyes staring horrorstricken into the snarling face of the beast scarce ten feet from her  at her feet lay the prostrate form of the negress  if she could but arouse her their combined efforts might possibly avail to beat back the fierce and bloodthirsty intruder  jane stooped to grasp the black woman by the shoulder  roughly she shook her  esmeralda  esmeralda she cried  help me or we are lost  esmeralda opened her eyes  the first object they encountered was the dripping fangs of the hungry lioness  with a horrified scream the poor woman rose to her hands and knees and in this position scurried across the room shrieking o gaberelle  o gaberelle at the top of her lungs  esmeralda weighed some two hundred and eighty pounds and her extreme haste added to her extreme corpulency produced a most amazing result when esmeralda elected to travel on all fours  for a moment the lioness remained quiet with intense gaze directed upon the flitting esmeralda whose goal appeared to be the cupboard into which she attempted to propel her huge bulk but as the shelves were but nine or ten inches apart she only succeeded in getting her head in whereupon with a final screech which paled the jungle noises into insignificance she fainted once again  with the subsidence of esmeralda the lioness renewed her efforts to wriggle her huge bulk through the weakening lattice  the girl standing pale and rigid against the farther wall sought with everincreasing terror for some loophole of escape  suddenly her hand tightpressed against her bosom felt the hard outline of the revolver that clayton had left with her earlier in the day  quickly she snatched it from its hidingplace and leveling it full at the lionesss face pulled the trigger  there was a flash of flame the roar of the discharge and an answering roar of pain and anger from the beast  jane porter saw the great form disappear from the window and then she too fainted the revolver falling at her side  but sabor was not killed  the bullet had but inflicted a painful wound in one of the great shoulders  it was the surprise at the blinding flash and the deafening roar that had caused her hasty but temporary retreat  in another instant she was back at the lattice and with renewed fury was clawing at the aperture but with lessened effect since the wounded member was almost useless  she saw her preythe two womenlying senseless upon the floor  there was no longer any resistance to be overcome  her meat lay before her and sabor had only to worm her way through the lattice to claim it  slowly she forced her great bulk inch by inch through the opening now her head was through now one great forearm and shoulder  carefully she drew up the wounded member to insinuate it gently beyond the tight pressing bars  a moment more and both shoulders through the long sinuous body and the narrow hips would glide quickly after  it was on this sight that jane porter again opened her eyes     chapter xv  the forest god   when clayton heard the report of the firearm he fell into an agony of fear and apprehension  he knew that one of the sailors might be the author of it but the fact that he had left the revolver with jane together with the overwrought condition of his nerves made him morbidly positive that she was threatened with some great danger perhaps even now she was attempting to defend herself against some savage man or beast  what were the thoughts of his strange captor or guide clayton could only vaguely conjecture but that he had heard the shot and was in some manner affected by it was quite evident for he quickened his pace so appreciably that clayton stumbling blindly in his wake was down a dozen times in as many minutes in a vain effort to keep pace with him and soon was left hopelessly behind  fearing that he would again be irretrievably lost he called aloud to the wild man ahead of him and in a moment had the satisfaction of seeing him drop lightly to his side from the branches above  for a moment tarzan looked at the young man closely as though undecided as to just what was best to do then stooping down before clayton he motioned him to grasp him about the neck and with the white man upon his back tarzan took to the trees  the next few minutes the young englishman never forgot  high into bending and swaying branches he was borne with what seemed to him incredible swiftness while tarzan chafed at the slowness of his progress  from one lofty branch the agile creature swung with clayton through a dizzy arc to a neighboring tree then for a hundred yards maybe the sure feet threaded a maze of interwoven limbs balancing like a tightrope walker high above the black depths of verdure beneath  from the first sensation of chilling fear clayton passed to one of keen admiration and envy of those giant muscles and that wondrous instinct or knowledge which guided this forest god through the inky blackness of the night as easily and safely as clayton would have strolled a london street at high noon  occasionally they would enter a spot where the foliage above was less dense and the bright rays of the moon lit up before claytons wondering eyes the strange path they were traversing  at such times the man fairly caught his breath at sight of the horrid depths below them for tarzan took the easiest way which often led over a hundred feet above the earth  and yet with all his seeming speed tarzan was in reality feeling his way with comparative slowness searching constantly for limbs of adequate strength for the maintenance of this double weight  presently they came to the clearing before the beach  tarzans quick ears had heard the strange sounds of sabors efforts to force her way through the lattice and it seemed to clayton that they dropped a straight hundred feet to earth so quickly did tarzan descend  yet when they struck the ground it was with scarce a jar and as clayton released his hold on the apeman he saw him dart like a squirrel for the opposite side of the cabin  the englishman sprang quickly after him just in time to see the hind quarters of some huge animal about to disappear through the window of the cabin  as jane opened her eyes to a realization of the imminent peril which threatened her her brave young heart gave up at last its final vestige of hope  but then to her surprise she saw the huge animal being slowly drawn back through the window and in the moonlight beyond she saw the heads and shoulders of two men  as clayton rounded the corner of the cabin to behold the animal disappearing within it was also to see the apeman seize the long tail in both hands and bracing himself with his feet against the side of the cabin throw all his mighty strength into the effort to draw the beast out of the interior  clayton was quick to lend a hand but the apeman jabbered to him in a commanding and peremptory tone something which clayton knew to be orders though he could not understand them  at last under their combined efforts the great body was slowly dragged farther and farther outside the window and then there came to claytons mind a dawning conception of the rash bravery of his companions act  for a naked man to drag a shrieking clawing maneater forth from a window by the tail to save a strange white girl was indeed the last word in heroism  insofar as clayton was concerned it was a very different matter since the girl was not only of his own kind and race but was the one woman in all the world whom he loved  though he knew that the lioness would make short work of both of them he pulled with a will to keep it from jane porter  and then he recalled the battle between this man and the great blackmaned lion which he had witnessed a short time before and he commenced to feel more assurance  tarzan was still issuing orders which clayton could not understand  he was trying to tell the stupid white man to plunge his poisoned arrows into sabors back and sides and to reach the savage heart with the long thin hunting knife that hung at tarzans hip but the man would not understand and tarzan did not dare release his hold to do the things himself for he knew that the puny white man never could hold mighty sabor alone for an instant  slowly the lioness was emerging from the window  at last her shoulders were out  and then clayton saw an incredible thing  tarzan racking his brains for some means to cope singlehanded with the infuriated beast had suddenly recalled his battle with terkoz and as the great shoulders came clear of the window so that the lioness hung upon the sill only by her forepaws tarzan suddenly released his hold upon the brute  with the quickness of a striking rattler he launched himself full upon sabors back his strong young arms seeking and gaining a fullnelson upon the beast as he had learned it that other day during his bloody wrestling victory over terkoz  with a roar the lioness turned completely over upon her back falling full upon her enemy but the blackhaired giant only closed tighter his hold  pawing and tearing at earth and air sabor rolled and threw herself this way and that in an effort to dislodge this strange antagonist but ever tighter and tighter drew the iron bands that were forcing her head lower and lower upon her tawny breast  higher crept the steel forearms of the apeman about the back of sabors neck  weaker and weaker became the lionesss efforts  at last clayton saw the immense muscles of tarzans shoulders and biceps leap into corded knots beneath the silver moonlight  there was a long sustained and supreme effort on the apemans partand the vertebrae of sabors neck parted with a sharp snap  in an instant tarzan was upon his feet and for the second time that day clayton heard the bull apes savage roar of victory  then he heard janes agonized cry  cecilmr clayton  oh what is it  what is it  running quickly to the cabin door clayton called out that all was right and shouted to her to open the door  as quickly as she could she raised the great bar and fairly dragged clayton within  what was that awful noise she whispered shrinking close to him  it was the cry of the kill from the throat of the man who has just saved your life miss porter  wait i will fetch him so you may thank him  the frightened girl would not be left alone so she accompanied clayton to the side of the cabin where lay the dead body of the lioness  tarzan of the apes was gone  clayton called several times but there was no reply and so the two returned to the greater safety of the interior  what a frightful sound cried jane i shudder at the mere thought of it  do not tell me that a human throat voiced that hideous and fearsome shriek  but it did miss porter replied clayton or at least if not a human throat that of a forest god  and then he told her of his experiences with this strange creatureof how twice the wild man had saved his lifeof the wondrous strength and agility and braveryof the brown skin and the handsome face  i cannot make it out at all he concluded  at first i thought he might be tarzan of the apes but he neither speaks nor understands english so that theory is untenable  well whatever he may be cried the girl we owe him our lives and may god bless him and keep him in safety in his wild and savage jungle  amen said clayton fervently  for the good lords sake aint i dead  the two turned to see esmeralda sitting upright upon the floor her great eyes rolling from side to side as though she could not believe their testimony as to her whereabouts  and now for jane porter the reaction came and she threw herself upon the bench sobbing with hysterical laughter     chapter xvi  most remarkable   several miles south of the cabin upon a strip of sandy beach stood two old men arguing  before them stretched the broad atlantic  at their backs was the dark continent  close around them loomed the impenetrable blackness of the jungle  savage beasts roared and growled noises hideous and weird assailed their ears  they had wandered for miles in search of their camp but always in the wrong direction  they were as hopelessly lost as though they suddenly had been transported to another world  at such a time indeed every fiber of their combined intellects must have been concentrated upon the vital question of the minutethe lifeanddeath question to them of retracing their steps to camp  samuel t philander was speaking  but my dear professor he was saying i still maintain that but for the victories of ferdinand and isabella over the fifteenthcentury moors in spain the world would be today a thousand years in advance of where we now find ourselves  the moors were essentially a tolerant broadminded liberal race of agriculturists artisans and merchantsthe very type of people that has made possible such civilization as we find today in america and europewhile the spaniards  tut tut dear mr philander interrupted professor porter their religion positively precluded the possibilities you suggest  moslemism was is and always will be a blight on that scientific progress which has marked  bless me  professor interjected mr philander who had turned his gaze toward the jungle there seems to be someone approaching  professor archimedes q porter turned in the direction indicated by the nearsighted mr philander  tut tut mr philander he chided  how often must i urge you to seek that absolute concentration of your mental faculties which alone may permit you to bring to bear the highest powers of intellectuality upon the momentous problems which naturally fall to the lot of great minds  and now i find you guilty of a most flagrant breach of courtesy in interrupting my learned discourse to call attention to a mere quadruped of the genus felis  as i was saying mr  heavens professor a lion cried mr philander straining his weak eyes toward the dim figure outlined against the dark tropical underbrush  yes yes mr philander if you insist upon employing slang in your discourse a lion  but as i was saying  bless me professor again interrupted mr philander permit me to suggest that doubtless the moors who were conquered in the fifteenth century will continue in that most regrettable condition for the time being at least even though we postpone discussion of that world calamity until we may attain the enchanting view of yon felis carnivora which distance proverbially is credited with lending  in the meantime the lion had approached with quiet dignity to within ten paces of the two men where he stood curiously watching them  the moonlight flooded the beach and the strange group stood out in bold relief against the yellow sand  most reprehensible most reprehensible exclaimed professor porter with a faint trace of irritation in his voice  never mr philander never before in my life have i known one of these animals to be permitted to roam at large from its cage  i shall most certainly report this outrageous breach of ethics to the directors of the adjacent zoological garden  quite right professor agreed mr philander and the sooner it is done the better  let us start now  seizing the professor by the arm mr philander set off in the direction that would put the greatest distance between themselves and the lion  they had proceeded but a short distance when a backward glance revealed to the horrified gaze of mr philander that the lion was following them  he tightened his grip upon the protesting professor and increased his speed  as i was saying mr philander repeated professor porter  mr philander took another hasty glance rearward  the lion also had quickened his gait and was doggedly maintaining an unvarying distance behind them  he is following us gasped mr philander breaking into a run  tut tut mr philander remonstrated the professor this unseemly haste is most unbecoming to men of letters  what will our friends think of us who may chance to be upon the street and witness our frivolous antics  pray let us proceed with more decorum  mr philander stole another observation astern  the lion was bounding along in easy leaps scarce five paces behind  mr philander dropped the professors arm and broke into a mad orgy of speed that would have done credit to any varsity track team  as i was saying mr philander screamed professor porter as metaphorically speaking he himself threw her into high  he too had caught a fleeting backward glimpse of cruel yellow eyes and half open mouth within startling proximity of his person  with streaming coat tails and shiny silk hat professor archimedes q porter fled through the moonlight close upon the heels of mr samuel t philander  before them a point of the jungle ran out toward a narrow promontory and it was for the heaven of the trees he saw there that mr samuel t philander directed his prodigious leaps and bounds while from the shadows of this same spot peered two keen eyes in interested appreciation of the race  it was tarzan of the apes who watched with face agrin this odd game of followtheleader  he knew the two men were safe enough from attack in so far as the lion was concerned  the very fact that numa had foregone such easy prey at all convinced the wise forest craft of tarzan that numas belly already was full  the lion might stalk them until hungry again but the chances were that if not angered he would soon tire of the sport and slink away to his jungle lair  really the one great danger was that one of the men might stumble and fall and then the yellow devil would be upon him in a moment and the joy of the kill would be too great a temptation to withstand  so tarzan swung quickly to a lower limb in line with the approaching fugitives and as mr samuel t philander came panting and blowing beneath him already too spent to struggle up to the safety of the limb tarzan reached down and grasping him by the collar of his coat yanked him to the limb by his side  another moment brought the professor within the sphere of the friendly grip and he too was drawn upward to safety just as the baffled numa with a roar leaped to recover his vanishing quarry  for a moment the two men clung panting to the great branch while tarzan squatted with his back to the stem of the tree watching them with mingled curiosity and amusement  it was the professor who first broke the silence  i am deeply pained mr philander that you should have evinced such a paucity of manly courage in the presence of one of the lower orders and by your crass timidity have caused me to exert myself to such an unaccustomed degree in order that i might resume my discourse  as i was saying mr philander when you interrupted me the moors  professor archimedes q porter broke in mr philander in icy tones the time has arrived when patience becomes a crime and mayhem appears garbed in the mantle of virtue  you have accused me of cowardice  you have insinuated that you ran only to overtake me not to escape the clutches of the lion  have a care professor archimedes q porter  i am a desperate man  goaded by longsuffering patience the worm will turn  tut tut mr philander tut tut cautioned professor porter you forget yourself  i forget nothing as yet professor archimedes q porter but believe me sir i am tottering on the verge of forgetfulness as to your exalted position in the world of science and your gray hairs  the professor sat in silence for a few minutes and the darkness hid the grim smile that wreathed his wrinkled countenance  presently he spoke  look here skinny philander he said in belligerent tones if you are lookin for a scrap peel off your coat and come on down on the ground and ill punch your head just as i did sixty years ago in the alley back of porky evans barn  ark gasped the astonished mr philander  lordy how good that sounds  when youre human ark i love you but somehow it seems as though you had forgotten how to be human for the last twenty years  the professor reached out a thin trembling old hand through the darkness until it found his old friends shoulder  forgive me skinny he said softly  it hasnt been quite twenty years and god alone knows how hard i have tried to be human for janes sake and yours too since he took my other jane away  another old hand stole up from mr philanders side to clasp the one that lay upon his shoulder and no other message could better have translated the one heart to the other  they did not speak for some minutes  the lion below them paced nervously back and forth  the third figure in the tree was hidden by the dense shadows near the stem  he too was silentmotionless as a graven image  you certainly pulled me up into this tree just in time said the professor at last  i want to thank you  you saved my life  but i didnt pull you up here professor said mr philander  bless me  the excitement of the moment quite caused me to forget that i myself was drawn up here by some outside agencythere must be someone or something in this tree with us  eh ejaculated professor porter  are you quite positive mr philander  most positive professor replied mr philander and he added i think we should thank the party  he may be sitting right next to you now professor  eh  whats that  tut tut mr philander tut tut said professor porter edging cautiously nearer to mr philander  just then it occurred to tarzan of the apes that numa had loitered beneath the tree for a sufficient length of time so he raised his young head toward the heavens and there rang out upon the terrified ears of the two old men the awful warning challenge of the anthropoid  the two friends huddled trembling in their precarious position on the limb saw the great lion halt in his restless pacing as the bloodcurdling cry smote his ears and then slink quickly into the jungle to be instantly lost to view  even the lion trembles in fear whispered mr philander  most remarkable most remarkable murmured professor porter clutching frantically at mr philander to regain the balance which the sudden fright had so perilously endangered  unfortunately for them both mr philanders center of equilibrium was at that very moment hanging upon the ragged edge of nothing so that it needed but the gentle impetus supplied by the additional weight of professor porters body to topple the devoted secretary from the limb  for a moment they swayed uncertainly and then with mingled and most unscholarly shrieks they pitched headlong from the tree locked in frenzied embrace  it was quite some moments ere either moved for both were positive that any such attempt would reveal so many breaks and fractures as to make further progress impossible  at length professor porter made an attempt to move one leg  to his surprise it responded to his will as in days gone by  he now drew up its mate and stretched it forth again  most remarkable most remarkable he murmured  thank god professor whispered mr philander fervently you are not dead then  tut tut mr philander tut tut cautioned professor porter i do not know with accuracy as yet  with infinite solicitude professor porter wiggled his right armjoy it was intact  breathlessly he waved his left arm above his prostrate bodyit waved  most remarkable most remarkable he said  to whom are you signaling professor asked mr philander in an excited tone  professor porter deigned to make no response to this puerile inquiry instead he raised his head gently from the ground nodding it back and forth a half dozen times  most remarkable he breathed  it remains intact  mr philander had not moved from where he had fallen he had not dared the attempt  how indeed could one move when ones arms and legs and back were broken  one eye was buried in the soft loam the other rolling sidewise was fixed in awe upon the strange gyrations of professor porter  how sad exclaimed mr philander half aloud  concussion of the brain superinducing total mental aberration  how very sad indeed and for one still so young  professor porter rolled over upon his stomach gingerly he bowed his back until he resembled a huge tom cat in proximity to a yelping dog then he sat up and felt of various portions of his anatomy  they are all here he exclaimed  most remarkable  whereupon he arose and bending a scathing glance upon the still prostrate form of mr samuel t philander he said  tut tut mr philander this is no time to indulge in slothful ease we must be up and doing  mr philander lifted his other eye out of the mud and gazed in speechless rage at professor porter  then he attempted to rise nor could there have been any more surprised than he when his efforts were immediately crowned with marked success  he was still bursting with rage however at the cruel injustice of professor porters insinuation and was on the point of rendering a tart rejoinder when his eyes fell upon a strange figure standing a few paces away scrutinizing them intently  professor porter had recovered his shiny silk hat which he had brushed carefully upon the sleeve of his coat and replaced upon his head  when he saw mr philander pointing to something behind him he turned to behold a giant naked but for a loin cloth and a few metal ornaments standing motionless before him  good evening sir said the professor lifting his hat  for reply the giant motioned them to follow him and set off up the beach in the direction from which they had recently come  i think it the better part of discretion to follow him said mr philander  tut tut mr philander returned the professor  a short time since you were advancing a most logical argument in substantiation of your theory that camp lay directly south of us  i was skeptical but you finally convinced me so now i am positive that toward the south we must travel to reach our friends  therefore i shall continue south  but professor porter this man may know better than either of us  he seems to be indigenous to this part of the world  let us at least follow him for a short distance  tut tut mr philander repeated the professor  i am a difficult man to convince but when once convinced my decision is unalterable  i shall continue in the proper direction if i have to circumambulate the continent of africa to reach my destination  further argument was interrupted by tarzan who seeing that these strange men were not following him had returned to their side  again he beckoned to them but still they stood in argument  presently the apeman lost patience with their stupid ignorance  he grasped the frightened mr philander by the shoulder and before that worthy gentleman knew whether he was being killed or merely maimed for life tarzan had tied one end of his rope securely about mr philanders neck  tut tut mr philander remonstrated professor porter it is most unbeseeming in you to submit to such indignities  but scarcely were the words out of his mouth ere he too had been seized and securely bound by the neck with the same rope  then tarzan set off toward the north leading the now thoroughly frightened professor and his secretary  in deathly silence they proceeded for what seemed hours to the two tired and hopeless old men but presently as they topped a little rise of ground they were overjoyed to see the cabin lying before them not a hundred yards distant  here tarzan released them and pointing toward the little building vanished into the jungle beside them  most remarkable most remarkable gasped the professor  but you see mr philander that i was quite right as usual and but for your stubborn willfulness we should have escaped a series of most humiliating not to say dangerous accidents  pray allow yourself to be guided by a more mature and practical mind hereafter when in need of wise counsel  mr samuel t philander was too much relieved at the happy outcome to their adventure to take umbrage at the professors cruel fling instead he grasped his friends arm and hastened him forward in the direction of the cabin  it was a muchrelieved party of castaways that found itself once more united  dawn discovered them still recounting their various adventures and speculating upon the identity of the strange guardian and protector they had found on this savage shore  esmeralda was positive that it was none other than an angel of the lord sent down especially to watch over them  had you seen him devour the raw meat of the lion esmeralda laughed clayton you would have thought him a very material angel  there was nothing heavenly about his voice said jane porter with a little shudder at recollection of the awful roar which had followed the killing of the lioness  nor did it precisely comport with my preconceived ideas of the dignity of divine messengers remarked professor porter when theahgentleman tied two highly respectable and erudite scholars neck to neck and dragged them through the jungle as though they had been cows     chapter xvii  burials   as it was now quite light the party none of whom had eaten or slept since the previous morning began to bestir themselves to prepare food  the mutineers of the arrow had landed a small supply of dried meats canned soups and vegetables crackers flour tea and coffee for the five they had marooned and these were hurriedly drawn upon to satisfy the craving of longfamished appetites  the next task was to make the cabin habitable and to this end it was decided to at once remove the gruesome relics of the tragedy which had taken place there on some bygone day  professor porter and mr philander were deeply interested in examining the skeletons  the two larger they stated had belonged to a male and female of one of the higher white races  the smallest skeleton was given but passing attention as its location in the crib left no doubt as to its having been the infant offspring of this unhappy couple  as they were preparing the skeleton of the man for burial clayton discovered a massive ring which had evidently encircled the mans finger at the time of his death for one of the slender bones of the hand still lay within the golden bauble  picking it up to examine it clayton gave a cry of astonishment for the ring bore the crest of the house of greystoke  at the same time jane discovered the books in the cupboard and on opening the flyleaf of one of them saw the name john clayton london in a second book which she hurriedly examined was the single name greystoke  why mr clayton she cried what does this mean  here are the names of some of your own people in these books  and here he replied gravely is the great ring of the house of greystoke which has been lost since my uncle john clayton the former lord greystoke disappeared presumably lost at sea  but how do you account for these things being here in this savage african jungle exclaimed the girl  there is but one way to account for it miss porter said clayton the late lord greystoke was not drowned  he died here in this cabin and this poor thing upon the floor is all that is mortal of him  then this must have been lady greystoke said jane reverently indicating the poor mass of bones upon the bed  the beautiful lady alice replied clayton of whose many virtues and remarkable personal charms i often have heard my mother and father speak  poor woman he murmured sadly  with deep reverence and solemnity the bodies of the late lord and lady greystoke were buried beside their little african cabin and between them was placed the tiny skeleton of the baby of kala the ape  as mr philander was placing the frail bones of the infant in a bit of sail cloth he examined the skull minutely  then he called professor porter to his side and the two argued in low tones for several minutes  most remarkable most remarkable said professor porter  bless me said mr philander we must acquaint mr clayton with our discovery at once  tut tut mr philander tut tut remonstrated professor archimedes q porter  let the dead past bury its dead  and so the whitehaired old man repeated the burial service over this strange grave while his four companions stood with bowed and uncovered heads about him  from the trees tarzan of the apes watched the solemn ceremony but most of all he watched the sweet face and graceful figure of jane porter  in his savage untutored breast new emotions were stirring  he could not fathom them  he wondered why he felt so great an interest in these peoplewhy he had gone to such pains to save the three men  but he did not wonder why he had torn sabor from the tender flesh of the strange girl  surely the men were stupid and ridiculous and cowardly  even manu the monkey was more intelligent than they  if these were creatures of his own kind he was doubtful if his past pride in blood was warranted  but the girl ahthat was a different matter  he did not reason here he knew that she was created to be protected and that he was created to protect her  he wondered why they had dug a great hole in the ground merely to bury dry bones  surely there was no sense in that no one wanted to steal dry bones  had there been meat upon them he could have understood for thus alone might one keep his meat from dango the hyena and the other robbers of the jungle  when the grave had been filled with earth the little party turned back toward the cabin and esmeralda still weeping copiously for the two she had never heard of before today and who had been dead twenty years chanced to glance toward the harbor  instantly her tears ceased  look at them low down white trash out there she shrilled pointing toward the arrow  theyalls a desecrating us right here on this here perverted island  and sure enough the arrow was being worked toward the open sea slowly through the harbors entrance  they promised to leave us firearms and ammunition said clayton the merciless beasts  it is the work of that fellow they call snipes i am sure said jane king was a scoundrel but he had a little sense of humanity  if they had not killed him i know that he would have seen that we were properly provided for before they left us to our fate  i regret that they did not visit us before sailing said professor porter  i had proposed requesting them to leave the treasure with us as i shall be a ruined man if that is lost  jane looked at her father sadly  never mind dear she said  it wouldnt have done any good because it is solely for the treasure that they killed their officers and landed us upon this awful shore  tut tut child tut tut replied professor porter  you are a good child but inexperienced in practical matters and professor porter turned and walked slowly away toward the jungle his hands clasped beneath his long coat tails and his eyes bent upon the ground  his daughter watched him with a pathetic smile upon her lips and then turning to mr philander she whispered  please dont let him wander off again as he did yesterday  we depend upon you you know to keep a close watch upon him  he becomes more difficult to handle each day replied mr philander with a sigh and a shake of his head  i presume he is now off to report to the directors of the zoo that one of their lions was at large last night  oh miss jane you dont know what i have to contend with  yes i do mr philander but while we all love him you alone are best fitted to manage him for regardless of what he may say to you he respects your great learning and therefore has immense confidence in your judgment  the poor dear cannot differentiate between erudition and wisdom  mr philander with a mildly puzzled expression on his face turned to pursue professor porter and in his mind he was revolving the question of whether he should feel complimented or aggrieved at miss porters rather backhanded compliment  tarzan had seen the consternation depicted upon the faces of the little group as they witnessed the departure of the arrow so as the ship was a wonderful novelty to him in addition he determined to hasten out to the point of land at the north of the harbors mouth and obtain a nearer view of the boat as well as to learn if possible the direction of its flight  swinging through the trees with great speed he reached the point only a moment after the ship had passed out of the harbor so that he obtained an excellent view of the wonders of this strange floating house  there were some twenty men running hither and thither about the deck pulling and hauling on ropes  a light land breeze was blowing and the ship had been worked through the harbors mouth under scant sail but now that they had cleared the point every available shred of canvas was being spread that she might stand out to sea as handily as possible  tarzan watched the graceful movements of the ship in rapt admiration and longed to be aboard her  presently his keen eyes caught the faintest suspicion of smoke on the far northern horizon and he wondered over the cause of such a thing out on the great water  about the same time the lookout on the arrow must have discerned it for in a few minutes tarzan saw the sails being shifted and shortened the ship came about and presently he knew that she was beating back toward land  a man at the bows was constantly heaving into the sea a rope to the end of which a small object was fastened  tarzan wondered what the purpose of this action might be  at last the ship came up directly into the wind the anchor was lowered down came the sails  there was great scurrying about on deck  a boat was lowered and in it a great chest was placed  then a dozen sailors bent to the oars and pulled rapidly toward the point where tarzan crouched in the branches of a tree  in the stern of the boat as it drew nearer tarzan saw the ratfaced man  it was but a few minutes later that the boat touched the beach  the men jumped out and lifted the great chest to the sand  they were on the north side of the point so that their presence was concealed from those at the cabin  the men argued angrily for a moment  then the ratfaced one with several companions ascended the low bluff on which stood the tree that concealed tarzan  they looked about for several minutes  here is a good place said the ratfaced sailor indicating a spot beneath tarzans tree  it is as good as any replied one of his companions  if they catch us with the treasure aboard it will all be confiscated anyway  we might as well bury it here on the chance that some of us will escape the gallows to come back and enjoy it later  the ratfaced one now called to the men who had remained at the boat and they came slowly up the bank carrying picks and shovels  hurry you cried snipes  stow it retorted one of the men in a surly tone  youre no admiral you damned shrimp  im capn here though ill have you to understand you swab shrieked snipes with a volley of frightful oaths  steady boys cautioned one of the men who had not spoken before it aint goin to get us nothing by fightin amongst ourselves  right enough replied the sailor who had resented snipes autocratic tones but it aint agoin to get nobody nothin to put on airs in this bloomin company neither  you fellows dig here said snipes indicating a spot beneath the tree  and while youre diggin peter kin be amakin of a map of the location sos we kin find it again  you tom and bill take a couple more down and fetch up the chest  wot are you agoin to do asked he of the previous altercation just boss  git busy there growled snipes  you didnt think your capn was agoin to dig with a shovel did you  the men all looked up angrily  none of them liked snipes and this disagreeable show of authority since he had murdered king the real head and ringleader of the mutineers had only added fuel to the flames of their hatred  do you mean to say that you dont intend to take a shovel and lend a hand with this work  your shoulders not hurt so allfired bad as that said tarrant the sailor who had before spoken  not by a damned sight replied snipes fingering the butt of his revolver nervously  then by god replied tarrant if you wont take a shovel youll take a pickax  with the words he raised his pick above his head and with a mighty blow he buried the point in snipes brain  for a moment the men stood silently looking at the result of their fellows grim humor  then one of them spoke  served the skunk jolly well right he said  one of the others commenced to ply his pick to the ground  the soil was soft and he threw aside the pick and grasped a shovel then the others joined him  there was no further comment on the killing but the men worked in a better frame of mind than they had since snipes had assumed command  when they had a trench of ample size to bury the chest tarrant suggested that they enlarge it and inter snipes body on top of the chest  it might elp fool any as appened to be diggin ereabouts he explained  the others saw the cunning of the suggestion and so the trench was lengthened to accommodate the corpse and in the center a deeper hole was excavated for the box which was first wrapped in sailcloth and then lowered to its place which brought its top about a foot below the bottom of the grave  earth was shovelled in and tramped down about the chest until the bottom of the grave showed level and uniform  two of the men rolled the ratfaced corpse unceremoniously into the grave after first stripping it of its weapons and various other articles which the several members of the party coveted for their own  they then filled the grave with earth and tramped upon it until it would hold no more  the balance of the loose earth was thrown far and wide and a mass of dead undergrowth spread in as natural a manner as possible over the newmade grave to obliterate all signs of the ground having been disturbed  their work done the sailors returned to the small boat and pulled off rapidly toward the arrow  the breeze had increased considerably and as the smoke upon the horizon was now plainly discernible in considerable volume the mutineers lost no time in getting under full sail and bearing away toward the southwest  tarzan an interested spectator of all that had taken place sat speculating on the strange actions of these peculiar creatures  men were indeed more foolish and more cruel than the beasts of the jungle  how fortunate was he who lived in the peace and security of the great forest  tarzan wondered what the chest they had buried contained  if they did not want it why did they not merely throw it into the water  that would have been much easier  ah he thought but they do want it  they have hidden it here because they intend returning for it later  tarzan dropped to the ground and commenced to examine the earth about the excavation  he was looking to see if these creatures had dropped anything which he might like to own  soon he discovered a spade hidden by the underbrush which they had laid upon the grave  he seized it and attempted to use it as he had seen the sailors do  it was awkward work and hurt his bare feet but he persevered until he had partially uncovered the body  this he dragged from the grave and laid to one side  then he continued digging until he had unearthed the chest  this also he dragged to the side of the corpse  then he filled in the smaller hole below the grave replaced the body and the earth around and above it covered it over with underbrush and returned to the chest  four sailors had sweated beneath the burden of its weighttarzan of the apes picked it up as though it had been an empty packing case and with the spade slung to his back by a piece of rope carried it off into the densest part of the jungle  he could not well negotiate the trees with his awkward burden but he kept to the trails and so made fairly good time  for several hours he traveled a little north of east until he came to an impenetrable wall of matted and tangled vegetation  then he took to the lower branches and in another fifteen minutes he emerged into the amphitheater of the apes where they met in council or to celebrate the rites of the dumdum  near the center of the clearing and not far from the drum or altar he commenced to dig  this was harder work than turning up the freshly excavated earth at the grave but tarzan of the apes was persevering and so he kept at his labor until he was rewarded by seeing a hole sufficiently deep to receive the chest and effectually hide it from view  why had he gone to all this labor without knowing the value of the contents of the chest  tarzan of the apes had a mans figure and a mans brain but he was an ape by training and environment  his brain told him that the chest contained something valuable or the men would not have hidden it  his training had taught him to imitate whatever was new and unusual and now the natural curiosity which is as common to men as to apes prompted him to open the chest and examine its contents  but the heavy lock and massive iron bands baffled both his cunning and his immense strength so that he was compelled to bury the chest without having his curiosity satisfied  by the time tarzan had hunted his way back to the vicinity of the cabin feeding as he went it was quite dark  within the little building a light was burning for clayton had found an unopened tin of oil which had stood intact for twenty years a part of the supplies left with the claytons by black michael  the lamps also were still useable and thus the interior of the cabin appeared as bright as day to the astonished tarzan  he had often wondered at the exact purpose of the lamps  his reading and the pictures had told him what they were but he had no idea of how they could be made to produce the wondrous sunlight that some of his pictures had portrayed them as diffusing upon all surrounding objects  as he approached the window nearest the door he saw that the cabin had been divided into two rooms by a rough partition of boughs and sailcloth  in the front room were the three men the two older deep in argument while the younger tilted back against the wall on an improvised stool was deeply engrossed in reading one of tarzans books  tarzan was not particularly interested in the men however so he sought the other window  there was the girl  how beautiful her features  how delicate her snowy skin  she was writing at tarzans own table beneath the window  upon a pile of grasses at the far side of the room lay the negress asleep  for an hour tarzan feasted his eyes upon her while she wrote  how he longed to speak to her but he dared not attempt it for he was convinced that like the young man she would not understand him and he feared too that he might frighten her away  at length she arose leaving her manuscript upon the table  she went to the bed upon which had been spread several layers of soft grasses these she rearranged  then she loosened the soft mass of golden hair which crowned her head like a shimmering waterfall turned to burnished metal by a dying sun it fell about her oval face in waving lines below her waist it tumbled  tarzan was spellbound  then she extinguished the lamp and all within the cabin was wrapped in cimmerian darkness  still tarzan watched  creeping close beneath the window he waited listening for half an hour  at last he was rewarded by the sounds of the regular breathing within which denotes sleep  cautiously he intruded his hand between the meshes of the lattice until his whole arm was within the cabin  carefully he felt upon the desk at last he grasped the manuscript upon which jane porter had been writing and as cautiously withdrew his arm and hand holding the precious treasure  tarzan folded the sheets into a small parcel which he tucked into the quiver with his arrows  then he melted away into the jungle as softly and as noiselessly as a shadow     chapter xviii  the jungle toll   early the following morning tarzan awoke and his first thought of the new day as the last of yesterday was of the wonderful writing which lay hidden in his quiver  hurriedly he brought it forth hoping against hope that he could read what the beautiful white girl had written there the preceding evening  at the first glance he suffered a bitter disappointment never before had he so yearned for anything as now he did for the ability to interpret a message from that goldenhaired divinity who had come so suddenly and so unexpectedly into his life  what did it matter if the message were not intended for him  it was an expression of her thoughts and that was sufficient for tarzan of the apes  and now to be baffled by strange uncouth characters the like of which he had never seen before  why they even tipped in the opposite direction from all that he had ever examined either in printed books or the difficult script of the few letters he had found  even the little bugs of the black book were familiar friends though their arrangement meant nothing to him but these bugs were new and unheard of  for twenty minutes he pored over them when suddenly they commenced to take familiar though distorted shapes  ah they were his old friends but badly crippled  then he began to make out a word here and a word there  his heart leaped for joy  he could read it and he would  in another half hour he was progressing rapidly and but for an exceptional word now and again he found it very plain sailing  here is what he read  west coast of africa about 10 degrees south       latitude  so mr clayton says                   february 3  1909  dearest hazel  it seems foolish to write you a letter that you may never see but i simply must tell somebody of our awful experiences since we sailed from europe on the illfated arrow  if we never return to civilization as now seems only too likely this will at least prove a brief record of the events which led up to our final fate whatever it may be  as you know we were supposed to have set out upon a scientific expedition to the congo  papa was presumed to entertain some wondrous theory of an unthinkably ancient civilization the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the congo valley  but after we were well under sail the truth came out  it seems that an old bookworm who has a book and curio shop in baltimore discovered between the leaves of a very old spanish manuscript a letter written in 1550 detailing the adventures of a crew of mutineers of a spanish galleon bound from spain to south america with a vast treasure of doubloons and pieces of eight i suppose for they certainly sound weird and piraty  the writer had been one of the crew and the letter was to his son who was at the very time the letter was written master of a spanish merchantman  many years had elapsed since the events the letter narrated had transpired and the old man had become a respected citizen of an obscure spanish town but the love of gold was still so strong upon him that he risked all to acquaint his son with the means of attaining fabulous wealth for them both  the writer told how when but a week out from spain the crew had mutinied and murdered every officer and man who opposed them but they defeated their own ends by this very act for there was none left competent to navigate a ship at sea  they were blown hither and thither for two months until sick and dying of scurvy starvation and thirst they had been wrecked on a small islet  the galleon was washed high upon the beach where she went to pieces but not before the survivors who numbered but ten souls had rescued one of the great chests of treasure  this they buried well up on the island and for three years they lived there in constant hope of being rescued  one by one they sickened and died until only one man was left the writer of the letter  the men had built a boat from the wreckage of the galleon but having no idea where the island was located they had not dared to put to sea  when all were dead except himself however the awful loneliness so weighed upon the mind of the sole survivor that he could endure it no longer and choosing to risk death upon the open sea rather than madness on the lonely isle he set sail in his little boat after nearly a year of solitude  fortunately he sailed due north and within a week was in the track of the spanish merchantmen plying between the west indies and spain and was picked up by one of these vessels homeward bound  the story he told was merely one of shipwreck in which all but a few had perished the balance except himself dying after they reached the island  he did not mention the mutiny or the chest of buried treasure  the master of the merchantman assured him that from the position at which they had picked him up and the prevailing winds for the past week he could have been on no other island than one of the cape verde group which lie off the west coast of africa in about 16 degrees or 17 degrees north latitude  his letter described the island minutely as well as the location of the treasure and was accompanied by the crudest funniest little old map you ever saw with trees and rocks all marked by scrawly xs to show the exact spot where the treasure had been buried  when papa explained the real nature of the expedition my heart sank for i know so well how visionary and impractical the poor dear has always been that i feared that he had again been duped especially when he told me he had paid a thousand dollars for the letter and map  to add to my distress i learned that he had borrowed ten thousand dollars more from robert canler and had given his notes for the amount  mr canler had asked for no security and you know dearie what that will mean for me if papa cannot meet them  oh how i detest that man  we all tried to look on the bright side of things but mr philander and mr claytonhe joined us in london just for the adventureboth felt as skeptical as i  well to make a long story short we found the island and the treasurea great ironbound oak chest wrapped in many layers of oiled sailcloth and as strong and firm as when it had been buried nearly two hundred years ago  it was simply filled with gold coin and was so heavy that four men bent underneath its weight  the horrid thing seems to bring nothing but murder and misfortune to those who have anything to do with it for three days after we sailed from the cape verde islands our own crew mutinied and killed every one of their officers  oh it was the most terrifying experience one could imaginei cannot even write of it  they were going to kill us too but one of them the leader named king would not let them and so they sailed south along the coast to a lonely spot where they found a good harbor and here they landed and have left us  they sailed away with the treasure today but mr clayton says they will meet with a fate similar to the mutineers of the ancient galleon because king the only man aboard who knew aught of navigation was murdered on the beach by one of the men the day we landed  i wish you could know mr clayton he is the dearest fellow imaginable and unless i am mistaken he has fallen very much in love with me  he is the only son of lord greystoke and some day will inherit the title and estates  in addition he is wealthy in his own right but the fact that he is going to be an english lord makes me very sadyou know what my sentiments have always been relative to american girls who married titled foreigners  oh if he were only a plain american gentleman  but it isnt his fault poor fellow and in everything except birth he would do credit to my country and that is the greatest compliment i know how to pay any man  we have had the most weird experiences since we were landed here  papa and mr philander lost in the jungle and chased by a real lion  mr clayton lost and attacked twice by wild beasts  esmeralda and i cornered in an old cabin by a perfectly awful maneating lioness  oh it was simply terrifical as esmeralda would say  but the strangest part of it all is the wonderful creature who rescued us  i have not seen him but mr clayton and papa and mr philander have and they say that he is a perfectly godlike white man tanned to a dusky brown with the strength of a wild elephant the agility of a monkey and the bravery of a lion  he speaks no english and vanishes as quickly and as mysteriously after he has performed some valorous deed as though he were a disembodied spirit  then we have another weird neighbor who printed a beautiful sign in english and tacked it on the door of his cabin which we have preempted warning us to destroy none of his belongings and signing himself tarzan of the apes  we have never seen him though we think he is about for one of the sailors who was going to shoot mr clayton in the back received a spear in his shoulder from some unseen hand in the jungle  the sailors left us but a meager supply of food so as we have only a single revolver with but three cartridges left in it we do not know how we can procure meat though mr philander says that we can exist indefinitely on the wild fruit and nuts which abound in the jungle  i am very tired now so i shall go to my funny bed of grasses which mr clayton gathered for me but will add to this from day to day as things happen                               lovingly                                   jane porter  to hazel strong baltimore md   tarzan sat in a brown study for a long time after he finished reading the letter  it was filled with so many new and wonderful things that his brain was in a whirl as he attempted to digest them all  so they did not know that he was tarzan of the apes  he would tell them  in his tree he had constructed a rude shelter of leaves and boughs beneath which protected from the rain he had placed the few treasures brought from the cabin  among these were some pencils  he took one and beneath jane porters signature he wrote        i am tarzan of the apes   he thought that would be sufficient  later he would return the letter to the cabin  in the matter of food thought tarzan they had no need to worryhe would provide and he did  the next morning jane found her missing letter in the exact spot from which it had disappeared two nights before  she was mystified but when she saw the printed words beneath her signature she felt a cold clammy chill run up her spine  she showed the letter or rather the last sheet with the signature to clayton  and to think she said that uncanny thing was probably watching me all the time that i was writingoo  it makes me shudder just to think of it  but he must be friendly reassured clayton for he has returned your letter nor did he offer to harm you and unless i am mistaken he left a very substantial memento of his friendship outside the cabin door last night for i just found the carcass of a wild boar there as i came out  from then on scarcely a day passed that did not bring its offering of game or other food  sometimes it was a young deer again a quantity of strange cooked foodcassava cakes pilfered from the village of mbongaor a boar or leopard and once a lion  tarzan derived the greatest pleasure of his life in hunting meat for these strangers  it seemed to him that no pleasure on earth could compare with laboring for the welfare and protection of the beautiful white girl  some day he would venture into the camp in daylight and talk with these people through the medium of the little bugs which were familiar to them and to tarzan  but he found it difficult to overcome the timidity of the wild thing of the forest and so day followed day without seeing a fulfillment of his good intentions  the party in the camp emboldened by familiarity wandered farther and yet farther into the jungle in search of nuts and fruit  scarcely a day passed that did not find professor porter straying in his preoccupied indifference toward the jaws of death  mr samuel t philander never what one might call robust was worn to the shadow of a shadow through the ceaseless worry and mental distraction resultant from his herculean efforts to safeguard the professor  a month passed  tarzan had finally determined to visit the camp by daylight  it was early afternoon  clayton had wandered to the point at the harbors mouth to look for passing vessels  here he kept a great mass of wood high piled ready to be ignited as a signal should a steamer or a sail top the far horizon  professor porter was wandering along the beach south of the camp with mr philander at his elbow urging him to turn his steps back before the two became again the sport of some savage beast  the others gone jane and esmeralda had wandered into the jungle to gather fruit and in their search were led farther and farther from the cabin  tarzan waited in silence before the door of the little house until they should return  his thoughts were of the beautiful white girl  they were always of her now  he wondered if she would fear him and the thought all but caused him to relinquish his plan  he was rapidly becoming impatient for her return that he might feast his eyes upon her and be near her perhaps touch her  the apeman knew no god but he was as near to worshipping his divinity as mortal man ever comes to worship  while he waited he passed the time printing a message to her whether he intended giving it to her he himself could not have told but he took infinite pleasure in seeing his thoughts expressed in printin which he was not so uncivilized after all  he wrote   i am tarzan of the apes  i want you  i am yours  you are mine  we live here together always in my house  i will bring you the best of fruits the tenderest deer the finest meats that roam the jungle  i will hunt for you  i am the greatest of the jungle fighters  i will fight for you  i am the mightiest of the jungle fighters  you are jane porter i saw it in your letter  when you see this you will know that it is for you and that tarzan of the apes loves you   as he stood straight as a young indian by the door waiting after he had finished the message there came to his keen ears a familiar sound it was the passing of a great ape through the lower branches of the forest  for an instant he listened intently and then from the jungle came the agonized scream of a woman and tarzan of the apes dropping his first love letter upon the ground shot like a panther into the forest  clayton also heard the scream and professor porter and mr philander and in a few minutes they came panting to the cabin calling out to each other a volley of excited questions as they approached  a glance within confirmed their worst fears  jane and esmeralda were not there  instantly clayton followed by the two old men plunged into the jungle calling the girls name aloud  for half an hour they stumbled on until clayton by merest chance came upon the prostrate form of esmeralda  he stopped beside her feeling for her pulse and then listening for her heartbeats  she lived  he shook her  esmeralda he shrieked in her ear  esmeralda  for gods sake where is miss porter  what has happened  esmeralda  slowly esmeralda opened her eyes  she saw clayton  she saw the jungle about her  oh gaberelle she screamed and fainted again  by this time professor porter and mr philander had come up  what shall we do mr clayton asked the old professor  where shall we look  god could not have been so cruel as to take my little girl away from me now  we must arouse esmeralda first replied clayton  she can tell us what has happened  esmeralda he cried again shaking the black woman roughly by the shoulder  o gaberelle i want to die cried the poor woman but with eyes fast closed  let me die dear lord dont let me see that awful face again  come come esmeralda cried clayton  the lord isnt here its mr clayton  open your eyes  esmeralda did as she was bade  o gaberelle  thank the lord she said  wheres miss porter  what happened questioned clayton  aint miss jane here cried esmeralda sitting up with wonderful celerity for one of her bulk  oh lord now i remember  it must have took her away and the negress commenced to sob and wail her lamentations  what took her away cried professor porter  a great big giant all covered with hair  a gorilla esmeralda questioned mr philander and the three men scarcely breathed as he voiced the horrible thought  i thought it was the devil but i guess it must have been one of them gorilephants  oh my poor baby my poor little honey and again esmeralda broke into uncontrollable sobbing  clayton immediately began to look about for tracks but he could find nothing save a confusion of trampled grasses in the close vicinity and his woodcraft was too meager for the translation of what he did see  all the balance of the day they sought through the jungle but as night drew on they were forced to give up in despair and hopelessness for they did not even know in what direction the thing had borne jane  it was long after dark ere they reached the cabin and a sad and griefstricken party it was that sat silently within the little structure  professor porter finally broke the silence  his tones were no longer those of the erudite pedant theorizing upon the abstract and the unknowable but those of the man of actiondetermined but tinged also by a note of indescribable hopelessness and grief which wrung an answering pang from claytons heart  i shall lie down now said the old man and try to sleep  early tomorrow as soon as it is light i shall take what food i can carry and continue the search until i have found jane  i will not return without her  his companions did not reply at once  each was immersed in his own sorrowful thoughts and each knew as did the old professor what the last words meantprofessor porter would never return from the jungle  at length clayton arose and laid his hand gently upon professor porters bent old shoulder  i shall go with you of course he said  i knew that you would offerthat you would wish to go mr clayton but you must not  jane is beyond human assistance now  what was once my dear little girl shall not lie alone and friendless in the awful jungle  the same vines and leaves will cover us the same rains beat upon us and when the spirit of her mother is abroad it will find us together in death as it has always found us in life  no it is i alone who may go for she was my daughterall that was left on earth for me to love  i shall go with you said clayton simply  the old man looked up regarding the strong handsome face of william cecil clayton intently  perhaps he read there the love that lay in the heart beneaththe love for his daughter  he had been too preoccupied with his own scholarly thoughts in the past to consider the little occurrences the chance words which would have indicated to a more practical man that these young people were being drawn more and more closely to one another  now they came back to him one by one  as you wish he said  you may count on me also said mr philander  no my dear old friend said professor porter  we may not all go it would be cruelly wicked to leave poor esmeralda here alone and three of us would be no more successful than one  there be enough dead things in the cruel forest as it is  comelet us try to sleep a little     chapter xix  the call of the primitive   from the time tarzan left the tribe of great anthropoids in which he had been raised it was torn by continual strife and discord  terkoz proved a cruel and capricious king so that one by one many of the older and weaker apes upon whom he was particularly prone to vent his brutish nature took their families and sought the quiet and safety of the far interior  but at last those who remained were driven to desperation by the continued truculence of terkoz and it so happened that one of them recalled the parting admonition of tarzan  if you have a chief who is cruel do not do as the other apes do and attempt any one of you to pit yourself against him alone  but instead let two or three or four of you attack him together  then if you will do this no chief will dare to be other than he should be for four of you can kill any chief who may ever be over you  and the ape who recalled this wise counsel repeated it to several of his fellows so that when terkoz returned to the tribe that day he found a warm reception awaiting him  there were no formalities  as terkoz reached the group five huge hairy beasts sprang upon him  at heart he was an arrant coward which is the way with bullies among apes as well as among men so he did not remain to fight and die but tore himself away from them as quickly as he could and fled into the sheltering boughs of the forest  two more attempts he made to rejoin the tribe but on each occasion he was set upon and driven away  at last he gave it up and turned foaming with rage and hatred into the jungle  for several days he wandered aimlessly nursing his spite and looking for some weak thing on which to vent his pent anger  it was in this state of mind that the horrible manlike beast swinging from tree to tree came suddenly upon two women in the jungle  he was right above them when he discovered them  the first intimation jane porter had of his presence was when the great hairy body dropped to the earth beside her and she saw the awful face and the snarling hideous mouth thrust within a foot of her  one piercing scream escaped her lips as the brute hand clutched her arm  then she was dragged toward those awful fangs which yawned at her throat  but ere they touched that fair skin another mood claimed the anthropoid  the tribe had kept his women  he must find others to replace them this hairless white ape would be the first of his new household and so he threw her roughly across his broad hairy shoulders and leaped back into the trees bearing jane away  esmeraldas scream of terror had mingled once with that of jane and then as was esmeraldas manner under stress of emergency which required presence of mind she swooned  but jane did not once lose consciousness  it is true that that awful face pressing close to hers and the stench of the foul breath beating upon her nostrils paralyzed her with terror but her brain was clear and she comprehended all that transpired  with what seemed to her marvelous rapidity the brute bore her through the forest but still she did not cry out or struggle  the sudden advent of the ape had confused her to such an extent that she thought now that he was bearing her toward the beach  for this reason she conserved her energies and her voice until she could see that they had approached near enough to the camp to attract the succor she craved  she could not have known it but she was being borne farther and farther into the impenetrable jungle  the scream that had brought clayton and the two older men stumbling through the undergrowth had led tarzan of the apes straight to where esmeralda lay but it was not esmeralda in whom his interest centered though pausing over her he saw that she was unhurt  for a moment he scrutinized the ground below and the trees above until the ape that was in him by virtue of training and environment combined with the intelligence that was his by right of birth told his wondrous woodcraft the whole story as plainly as though he had seen the thing happen with his own eyes  and then he was gone again into the swaying trees following the highflung spoor which no other human eye could have detected much less translated  at boughs ends where the anthropoid swings from one tree to another there is most to mark the trail but least to point the direction of the quarry for there the pressure is downward always toward the small end of the branch whether the ape be leaving or entering a tree nearer the center of the tree where the signs of passage are fainter the direction is plainly marked  here on this branch a caterpillar has been crushed by the fugitives great foot and tarzan knows instinctively where that same foot would touch in the next stride  here he looks to find a tiny particle of the demolished larva ofttimes not more than a speck of moisture  again a minute bit of bark has been upturned by the scraping hand and the direction of the break indicates the direction of the passage  or some great limb or the stem of the tree itself has been brushed by the hairy body and a tiny shred of hair tells him by the direction from which it is wedged beneath the bark that he is on the right trail  nor does he need to check his speed to catch these seemingly faint records of the fleeing beast  to tarzan they stand out boldly against all the myriad other scars and bruises and signs upon the leafy way  but strongest of all is the scent for tarzan is pursuing up the wind and his trained nostrils are as sensitive as a hounds  there are those who believe that the lower orders are specially endowed by nature with better olfactory nerves than man but it is merely a matter of development  mans survival does not hinge so greatly upon the perfection of his senses  his power to reason has relieved them of many of their duties and so they have to some extent atrophied as have the muscles which move the ears and scalp merely from disuse  the muscles are there about the ears and beneath the scalp and so are the nerves which transmit sensations to the brain but they are underdeveloped because they are not needed  not so with tarzan of the apes  from early infancy his survival had depended upon acuteness of eyesight hearing smell touch and taste far more than upon the more slowly developed organ of reason  the least developed of all in tarzan was the sense of taste for he could eat luscious fruits or raw flesh long buried with almost equal appreciation but in that he differed but slightly from more civilized epicures  almost silently the apeman sped on in the track of terkoz and his prey but the sound of his approach reached the ears of the fleeing beast and spurred it on to greater speed  three miles were covered before tarzan overtook them and then terkoz seeing that further flight was futile dropped to the ground in a small open glade that he might turn and fight for his prize or be free to escape unhampered if he saw that the pursuer was more than a match for him  he still grasped jane in one great arm as tarzan bounded like a leopard into the arena which nature had provided for this primevallike battle  when terkoz saw that it was tarzan who pursued him he jumped to the conclusion that this was tarzans woman since they were of the same kindwhite and hairlessand so he rejoiced at this opportunity for double revenge upon his hated enemy  to jane the strange apparition of this godlike man was as wine to sick nerves  from the description which clayton and her father and mr philander had given her she knew that it must be the same wonderful creature who had saved them and she saw in him only a protector and a friend  but as terkoz pushed her roughly aside to meet tarzans charge and she saw the great proportions of the ape and the mighty muscles and the fierce fangs her heart quailed  how could any vanquish such a mighty antagonist  like two charging bulls they came together and like two wolves sought each others throat  against the long canines of the ape was pitted the thin blade of the mans knife  janeher lithe young form flattened against the trunk of a great tree her hands tight pressed against her rising and falling bosom and her eyes wide with mingled horror fascination fear and admirationwatched the primordial ape battle with the primeval man for possession of a womanfor her  as the great muscles of the mans back and shoulders knotted beneath the tension of his efforts and the huge biceps and forearm held at bay those mighty tusks the veil of centuries of civilization and culture was swept from the blurred vision of the baltimore girl  when the long knife drank deep a dozen times of terkoz hearts blood and the great carcass rolled lifeless upon the ground it was a primeval woman who sprang forward with outstretched arms toward the primeval man who had fought for her and won her  and tarzan  he did what no redblooded man needs lessons in doing  he took his woman in his arms and smothered her upturned panting lips with kisses  for a moment jane lay there with halfclosed eyes  for a momentthe first in her young lifeshe knew the meaning of love  but as suddenly as the veil had been withdrawn it dropped again and an outraged conscience suffused her face with its scarlet mantle and a mortified woman thrust tarzan of the apes from her and buried her face in her hands  tarzan had been surprised when he had found the girl he had learned to love after a vague and abstract manner a willing prisoner in his arms now he was surprised that she repulsed him  he came close to her once more and took hold of her arm  she turned upon him like a tigress striking his great breast with her tiny hands  tarzan could not understand it  a moment ago and it had been his intention to hasten jane back to her people but that little moment was lost now in the dim and distant past of things which were but can never be again and with it the good intentions had gone to join the impossible  since then tarzan of the apes had felt a warm lithe form close pressed to his  hot sweet breath against his cheek and mouth had fanned a new flame to life within his breast and perfect lips had clung to his in burning kisses that had seared a deep brand into his soula brand which marked a new tarzan  again he laid his hand upon her arm  again she repulsed him  and then tarzan of the apes did just what his first ancestor would have done  he took his woman in his arms and carried her into the jungle   early the following morning the four within the little cabin by the beach were awakened by the booming of a cannon  clayton was the first to rush out and there beyond the harbors mouth he saw two vessels lying at anchor  one was the arrow and the other a small french cruiser  the sides of the latter were crowded with men gazing shoreward and it was evident to clayton as to the others who had now joined him that the gun which they had heard had been fired to attract their attention if they still remained at the cabin  both vessels lay at a considerable distance from shore and it was doubtful if their glasses would locate the waving hats of the little party far in between the harbors points  esmeralda had removed her red apron and was waving it frantically above her head but clayton still fearing that even this might not be seen hurried off toward the northern point where lay his signal pyre ready for the match  it seemed an age to him as to those who waited breathlessly behind ere he reached the great pile of dry branches and underbrush  as he broke from the dense wood and came in sight of the vessels again he was filled with consternation to see that the arrow was making sail and that the cruiser was already under way  quickly lighting the pyre in a dozen places he hurried to the extreme point of the promontory where he stripped off his shirt and tying it to a fallen branch stood waving it back and forth above him  but still the vessels continued to stand out and he had given up all hope when the great column of smoke rising above the forest in one dense vertical shaft attracted the attention of a lookout aboard the cruiser and instantly a dozen glasses were leveled on the beach  presently clayton saw the two ships come about again and while the arrow lay drifting quietly on the ocean the cruiser steamed slowly back toward shore  at some distance away she stopped and a boat was lowered and dispatched toward the beach  as it was drawn up a young officer stepped out  monsieur clayton i presume he asked  thank god you have come was claytons reply  and it may be that it is not too late even now  what do you mean monsieur asked the officer  clayton told of the abduction of jane porter and the need of armed men to aid in the search for her  mon dieu exclaimed the officer sadly  yesterday and it would not have been too late  today and it may be better that the poor lady were never found  it is horrible monsieur  it is too horrible  other boats had now put off from the cruiser and clayton having pointed out the harbors entrance to the officer entered the boat with him and its nose was turned toward the little landlocked bay into which the other craft followed  soon the entire party had landed where stood professor porter mr philander and the weeping esmeralda  among the officers in the last boats to put off from the cruiser was the commander of the vessel and when he had heard the story of janes abduction he generously called for volunteers to accompany professor porter and clayton in their search  not an officer or a man was there of those brave and sympathetic frenchmen who did not quickly beg leave to be one of the expedition  the commander selected twenty men and two officers lieutenant darnot and lieutenant charpentier  a boat was dispatched to the cruiser for provisions ammunition and carbines the men were already armed with revolvers  then to claytons inquiries as to how they had happened to anchor off shore and fire a signal gun the commander captain dufranne explained that a month before they had sighted the arrow bearing southwest under considerable canvas and that when they had signaled her to come about she had but crowded on more sail  they had kept her hullup until sunset firing several shots after her but the next morning she was nowhere to be seen  they had then continued to cruise up and down the coast for several weeks and had about forgotten the incident of the recent chase when early one morning a few days before the lookout had described a vessel laboring in the trough of a heavy sea and evidently entirely out of control  as they steamed nearer to the derelict they were surprised to note that it was the same vessel that had run from them a few weeks earlier  her forestaysail and mizzen spanker were set as though an effort had been made to hold her head up into the wind but the sheets had parted and the sails were tearing to ribbons in the half gale of wind  in the high sea that was running it was a difficult and dangerous task to attempt to put a prize crew aboard her and as no signs of life had been seen above deck it was decided to stand by until the wind and sea abated but just then a figure was seen clinging to the rail and feebly waving a mute signal of despair toward them  immediately a boats crew was ordered out and an attempt was successfully made to board the arrow  the sight that met the frenchmens eyes as they clambered over the ships side was appalling  a dozen dead and dying men rolled hither and thither upon the pitching deck the living intermingled with the dead  two of the corpses appeared to have been partially devoured as though by wolves  the prize crew soon had the vessel under proper sail once more and the living members of the illstarred company carried below to their hammocks  the dead were wrapped in tarpaulins and lashed on deck to be identified by their comrades before being consigned to the deep  none of the living was conscious when the frenchmen reached the arrows deck  even the poor devil who had waved the single despairing signal of distress had lapsed into unconsciousness before he had learned whether it had availed or not  it did not take the french officer long to learn what had caused the terrible condition aboard for when water and brandy were sought to restore the men it was found that there was none nor even food of any description  he immediately signalled to the cruiser to send water medicine and provisions and another boat made the perilous trip to the arrow  when restoratives had been applied several of the men regained consciousness and then the whole story was told  that part of it we know up to the sailing of the arrow after the murder of snipes and the burial of his body above the treasure chest  it seems that the pursuit by the cruiser had so terrorized the mutineers that they had continued out across the atlantic for several days after losing her but on discovering the meager supply of water and provisions aboard they had turned back toward the east  with no one on board who understood navigation discussions soon arose as to their whereabouts and as three days sailing to the east did not raise land they bore off to the north fearing that the high north winds that had prevailed had driven them south of the southern extremity of africa  they kept on a northnortheasterly course for two days when they were overtaken by a calm which lasted for nearly a week  their water was gone and in another day they would be without food  conditions changed rapidly from bad to worse  one man went mad and leaped overboard  soon another opened his veins and drank his own blood  when he died they threw him overboard also though there were those among them who wanted to keep the corpse on board  hunger was changing them from human beasts to wild beasts  two days before they had been picked up by the cruiser they had become too weak to handle the vessel and that same day three men died  on the following morning it was seen that one of the corpses had been partially devoured  all that day the men lay glaring at each other like beasts of prey and the following morning two of the corpses lay almost entirely stripped of flesh  the men were but little stronger for their ghoulish repast for the want of water was by far the greatest agony with which they had to contend  and then the cruiser had come  when those who could had recovered the entire story had been told to the french commander but the men were too ignorant to be able to tell him at just what point on the coast the professor and his party had been marooned so the cruiser had steamed slowly along within sight of land firing occasional signal guns and scanning every inch of the beach with glasses  they had anchored by night so as not to neglect a particle of the shore line and it had happened that the preceding night had brought them off the very beach where lay the little camp they sought  the signal guns of the afternoon before had not been heard by those on shore it was presumed because they had doubtless been in the thick of the jungle searching for jane porter where the noise of their own crashing through the underbrush would have drowned the report of a far distant gun  by the time the two parties had narrated their several adventures the cruisers boat had returned with supplies and arms for the expedition  within a few minutes the little body of sailors and the two french officers together with professor porter and clayton set off upon their hopeless and illfated quest into the untracked jungle     chapter xx  heredity   when jane realized that she was being borne away a captive by the strange forest creature who had rescued her from the clutches of the ape she struggled desperately to escape but the strong arms that held her as easily as though she had been but a dayold babe only pressed a little more tightly  so presently she gave up the futile effort and lay quietly looking through halfclosed lids at the face of the man who strode easily through the tangled undergrowth with her  the face above her was one of extraordinary beauty  a perfect type of the strongly masculine unmarred by dissipation or brutal or degrading passions  for though tarzan of the apes was a killer of men and of beasts he killed as the hunter kills dispassionately except on those rare occasions when he had killed for hatethough not the brooding malevolent hate which marks the features of its own with hideous lines  when tarzan killed he more often smiled than scowled and smiles are the foundation of beauty  one thing the girl had noticed particularly when she had seen tarzan rushing upon terkozthe vivid scarlet band upon his forehead from above the left eye to the scalp but now as she scanned his features she noticed that it was gone and only a thin white line marked the spot where it had been  as she lay more quietly in his arms tarzan slightly relaxed his grip upon her  once he looked down into her eyes and smiled and the girl had to close her own to shut out the vision of that handsome winning face  presently tarzan took to the trees and jane wondering that she felt no fear began to realize that in many respects she had never felt more secure in her whole life than now as she lay in the arms of this strong wild creature being borne god alone knew where or to what fate deeper and deeper into the savage fastness of the untamed forest  when with closed eyes she commenced to speculate upon the future and terrifying fears were conjured by a vivid imagination she had but to raise her lids and look upon that noble face so close to hers to dissipate the last remnant of apprehension  no he could never harm her of that she was convinced when she translated the fine features and the frank brave eyes above her into the chivalry which they proclaimed  on and on they went through what seemed to jane a solid mass of verdure yet ever there appeared to open before this forest god a passage as by magic which closed behind them as they passed  scarce a branch scraped against her yet above and below before and behind the view presented naught but a solid mass of inextricably interwoven branches and creepers  as tarzan moved steadily onward his mind was occupied with many strange and new thoughts  here was a problem the like of which he had never encountered and he felt rather than reasoned that he must meet it as a man and not as an ape  the free movement through the middle terrace which was the route he had followed for the most part had helped to cool the ardor of the first fierce passion of his new found love  now he discovered himself speculating upon the fate which would have fallen to the girl had he not rescued her from terkoz  he knew why the ape had not killed her and he commenced to compare his intentions with those of terkoz  true it was the order of the jungle for the male to take his mate by force but could tarzan be guided by the laws of the beasts  was not tarzan a man  but what did men do  he was puzzled for he did not know  he wished that he might ask the girl and then it came to him that she had already answered him in the futile struggle she had made to escape and to repulse him  but now they had come to their destination and tarzan of the apes with jane in his strong arms swung lightly to the turf of the arena where the great apes held their councils and danced the wild orgy of the dumdum  though they had come many miles it was still but midafternoon and the amphitheater was bathed in the half light which filtered through the maze of encircling foliage  the green turf looked soft and cool and inviting  the myriad noises of the jungle seemed far distant and hushed to a mere echo of blurred sounds rising and falling like the surf upon a remote shore  a feeling of dreamy peacefulness stole over jane as she sank down upon the grass where tarzan had placed her and as she looked up at his great figure towering above her there was added a strange sense of perfect security  as she watched him from beneath halfclosed lids tarzan crossed the little circular clearing toward the trees upon the further side  she noted the graceful majesty of his carriage the perfect symmetry of his magnificent figure and the poise of his wellshaped head upon his broad shoulders  what a perfect creature  there could be naught of cruelty or baseness beneath that godlike exterior  never she thought had such a man strode the earth since god created the first in his own image  with a bound tarzan sprang into the trees and disappeared  jane wondered where he had gone  had he left her there to her fate in the lonely jungle  she glanced nervously about  every vine and bush seemed but the lurkingplace of some huge and horrible beast waiting to bury gleaming fangs into her soft flesh  every sound she magnified into the stealthy creeping of a sinuous and malignant body  how different now that he had left her  for a few minutes that seemed hours to the frightened girl she sat with tense nerves waiting for the spring of the crouching thing that was to end her misery of apprehension  she almost prayed for the cruel teeth that would give her unconsciousness and surcease from the agony of fear  she heard a sudden slight sound behind her  with a cry she sprang to her feet and turned to face her end  there stood tarzan his arms filled with ripe and luscious fruit  jane reeled and would have fallen had not tarzan dropping his burden caught her in his arms  she did not lose consciousness but she clung tightly to him shuddering and trembling like a frightened deer  tarzan of the apes stroked her soft hair and tried to comfort and quiet her as kala had him when as a little ape he had been frightened by sabor the lioness or histah the snake  once he pressed his lips lightly upon her forehead and she did not move but closed her eyes and sighed  she could not analyze her feelings nor did she wish to attempt it she was satisfied to feel the safety of those strong arms and to leave her future to fate for the last few hours had taught her to trust this strange wild creature of the forest as she would have trusted but few of the men of her acquaintance  as she thought of the strangeness of it there commenced to dawn upon her the realization that she had possibly learned something else which she had never really known beforelove  she wondered and then she smiled  and still smiling she pushed tarzan gently away and looking at him with a halfsmiling halfquizzical expression that made her face wholly entrancing she pointed to the fruit upon the ground and seated herself upon the edge of the earthen drum of the anthropoids for hunger was asserting itself  tarzan quickly gathered up the fruit and bringing it laid it at her feet and then he too sat upon the drum beside her and with his knife opened and prepared the various fruits for her meal  together and in silence they ate occasionally stealing sly glances at one another until finally jane broke into a merry laugh in which tarzan joined  i wish you spoke english said the girl  tarzan shook his head and an expression of wistful and pathetic longing sobered his laughing eyes  then jane tried speaking to him in french and then in german but she had to laugh at her own blundering attempt at the latter tongue  anyway she said to him in english you understand my german as well as they did in berlin  tarzan had long since reached a decision as to what his future procedure should be  he had had time to recollect all that he had read of the ways of men and women in the books at the cabin  he would act as he imagined the men in the books would have acted were they in his place  again he rose and went into the trees but first he tried to explain by means of signs that he would return shortly and he did so well that jane understood and was not afraid when he had gone  only a feeling of loneliness came over her and she watched the point where he had disappeared with longing eyes awaiting his return  as before she was appraised of his presence by a soft sound behind her and turned to see him coming across the turf with a great armful of branches  then he went back again into the jungle and in a few minutes reappeared with a quantity of soft grasses and ferns  two more trips he made until he had quite a pile of material at hand  then he spread the ferns and grasses upon the ground in a soft flat bed and above it leaned many branches together so that they met a few feet over its center  upon these he spread layers of huge leaves of the great elephants ear and with more branches and more leaves he closed one end of the little shelter he had built  then they sat down together again upon the edge of the drum and tried to talk by signs  the magnificent diamond locket which hung about tarzans neck had been a source of much wonderment to jane  she pointed to it now and tarzan removed it and handed the pretty bauble to her  she saw that it was the work of a skilled artisan and that the diamonds were of great brilliancy and superbly set but the cutting of them denoted that they were of a former day  she noticed too that the locket opened and pressing the hidden clasp she saw the two halves spring apart to reveal in either section an ivory miniature  one was of a beautiful woman and the other might have been a likeness of the man who sat beside her except for a subtle difference of expression that was scarcely definable  she looked up at tarzan to find him leaning toward her gazing on the miniatures with an expression of astonishment  he reached out his hand for the locket and took it away from her examining the likenesses within with unmistakable signs of surprise and new interest  his manner clearly denoted that he had never before seen them nor imagined that the locket opened  this fact caused jane to indulge in further speculation and it taxed her imagination to picture how this beautiful ornament came into the possession of a wild and savage creature of the unexplored jungles of africa  still more wonderful was how it contained the likeness of one who might be a brother or more likely the father of this woodland demigod who was even ignorant of the fact that the locket opened  tarzan was still gazing with fixity at the two faces  presently he removed the quiver from his shoulder and emptying the arrows upon the ground reached into the bottom of the baglike receptacle and drew forth a flat object wrapped in many soft leaves and tied with bits of long grass  carefully he unwrapped it removing layer after layer of leaves until at length he held a photograph in his hand  pointing to the miniature of the man within the locket he handed the photograph to jane holding the open locket beside it  the photograph only served to puzzle the girl still more for it was evidently another likeness of the same man whose picture rested in the locket beside that of the beautiful young woman  tarzan was looking at her with an expression of puzzled bewilderment in his eyes as she glanced up at him  he seemed to be framing a question with his lips  the girl pointed to the photograph and then to the miniature and then to him as though to indicate that she thought the likenesses were of him but he only shook his head and then shrugging his great shoulders he took the photograph from her and having carefully rewrapped it placed it again in the bottom of his quiver  for a few moments he sat in silence his eyes bent upon the ground while jane held the little locket in her hand turning it over and over in an endeavor to find some further clue that might lead to the identity of its original owner  at length a simple explanation occurred to her  the locket had belonged to lord greystoke and the likenesses were of himself and lady alice  this wild creature had simply found it in the cabin by the beach  how stupid of her not to have thought of that solution before  but to account for the strange likeness between lord greystoke and this forest godthat was quite beyond her and it is not strange that she could not imagine that this naked savage was indeed an english nobleman  at length tarzan looked up to watch the girl as she examined the locket  he could not fathom the meaning of the faces within but he could read the interest and fascination upon the face of the live young creature by his side  she noticed that he was watching her and thinking that he wished his ornament again she held it out to him  he took it from her and taking the chain in his two hands he placed it about her neck smiling at her expression of surprise at his unexpected gift  jane shook her head vehemently and would have removed the golden links from about her throat but tarzan would not let her  taking her hands in his when she insisted upon it he held them tightly to prevent her  at last she desisted and with a little laugh raised the locket to her lips  tarzan did not know precisely what she meant but he guessed correctly that it was her way of acknowledging the gift and so he rose and taking the locket in his hand stooped gravely like some courtier of old and pressed his lips upon it where hers had rested  it was a stately and gallant little compliment performed with the grace and dignity of utter unconsciousness of self  it was the hallmark of his aristocratic birth the natural outcropping of many generations of fine breeding an hereditary instinct of graciousness which a lifetime of uncouth and savage training and environment could not eradicate  it was growing dark now and so they ate again of the fruit which was both food and drink for them then tarzan rose and leading jane to the little bower he had erected motioned her to go within  for the first time in hours a feeling of fear swept over her and tarzan felt her draw away as though shrinking from him  contact with this girl for half a day had left a very diferent tarzan from the one on whom the mornings sun had risen  now in every fiber of his being heredity spoke louder than training  he had not in one swift transition become a polished gentleman from a savage apeman but at last the instincts of the former predominated and over all was the desire to please the woman he loved and to appear well in her eyes  so tarzan of the apes did the only thing he knew to assure jane of her safety  he removed his hunting knife from its sheath and handed it to her hilt first again motioning her into the bower  the girl understood and taking the long knife she entered and lay down upon the soft grasses while tarzan of the apes stretched himself upon the ground across the entrance  and thus the rising sun found them in the morning  when jane awoke she did not at first recall the strange events of the preceding day and so she wondered at her odd surroundingsthe little leafy bower the soft grasses of her bed the unfamiliar prospect from the opening at her feet  slowly the circumstances of her position crept one by one into her mind  and then a great wonderment arose in her hearta mighty wave of thankfulness and gratitude that though she had been in such terrible danger yet she was unharmed  she moved to the entrance of the shelter to look for tarzan  he was gone but this time no fear assailed her for she knew that he would return  in the grass at the entrance to her bower she saw the imprint of his body where he had lain all night to guard her  she knew that the fact that he had been there was all that had permitted her to sleep in such peaceful security  with him near who could entertain fear  she wondered if there was another man on earth with whom a girl could feel so safe in the heart of this savage african jungle  even the lions and panthers had no fears for her now  she looked up to see his lithe form drop softly from a nearby tree as he caught her eyes upon him his face lighted with that frank and radiant smile that had won her confidence the day before  as he approached her janes heart beat faster and her eyes brightened as they had never done before at the approach of any man  he had again been gathering fruit and this he laid at the entrance of her bower  once more they sat down together to eat  jane commenced to wonder what his plans were  would he take her back to the beach or would he keep her here  suddenly she realized that the matter did not seem to give her much concern  could it be that she did not care  she began to comprehend also that she was entirely contented sitting here by the side of this smiling giant eating delicious fruit in a sylvan paradise far within the remote depths of an african junglethat she was contented and very happy  she could not understand it  her reason told her that she should be torn by wild anxieties weighted by dread fears cast down by gloomy forebodings but instead her heart was singing and she was smiling into the answering face of the man beside her  when they had finished their breakfast tarzan went to her bower and recovered his knife  the girl had entirely forgotten it  she realized that it was because she had forgotten the fear that prompted her to accept it  motioning her to follow tarzan walked toward the trees at the edge of the arena and taking her in one strong arm swung to the branches above  the girl knew that he was taking her back to her people and she could not understand the sudden feeling of loneliness and sorrow which crept over her  for hours they swung slowly along  tarzan of the apes did not hurry  he tried to draw out the sweet pleasure of that journey with those dear arms about his neck as long as possible and so he went far south of the direct route to the beach  several times they halted for brief rests which tarzan did not need and at noon they stopped for an hour at a little brook where they quenched their thirst and ate  so it was nearly sunset when they came to the clearing and tarzan dropping to the ground beside a great tree parted the tall jungle grass and pointed out the little cabin to her  she took him by the hand to lead him to it that she might tell her father that this man had saved her from death and worse than death that he had watched over her as carefully as a mother might have done  but again the timidity of the wild thing in the face of human habitation swept over tarzan of the apes  he drew back shaking his head  the girl came close to him looking up with pleading eyes  somehow she could not bear the thought of his going back into the terrible jungle alone  still he shook his head and finally he drew her to him very gently and stooped to kiss her but first he looked into her eyes and waited to learn if she were pleased or if she would repulse him  just an instant the girl hesitated and then she realized the truth and throwing her arms about his neck she drew his face to hers and kissed himunashamed  i love youi love you she murmured  from far in the distance came the faint sound of many guns  tarzan and jane raised their heads  from the cabin came mr philander and esmeralda  from where tarzan and the girl stood they could not see the two vessels lying at anchor in the harbor  tarzan pointed toward the sounds touched his breast and pointed again she understood  he was going and something told her that it was because he thought her people were in danger  again he kissed her  come back to me she whispered  i shall wait for youalways  he was goneand jane turned to walk across the clearing to the cabin  mr philander was the first to see her  it was dusk and mr philander was very near sighted  quickly esmeralda he cried  let us seek safety within it is a lioness  bless me  esmeralda did not bother to verify mr philanders vision  his tone was enough  she was within the cabin and had slammed and bolted the door before he had finished pronouncing her name  the bless me was startled out of mr philander by the discovery that esmeralda in the exuberance of her haste had fastened him upon the same side of the door as was the closeapproaching lioness  he beat furiously upon the heavy portal  esmeralda  esmeralda he shrieked  let me in  i am being devoured by a lion  esmeralda thought that the noise upon the door was made by the lioness in her attempts to pursue her so after her custom she fainted  mr philander cast a frightened glance behind him  horrors  the thing was quite close now  he tried to scramble up the side of the cabin and succeeded in catching a fleeting hold upon the thatched roof  for a moment he hung there clawing with his feet like a cat on a clothesline but presently a piece of the thatch came away and mr philander preceding it was precipitated upon his back  at the instant he fell a remarkable item of natural history leaped to his mind  if one feigns death lions and lionesses are supposed to ignore one according to mr philanders faulty memory  so mr philander lay as he had fallen frozen into the horrid semblance of death  as his arms and legs had been extended stiffly upward as he came to earth upon his back the attitude of death was anything but impressive  jane had been watching his antics in mildeyed surprise  now she laugheda little choking gurgle of a laugh but it was enough  mr philander rolled over upon his side and peered about  at length he discovered her  jane he cried  jane porter  bless me  he scrambled to his feet and rushed toward her  he could not believe that it was she and alive  bless me  where did you come from  where in the world have you been  how  mercy mr philander interrupted the girl i can never remember so many questions  well well said mr philander  bless me  i am so filled with surprise and exuberant delight at seeing you safe and well again that i scarcely know what i am saying really  but come tell me all that has happened to you     chapter xxi  the village of torture   as the little expedition of sailors toiled through the dense jungle searching for signs of jane porter the futility of their venture became more and more apparent but the grief of the old man and the hopeless eyes of the young englishman prevented the kind hearted darnot from turning back  he thought that there might be a bare possibility of finding her body or the remains of it for he was positive that she had been devoured by some beast of prey  he deployed his men into a skirmish line from the point where esmeralda had been found and in this extended formation they pushed their way sweating and panting through the tangled vines and creepers  it was slow work  noon found them but a few miles inland  they halted for a brief rest then and after pushing on for a short distance further one of the men discovered a wellmarked trail  it was an old elephant track and darnot after consulting with professor porter and clayton decided to follow it  the path wound through the jungle in a northeasterly direction and along it the column moved in single file  lieutenant darnot was in the lead and moving at a quick pace for the trail was comparatively open  immediately behind him came professor porter but as he could not keep pace with the younger man darnot was a hundred yards in advance when suddenly a half dozen black warriors arose about him  darnot gave a warning shout to his column as the blacks closed on him but before he could draw his revolver he had been pinioned and dragged into the jungle  his cry had alarmed the sailors and a dozen of them sprang forward past professor porter running up the trail to their officers aid  they did not know the cause of his outcry only that it was a warning of danger ahead  they had rushed past the spot where darnot had been seized when a spear hurled from the jungle transfixed one of the men and then a volley of arrows fell among them  raising their rifles they fired into the underbrush in the direction from which the missiles had come  by this time the balance of the party had come up and volley after volley was fired toward the concealed foe  it was these shots that tarzan and jane porter had heard  lieutenant charpentier who had been bringing up the rear of the column now came running to the scene and on hearing the details of the ambush ordered the men to follow him and plunged into the tangled vegetation  in an instant they were in a handtohand fight with some fifty black warriors of mbongas village  arrows and bullets flew thick and fast  queer african knives and french gun butts mingled for a moment in savage and bloody duels but soon the natives fled into the jungle leaving the frenchmen to count their losses  four of the twenty were dead a dozen others were wounded and lieutenant darnot was missing  night was falling rapidly and their predicament was rendered doubly worse when they could not even find the elephant trail which they had been following  there was but one thing to do make camp where they were until daylight  lieutenant charpentier ordered a clearing made and a circular abatis of underbrush constructed about the camp  this work was not completed until long after dark the men building a huge fire in the center of the clearing to give them light to work by  when all was safe as possible against attack of wild beasts and savage men lieutenant charpentier placed sentries about the little camp and the tired and hungry men threw themselves upon the ground to sleep  the groans of the wounded mingled with the roaring and growling of the great beasts which the noise and firelight had attracted kept sleep except in its most fitful form from the tired eyes  it was a sad and hungry party that lay through the long night praying for dawn  the blacks who had seized darnot had not waited to participate in the fight which followed but instead had dragged their prisoner a little way through the jungle and then struck the trail further on beyond the scene of the fighting in which their fellows were engaged  they hurried him along the sounds of battle growing fainter and fainter as they drew away from the contestants until there suddenly broke upon darnots vision a goodsized clearing at one end of which stood a thatched and palisaded village  it was now dusk but the watchers at the gate saw the approaching trio and distinguished one as a prisoner ere they reached the portals  a cry went up within the palisade  a great throng of women and children rushed out to meet the party  and then began for the french officer the most terrifying experience which man can encounter upon earththe reception of a white prisoner into a village of african cannibals  to add to the fiendishness of their cruel savagery was the poignant memory of still crueler barbarities practiced upon them and theirs by the white officers of that arch hypocrite leopold ii of belgium because of whose atrocities they had fled the congo free statea pitiful remnant of what once had been a mighty tribe  they fell upon darnot tooth and nail beating him with sticks and stones and tearing at him with clawlike hands  every vestige of clothing was torn from him and the merciless blows fell upon his bare and quivering flesh  but not once did the frenchman cry out in pain he breathed a silent prayer that he be quickly delivered from his torture  but the death he prayed for was not to be so easily had  soon the warriors beat the women away from their prisoner  he was to be saved for nobler sport than this and the first wave of their passion having subsided they contented themselves with crying out taunts and insults and spitting upon him  presently they reached the center of the village  there darnot was bound securely to the great post from which no live man had ever been released  a number of the women scattered to their several huts to fetch pots and water while others built a row of fires on which portions of the feast were to be boiled while the balance would be slowly dried in strips for future use as they expected the other warriors to return with many prisoners  the festivities were delayed awaiting the return of the warriors who had remained to engage in the skirmish with the white men so that it was quite late when all were in the village and the dance of death commenced to circle around the doomed officer  half fainting from pain and exhaustion darnot watched from beneath halfclosed lids what seemed but the vagary of delirium or some horrid nightmare from which he must soon awake  the bestial faces daubed with colorthe huge mouths and flabby hanging lipsthe yellow teeth sharp filedthe rolling demon eyesthe shining naked bodiesthe cruel spears  surely no such creatures really existed upon earthhe must indeed be dreaming  the savage whirling bodies circled nearer  now a spear sprang forth and touched his arm  the sharp pain and the feel of hot trickling blood assured him of the awful reality of his hopeless position  another spear and then another touched him  he closed his eyes and held his teeth firm sethe would not cry out  he was a soldier of france and he would teach these beasts how an officer and a gentleman died   tarzan of the apes needed no interpreter to translate the story of those distant shots  with jane porters kisses still warm upon his lips he was swinging with incredible rapidity through the forest trees straight toward the village of mbonga  he was not interested in the location of the encounter for he judged that that would soon be over  those who were killed he could not aid those who escaped would not need his assistance  it was to those who had neither been killed or escaped that he hastened  and he knew that he would find them by the great post in the center of mbonga village  many times had tarzan seen mbongas black raiding parties return from the northward with prisoners and always were the same scenes enacted about that grim stake beneath the flaring light of many fires  he knew too that they seldom lost much time before consummating the fiendish purpose of their captures  he doubted that he would arrive in time to do more than avenge  on he sped  night had fallen and he traveled high along the upper terrace where the gorgeous tropic moon lighted the dizzy pathway through the gently undulating branches of the tree tops  presently he caught the reflection of a distant blaze  it lay to the right of his path  it must be the light from the camp fire the two men had built before they were attackedtarzan knew nothing of the presence of the sailors  so sure was tarzan of his jungle knowledge that he did not turn from his course but passed the glare at a distance of a half mile  it was the camp fire of the frenchmen  in a few minutes more tarzan swung into the trees above mbongas village  ah he was not quite too late  or was he  he could not tell  the figure at the stake was very still yet the black warriors were but pricking it  tarzan knew their customs  the death blow had not been struck  he could tell almost to a minute how far the dance had gone  in another instant mbongas knife would sever one of the victims earsthat would mark the beginning of the end for very shortly after only a writhing mass of mutilated flesh would remain  there would still be life in it but death then would be the only charity it craved  the stake stood forty feet from the nearest tree  tarzan coiled his rope  then there rose suddenly above the fiendish cries of the dancing demons the awful challenge of the apeman  the dancers halted as though turned to stone  the rope sped with singing whir high above the heads of the blacks  it was quite invisible in the flaring lights of the camp fires  darnot opened his eyes  a huge black standing directly before him lunged backward as though felled by an invisible hand  struggling and shrieking his body rolling from side to side moved quickly toward the shadows beneath the trees  the blacks their eyes protruding in horror watched spellbound  once beneath the trees the body rose straight into the air and as it disappeared into the foliage above the terrified negroes screaming with fright broke into a mad race for the village gate  darnot was left alone  he was a brave man but he had felt the short hairs bristle upon the nape of his neck when that uncanny cry rose upon the air  as the writhing body of the black soared as though by unearthly power into the dense foliage of the forest darnot felt an icy shiver run along his spine as though death had risen from a dark grave and laid a cold and clammy finger on his flesh  as darnot watched the spot where the body had entered the tree he heard the sounds of movement there  the branches swayed as though under the weight of a mans bodythere was a crash and the black came sprawling to earth againto lie very quietly where he had fallen  immediately after him came a white body but this one alighted erect  darnot saw a cleanlimbed young giant emerge from the shadows into the firelight and come quickly toward him  what could it mean  who could it be  some new creature of torture and destruction doubtless  darnot waited  his eyes never left the face of the advancing man nor did the others frank clear eyes waver beneath darnots fixed gaze  darnot was reassured but still without much hope though he felt that that face could not mask a cruel heart  without a word tarzan of the apes cut the bonds which held the frenchman  weak from suffering and loss of blood he would have fallen but for the strong arm that caught him  he felt himself lifted from the ground  there was a sensation as of flying and then he lost consciousness     chapter xxii  the search party   when dawn broke upon the little camp of frenchmen in the heart of the jungle it found a sad and disheartened group  as soon as it was light enough to see their surroundings lieutenant charpentier sent men in groups of three in several directions to locate the trail and in ten minutes it was found and the expedition was hurrying back toward the beach  it was slow work for they bore the bodies of six dead men two more having succumbed during the night and several of those who were wounded required support to move even very slowly  charpentier had decided to return to camp for reinforcements and then make an attempt to track down the natives and rescue darnot  it was late in the afternoon when the exhausted men reached the clearing by the beach but for two of them the return brought so great a happiness that all their suffering and heartbreaking grief was forgotten on the instant  as the little party emerged from the jungle the first person that professor porter and cecil clayton saw was jane standing by the cabin door  with a little cry of joy and relief she ran forward to greet them throwing her arms about her fathers neck and bursting into tears for the first time since they had been cast upon this hideous and adventurous shore  professor porter strove manfully to suppress his own emotions but the strain upon his nerves and weakened vitality were too much for him and at length burying his old face in the girls shoulder he sobbed quietly like a tired child  jane led him toward the cabin and the frenchmen turned toward the beach from which several of their fellows were advancing to meet them  clayton wishing to leave father and daughter alone joined the sailors and remained talking with the officers until their boat pulled away toward the cruiser whither lieutenant charpentier was bound to report the unhappy outcome of his adventure  then clayton turned back slowly toward the cabin  his heart was filled with happiness  the woman he loved was safe  he wondered by what manner of miracle she had been spared  to see her alive seemed almost unbelievable  as he approached the cabin he saw jane coming out  when she saw him she hurried forward to meet him  jane he cried god has been good to us indeed  tell me how you escapedwhat form providence took to save you forus  he had never before called her by her given name  fortyeight hours before it would have suffused jane with a soft glow of pleasure to have heard that name from claytons lipsnow it frightened her  mr clayton she said quietly extending her hand first let me thank you for your chivalrous loyalty to my dear father  he has told me how noble and selfsacrificing you have been  how can we repay you  clayton noticed that she did not return his familiar salutation but he felt no misgivings on that score  she had been through so much  this was no time to force his love upon her he quickly realized  i am already repaid he said  just to see you and professor porter both safe well and together again  i do not think that i could much longer have endured the pathos of his quiet and uncomplaining grief  it was the saddest experience of my life miss porter and then added to it there was my own griefthe greatest i have ever known  but his was so hopelesshis was pitiful  it taught me that no love not even that of a man for his wife may be so deep and terrible and selfsacrificing as the love of a father for his daughter  the girl bowed her head  there was a question she wanted to ask but it seemed almost sacrilegious in the face of the love of these two men and the terrible suffering they had endured while she sat laughing and happy beside a godlike creature of the forest eating delicious fruits and looking with eyes of love into answering eyes  but love is a strange master and human nature is still stranger so she asked her question  where is the forest man who went to rescue you  why did he not return  i do not understand said clayton  whom do you mean  he who has saved each of uswho saved me from the gorilla  oh cried clayton in surprise  it was he who rescued you  you have not told me anything of your adventure you know  but the wood man she urged  have you not seen him  when we heard the shots in the jungle very faint and far away he left me  we had just reached the clearing and he hurried off in the direction of the fighting  i know he went to aid you  her tone was almost pleadingher manner tense with suppressed emotion clayton could not but notice it and he wondered vaguely why she was so deeply movedso anxious to know the whereabouts of this strange creature  yet a feeling of apprehension of some impending sorrow haunted him and in his breast unknown to himself was implanted the first germ of jealousy and suspicion of the apeman to whom he owed his life  we did not see him he replied quietly  he did not join us  and then after a moment of thoughtful pause  possibly he joined his own tribethe men who attacked us  he did not know why he had said it for he did not believe it  the girl looked at him wide eyed for a moment  no she exclaimed vehemently much too vehemently he thought  it could not be  they were savages  clayton looked puzzled  he is a strange halfsavage creature of the jungle miss porter  we know nothing of him  he neither speaks nor understands any european tongueand his ornaments and weapons are those of the west coast savages  clayton was speaking rapidly  there are no other human beings than savages within hundreds of miles miss porter  he must belong to the tribes which attacked us or to some other equally savagehe may even be a cannibal  jane blanched  i will not believe it she half whispered  it is not true  you shall see she said addressing clayton that he will come back and that he will prove that you are wrong  you do not know him as i do  i tell you that he is a gentleman  clayton was a generous and chivalrous man but something in the girls breathless defense of the forest man stirred him to unreasoning jealousy so that for the instant he forgot all that they owed to this wild demigod and he answered her with a half sneer upon his lip  possibly you are right miss porter he said but i do not think that any of us need worry about our carrioneating acquaintance  the chances are that he is some halfdemented castaway who will forget us more quickly but no more surely than we shall forget him  he is only a beast of the jungle miss porter  the girl did not answer but she felt her heart shrivel within her  she knew that clayton spoke merely what he thought and for the first time she began to analyze the structure which supported her newfound love and to subject its object to a critical examination  slowly she turned and walked back to the cabin  she tried to imagine her woodgod by her side in the saloon of an ocean liner  she saw him eating with his hands tearing his food like a beast of prey and wiping his greasy fingers upon his thighs  she shuddered  she saw him as she introduced him to her friendsuncouth illiteratea boor and the girl winced  she had reached her room now and as she sat upon the edge of her bed of ferns and grasses with one hand resting upon her rising and falling bosom she felt the hard outlines of the mans locket  she drew it out holding it in the palm of her hand for a moment with tearblurred eyes bent upon it  then she raised it to her lips and crushing it there buried her face in the soft ferns sobbing  beast she murmured  then god make me a beast for man or beast i am yours  she did not see clayton again that day  esmeralda brought her supper to her and she sent word to her father that she was suffering from the reaction following her adventure  the next morning clayton left early with the relief expedition in search of lieutenant darnot  there were two hundred armed men this time with ten officers and two surgeons and provisions for a week  they carried bedding and hammocks the latter for transporting their sick and wounded  it was a determined and angry companya punitive expedition as well as one of relief  they reached the site of the skirmish of the previous expedition shortly after noon for they were now traveling a known trail and no time was lost in exploring  from there on the elephanttrack led straight to mbongas village  it was but two oclock when the head of the column halted upon the edge of the clearing  lieutenant charpentier who was in command immediately sent a portion of his force through the jungle to the opposite side of the village another detachment was dispatched to a point before the village gate while he remained with the balance upon the south side of the clearing  it was arranged that the party which was to take its position to the north and which would be the last to gain its station should commence the assault and that their opening volley should be the signal for a concerted rush from all sides in an attempt to carry the village by storm at the first charge  for half an hour the men with lieutenant charpentier crouched in the dense foliage of the jungle waiting the signal  to them it seemed like hours  they could see natives in the fields and others moving in and out of the village gate  at length the signal camea sharp rattle of musketry and like one man an answering volley tore from the jungle to the west and to the south  the natives in the field dropped their implements and broke madly for the palisade  the french bullets mowed them down and the french sailors bounded over their prostrate bodies straight for the village gate  so sudden and unexpected the assault had been that the whites reached the gates before the frightened natives could bar them and in another minute the village street was filled with armed men fighting hand to hand in an inextricable tangle  for a few moments the blacks held their ground within the entrance to the street but the revolvers rifles and cutlasses of the frenchmen crumpled the native spearmen and struck down the black archers with their bows halfdrawn  soon the battle turned to a wild rout and then to a grim massacre for the french sailors had seen bits of darnots uniform upon several of the black warriors who opposed them  they spared the children and those of the women whom they were not forced to kill in selfdefense but when at length they stopped panting blood covered and sweating it was because there lived to oppose them no single warrior of all the savage village of mbonga  carefully they ransacked every hut and corner of the village but no sign of darnot could they find  they questioned the prisoners by signs and finally one of the sailors who had served in the french congo found that he could make them understand the bastard tongue that passes for language between the whites and the more degraded tribes of the coast but even then they could learn nothing definite regarding the fate of darnot  only excited gestures and expressions of fear could they obtain in response to their inquiries concerning their fellow and at last they became convinced that these were but evidences of the guilt of these demons who had slaughtered and eaten their comrade two nights before  at length all hope left them and they prepared to camp for the night within the village  the prisoners were herded into three huts where they were heavily guarded  sentries were posted at the barred gates and finally the village was wrapped in the silence of slumber except for the wailing of the native women for their dead   the next morning they set out upon the return march  their original intention had been to burn the village but this idea was abandoned and the prisoners were left behind weeping and moaning but with roofs to cover them and a palisade for refuge from the beasts of the jungle  slowly the expedition retraced its steps of the preceding day  ten loaded hammocks retarded its pace  in eight of them lay the more seriously wounded while two swung beneath the weight of the dead  clayton and lieutenant charpentier brought up the rear of the column the englishman silent in respect for the others grief for darnot and charpentier had been inseparable friends since boyhood  clayton could not but realize that the frenchman felt his grief the more keenly because darnots sacrifice had been so futile since jane had been rescued before darnot had fallen into the hands of the savages and again because the service in which he had lost his life had been outside his duty and for strangers and aliens but when he spoke of it to lieutenant charpentier the latter shook his head  no monsieur he said darnot would have chosen to die thus  i only grieve that i could not have died for him or at least with him i wish that you could have known him better monsieur  he was indeed an officer and a gentlemana title conferred on many but deserved by so few  he did not die futilely for his death in the cause of a strange american girl will make us his comrades face our ends the more bravely however they may come to us  clayton did not reply but within him rose a new respect for frenchmen which remained undimmed ever after  it was quite late when they reached the cabin by the beach  a single shot before they emerged from the jungle had announced to those in camp as well as on the ship that the expedition had been too latefor it had been prearranged that when they came within a mile or two of camp one shot was to be fired to denote failure or three for success while two would have indicated that they had found no sign of either darnot or his black captors  so it was a solemn party that awaited their coming and few words were spoken as the dead and wounded men were tenderly placed in boats and rowed silently toward the cruiser  clayton exhausted from his five days of laborious marching through the jungle and from the effects of his two battles with the blacks turned toward the cabin to seek a mouthful of food and then the comparative ease of his bed of grasses after two nights in the jungle  by the cabin door stood jane  the poor lieutenant she asked  did you find no trace of him  we were too late miss porter he replied sadly  tell me  what had happened she asked  i cannot miss porter it is too horrible  you do not mean that they had tortured him she whispered  we do not know what they did to him before they killed him he answered his face drawn with fatigue and the sorrow he felt for poor darnot and he emphasized the word before  before they killed him  what do you mean  they are not  they are not  she was thinking of what clayton had said of the forest mans probable relationship to this tribe and she could not frame the awful word  yes miss porter they werecannibals he said almost bitterly for to him too had suddenly come the thought of the forest man and the strange unaccountable jealousy he had felt two days before swept over him once more  and then in sudden brutality that was as unlike clayton as courteous consideration is unlike an ape he blurted out  when your forest god left you he was doubtless hurrying to the feast  he was sorry ere the words were spoken though he did not know how cruelly they had cut the girl  his regret was for his baseless disloyalty to one who had saved the lives of every member of his party and offered harm to none  the girls head went high  there could be but one suitable reply to your assertion mr clayton she said icily and i regret that i am not a man that i might make it  she turned quickly and entered the cabin  clayton was an englishman so the girl had passed quite out of sight before he deduced what reply a man would have made  upon my word he said ruefully she called me a liar  and i fancy i jolly well deserved it he added thoughtfully  clayton my boy i know you are tired out and unstrung but thats no reason why you should make an ass of yourself  youd better go to bed  but before he did so he called gently to jane upon the opposite side of the sailcloth partition for he wished to apologize but he might as well have addressed the sphinx  then he wrote upon a piece of paper and shoved it beneath the partition  jane saw the little note and ignored it for she was very angry and hurt and mortified butshe was a woman and so eventually she picked it up and read it  my dear miss porter  i had no reason to insinuate what i did  my only excuse is that my nerves must be unstrungwhich is no excuse at all  please try and think that i did not say it  i am very sorry  i would not have hurt you above all others in the world  say that you forgive me                wm cecil clayton   he did think it or he never would have said it reasoned the girl but it cannot be trueoh i know it is not true  one sentence in the letter frightened her  i would not have hurt you above all others in the world  a week ago that sentence would have filled her with delight now it depressed her  she wished she had never met clayton  she was sorry that she had ever seen the forest god  no she was glad  and there was that other note she had found in the grass before the cabin the day after her return from the jungle the love note signed by tarzan of the apes  who could be this new suitor  if he were another of the wild denizens of this terrible forest what might he not do to claim her  esmeralda  wake up she cried  you make me so irritable sleeping there peacefully when you know perfectly well that the world is filled with sorrow  gaberelle screamed esmeralda sitting up  what is it now  a hipponocerous  where is he miss jane  nonsense esmeralda there is nothing  go back to sleep  you are bad enough asleep but you are infinitely worse awake  yes honey but whats the matter with you precious  you acts sort of disgranulated this evening  oh esmeralda im just plain ugly tonight said the girl  dont pay any attention to methats a dear  yes honey now you go right to sleep  your nerves are all on edge what with all these ripotamuses and man eating geniuses that mister philander been telling aboutlord it aint no wonder we all get nervous prosecution  jane crossed the little room laughing and kissing the faithful woman bid esmeralda good night     chapter xxiii  brother men   when darnot regained consciousness he found himself lying upon a bed of soft ferns and grasses beneath a little a shaped shelter of boughs  at his feet an opening looked out upon a green sward and at a little distance beyond was the dense wall of jungle and forest  he was very lame and sore and weak and as full consciousness returned he felt the sharp torture of many cruel wounds and the dull aching of every bone and muscle in his body as a result of the hideous beating he had received  even the turning of his head caused him such excruciating agony that he lay still with closed eyes for a long time  he tried to piece out the details of his adventure prior to the time he lost consciousness to see if they would explain his present whereaboutshe wondered if he were among friends or foes  at length he recollected the whole hideous scene at the stake and finally recalled the strange white figure in whose arms he had sunk into oblivion  darnot wondered what fate lay in store for him now  he could neither see nor hear any signs of life about him  the incessant hum of the junglethe rustling of millions of leavesthe buzz of insectsthe voices of the birds and monkeys seemed blended into a strangely soothing purr as though he lay apart far from the myriad life whose sounds came to him only as a blurred echo  at length he fell into a quiet slumber nor did he awake again until afternoon  once more he experienced the strange sense of utter bewilderment that had marked his earlier awakening but soon he recalled the recent past and looking through the opening at his feet he saw the figure of a man squatting on his haunches  the broad muscular back was turned toward him but tanned though it was darnot saw that it was the back of a white man and he thanked god  the frenchman called faintly  the man turned and rising came toward the shelter  his face was very handsomethe handsomest thought darnot that he had ever seen  stooping he crawled into the shelter beside the wounded officer and placed a cool hand upon his forehead  darnot spoke to him in french but the man only shook his headsadly it seemed to the frenchman  then darnot tried english but still the man shook his head  italian spanish and german brought similar discouragement  darnot knew a few words of norwegian russian greek and also had a smattering of the language of one of the west coast negro tribesthe man denied them all  after examining darnots wounds the man left the shelter and disappeared  in half an hour he was back with fruit and a hollow gourdlike vegetable filled with water  darnot drank and ate a little  he was surprised that he had no fever again he tried to converse with his strange nurse but the attempt was useless  suddenly the man hastened from the shelter only to return a few minutes later with several pieces of bark andwonder of wondersa lead pencil  squatting beside darnot he wrote for a minute on the smooth inner surface of the bark then he handed it to the frenchman  darnot was astonished to see in plain printlike characters a message in english   i am tarzan of the apes  who are you  can you read this language   darnot seized the pencilthen he stopped  this strange man wrote englishevidently he was an englishman  yes said darnot i read english  i speak it also  now we may talk  first let me thank you for all that you have done for me  the man only shook his head and pointed to the pencil and the bark  mon dieu cried darnot  if you are english why is it then that you cannot speak english  and then in a flash it came to himthe man was a mute possibly a deaf mute  so darnot wrote a message on the bark in english   i am paul darnot lieutenant in the navy of france  i thank you for what you have done for me  you have saved my life and all that i have is yours  may i ask how it is that one who writes english does not speak it   tarzans reply filled darnot with still greater wonder   i speak only the language of my tribethe great apes who were kerchaks and a little of the languages of tantor the elephant and numa the lion and of the other folks of the jungle i understand with a human being i have never spoken except once with jane porter by signs  this is the first time i have spoken with another of my kind through written words   darnot was mystified  it seemed incredible that there lived upon earth a fullgrown man who had never spoken with a fellow man and still more preposterous that such a one could read and write  he looked again at tarzans messageexcept once with jane porter that was the american girl who had been carried into the jungle by a gorilla  a sudden light commenced to dawn on darnotthis then was the gorilla  he seized the pencil and wrote   where is jane porter   and tarzan replied below   back with her people in the cabin of tarzan of the apes   she is not dead then  where was she  what happened to her   she is not dead  she was taken by terkoz to be his wife but tarzan of the apes took her away from terkoz and killed him before he could harm her  none in all the jungle may face tarzan of the apes in battle and live i am tarzan of the apesmighty fighter  darnot wrote   i am glad she is safe  it pains me to write i will rest a while   and then tarzan   yes rest  when you are well i shall take you back to your people   for many days darnot lay upon his bed of soft ferns  the second day a fever had come and darnot thought that it meant infection and he knew that he would die  an idea came to him  he wondered why he had not thought of it before  he called tarzan and indicated by signs that he would write and when tarzan had fetched the bark and pencil darnot wrote   can you go to my people and lead them here  i will write a message that you may take to them and they will follow you   tarzan shook his head and taking the bark wrote   i had thought of thatthe first day but i dared not  the great apes come often to this spot and if they found you here wounded and alone they would kill you   darnot turned on his side and closed his eyes  he did not wish to die but he felt that he was going for the fever was mounting higher and higher  that night he lost consciousness  for three days he was in delirium and tarzan sat beside him and bathed his head and hands and washed his wounds  on the fourth day the fever broke as suddenly as it had come but it left darnot a shadow of his former self and very weak  tarzan had to lift him that he might drink from the gourd  the fever had not been the result of infection as darnot had thought but one of those that commonly attack whites in the jungles of africa and either kill or leave them as suddenly as darnots had left him  two days later darnot was tottering about the amphitheater tarzans strong arm about him to keep him from falling  they sat beneath the shade of a great tree and tarzan found some smooth bark that they might converse  darnot wrote the first message   what can i do to repay you for all that you have done for me   and tarzan in reply   teach me to speak the language of men   and so darnot commenced at once pointing out familiar objects and repeating their names in french for he thought that it would be easier to teach this man his own language since he understood it himself best of all  it meant nothing to tarzan of course for he could not tell one language from another so when he pointed to the word man which he had printed upon a piece of bark he learned from darnot that it was pronounced homme and in the same way he was taught to pronounce ape singe and tree arbre  he was a most eager student and in two more days had mastered so much french that he could speak little sentences such as  that is a tree this is grass i am hungry and the like but darnot found that it was difficult to teach him the french construction upon a foundation of english  the frenchman wrote little lessons for him in english and had tarzan repeat them in french but as a literal translation was usually very poor french tarzan was often confused  darnot realized now that he had made a mistake but it seemed too late to go back and do it all over again and force tarzan to unlearn all that he had learned especially as they were rapidly approaching a point where they would be able to converse  on the third day after the fever broke tarzan wrote a message asking darnot if he felt strong enough to be carried back to the cabin tarzan was as anxious to go as darnot for he longed to see jane again  it had been hard for him to remain with the frenchman all these days for that very reason and that he had unselfishly done so spoke more glowingly of his nobility of character than even did his rescuing the french officer from mbongas clutches  darnot only too willing to attempt the journey wrote   but you cannot carry me all the distance through this tangled forest   tarzan laughed  mais oui he said and darnot laughed aloud to hear the phrase that he used so often glide from tarzans tongue  so they set out darnot marveling as had clayton and jane at the wondrous strength and agility of the apeman  midafternoon brought them to the clearing and as tarzan dropped to earth from the branches of the last tree his heart leaped and bounded against his ribs in anticipation of seeing jane so soon again  no one was in sight outside the cabin and darnot was perplexed to note that neither the cruiser nor the arrow was at anchor in the bay  an atmosphere of loneliness pervaded the spot which caught suddenly at both men as they strode toward the cabin  neither spoke yet both knew before they opened the closed door what they would find beyond  tarzan lifted the latch and pushed the great door in upon its wooden hinges  it was as they had feared  the cabin was deserted  the men turned and looked at one another  darnot knew that his people thought him dead but tarzan thought only of the woman who had kissed him in love and now had fled from him while he was serving one of her people  a great bitterness rose in his heart  he would go away far into the jungle and join his tribe  never would he see one of his own kind again nor could he bear the thought of returning to the cabin  he would leave that forever behind him with the great hopes he had nursed there of finding his own race and becoming a man among men  and the frenchman  darnot  what of him  he could get along as tarzan had  tarzan did not want to see him more  he wanted to get away from everything that might remind him of jane  as tarzan stood upon the threshold brooding darnot had entered the cabin  many comforts he saw that had been left behind  he recognized numerous articles from the cruisera camp oven some kitchen utensils a rifle and many rounds of ammunition canned foods blankets two chairs and a cotand several books and periodicals mostly american  they must intend returning thought darnot  he walked over to the table that john clayton had built so many years before to serve as a desk and on it he saw two notes addressed to tarzan of the apes  one was in a strong masculine hand and was unsealed  the other in a womans hand was sealed  here are two messages for you tarzan of the apes cried darnot turning toward the door but his companion was not there  darnot walked to the door and looked out  tarzan was nowhere in sight  he called aloud but there was no response  mon dieu exclaimed darnot he has left me  i feel it  he has gone back into his jungle and left me here alone  and then he remembered the look on tarzans face when they had discovered that the cabin was emptysuch a look as the hunter sees in the eyes of the wounded deer he has wantonly brought down  the man had been hard hitdarnot realized it nowbut why  he could not understand  the frenchman looked about him  the loneliness and the horror of the place commenced to get on his nervesalready weakened by the ordeal of suffering and sickness he had passed through  to be left here alone beside this awful junglenever to hear a human voice or see a human facein constant dread of savage beasts and more terribly savage mena prey to solitude and hopelessness  it was awful  and far to the east tarzan of the apes was speeding through the middle terrace back to his tribe  never had he traveled with such reckless speed  he felt that he was running away from himselfthat by hurtling through the forest like a frightened squirrel he was escaping from his own thoughts  but no matter how fast he went he found them always with him  he passed above the sinuous body of sabor the lioness going in the opposite directiontoward the cabin thought tarzan  what could darnot do against saboror if bolgani the gorilla should come upon himor numa the lion or cruel sheeta  tarzan paused in his flight  what are you tarzan he asked aloud  an ape or a man  if you are an ape you will do as the apes would doleave one of your kind to die in the jungle if it suited your whim to go elsewhere  if you are a man you will return to protect your kind  you will not run away from one of your own people because one of them has run away from you   darnot closed the cabin door  he was very nervous  even brave men and darnot was a brave man are sometimes frightened by solitude  he loaded one of the rifles and placed it within easy reach  then he went to the desk and took up the unsealed letter addressed to tarzan  possibly it contained word that his people had but left the beach temporarily  he felt that it would be no breach of ethics to read this letter so he took the enclosure from the envelope and read  to tarzan of the apes   we thank you for the use of your cabin and are sorry that you did not permit us the pleasure of seeing and thanking you in person  we have harmed nothing but have left many things for you which may add to your comfort and safety here in your lonely home  if you know the strange white man who saved our lives so many times and brought us food and if you can converse with him thank him also for his kindness  we sail within the hour never to return but we wish you and that other jungle friend to know that we shall always thank you for what you did for strangers on your shore and that we should have done infinitely more to reward you both had you given us the opportunity                very respectfully               wm cecil clayton   never to return muttered darnot and threw himself face downward upon the cot  an hour later he started up listening  something was at the door trying to enter  darnot reached for the loaded rifle and placed it to his shoulder  dusk was falling and the interior of the cabin was very dark but the man could see the latch moving from its place  he felt his hair rising upon his scalp  gently the door opened until a thin crack showed something standing just beyond  darnot sighted along the blue barrel at the crack of the doorand then he pulled the trigger     chapter xxiv  lost treasure   when the expedition returned following their fruitless endeavor to succor darnot captain dufranne was anxious to steam away as quickly as possible and all save jane had acquiesced  no she said determinedly i shall not go nor should you for there are two friends in that jungle who will come out of it some day expecting to find us awaiting them  your officer captain dufranne is one of them and the forest man who has saved the lives of every member of my fathers party is the other  he left me at the edge of the jungle two days ago to hasten to the aid of my father and mr clayton as he thought and he has stayed to rescue lieutenant darnot of that you may be sure  had he been too late to be of service to the lieutenant he would have been back before nowthe fact that he is not back is sufficient proof to me that he is delayed because lieutenant darnot is wounded or he has had to follow his captors further than the village which your sailors attacked  but poor darnots uniform and all his belongings were found in that village miss porter argued the captain and the natives showed great excitement when questioned as to the white mans fate  yes captain but they did not admit that he was dead and as for his clothes and accouterments being in their possessionwhy more civilized peoples than these poor savage negroes strip their prisoners of every article of value whether they intend killing them or not  even the soldiers of my own dear south looted not only the living but the dead  it is strong circumstantial evidence i will admit but it is not positive proof  possibly your forest man himself was captured or killed by the savages suggested captain dufranne  the girl laughed  you do not know him she replied a little thrill of pride setting her nerves atingle at the thought that she spoke of her own  i admit that he would be worth waiting for this superman of yours laughed the captain  i most certainly should like to see him  then wait for him my dear captain urged the girl for i intend doing so  the frenchman would have been a very much surprised man could he have interpreted the true meaning of the girls words  they had been walking from the beach toward the cabin as they talked and now they joined a little group sitting on camp stools in the shade of a great tree beside the cabin  professor porter was there and mr philander and clayton with lieutenant charpentier and two of his brother officers while esmeralda hovered in the background ever and anon venturing opinions and comments with the freedom of an old and muchindulged family servant  the officers arose and saluted as their superior approached and clayton surrendered his camp stool to jane  we were just discussing poor pauls fate said captain dufranne miss porter insists that we have no absolute proof of his deathnor have we  and on the other hand she maintains that the continued absence of your omnipotent jungle friend indicates that darnot is still in need of his services either because he is wounded or still is a prisoner in a more distant native village  it has been suggested ventured lieutenant charpentier that the wild man may have been a member of the tribe of blacks who attacked our partythat he was hastening to aid themhis own people  jane shot a quick glance at clayton  it seems vastly more reasonable said professor porter  i do not agree with you objected mr philander  he had ample opportunity to harm us himself or to lead his people against us instead during our long residence here he has been uniformly consistent in his role of protector and provider  that is true interjected clayton yet we must not overlook the fact that except for himself the only human beings within hundreds of miles are savage cannibals  he was armed precisely as are they which indicates that he has maintained relations of some nature with them and the fact that he is but one against possibly thousands suggests that these relations could scarcely have been other than friendly  it seems improbable then that he is not connected with them remarked the captain possibly a member of this tribe  otherwise added another of the officers how could he have lived a sufficient length of time among the savage denizens of the jungle brute and human to have become proficient in woodcraft or in the use of african weapons  you are judging him according to your own standards gentlemen said jane  an ordinary white man such as any of youpardon me i did not mean just thatrather a white man above the ordinary in physique and intelligence could never i grant you have lived a year alone and naked in this tropical jungle but this man not only surpasses the average white man in strength and agility but as far transcends our trained athletes and strong men as they surpass a dayold babe and his courage and ferocity in battle are those of the wild beast  he has certainly won a loyal champion miss porter said captain dufranne laughing  i am sure that there be none of us here but would willingly face death a hundred times in its most terrifying forms to deserve the tributes of one even half so loyalor so beautiful  you would not wonder that i defend him said the girl could you have seen him as i saw him battling in my behalf with that huge hairy brute  could you have seen him charge the monster as a bull might charge a grizzlyabsolutely without sign of fear or hesitationyou would have believed him more than human  could you have seen those mighty muscles knotting under the brown skincould you have seen them force back those awful fangsyou too would have thought him invincible  and could you have seen the chivalrous treatment which he accorded a strange girl of a strange race you would feel the same absolute confidence in him that i feel  you have won your suit my fair pleader cried the captain  this court finds the defendant not guilty and the cruiser shall wait a few days longer that he may have an opportunity to come and thank the divine portia  for the lords sake honey cried esmeralda  you all dont mean to tell me that youre going to stay right here in this here land of carnivable animals when you all got the opportunity to escapade on that boat  dont you tell me that honey  why esmeralda  you should be ashamed of yourself cried jane  is this any way to show your gratitude to the man who saved your life twice  well miss jane thats all jest as you say but that there forest man never did save us to stay here  he done save us so we all could get away from here  i expect he be mighty peevish when he find we aint got no more sense than to stay right here after he done give us the chance to get away  i hoped id never have to sleep in this here geological garden another night and listen to all them lonesome noises that come out of that jumble after dark  i dont blame you a bit esmeralda said clayton and you certainly did hit it off right when you called them lonesome noises  i never have been able to find the right word for them but thats it dont you know lonesome noises  you and esmeralda had better go and live on the cruiser said jane in fine scorn  what would you think if you had to live all of your life in that jungle as our forest man has done  im afraid id be a blooming bounder as a wild man laughed clayton ruefully  those noises at night make the hair on my head bristle  i suppose that i should be ashamed to admit it but its the truth  i dont know about that said lieutenant charpentier  i never thought much about fear and that sort of thingnever tried to determine whether i was a coward or brave man but the other night as we lay in the jungle there after poor darnot was taken and those jungle noises rose and fell around us i began to think that i was a coward indeed  it was not the roaring and growling of the big beasts that affected me so much as it was the stealthy noisesthe ones that you heard suddenly close by and then listened vainly for a repetition ofthe unaccountable sounds as of a great body moving almost noiselessly and the knowledge that you didnt know how close it was or whether it were creeping closer after you ceased to hear it  it was those noisesand the eyes  mon dieu  i shall see them in the dark foreverthe eyes that you see and those that you dont see but feelah they are the worst  all were silent for a moment and then jane spoke  and he is out there she said in an awehushed whisper  those eyes will be glaring at him tonight and at your comrade lieutenant darnot  can you leave them gentlemen without at least rendering them the passive succor which remaining here a few days longer might insure them  tut tut child said professor porter  captain dufranne is willing to remain and for my part i am perfectly willing perfectly willingas i always have been to humor your childish whims  we can utilize the morrow in recovering the chest professor suggested mr philander  quite so quite so mr philander i had almost forgotten the treasure exclaimed professor porter  possibly we can borrow some men from captain dufranne to assist us and one of the prisoners to point out the location of the chest  most assuredly my dear professor we are all yours to command said the captain  and so it was arranged that on the next day lieutenant charpentier was to take a detail of ten men and one of the mutineers of the arrow as a guide and unearth the treasure and that the cruiser would remain for a full week in the little harbor  at the end of that time it was to be assumed that darnot was truly dead and that the forest man would not return while they remained  then the two vessels were to leave with all the party  professor porter did not accompany the treasureseekers on the following day but when he saw them returning emptyhanded toward noon he hastened forward to meet themhis usual preoccupied indifference entirely vanished and in its place a nervous and excited manner  where is the treasure he cried to clayton while yet a hundred feet separated them  clayton shook his head  gone he said as he neared the professor  gone  it cannot be  who could have taken it cried professor porter  god only knows professor replied clayton  we might have thought the fellow who guided us was lying about the location but his surprise and consternation on finding no chest beneath the body of the murdered snipes were too real to be feigned  and then our spades showed us that something had been buried beneath the corpse for a hole had been there and it had been filled with loose earth  but who could have taken it repeated professor porter  suspicion might naturally fall on the men of the cruiser said lieutenant charpentier but for the fact that sublieutenant janviers here assures me that no men have had shore leavethat none has been on shore since we anchored here except under command of an officer  i do not know that you would suspect our men but i am glad that there is now no chance for suspicion to fall on them he concluded  it would never have occurred to me to suspect the men to whom we owe so much replied professor porter graciously  i would as soon suspect my dear clayton here or mr philander  the frenchmen smiled both officers and sailors  it was plain to see that a burden had been lifted from their minds  the treasure has been gone for some time continued clayton  in fact the body fell apart as we lifted it which indicates that whoever removed the treasure did so while the corpse was still fresh for it was intact when we first uncovered it  there must have been several in the party said jane who had joined them  you remember that it took four men to carry it  by jove cried clayton  thats right  it must have been done by a party of blacks  probably one of them saw the men bury the chest and then returned immediately after with a party of his friends and carried it off  speculation is futile said professor porter sadly  the chest is gone  we shall never see it again nor the treasure that was in it  only jane knew what the loss meant to her father and none there knew what it meant to her  six days later captain dufranne announced that they would sail early on the morrow  jane would have begged for a further reprieve had it not been that she too had begun to believe that her forest lover would return no more  in spite of herself she began to entertain doubts and fears  the reasonableness of the arguments of these disinterested french officers commenced to convince her against her will  that he was a cannibal she would not believe but that he was an adopted member of some savage tribe at length seemed possible to her  she would not admit that he could be dead  it was impossible to believe that that perfect body so filled with triumphant life could ever cease to harbor the vital sparkas soon believe that immortality were dust  as jane permitted herself to harbor these thoughts others equally unwelcome forced themselves upon her  if he belonged to some savage tribe he had a savage wifea dozen of them perhapsand wild halfcaste children  the girl shuddered and when they told her that the cruiser would sail on the morrow she was almost glad  it was she though who suggested that arms ammunition supplies and comforts be left behind in the cabin ostensibly for that intangible personality who had signed himself tarzan of the apes and for darnot should he still be living but really she hoped for her forest godeven though his feet should prove of clay  and at the last minute she left a message for him to be transmitted by tarzan of the apes  she was the last to leave the cabin returning on some trivial pretext after the others had started for the boat  she kneeled down beside the bed in which she had spent so many nights and offered up a prayer for the safety of her primeval man and crushing his locket to her lips she murmured  i love you and because i love you i believe in you  but if i did not believe still should i love  had you come back for me and had there been no other way i would have gone into the jungle with youforever     chapter xxv  the outpost of the world   with the report of his gun darnot saw the door fly open and the figure of a man pitch headlong within onto the cabin floor  the frenchman in his panic raised his gun to fire again into the prostrate form but suddenly in the half dusk of the open door he saw that the man was white and in another instant realized that he had shot his friend and protector tarzan of the apes  with a cry of anguish darnot sprang to the apemans side and kneeling lifted the latters head in his armscalling tarzans name aloud  there was no response and then darnot placed his ear above the mans heart  to his joy he heard its steady beating beneath  carefully he lifted tarzan to the cot and then after closing and bolting the door he lighted one of the lamps and examined the wound  the bullet had struck a glancing blow upon the skull  there was an ugly flesh wound but no signs of a fracture of the skull  darnot breathed a sigh of relief and went about bathing the blood from tarzans face  soon the cool water revived him and presently he opened his eyes to look in questioning surprise at darnot  the latter had bound the wound with pieces of cloth and as he saw that tarzan had regained consciousness he arose and going to the table wrote a message which he handed to the apeman explaining the terrible mistake he had made and how thankful he was that the wound was not more serious  tarzan after reading the message sat on the edge of the couch and laughed   it is nothing he said in french and then his vocabulary failing him he wrote  you should have seen what bolgani did to me and kerchak and terkoz before i killed themthen you would laugh at such a little scratch   darnot handed tarzan the two messages that had been left for him  tarzan read the first one through with a look of sorrow on his face the second one he turned over and over searching for an openinghe had never seen a sealed envelope before  at length he handed it to darnot  the frenchman had been watching him and knew that tarzan was puzzled over the envelope  how strange it seemed that to a fullgrown white man an envelope was a mystery  darnot opened it and handed the letter back to tarzan  sitting on a camp stool the apeman spread the written sheet before him and read  to tarzan of the apes  before i leave let me add my thanks to those of mr clayton for the kindness you have shown in permitting us the use of your cabin  that you never came to make friends with us has been a great regret to us  we should have liked so much to have seen and thanked our host  there is another i should like to thank also but he did not come back though i cannot believe that he is dead  i do not know his name  he is the great white giant who wore the diamond locket upon his breast  if you know him and can speak his language carry my thanks to him and tell him that i waited seven days for him to return  tell him also that in my home in america in the city of baltimore there will always be a welcome for him if he cares to come  i found a note you wrote me lying among the leaves beneath a tree near the cabin  i do not know how you learned to love me who have never spoken to me and i am very sorry if it is true for i have already given my heart to another  but know that i am always your friend                                   jane porter   tarzan sat with gaze fixed upon the floor for nearly an hour  it was evident to him from the notes that they did not know that he and tarzan of the apes were one and the same  i have given my heart to another he repeated over and over again to himself  then she did not love him  how could she have pretended love and raised him to such a pinnacle of hope only to cast him down to such utter depths of despair  maybe her kisses were only signs of friendship  how did he know who knew nothing of the customs of human beings  suddenly he arose and bidding darnot good night as he had learned to do threw himself upon the couch of ferns that had been jane porters  darnot extinguished the lamp and lay down upon the cot  for a week they did little but rest darnot coaching tarzan in french at the end of that time the two men could converse quite easily  one night as they were sitting within the cabin before retiring tarzan turned to darnot  where is america he said  darnot pointed toward the northwest  many thousands of miles across the ocean he replied  why  i am going there  darnot shook his head  it is impossible my friend he said  tarzan rose and going to one of the cupboards returned with a wellthumbed geography  turning to a map of the world he said  i have never quite understood all this explain it to me please  when darnot had done so showing him that the blue represented all the water on the earth and the bits of other colors the continents and islands tarzan asked him to point out the spot where they now were  darnot did so  now point out america said tarzan  and as darnot placed his finger upon north america tarzan smiled and laid his palm upon the page spanning the great ocean that lay between the two continents  you see it is not so very far he said scarce the width of my hand  darnot laughed  how could he make the man understand  then he took a pencil and made a tiny point upon the shore of africa  this little mark he said is many times larger upon this map than your cabin is upon the earth  do you see now how very far it is  tarzan thought for a long time  do any white men live in africa he asked  yes  where are the nearest  darnot pointed out a spot on the shore just north of them  so close asked tarzan in surprise  yes said darnot but it is not close  have they big boats to cross the ocean  yes  we shall go there tomorrow announced tarzan  again darnot smiled and shook his head  it is too far  we should die long before we reached them  do you wish to stay here then forever asked tarzan  no said darnot  then we shall start tomorrow  i do not like it here longer  i should rather die than remain here  well answered darnot with a shrug i do not know my friend but that i also would rather die than remain here  if you go i shall go with you  it is settled then said tarzan  i shall start for america tomorrow  how will you get to america without money asked darnot  what is money inquired tarzan  it took a long time to make him understand even imperfectly  how do men get money he asked at last  they work for it  very well  i will work for it then  no my friend returned darnot you need not worry about money nor need you work for it  i have enough money for twoenough for twenty much more than is good for one man and you shall have all you need if ever we reach civilization  so on the following day they started north along the shore  each man carrying a rifle and ammunition beside bedding and some food and cooking utensils  the latter seemed to tarzan a most useless encumbrance so he threw his away  but you must learn to eat cooked food my friend remonstrated darnot  no civilized men eat raw flesh  there will be time enough when i reach civilization said tarzan  i do not like the things and they only spoil the taste of good meat  for a month they traveled north  sometimes finding food in plenty and again going hungry for days  they saw no signs of natives nor were they molested by wild beasts their journey was a miracle of ease  tarzan asked questions and learned rapidly  darnot taught him many of the refinements of civilizationeven to the use of knife and fork but sometimes tarzan would drop them in disgust and grasp his food in his strong brown hands tearing it with his molars like a wild beast  then darnot would expostulate with him saying  you must not eat like a brute tarzan while i am trying to make a gentleman of you  mon dieu  gentlemen do not thusit is terrible  tarzan would grin sheepishly and pick up his knife and fork again but at heart he hated them  on the journey he told darnot about the great chest he had seen the sailors bury of how he had dug it up and carried it to the gathering place of the apes and buried it there  it must be the treasure chest of professor porter said darnot  it is too bad but of course you did not know  then tarzan recalled the letter written by jane to her friendthe one he had stolen when they first came to his cabin and now he knew what was in the chest and what it meant to jane  tomorrow we shall go back after it he announced to darnot  go back exclaimed darnot  but my dear fellow we have now been three weeks upon the march  it would require three more to return to the treasure and then with that enormous weight which required you say four sailors to carry it would be months before we had again reached this spot  it must be done my friend insisted tarzan  you may go on toward civilization and i will return for the treasure  i can go very much faster alone  i have a better plan tarzan exclaimed darnot  we shall go on together to the nearest settlement and there we will charter a boat and sail back down the coast for the treasure and so transport it easily  that will be safer and quicker and also not require us to be separated  what do you think of that plan  very well said tarzan  the treasure will be there whenever we go for it and while i could fetch it now and catch up with you in a moon or two i shall feel safer for you to know that you are not alone on the trail  when i see how helpless you are darnot i often wonder how the human race has escaped annihilation all these ages which you tell me about  why sabor single handed could exterminate a thousand of you  darnot laughed  you will think more highly of your genus when you have seen its armies and navies its great cities and its mighty engineering works  then you will realize that it is mind and not muscle that makes the human animal greater than the mighty beasts of your jungle  alone and unarmed a single man is no match for any of the larger beasts but if ten men were together they would combine their wits and their muscles against their savage enemies while the beasts being unable to reason would never think of combining against the men otherwise tarzan of the apes how long would you have lasted in the savage wilderness  you are right darnot replied tarzan for if kerchak had come to tublats aid that night at the dumdum there would have been an end of me  but kerchak could never think far enough ahead to take advantage of any such opportunity  even kala my mother could never plan ahead she simply ate what she needed when she needed it and if the supply was very scarce even though she found plenty for several meals she would never gather any ahead  i remember that she used to think it very silly of me to burden myself with extra food upon the march though she was quite glad to eat it with me if the way chanced to be barren of sustenance  then you knew your mother tarzan asked darnot in surprise  yes  she was a great fine ape larger than i and weighing twice as much  and your father asked darnot  i did not know him  kala told me he was a white ape and hairless like myself  i know now that he must have been a white man  darnot looked long and earnestly at his companion  tarzan he said at length it is impossible that the ape kala was your mother  if such a thing can be which i doubt you would have inherited some of the characteristics of the ape but you have notyou are pure man and i should say the offspring of highly bred and intelligent parents  have you not the slightest clue to your past  not the slightest replied tarzan  no writings in the cabin that might have told something of the lives of its original inmates  i have read everything that was in the cabin with the exception of one book which i know now to be written in a language other than english possibly you can read it  tarzan fished the little black diary from the bottom of his quiver and handed it to his companion  darnot glanced at the title page  it is the diary of john clayton lord greystoke an english nobleman and it is written in french he said  then he proceeded to read the diary that had been written over twenty years before and which recorded the details of the story which we already knowthe story of adventure hardships and sorrow of john clayton and his wife alice from the day they left england until an hour before he was struck down by kerchak  darnot read aloud  at times his voice broke and he was forced to stop reading for the pitiful hopelessness that spoke between the lines  occasionally he glanced at tarzan but the apeman sat upon his haunches like a carven image his eyes fixed upon the ground  only when the little babe was mentioned did the tone of the diary alter from the habitual note of despair which had crept into it by degrees after the first two months upon the shore  then the passages were tinged with a subdued happiness that was even sadder than the rest  one entry showed an almost hopeful spirit  today our little boy is six months old  he is sitting in alices lap beside the table where i am writinga happy healthy perfect child  somehow even against all reason i seem to see him a grown man taking his fathers place in the worldthe second john claytonand bringing added honors to the house of greystoke  thereas though to give my prophecy the weight of his endorsementhe has grabbed my pen in his chubby fists and with his inkbegrimed little fingers has placed the seal of his tiny finger prints upon the page   and there on the margin of the page were the partially blurred imprints of four wee fingers and the outer half of the thumb  when darnot had finished the diary the two men sat in silence for some minutes  well  tarzan of the apes what think you asked darnot  does not this little book clear up the mystery of your parentage  why man you are lord greystoke  the book speaks of but one child he replied  its little skeleton lay in the crib where it died crying for nourishment from the first time i entered the cabin until professor porters party buried it with its father and mother beside the cabin  no that was the babe the book speaks ofand the mystery of my origin is deeper than before for i have thought much of late of the possibility of that cabin having been my birthplace  i am afraid that kala spoke the truth he concluded sadly  darnot shook his head  he was unconvinced and in his mind had sprung the determination to prove the correctness of his theory for he had discovered the key which alone could unlock the mystery or consign it forever to the realms of the unfathomable  a week later the two men came suddenly upon a clearing in the forest  in the distance were several buildings surrounded by a strong palisade between them and the enclosure stretched a cultivated field in which a number of negroes were working  the two halted at the edge of the jungle  tarzan fitted his bow with a poisoned arrow but darnot placed a hand upon his arm  what would you do tarzan he asked  they will try to kill us if they see us replied tarzan  i prefer to be the killer  maybe they are friends suggested darnot  they are black was tarzans only reply  and again he drew back his shaft  you must not tarzan cried darnot  white men do not kill wantonly  mon dieu but you have much to learn  i pity the ruffian who crosses you my wild man when i take you to paris  i will have my hands full keeping your neck from beneath the guillotine  tarzan lowered his bow and smiled  i do not know why i should kill the blacks back there in my jungle yet not kill them here  suppose numa the lion should spring out upon us i should say then i presume good morning monsieur numa how is madame numa eh  wait until the blacks spring upon you replied darnot then you may kill them  do not assume that men are your enemies until they prove it  come said tarzan let us go and present ourselves to be killed and he started straight across the field his head high held and the tropical sun beating upon his smooth brown skin  behind him came darnot clothed in some garments which had been discarded at the cabin by clayton when the officers of the french cruiser had fitted him out in more presentable fashion  presently one of the blacks looked up and beholding tarzan turned shrieking toward the palisade  in an instant the air was filled with cries of terror from the fleeing gardeners but before any had reached the palisade a white man emerged from the enclosure rifle in hand to discover the cause of the commotion  what he saw brought his rifle to his shoulder and tarzan of the apes would have felt cold lead once again had not darnot cried loudly to the man with the leveled gun  do not fire  we are friends  halt then was the reply  stop tarzan cried darnot  he thinks we are enemies  tarzan dropped into a walk and together he and darnot advanced toward the white man by the gate  the latter eyed them in puzzled bewilderment  what manner of men are you he asked in french  white men replied darnot  we have been lost in the jungle for a long time  the man had lowered his rifle and now advanced with outstretched hand  i am father constantine of the french mission here he said and i am glad to welcome you  this is monsieur tarzan father constantine replied darnot indicating the apeman and as the priest extended his hand to tarzan darnot added and i am paul darnot of the french navy  father constantine took the hand which tarzan extended in imitation of the priests act while the latter took in the superb physique and handsome face in one quick keen glance  and thus came tarzan of the apes to the first outpost of civilization  for a week they remained there and the apeman keenly observant learned much of the ways of men meanwhile black women sewed white duck garments for himself and darnot so that they might continue their journey properly clothed     chapter xxvi  the height of civilization   another month brought them to a little group of buildings at the mouth of a wide river and there tarzan saw many boats and was filled with the timidity of the wild thing by the sight of many men  gradually he became accustomed to the strange noises and the odd ways of civilization so that presently none might know that two short months before this handsome frenchman in immaculate white ducks who laughed and chatted with the gayest of them had been swinging naked through primeval forests to pounce upon some unwary victim which raw was to fill his savage belly  the knife and fork so contemptuously flung aside a month before tarzan now manipulated as exquisitely as did the polished darnot  so apt a pupil had he been that the young frenchman had labored assiduously to make of tarzan of the apes a polished gentleman in so far as nicety of manners and speech were concerned  god made you a gentleman at heart my friend darnot had said but we want his works to show upon the exterior also  as soon as they had reached the little port darnot had cabled his government of his safety and requested a threemonths leave which had been granted  he had also cabled his bankers for funds and the enforced wait of a month under which both chafed was due to their inability to charter a vessel for the return to tarzans jungle after the treasure  during their stay at the coast town monsieur tarzan became the wonder of both whites and blacks because of several occurrences which to tarzan seemed the merest of nothings  once a huge black crazed by drink had run amuck and terrorized the town until his evil star had led him to where the blackhaired french giant lolled upon the veranda of the hotel  mounting the broad steps with brandished knife the negro made straight for a party of four men sitting at a table sipping the inevitable absinthe  shouting in alarm the four took to their heels and then the black spied tarzan  with a roar he charged the apeman while half a hundred heads peered from sheltering windows and doorways to witness the butchering of the poor frenchman by the giant black  tarzan met the rush with the fighting smile that the joy of battle always brought to his lips  as the negro closed upon him steel muscles gripped the black wrist of the uplifted knifehand and a single swift wrench left the hand dangling below a broken bone  with the pain and surprise the madness left the black man and as tarzan dropped back into his chair the fellow turned crying with agony and dashed wildly toward the native village  on another occasion as tarzan and darnot sat at dinner with a number of other whites the talk fell upon lions and lion hunting  opinion was divided as to the bravery of the king of beastssome maintaining that he was an arrant coward but all agreeing that it was with a feeling of greater security that they gripped their express rifles when the monarch of the jungle roared about a camp at night  darnot and tarzan had agreed that his past be kept secret and so none other than the french officer knew of the apemans familiarity with the beasts of the jungle  monsieur tarzan has not expressed himself said one of the party  a man of his prowess who has spent some time in africa as i understand monsieur tarzan has must have had experiences with lionsyes  some replied tarzan dryly  enough to know that each of you are right in your judgment of the characteristics of the lionsyou have met  but one might as well judge all blacks by the fellow who ran amuck last week or decide that all whites are cowards because one has met a cowardly white  there is as much individuality among the lower orders gentlemen as there is among ourselves  today we may go out and stumble upon a lion which is overtimidhe runs away from us  tomorrow we may meet his uncle or his twin brother and our friends wonder why we do not return from the jungle  for myself i always assume that a lion is ferocious and so i am never caught off my guard  there would be little pleasure in hunting retorted the first speaker if one is afraid of the thing he hunts  darnot smiled  tarzan afraid  i do not exactly understand what you mean by fear said tarzan like lions fear is a different thing in different men but to me the only pleasure in the hunt is the knowledge that the hunted thing has power to harm me as much as i have to harm him  if i went out with a couple of rifles and a gun bearer and twenty or thirty beaters to hunt a lion i should not feel that the lion had much chance and so the pleasure of the hunt would be lessened in proportion to the increased safety which i felt  then i am to take it that monsieur tarzan would prefer to go naked into the jungle armed only with a jackknife to kill the king of beasts laughed the other good naturedly but with the merest touch of sarcasm in his tone  and a piece of rope added tarzan  just then the deep roar of a lion sounded from the distant jungle as though to challenge whoever dared enter the lists with him  there is your opportunity monsieur tarzan bantered the frenchman  i am not hungry said tarzan simply  the men laughed all but darnot  he alone knew that a savage beast had spoken its simple reason through the lips of the apeman  but you are afraid just as any of us would be to go out there naked armed only with a knife and a piece of rope said the banterer  is it not so  no replied tarzan  only a fool performs any act without reason  five thousand francs is a reason said the other  i wager you that amount you cannot bring back a lion from the jungle under the conditions we have namednaked and armed only with a knife and a piece of rope  tarzan glanced toward darnot and nodded his head  make it ten thousand said darnot  done replied the other  tarzan arose  i shall have to leave my clothes at the edge of the settlement so that if i do not return before daylight i shall have something to wear through the streets  you are not going now exclaimed the wagererat night  why not asked tarzan  numa walks abroad at nightit will be easier to find him  no said the other i do not want your blood upon my hands  it will be foolhardy enough if you go forth by day  i shall go now replied tarzan and went to his room for his knife and rope  the men accompanied him to the edge of the jungle where he left his clothes in a small storehouse  but when he would have entered the blackness of the undergrowth they tried to dissuade him and the wagerer was most insistent of all that he abandon his foolhardy venture  i will accede that you have won he said and the ten thousand francs are yours if you will but give up this foolish attempt which can only end in your death  tarzan laughed and in another moment the jungle had swallowed him  the men stood silent for some moments and then slowly turned and walked back to the hotel veranda  tarzan had no sooner entered the jungle than he took to the trees and it was with a feeling of exultant freedom that he swung once more through the forest branches  this was life  ah how he loved it  civilization held nothing like this in its narrow and circumscribed sphere hemmed in by restrictions and conventionalities  even clothes were a hindrance and a nuisance  at last he was free  he had not realized what a prisoner he had been  how easy it would be to circle back to the coast and then make toward the south and his own jungle and cabin  now he caught the scent of numa for he was traveling up wind presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge furclad body through the undergrowth  tarzan came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight  then the quick noose settled and tightened about the tawny throat and as he had done it a hundred times in the past tarzan made fast the end to a strong branch and while the beast fought and clawed for freedom dropped to the ground behind him and leaping upon the great back plunged his long thin blade a dozen times into the fierce heart  then with his foot upon the carcass of numa he raised his voice in the awesome victory cry of his savage tribe  for a moment tarzan stood irresolute swayed by conflicting emotions of loyalty to darnot and a mighty lust for the freedom of his own jungle at last the vision of a beautiful face and the memory of warm lips crushed to his dissolved the fascinating picture he had been drawing of his old life  the apeman threw the warm carcass of numa across his shoulders and took to the trees once more  the men upon the veranda had sat for an hour almost in silence  they had tried ineffectually to converse on various subjects and always the thing uppermost in the mind of each had caused the conversation to lapse  mon dieu said the wagerer at length i can endure it no longer  i am going into the jungle with my express and bring back that mad man  i will go with you said one  and iand iand i chorused the others  as though the suggestion had broken the spell of some horrid nightmare they hastened to their various quarters and presently were headed toward the jungleeach one heavily armed  god  what was that suddenly cried one of the party an englishman as tarzans savage cry came faintly to their ears  i heard the same thing once before said a belgian when i was in the gorilla country  my carriers said it was the cry of a great bull ape who has made a kill  darnot remembered claytons description of the awful roar with which tarzan had announced his kills and he half smiled in spite of the horror which filled him to think that the uncanny sound could have issued from a human throatfrom the lips of his friend  as the party stood finally near the edge of the jungle debating as to the best distribution of their forces they were startled by a low laugh near them and turning beheld advancing toward them a giant figure bearing a dead lion upon its broad shoulders  even darnot was thunderstruck for it seemed impossible that the man could have so quickly dispatched a lion with the pitiful weapons he had taken or that alone he could have borne the huge carcass through the tangled jungle  the men crowded about tarzan with many questions but his only answer was a laughing depreciation of his feat  to tarzan it was as though one should eulogize a butcher for his heroism in killing a cow for tarzan had killed so often for food and for selfpreservation that the act seemed anything but remarkable to him  but he was indeed a hero in the eyes of these menmen accustomed to hunting big game  incidentally he had won ten thousand francs for darnot insisted that he keep it all  this was a very important item to tarzan who was just commencing to realize the power which lay beyond the little pieces of metal and paper which always changed hands when human beings rode or ate or slept or clothed themselves or drank or worked or played or sheltered themselves from the rain or cold or sun  it had become evident to tarzan that without money one must die darnot had told him not to worry since he had more than enough for both but the apeman was learning many things and one of them was that people looked down upon one who accepted money from another without giving something of equal value in exchange  shortly after the episode of the lion hunt darnot succeeded in chartering an ancient tub for the coastwise trip to tarzans landlocked harbor  it was a happy morning for them both when the little vessel weighed anchor and made for the open sea  the trip to the beach was uneventful and the morning after they dropped anchor before the cabin tarzan garbed once more in his jungle regalia and carrying a spade set out alone for the amphitheater of the apes where lay the treasure  late the next day he returned bearing the great chest upon his shoulder and at sunrise the little vessel worked through the harbors mouth and took up her northward journey  three weeks later tarzan and darnot were passengers on board a french steamer bound for lyons and after a few days in that city darnot took tarzan to paris  the apeman was anxious to proceed to america but darnot insisted that he must accompany him to paris first nor would he divulge the nature of the urgent necessity upon which he based his demand  one of the first things which darnot accomplished after their arrival was to arrange to visit a high official of the police department an old friend and to take tarzan with him  adroitly darnot led the conversation from point to point until the policeman had explained to the interested tarzan many of the methods in vogue for apprehending and identifying criminals  not the least interesting to tarzan was the part played by finger prints in this fascinating science  but of what value are these imprints asked tarzan when after a few years the lines upon the fingers are entirely changed by the wearing out of the old tissue and the growth of new  the lines never change replied the official  from infancy to senility the fingerprints of an individual change only in size except as injuries alter the loops and whorls  but if imprints have been taken of the thumb and four fingers of both hands one must needs lose all entirely to escape identification  it is marvelous exclaimed darnot  i wonder what the lines upon my own fingers may resemble  we can soon see replied the police officer and ringing a bell he summoned an assistant to whom he issued a few directions  the man left the room but presently returned with a little hardwood box which he placed on his superiors desk  now said the officer you shall have your fingerprints in a second  he drew from the little case a square of plate glass a little tube of thick ink a rubber roller and a few snowy white cards  squeezing a drop of ink onto the glass he spread it back and forth with the rubber roller until the entire surface of the glass was covered to his satisfaction with a very thin and uniform layer of ink  place the four fingers of your right hand upon the glass thus he said to darnot  now the thumb  that is right  now place them in just the same position upon this card here noa little to the right we must leave room for the thumb and the fingers of the left hand there thats it  now the same with the left  come tarzan cried darnot lets see what your whorls look like  tarzan complied readily asking many questions of the officer during the operation  do fingerprints show racial characteristics he asked  could you determine for example solely from fingerprints whether the subject was negro or caucasian  i think not replied the officer  could the finger prints of an ape be detected from those of a man  probably because the apes would be far simpler than those of the higher organism  but a cross between an ape and a man might show the characteristics of either progenitor continued tarzan  yes i should think likely responded the official but the science has not progressed sufficiently to render it exact enough in such matters  i should hate to trust its findings further than to differentiate between individuals  there it is absolute  no two people born into the world probably have ever had identical lines upon all their digits  it is very doubtful if any single fingerprint will ever be exactly duplicated by any finger other than the one which originally made it  does the comparison require much time or labor asked darnot  ordinarily but a few moments if the impressions are distinct  darnot drew a little black book from his pocket and commenced turning the pages  tarzan looked at the book in surprise  how did darnot come to have his book  presently darnot stopped at a page on which were five tiny little smudges  he handed the open book to the policeman  are these imprints similar to mine or monsieur tarzans or can you say that they are identical with either the officer drew a powerful glass from his desk and examined all three specimens carefully making notations meanwhile upon a pad of paper  tarzan realized now what was the meaning of their visit to the police officer  the answer to his lifes riddle lay in these tiny marks  with tense nerves he sat leaning forward in his chair but suddenly he relaxed and dropped back smiling  darnot looked at him in surprise  you forget that for twenty years the dead body of the child who made those fingerprints lay in the cabin of his father and that all my life i have seen it lying there said tarzan bitterly  the policeman looked up in astonishment  go ahead captain with your examination said darnot we will tell you the story laterprovided monsieur tarzan is agreeable  tarzan nodded his head  but you are mad my dear darnot he insisted  those little fingers are buried on the west coast of africa  i do not know as to that tarzan replied darnot  it is possible but if you are not the son of john clayton then how in heavens name did you come into that god forsaken jungle where no white man other than john clayton had ever set foot  you forgetkala said tarzan  i do not even consider her replied darnot  the friends had walked to the broad window overlooking the boulevard as they talked  for some time they stood there gazing out upon the busy throng beneath each wrapped in his own thoughts  it takes some time to compare finger prints thought darnot turning to look at the police officer  to his astonishment he saw the official leaning back in his chair hastily scanning the contents of the little black diary  darnot coughed  the policeman looked up and catching his eye raised his finger to admonish silence  darnot turned back to the window and presently the police officer spoke  gentlemen he said  both turned toward him  there is evidently a great deal at stake which must hinge to a greater or lesser extent upon the absolute correctness of this comparison  i therefore ask that you leave the entire matter in my hands until monsieur desquerc our expert returns  it will be but a matter of a few days  i had hoped to know at once said darnot  monsieur tarzan sails for america tomorrow  i will promise that you can cable him a report within two weeks replied the officer but what it will be i dare not say  there are resemblances yetwell we had better leave it for monsieur desquerc to solve     chapter xxvii  the giant again   a taxicab drew up before an oldfashioned residence upon the outskirts of baltimore  a man of about forty well built and with strong regular features stepped out and paying the chauffeur dismissed him  a moment later the passenger was entering the library of the old home  ah mr canler exclaimed an old man rising to greet him  good evening my dear professor cried the man extending a cordial hand  who admitted you asked the professor  esmeralda  then she will acquaint jane with the fact that you are here said the old man  no professor replied canler for i came primarily to see you  ah i am honored said professor porter  professor continued robert canler with great deliberation as though carefully weighing his words i have come this evening to speak with you about jane  you know my aspirations and you have been generous enough to approve my suit  professor archimedes q porter fidgeted in his armchair  the subject always made him uncomfortable  he could not understand why  canler was a splendid match  but jane continued canler i cannot understand her  she puts me off first on one ground and then another  i have always the feeling that she breathes a sigh of relief every time i bid her goodby  tut tut said professor porter  tut tut mr canler  jane is a most obedient daughter  she will do precisely as i tell her  then i can still count on your support asked canler a tone of relief marking his voice  certainly sir certainly sir exclaimed professor porter  how could you doubt it  there is young clayton you know suggested canler he has been hanging about for months  i dont know that jane cares for him but beside his title they say he has inherited a very considerable estate from his father and it might not be strangeif he finally won her unless and canler paused  tuttut mr canler unlesswhat  unless you see fit to request that jane and i be married at once said canler slowly and distinctly  i have already suggested to jane that it would be desirable said professor porter sadly for we can no longer afford to keep up this house and live as her associations demand  what was her reply asked canler  she said she was not ready to marry anyone yet replied professor porter and that we could go and live upon the farm in northern wisconsin which her mother left her  it is a little more than selfsupporting  the tenants have always made a living from it and been able to send jane a trifle beside each year  she is planning on our going up there the first of the week philander and mr clayton have already gone to get things in readiness for us  clayton has gone there exclaimed canler visibly chagrined  why was i not told  i would gladly have gone and seen that every comfort was provided  jane feels that we are already too much in your debt mr canler said professor porter  canler was about to reply when the sound of footsteps came from the hall without and jane entered the room  oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed pausing on the threshold  i thought you were alone papa  it is only i jane said canler who had risen wont you come in and join the family group  we were just speaking of you  thank you said jane entering and taking the chair canler placed for her  i only wanted to tell papa that tobey is coming down from the college tomorrow to pack his books  i want you to be sure papa to indicate all that you can do without until fall  please dont carry this entire library to wisconsin as you would have carried it to africa if i had not put my foot down  was tobey here asked professor porter  yes i just left him  he and esmeralda are exchanging religious experiences on the back porch now  tut tut i must see him at once cried the professor  excuse me just a moment children and the old man hastened from the room  as soon as he was out of earshot canler turned to jane  see here jane he said bluntly  how long is this thing going on like this  you havent refused to marry me but you havent promised either  i want to get the license tomorrow so that we can be married quietly before you leave for wisconsin  i dont care for any fuss or feathers and im sure you dont either  the girl turned cold but she held her head bravely  your father wishes it you know added canler  yes i know  she spoke scarcely above a whisper  do you realize that you are buying me mr canler she said finally and in a cold level voice  buying me for a few paltry dollars  of course you do robert canler and the hope of just such a contingency was in your mind when you loaned papa the money for that hairbrained escapade which but for a most mysterious circumstance would have been surprisingly successful  but you mr canler would have been the most surprised  you had no idea that the venture would succeed  you are too good a businessman for that  and you are too good a businessman to loan money for buried treasure seeking or to loan money without securityunless you had some special object in view  you knew that without security you had a greater hold on the honor of the porters than with it  you knew the one best way to force me to marry you without seeming to force me  you have never mentioned the loan  in any other man i should have thought that the prompting of a magnanimous and noble character  but you are deep mr robert canler  i know you better than you think i know you  i shall certainly marry you if there is no other way but let us understand each other once and for all  while she spoke robert canler had alternately flushed and paled and when she ceased speaking he arose and with a cynical smile upon his strong face said  you surprise me jane  i thought you had more selfcontrolmore pride  of course you are right  i am buying you and i knew that you knew it but i thought you would prefer to pretend that it was otherwise  i should have thought your self respect and your porter pride would have shrunk from admitting even to yourself that you were a bought woman  but have it your own way dear girl he added lightly  i am going to have you and that is all that interests me  without a word the girl turned and left the room  jane was not married before she left with her father and esmeralda for her little wisconsin farm and as she coldly bid robert canler goodby as her train pulled out he called to her that he would join them in a week or two  at their destination they were met by clayton and mr philander in a huge touring car belonging to the former and quickly whirled away through the dense northern woods toward the little farm which the girl had not visited before since childhood  the farmhouse which stood on a little elevation some hundred yards from the tenant house had undergone a complete transformation during the three weeks that clayton and mr philander had been there  the former had imported a small army of carpenters and plasterers plumbers and painters from a distant city and what had been but a dilapidated shell when they reached it was now a cosy little twostory house filled with every modern convenience procurable in so short a time  why mr clayton what have you done cried jane porter her heart sinking within her as she realized the probable size of the expenditure that had been made  ssh cautioned clayton  dont let your father guess  if you dont tell him he will never notice and i simply couldnt think of him living in the terrible squalor and sordidness which mr philander and i found  it was so little when i would like to do so much jane  for his sake please never mention it  but you know that we cant repay you cried the girl  why do you want to put me under such terrible obligations  dont jane said clayton sadly  if it had been just you believe me i wouldnt have done it for i knew from the start that it would only hurt me in your eyes but i couldnt think of that dear old man living in the hole we found here  wont you please believe that i did it just for him and give me that little crumb of pleasure at least  i do believe you mr clayton said the girl because i know you are big enough and generous enough to have done it just for himand oh cecil i wish i might repay you as you deserveas you would wish  why cant you jane  because i love another  canler  no  but you are going to marry him  he told me as much before i left baltimore  the girl winced  i do not love him she said almost proudly  is it because of the money jane  she nodded  then am i so much less desirable than canler  i have money enough and far more for every need he said bitterly  i do not love you cecil she said but i respect you  if i must disgrace myself by such a bargain with any man i prefer that it be one i already despise  i should loathe the man to whom i sold myself without love whomsoever he might be  you will be happier she concluded alonewith my respect and friendship than with me and my contempt  he did not press the matter further but if ever a man had murder in his heart it was william cecil clayton lord greystoke when a week later robert canler drew up before the farmhouse in his purring six cylinder  a week passed a tense uneventful but uncomfortable week for all the inmates of the little wisconsin farmhouse  canler was insistent that jane marry him at once  at length she gave in from sheer loathing of the continued and hateful importuning  it was agreed that on the morrow canler was to drive to town and bring back the license and a minister  clayton had wanted to leave as soon as the plan was announced but the girls tired hopeless look kept him  he could not desert her  something might happen yet he tried to console himself by thinking and in his heart he knew that it would require but a tiny spark to turn his hatred for canler into the blood lust of the killer  early the next morning canler set out for town  in the east smoke could be seen lying low over the forest for a fire had been raging for a week not far from them but the wind still lay in the west and no danger threatened them  about noon jane started off for a walk  she would not let clayton accompany her  she wanted to be alone she said and he respected her wishes  in the house professor porter and mr philander were immersed in an absorbing discussion of some weighty scientific problem  esmeralda dozed in the kitchen and clayton heavyeyed after a sleepless night threw himself down upon the couch in the living room and soon dropped into a fitful slumber  to the east the black smoke clouds rose higher into the heavens suddenly they eddied and then commenced to drift rapidly toward the west  on and on they came  the inmates of the tenant house were gone for it was market day and none was there to see the rapid approach of the fiery demon  soon the flames had spanned the road to the south and cut off canlers return  a little fluctuation of the wind now carried the path of the forest fire to the north then blew back and the flames nearly stood still as though held in leash by some master hand  suddenly out of the northeast a great black car came careening down the road  with a jolt it stopped before the cottage and a blackhaired giant leaped out to run up onto the porch  without a pause he rushed into the house  on the couch lay clayton  the man started in surprise but with a bound was at the side of the sleeping man  shaking him roughly by the shoulder he cried  my god clayton are you all mad here  dont you know you are nearly surrounded by fire  where is miss porter  clayton sprang to his feet  he did not recognize the man but he understood the words and was upon the veranda in a bound  scott he cried and then dashing back into the house jane  jane where are you  in an instant esmeralda professor porter and mr philander had joined the two men  where is miss jane cried clayton seizing esmeralda by the shoulders and shaking her roughly  oh gaberelle mister clayton she done gone for a walk  hasnt she come back yet and without waiting for a reply clayton dashed out into the yard followed by the others  which way did she go cried the blackhaired giant of esmeralda  down that road cried the frightened woman pointing toward the south where a mighty wall of roaring flames shut out the view  put these people in the other car shouted the stranger to clayton i saw one as i drove upand get them out of here by the north road  leave my car here  if i find miss porter we shall need it  if i dont no one will need it  do as i say as clayton hesitated and then they saw the lithe figure bound away cross the clearing toward the northwest where the forest still stood untouched by flame  in each rose the unaccountable feeling that a great responsibility had been raised from their shoulders a kind of implicit confidence in the power of the stranger to save jane if she could be saved  who was that asked professor porter  i do not know replied clayton  he called me by name and he knew jane for he asked for her  and he called esmeralda by name  there was something most startlingly familiar about him exclaimed mr philander and yet bless me i know i never saw him before  tut tut cried professor porter  most remarkable  who could it have been and why do i feel that jane is safe now that he has set out in search of her  i cant tell you professor said clayton soberly but i know i have the same uncanny feeling  but come he cried we must get out of here ourselves or we shall be shut off and the party hastened toward claytons car  when jane turned to retrace her steps homeward she was alarmed to note how near the smoke of the forest fire seemed and as she hastened onward her alarm became almost a panic when she perceived that the rushing flames were rapidly forcing their way between herself and the cottage  at length she was compelled to turn into the dense thicket and attempt to force her way to the west in an effort to circle around the flames and reach the house  in a short time the futility of her attempt became apparent and then her one hope lay in retracing her steps to the road and flying for her life to the south toward the town  the twenty minutes that it took her to regain the road was all that had been needed to cut off her retreat as effectually as her advance had been cut off before  a short run down the road brought her to a horrified stand for there before her was another wall of flame  an arm of the main conflagration had shot out a half mile south of its parent to embrace this tiny strip of road in its implacable clutches  jane knew that it was useless again to attempt to force her way through the undergrowth  she had tried it once and failed  now she realized that it would be but a matter of minutes ere the whole space between the north and the south would be a seething mass of billowing flames  calmly the girl kneeled down in the dust of the roadway and prayed for strength to meet her fate bravely and for the delivery of her father and her friends from death  suddenly she heard her name being called aloud through the forest  jane  jane porter  it rang strong and clear but in a strange voice  here she called in reply  here  in the roadway  then through the branches of the trees she saw a figure swinging with the speed of a squirrel  a veering of the wind blew a cloud of smoke about them and she could no longer see the man who was speeding toward her but suddenly she felt a great arm about her  then she was lifted up and she felt the rushing of the wind and the occasional brush of a branch as she was borne along  she opened her eyes  far below her lay the undergrowth and the hard earth  about her was the waving foliage of the forest  from tree to tree swung the giant figure which bore her and it seemed to jane that she was living over in a dream the experience that had been hers in that far african jungle  oh if it were but the same man who had borne her so swiftly through the tangled verdure on that other day but that was impossible  yet who else in all the world was there with the strength and agility to do what this man was now doing  she stole a sudden glance at the face close to hers and then she gave a little frightened gasp  it was he  my forest man she murmured  no i must be delirious  yes your man jane porter  your savage primeval man come out of the jungle to claim his matethe woman who ran away from him he added almost fiercely  i did not run away she whispered  i would only consent to leave when they had waited a week for you to return  they had come to a point beyond the fire now and he had turned back to the clearing  side by side they were walking toward the cottage  the wind had changed once more and the fire was burning back upon itselfanother hour like that and it would be burned out  why did you not return she asked  i was nursing darnot  he was badly wounded  ah i knew it she exclaimed  they said you had gone to join the blacksthat they were your people  he laughed  but you did not believe them jane  nowhat shall i call you she asked  what is your name  i was tarzan of the apes when you first knew me he said  tarzan of the apes she criedand that was your note i answered when i left  yes whose did you think it was  i did not know only that it could not be yours for tarzan of the apes had written in english and you could not understand a word of any language  again he laughed  it is a long story but it was i who wrote what i could not speakand now darnot has made matters worse by teaching me to speak french instead of english  come he added jump into my car we must overtake your father they are only a little way ahead  as they drove along he said  then when you said in your note to tarzan of the apes that you loved anotheryou might have meant me  i might have she answered simply  but in baltimoreoh how i have searched for youthey told me you would possibly be married by now  that a man named canler had come up here to wed you  is that true  yes  do you love him  no  do you love me  she buried her face in her hands  i am promised to another  i cannot answer you tarzan of the apes she cried  you have answered  now tell me why you would marry one you do not love  my father owes him money  suddenly there came back to tarzan the memory of the letter he had readand the name robert canler and the hinted trouble which he had been unable to understand then  he smiled  if your father had not lost the treasure you would not feel forced to keep your promise to this man canler  i could ask him to release me  and if he refused  i have given my promise  he was silent for a moment  the car was plunging along the uneven road at a reckless pace for the fire showed threateningly at their right and another change of the wind might sweep it on with raging fury across this one avenue of escape  finally they passed the danger point and tarzan reduced their speed  suppose i should ask him ventured tarzan  he would scarcely accede to the demand of a stranger said the girl especially one who wanted me himself  terkoz did said tarzan grimly  jane shuddered and looked fearfully up at the giant figure beside her for she knew that he meant the great anthropoid he had killed in her defense  this is not the african jungle she said  you are no longer a savage beast  you are a gentleman and gentlemen do not kill in cold blood  i am still a wild beast at heart he said in a low voice as though to himself  again they were silent for a time  jane said the man at length if you were free would you marry me  she did not reply at once but he waited patiently  the girl was trying to collect her thoughts  what did she know of this strange creature at her side  what did he know of himself  who was he  who his parents  why his very name echoed his mysterious origin and his savage life  he had no name  could she be happy with this jungle waif  could she find anything in common with a husband whose life had been spent in the tree tops of an african wilderness frolicking and fighting with fierce anthropoids tearing his food from the quivering flank of freshkilled prey sinking his strong teeth into raw flesh and tearing away his portion while his mates growled and fought about him for their share  could he ever rise to her social sphere  could she bear to think of sinking to his  would either be happy in such a horrible misalliance  you do not answer he said  do you shrink from wounding me  i do not know what answer to make said jane sadly  i do not know my own mind  you do not love me then he asked in a level tone  do not ask me  you will be happier without me  you were never meant for the formal restrictions and conventionalities of societycivilization would become irksome to you and in a little while you would long for the freedom of your old lifea life to which i am as totally unfitted as you to mine  i think i understand you he replied quietly  i shall not urge you for i would rather see you happy than to be happy myself  i see now that you could not be happy withan ape  there was just the faintest tinge of bitterness in his voice  dont she remonstrated  dont say that  you do not understand  but before she could go on a sudden turn in the road brought them into the midst of a little hamlet  before them stood claytons car surrounded by the party he had brought from the cottage     chapter xxviii  conclusion   at the sight of jane cries of relief and delight broke from every lip and as tarzans car stopped beside the other professor porter caught his daughter in his arms  for a moment no one noticed tarzan sitting silently in his seat  clayton was the first to remember and turning held out his hand  how can we ever thank you he exclaimed  you have saved us all you called me by name at the cottage but i do not seem to recall yours though there is something very familiar about you  it is as though i had known you well under very different conditions a long time ago  tarzan smiled as he took the proffered hand  you are quite right monsieur clayton he said in french  you will pardon me if i do not speak to you in english  i am just learning it and while i understand it fairly well i speak it very poorly  but who are you insisted clayton speaking in french this time himself  tarzan of the apes  clayton started back in surprise  by jove he exclaimed  it is true  and professor porter and mr philander pressed forward to add their thanks to claytons and to voice their surprise and pleasure at seeing their jungle friend so far from his savage home  the party now entered the modest little hostelry where clayton soon made arrangements for their entertainment  they were sitting in the little stuffy parlor when the distant chugging of an approaching automobile caught their attention  mr philander who was sitting near the window looked out as the car drew in sight finally stopping beside the other automobiles  bless me said mr philander a shade of annoyance in his tone  it is mr canler  i had hoped eri had thought orerhow very happy we should be that he was not caught in the fire he ended lamely  tut tut  mr philander said professor porter  tut tut  i have often admonished my pupils to count ten before speaking  were i you mr philander i should count at least a thousand and then maintain a discreet silence  bless me yes acquiesced mr philander  but who is the clerical appearing gentleman with him  jane blanched  clayton moved uneasily in his chair  professor porter removed his spectacles nervously and breathed upon them but replaced them on his nose without wiping  the ubiquitous esmeralda grunted  only tarzan did not comprehend  presently robert canler burst into the room  thank god he cried  i feared the worst until i saw your car clayton  i was cut off on the south road and had to go away back to town and then strike east to this road  i thought wed never reach the cottage  no one seemed to enthuse much  tarzan eyed robert canler as sabor eyes her prey  jane glanced at him and coughed nervously  mr canler she said this is monsieur tarzan an old friend  canler turned and extended his hand  tarzan rose and bowed as only darnot could have taught a gentleman to do it but he did not seem to see canlers hand  nor did canler appear to notice the oversight  this is the reverend mr tousley jane said canler turning to the clerical party behind him  mr tousley miss porter  mr tousley bowed and beamed  canler introduced him to the others  we can have the ceremony at once jane said canler  then you and i can catch the midnight train in town  tarzan understood the plan instantly  he glanced out of halfclosed eyes at jane but he did not move  the girl hesitated  the room was tense with the silence of taut nerves  all eyes turned toward jane awaiting her reply  cant we wait a few days she asked  i am all unstrung  i have been through so much today  canler felt the hostility that emanated from each member of the party it made him angry  we have waited as long as i intend to wait he said roughly  you have promised to marry me  i shall be played with no longer  i have the license and here is the preacher  come mr tousley come jane there are plenty of witnessesmore than enough he added with a disagreeable inflection and taking jane porter by the arm he started to lead her toward the waiting minister  but scarcely had he taken a single step ere a heavy hand closed upon his arm with a grip of steel  another hand shot to his throat and in a moment he was being shaken high above the floor as a cat might shake a mouse  jane turned in horrified surprise toward tarzan  and as she looked into his face she saw the crimson band upon his forehead that she had seen that other day in far distant africa when tarzan of the apes had closed in mortal combat with the great anthropoidterkoz  she knew that murder lay in that savage heart and with a little cry of horror she sprang forward to plead with the apeman  but her fears were more for tarzan than for canler  she realized the stern retribution which justice metes to the murderer  before she could reach them however clayton had jumped to tarzans side and attempted to drag canler from his grasp  with a single sweep of one mighty arm the englishman was hurled across the room and then jane laid a firm white hand upon tarzans wrist and looked up into his eyes  for my sake she said  the grasp upon canlers throat relaxed  tarzan looked down into the beautiful face before him  do you wish this to live he asked in surprise  i do not wish him to die at your hands my friend she replied  i do not wish you to become a murderer  tarzan removed his hand from canlers throat  do you release her from her promise he asked  it is the price of your life  canler gasping for breath nodded  will you go away and never molest her further  again the man nodded his head his face distorted by fear of the death that had been so close  tarzan released him and canler staggered toward the door  in another moment he was gone and the terrorstricken preacher with him  tarzan turned toward jane  may i speak with you for a moment alone he asked  the girl nodded and started toward the door leading to the narrow veranda of the little hotel  she passed out to await tarzan and so did not hear the conversation which followed  wait cried professor porter as tarzan was about to follow  the professor had been stricken dumb with surprise by the rapid developments of the past few minutes  before we go further sir i should like an explanation of the events which have just transpired  by what right sir did you interfere between my daughter and mr canler  i had promised him her hand sir and regardless of our personal likes or dislikes sir that promise must be kept  i interfered professor porter replied tarzan because your daughter does not love mr canlershe does not wish to marry him that is enough for me to know  you do not know what you have done said professor porter  now he will doubtless refuse to marry her  he most certainly will said tarzan emphatically  and further added tarzan you need not fear that your pride will suffer professor porter for you will be able to pay the canler person what you owe him the moment you reach home  tut tut sir exclaimed professor porter  what do you mean sir  your treasure has been found said tarzan  whatwhat is that you are saying cried the professor  you are mad man  it cannot be  it is though  it was i who stole it not knowing either its value or to whom it belonged  i saw the sailors bury it and apelike i had to dig it up and bury it again elsewhere  when darnot told me what it was and what it meant to you i returned to the jungle and recovered it it had caused so much crime and suffering and sorrow that darnot thought it best not to attempt to bring the treasure itself on here as had been my intention so i have brought a letter of credit instead  here it is professor porter and tarzan drew an envelope from his pocket and handed it to the astonished professor two hundred and fortyone thousand dollars  the treasure was most carefully appraised by experts but lest there should be any question in your mind darnot himself bought it and is holding it for you should you prefer the treasure to the credit  to the already great burden of the obligations we owe you sir said professor porter with trembling voice is now added this greatest of all services  you have given me the means to save my honor  clayton who had left the room a moment after canler now returned  pardon me he said  i think we had better try to reach town before dark and take the first train out of this forest  a native just rode by from the north who reports that the fire is moving slowly in this direction  this announcement broke up further conversation and the entire party went out to the waiting automobiles  clayton with jane the professor and esmeralda occupied claytons car while tarzan took mr philander in with him  bless me exclaimed mr philander as the car moved off after clayton  who would ever have thought it possible  the last time i saw you you were a veritable wild man skipping about among the branches of a tropical african forest and now you are driving me along a wisconsin road in a french automobile  bless me  but it is most remarkable  yes assented tarzan and then after a pause mr philander do you recall any of the details of the finding and burying of three skeletons found in my cabin beside that african jungle  very distinctly sir very distinctly replied mr philander  was there anything peculiar about any of those skeletons  mr philander eyed tarzan narrowly  why do you ask  it means a great deal to me to know replied tarzan  your answer may clear up a mystery  it can do no worse at any rate than to leave it still a mystery  i have been entertaining a theory concerning those skeletons for the past two months and i want you to answer my question to the best of your knowledgewere the three skeletons you buried all human skeletons  no said mr philander the smallest one the one found in the crib was the skeleton of an anthropoid ape  thank you said tarzan  in the car ahead jane was thinking fast and furiously  she had felt the purpose for which tarzan had asked a few words with her and she knew that she must be prepared to give him an answer in the very near future  he was not the sort of person one could put off and somehow that very thought made her wonder if she did not really fear him  and could she love where she feared  she realized the spell that had been upon her in the depths of that faroff jungle but there was no spell of enchantment now in prosaic wisconsin  nor did the immaculate young frenchman appeal to the primal woman in her as had the stalwart forest god  did she love him  she did not knownow  she glanced at clayton out of the corner of her eye  was not here a man trained in the same school of environment in which she had been traineda man with social position and culture such as she had been taught to consider as the prime essentials to congenial association  did not her best judgment point to this young english nobleman whose love she knew to be of the sort a civilized woman should crave as the logical mate for such as herself  could she love clayton  she could see no reason why she could not jane was not coldly calculating by nature but training environment and heredity had all combined to teach her to reason even in matters of the heart  that she had been carried off her feet by the strength of the young giant when his great arms were about her in the distant african forest and again today in the wisconsin woods seemed to her only attributable to a temporary mental reversion to type on her partto the psychological appeal of the primeval man to the primeval woman in her nature  if he should never touch her again she reasoned she would never feel attracted toward him  she had not loved him then  it had been nothing more than a passing hallucination superinduced by excitement and by personal contact  excitement would not always mark their future relations should she marry him and the power of personal contact eventually would be dulled by familiarity  again she glanced at clayton  he was very handsome and every inch a gentleman  she should be very proud of such a husband  and then he spokea minute sooner or a minute later might have made all the difference in the world to three livesbut chance stepped in and pointed out to clayton the psychological moment  you are free now jane he said  wont you say yesi will devote my life to making you very happy  yes she whispered  that evening in the little waiting room at the station tarzan caught jane alone for a moment  you are free now jane he said and i have come across the ages out of the dim and distant past from the lair of the primeval man to claim youfor your sake i have become a civilized manfor your sake i have crossed oceans and continentsfor your sake i will be whatever you will me to be  i can make you happy jane in the life you know and love best  will you marry me  for the first time she realized the depths of the mans loveall that he had accomplished in so short a time solely for love of her  turning her head she buried her face in her arms  what had she done  because she had been afraid she might succumb to the pleas of this giant she had burned her bridges behind herin her groundless apprehension that she might make a terrible mistake she had made a worse one  and then she told him alltold him the truth word by word without attempting to shield herself or condone her error  what can we do he asked  you have admitted that you love me  you know that i love you but i do not know the ethics of society by which you are governed  i shall leave the decision to you for you know best what will be for your eventual welfare  i cannot tell him tarzan she said  he too loves me and he is a good man  i could never face you nor any other honest person if i repudiated my promise to mr clayton  i shall have to keep itand you must help me bear the burden though we may not see each other again after tonight  the others were entering the room now and tarzan turned toward the little window  but he saw nothing outsidewithin he saw a patch of greensward surrounded by a matted mass of gorgeous tropical plants and flowers and above the waving foliage of mighty trees and over all the blue of an equatorial sky  in the center of the greensward a young woman sat upon a little mound of earth and beside her sat a young giant  they ate pleasant fruit and looked into each others eyes and smiled  they were very happy and they were all alone  his thoughts were broken in upon by the station agent who entered asking if there was a gentleman by the name of tarzan in the party  i am monsieur tarzan said the apeman  here is a message for you forwarded from baltimore it is a cablegram from paris  tarzan took the envelope and tore it open  the message was from darnot  it read   fingerprints prove you greystoke  congratulations                                       darnot   as tarzan finished reading clayton entered and came toward him with extended hand  here was the man who had tarzans title and tarzans estates and was going to marry the woman whom tarzan lovedthe woman who loved tarzan a single word from tarzan would make a great difference in this mans life  it would take away his title and his lands and his castles andit would take them away from jane porter also  i say old man cried clayton i havent had a chance to thank you for all youve done for us  it seems as though you had your hands full saving our lives in africa and here  im awfully glad you came on here  we must get better acquainted  i often thought about you you know and the remarkable circumstances of your environment  if its any of my business how the devil did you ever get into that bally jungle  i was born there said tarzan quietly  my mother was an ape and of course she couldnt tell me much about it  i never knew who my father was                     for the       further adventures of lord greystoke           read the return of tarzan
