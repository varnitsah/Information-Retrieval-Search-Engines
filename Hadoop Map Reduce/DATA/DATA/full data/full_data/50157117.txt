the battlefield the sea the sea    preface   my dear lads  the present story was written and published a few months only after the termination of the francogerman war at that time the planwhich i have since carried out in the young buglers cornet of horse and in times of peril and which i hope to continue in further volumesof giving under the guise of historical tales full and accurate accounts of all the leading events of great wars had not occurred to me my object was only to represent one phase of the strugglethe action of the bodies of volunteer troops known as franc tireurs  the story is laid in france and is therefore written from the french point of view the names places and dates have been changed but circumstances and incidents are true there were a good many english among the franc tireurs and boys of from fifteen to sixteen were by no means uncommon in their ranks having been abroad during the whole of the war i saw a good deal of these irregulars and had several intimate friends amongst them upon the whole these corps did much less service to the cause of france than might have been reasonably expected they were too often badly led and were sometimes absolutely worse than useless  but there were brilliant exceptions and very many of those daring actions were performed whichwhile requiring heroism and courage of the highest kindare unknown to the world in general and find no place in history many of the occurrences in this tale are related almost in the words in which they were described to me by those who took part in them and nearly every fact and circumstance actually occurred according to my own knowledge without aspiring to the rank of a history however slight the story will give you a fair idea of what the life of the franc tireurs was and of what some of them actually went through suffered and performed  yours sincerely  the author    chapter 1 the outbreak of war   the usually quiet old town of dijon was in a state of excitement there were groups of people in the streets especially round the corners where the official placards were posted up both at the prefecture and the maine there were streams of callers all day every functionary wore an air of importance and mystery and mounted orderlies galloped here and there at headlong speed the gendarmes had twisted their mustaches to even finer points than usual and walked about with the air of men who knew all about the matter and had gone through more serious affairs than this was likely to be  in the marketplace the excitement and buzz of conversation were at their highest it was the market day and the whole area of the square was full never in the memory of the oldest inhabitant had such a market been seen in dijon for the ten days preceding france had been on the tiptoe of expectation and every peasants wife and daughter for miles round the town had come with their baskets of eggs fowls or fruits to attend the market and to hear the news so crowded was it that it was really difficult to move about people were not however unmindful of bargainsfor the french peasant woman is a thrifty body and has a shrewd eye to sousso the chaffering and haggling which almost invariably precede each purchase went on as briskly as usual but between times all thoughts and all tongues ran upon the great event of the day  it was certainquite certain nowthat there was to be war with prussia the newspapers had said so for some days but then bah who believes a newspaper monsieur le prefect had published the news today and everyone knows that monsieur le prefect is not a man to say a thing unless it were true most likely the emperor himself had written to him oh there could be no doubt about it now  it was singular to hear amidst all the talk that the speculation and argument turned but little upon the chances of the war itself it being tacitly assumed to be a matter of course that the germans would be defeated with ease by the french the great subject of speculation was upon the points which directly affected the speakers would the mobiles be called out and forced to march would soldiers who had served their time be recalled to the service even if they were married and would next years conscripts be called out at once these were the questions which everyone asked but no one could answer in another day or two it was probable that the orders respecting these matters would arrive and in the meantime the merry burgundian girls endeavored to hide their own uneasiness by laughingly predicting an early summons to arms to the young men of their acquaintance  at the lyceeor great schoolthe boys are just coming out they are too excited to attend to lessons and have been released hours before their usual time they troop out from the great doors talking and gesticulating their excitement however takes a different form to that which that of english boys would do under the same circumstances there was no shouting no pushing no practical jokes the french boy does not play at least he does not play roughly when young he does indeed sometimes play at buchona game something similar to the game of buttons as played by english street boys he may occasionally play at marbles but after twelve years of age he puts aside games as beneath him prisoners base football and cricket are alike unknown to him and he considers any exertion which would disarrange his hair or his shirt collar as barbarous and absurd his amusements are walking in the public promenade talking politics with the gravity of a man of sixty and discussing the local news and gossip  this is the general type of french school boy of course there are many exceptions and in the lycee of dijon these were more numerous than usual this was due to a great extent to the influence of the two boys who are coming out of the school at the present moment ralph and percy barclay areas one can see at first sightenglish that is to say their father is english and they have taken after him and not after their french mother they are french born for they first saw the light at the pretty cottage where they still live about two miles out of the town but their father captain barclay has brought them up as english boys and they have been for two years at a school in england  their example has had some effect their cousins louis and philippe duburg are almost as fond of cricket and other games and of taking long rambles for miles round as they are themselves other boys have also taken to these amusements and consequently you would see more square figures more healthy faces at the lycee at dijon than at most other french schools the boys who joined in these games formed a set in themselves apart from the rest they were called either the english set or contemptuously the savages but this latter name was not often applied to them before their faces for the young barclays had learned to box in england and their cousins as well as a few of the others had practised with the gloves with them consequently although the savages might be wondered at and sneered at behind their backs the offensive name was never applied in their hearing  at the present moment ralph barclay was the center of a knot of lads of his own age  and so you dont think that we shall get to berlin ralph barclay you think that these prussian louts are going to beat the french army look now it is a little strong to say that in a french town  but i dont say that at all ralph barclay said you are talking as if it was a certainty that we were going to march over the prussians i simply say dont be too positive there can be no doubt about the courage of the french army but pluck alone wont do the question is are our generals and our organization as good as those of the prussians and can we put as many or anything like as many men into the field i am at least half french and hope with all my heart that we shall thrash these germans but we know that they are good soldiers and it is safer not to begin to brag till the work is over  there was silence for a minute or two after ralph ceased speaking the fact was the thought that perhaps france might be defeated had never once before presented itself to them as possible they were half disposed to be angry with the english boy for stating it but it was in the first place evident now that they thought of it that it was just possible and in the second place a quarrel with ralph barclay was a thing which all his schoolfellows avoided  ralph barclay was nearly sixteen his brother a year younger their father captain barclay had lost a leg in one of the innumerable wars in india two or three years before the outbreak of the crimean war he returned to england and was recommended by his doctors to spend the winter in the south of france this he did and shortly after his arrival at pau he had fallen in love with melanie duburg daughter of a landed proprietor near dijon and who was stopping there with a relative a month later he called upon her father at dijon and in the spring they were married captain barclays half pay a small private income and the little fortune which his wife brought him were ample to enable him to live comfortably in france and there accordingly he had settled down  his family consisted of ralph percy and a daughtercalled after her mother melanie and who was two years younger than percy it had always been captain barclays intention to return to england when the time came for the boys to enter into some business or profession and he had kept up his english connection by several visits there of some months duration with his whole family the boys too had been for two years at school in englandas well as for two years in germanyand they spoke the three languages with equal fluency  a prettier abode than that of captain barclay would be difficult to find it was in no particular style of architecture and would have horrified a lover of the classic it was half swiss half gothic and altogether french it had numerous little gables containing the funniestshaped little rooms it had a high roof with projecting eaves and round three sides ran a wide veranda with a trellis workover which vines were closely trainedsubduing the glare of the summer sun casting a cool green shade over the sitting rooms and affording a pretty and delightfully cool retreat where mrs barclay generally sat with her work and taught melanie moving round the house with the sun so as to be always in the shade  the drawing and dining rooms both opened into this veranda the road came up to the back of the house and upon the other three sides was a garden which was a compromise between the english and french styles it had a smooth wellmown lawn with a few patches of bright flowers which were quite english and mixed up among them and beyond them were clumps of the graceful foliaged plants and shrubs in which the french delight beyond was a vineyard with its low rows of vines while over these the view stretched away to the towers of dijon  in the veranda the boys upon their return found captain barclay reading the papers and smoking he looked up as they entered  you are back early boys  yes papa there was so much talking going on that the professor gave it up as hopeless you have heard the news of course  yes boys and am very sorry to hear it  captain barclay spoke so gravely that ralph asked anxiously  dont you think we shall thrash them papa  i consider it very doubtful ralph his father said prussia has already gained an immense moral victory she has chosen her own time for war and has at the same time obliged france to take the initiative and so to appear to be the aggressorand therefore to lose the moral support of europe she has forced this quarrel upon france and yet ninetenths of europe look upon france as the inciter of the war history will show the truth but it will then be too late as it is france enters upon the war with the weight of public opinion dead against her and what is worse she enters upon it altogether unprepared whereas prussia has been getting ready for years  but the french always have shown themselves to be better soldiers than the prussians papa  so they have percy andequally well led disciplined and organizedi believe that in anything like equal forces they would do so again the question is have we generals to equal those who led the prussians to victory against austria is our discipline equalor anything like equalto that of the prussians is our organization as good as theirs and lastly have we anything like their numbers  i dont like the look of it boys at all we ought according to published accounts to be able to put a larger army than theirs in the field just at first and if we were but prepared should certainly be able to carry all before us for a while i question very much if we are so prepared supposing it to be so however the success would i fear be but temporary for the german reserves are greatly superior to ours discipline too has gone off sadly since i first knew the french army  radical opinions may be very wise and very excellent for a nation for aught i know but it is certain that they are fatal to the discipline of an army my own opinion as you know is that they are equally fatal for a country but that is a matter of opinion only but of the fact that a good radical makes an extremely bad soldier i am quite clear and the spread of radical opinion among the french army has been very great then too the officers have been much to blame they think of pleasure far more than duty they spend four times as much time in the cafes and billiard rooms as they do in the drill ground altogether in my opinion the french army has greatly gone off in all pointsexcept in courage which being a matter of nationality is probably as high as ever it is a bad lookout boysa very bad lookout  there dont talk about it any more i do not want to make your mother unhappy remember not to expresseither as my or your own opinionanything i have said in the town it would only render you obnoxious and might even cause serious mischief if things go wrong french mobs are liable to wreak their bad temper on the first comer  percy mrs barclay said coming into the room please to run down to the end of the garden and cut some lettuces for salad marie is so upset that she can do nothing  what is the matter with her mamma both the boys asked at once  victor harveyou know him the son of the blacksmith harve who had served his time in the army and came back two months ago to join his father in his forge and to marry our mariehas left to join his regiment he was here an hour since to say goodbye by this time he will have started it is not wonderful that she weeps she may never see him again i have told her that she must be brave a frenchwoman should not grudge those she loves most to fight for france  ah melanie captain barclay said smiling these little patriotic outbursts are delightful when one does not have to practice them at ones own expense it is sweet and right to die for ones country said the old roman and everyone agrees with him but at the same time every individual man has a strong objection to put himself in the way of this sweet and proper death  although as you say no frenchwoman should grudge her love to her country i fancy if a levee en masse took place tomorrow and the boys as well as the cripples had to goso that ralph percy and i were all obliged to marchyou would feel that you did grudge us to the country most amazingly  mrs barclay turned a little pale at the suggestion  ah i cant suppose that richard you are english and they cannot touch you or the boys even if you could march and if they were old enough  captain barclay smiled  that is no answer melanie you are shirking the question i said if they were to make us go  ah yes i am afraid i should grudge you richard and the boys except the enemy were to invade france and then everyone even we women would fight but of that there is no chance it is we who will invade  captain barclay made no reply  the plums want gathering papa percy said returning from cutting the lettuces it was arranged that our cousins should come over when they were ripe and have a regular picking they have no plums and madame duburg wants them for preserving may we go over after dinner and ask them to come in at three oclock and spend the evening  certainly captain barclay said and you can give your mammas compliments and ask if your uncle and madame duburg will come in after they have dined the young ones will make their dinner at our six oclock tea  in france early dinner is a thing scarcely known even among the peasantry that is to say their meals are taken at somewhat the same time as ours are but are called by different names the frenchman never eats what we call breakfast that is he never makes a really heavy meal the first thing in the morning he takes however coffee and milk and bread and butter when he gets up he does not call this breakfast he speaks of it as his morning coffee and takes his breakfast at eleven or halfpast eleven or even at twelve this is a regular meal with soup meat and wine in england it would be called an early lunch at six oclock the frenchman dines and even the working man calls this mealwhich an english laborer would call supperhis dinner the barclays meals therefore differed more in name than in reality from those of their neighbors  louis and philippe duburg came in at five oclock but brought a message that their sisters would come in with their father and mother later melanie was neither surprised nor disappointed at the nonarrival of her cousins she greatly preferred being with the boys and always felt uncomfortable with julie and justine who although little older than herself were already as prim decorous and properly behaved as if they had been women of thirty years old after tea was over the four boys returned to their work of gathering plums while melanieor milly as her father called her to distinguish her from her motherpicked up the plums that fell handed up fresh baskets and received the full ones and laughed and chattered with her brothers and cousins  while so engaged monsieur and madame duburg arrived with their daughters julie and justine monsieur duburgmrs barclays brotherwas proprietor of a considerable estate planted almost entirely with vines his income was a large one for the soil was favorable and he carried on the culture with such care and attention that the wines fetched a higher price than any in the district he was a clearheaded sensible man with a keen eye to a bargain he was fond of his sister and her english husband and had offered no opposition to his boys entering into the games and amusements of their cousinsalthough his wife was constantly urging him to do so it was to madame duburg a terrible thing that her boysinstead of being always tidy and orderly and ready when at home to accompany her for a walkshould come home flushed hot and untidy with perhaps a swelled cheek or a black eye from the effects of a blow from a cricket ball or boxing glove  upon their arrival at captain barclays the two gentlemen strolled out to smoke a cigar together and to discuss the prospects of the war and its effect upon prices  mrs barclay had asked julie and justine if they would like to go down to the orchard but madame duburg had so hurriedly answered in their name in a negativesaying that they would stroll round the garden until melanie returnedthat mrs barclay had no resource but to ask them when they passed near the orchard to call millyin her nameto join them in the garden  my dear melanie madame duburg began when her daughters had walked away in a quiet prim manner hand in hand i was really quite shocked as we came along there was melanie laughing and calling out as loudly as the boys themselves handing up baskets and lifting others down with her hair all in confusion and lookingexcuse my saying somore like a peasant girl than a young lady  mrs barclay smiled quietly  milly is enjoying herself no doubt sisterinlaw and i do not see that her laughing or calling out or handing baskets will do her any serious harm as for her hair five minutes brushing will set that right  but my dear sisterinlaw madame duburg said earnestly do you recall to yourself that milly is nearly fourteen years old that she will soon be becoming a woman that in another three years you will be searching for a husband for her my faith it is terribleand she has yet no figure no manner and madame duburg looked with an air of gratified pride at the stiff figures of her own two girls  her figure is not a bad one sisterinlaw mrs barclay said composedly she is taller than juliewho is six months her seniorshe is as straight as an arrow her health is admirable she has never had a days illness  but she cannot walk she absolutely cannot walk madame duburg said lifting up her hands in horror  she walked upwards of twelve miles with her father yesterday mrs barclay said pretending to misunderstand her sisterinlaws meaning  i did not mean that madame duburg said impatiently but she walks like a peasant girl my faith it is shocking to say but she walks like a boy i should be desolated to see my daughter step out in that way  then look at her manners my word she has no manners at all the other day when i was here and monsieur de riviere with his sons called she was awkward and shy yes indeed she was positively awkward and shy it is dreadful for me to have to say so sisterinlaw but it is true no manners no ease julie and even justine can receive visitors even as i could do myself  her manners are not formed yet sisterinlaw mrs barclay said quietly nor do i care that they should be she is a young girl at present and i do not wish to see her a woman before her time in three years it will be time enough for her to mend her manners  but in three years sisterinlaw you will be looking for a husband for her  i shall be doing nothing of the sort mrs barclay said steadily in that as in many other matters i greatly prefer the english ways as you know we give up our house in two years and go to england to reside we have economized greatly during the seventeen years since our marriage we can afford to live in england now  at sixteen therefore milly will have good masters and for two years her education will be carried on and her walk and manner will no doubt improve in england fathers and mothers do not arrange the marriage of their children and milly will have to do as other girls dothat iswait until someone falls in love with her and she falls in love with him then if he is a proper person and has enough to keep her they will be married  madame duburg was too much shocked at the expression of these sentiments to answer at once she only sighed shook her head and looked upwards  it is strange she said at last to hear you sisterinlawa frenchwomanspeak so lightly of marriage as if a young girl could know as well as her parents who is a fit and proper person for her to marry besides the idea of a young girl falling in love before she marries is shocking quite shocking  my dear sisterinlaw mrs barclay said we have talked this matter over before and i have always stated my opinion frankly i have been a good deal in england and have seen therefore and know the result of english marriages i know also what french marriages are and no one who does know the state of things in the two countries can hesitate for a moment in declaring that married life in england is infinitely happier in every respect than it is in france the idea of telling your daughter that she is to marry a man whom she has never seenas we do in franceis to my mind simply monstrous fortunately i myself married for love and i have been happy ever since i intend milly when the time comes to do the same thing  before madame duburg had time to answer the gentlemen joined them and the conversation turned upon the war in a short time the three girls came up  what a rosy little thing you are milly her uncle said where do you get your plump cheeks and your bright color i wish you could give the receipt to julie and justine why if you were to blow very hard i do think you would blow them both down  i am really surprised at you monsieur duburg his wife said angrily i am sure i do not wish julie and justine to have as much color as their cousin i consider it quite a misfortune for poor milly it is so very commonplace poor child she looks as if she had been working at the vintage  that is right madame stand up for your own and her husband who was accustomed to his wifes speeches laughed but for all that commonplace or not commonplace i should like to see some of millys bright healthy color in my girls cheeks and i should like to see them walk as if they had forgotten for a moment their tight boots and high heels  his wife was about to make an angry reply when the arrival of the four boysbearing in triumph the last basket of plumschanged the conversation and shortly afterwards madame duburg remarking that the evening was damp and that she did not like julie and justine to be out in it any later the du burgs took their leave    chapter 2 terrible news   the ten days succeeding the declaration of war were days of excitement and anticipation the troops quartered at dijon moved forward at once and scarcely an hour passed but long trains filled with soldiers from lyons and the south were on their way up towards metz the people of dijon spent half their time in and around the station the platform was kept clear but bands of ladies relieved each other every few hours and handed soup bread fruit and wine to the soldiers as they passed through each crowded train was greeted as it approached the station with cheers and waving of handkerchiefs to which the troops as heartily responded most of the trains were decorated with boughs and presented a gay appearance as filled with the little line men the sunburned zouaves swarthy turcos gay hussars or sober artillerymen they wound slowly into the town  some of the trains were less gay but were not less significant of war long lines of wagons filled with cannon open trucks with the deadly shellarranged side by side point upwards and looking more like eggs in a basket than deadly missilescame and went there too were long trains of pontoons for forming bridges while every half hour long lines of wagons filled with biscuits barrels of wine sacks of coffee and cases of stores of all sorts and kinds passed through  the enthusiasm of dijon at the sight of this moving panorama of war rose to fever heat the sound of the marseillaise resounded from morning to night victory was looked upon as certain and the only subject of debate was as to the terms which victorious france would impose upon conquered prussia the only impatience felt was for the news of the first victory  captain barclay sent down several casks of wine for the use of the passing troops and his wife went down each day to assist at the distribution in the evening she and milly scraped old rags to make lint for the wounded the lycee was still closedas it was found impossible to get the boys to attend to their studiesand ralph and percy spent their time in watching the trains go past and in shouting themselves hoarse  captain barclay did not share in the general enthusiasm and each morning at breakfast he looked more and more grave as upon opening the papers he found there was still no news of the commencement of hostilities  what difference does it make papa ralph asked one day we are sending fresh troops up every hour and i do not see how a few days delay can be any disadvantage to us  it makes all the difference ralph all the difference in the world we had a considerably larger standing army than the prussians and had the advantage that the main body of our troops were very much nearer to the frontier than those of the prussians if things had been ready we ought to have marched two hundred thousand men into germany three or four daysat latestafter the declaration of war the germans could have had no force capable of resisting them we should have had the prestige of a first successno slight thing with a french armyand we should also have had the great and solid advantage of fighting in an enemys country instead of upon our own  the german reserves are far greater than our own we know how perfect their organization is and every hour of delay is an immense advantage to them it is quite likely now that instead of the french invading germany it will be the prussians who will invade france  the boys were but little affected by their fathers forebodings it was scarcely possible to suppose that everyone could be wrong still more impossible to believe that those great hosts which they saw passing so full of high hope and eager courage could be beaten they were however very glad to sit round the table of an evening while captain barclay opened a great map on the table explained the strength of the various positions and the probability of this or that line of attack being selected by one or the other army  day after day went by until on the 2nd of august the news came at last the first blow had been struck the first blood shedthe french had taken saarbruck  it is too late captain barclay said as ralph and percy rushed in to say that the news was posted up at the prefecture it is too late boys the english papers of this morning have brought us the news that the germans are massing at least seven or eight hundred thousand men along the line from saar louis to spiers it is evident that they fell back from saarbruck without any serious resistance in another two or three days they will be in readiness and as they must far outnumber our men you will see that the advantage at saarbruck will not be followed up and that the prussians will assume the offensive  then what do you really think will be the result papa  i think ralph that we shall be forced to do whatnot having at once taken the offensivewe ought to have done from the first we shall have to fall back to abandon the line of frontierwhich is altogether indefensibleand to hold the line of the moselle and the spurs of the vosges an immensely strong position and which we ought to be able to hold against all the efforts of prussia  the exultation of dijon was but short lived for on the 5th the boys came up in the afternoon from the town with very serious faces  what is the matter ralph  there is a rumor in the town papa that the swiss papers have published an account of the capture of weissenburg by the prussians a great many french are said to be prisoners do you think it can be true  it is probable at any rate ralph the swiss papers would of course get the news an hour or so after it is known in germany we must not begin by believing all that the telegram says because both sides are certain to claim victories still the absolute capture of a town is a matter upon which there can be no dispute and is therefore likely enough to be true we know the prussians were massed all along that line and as i expected they have taken the offensive their chances of success in so doing were evident as neither party know where the others are preparing to strike a blow and each can therefore concentrate and strike with an overwhelming force at any given point  now that the germans have made the first move and shown their intention both parties will concentrate in that direction you see from weissenburg the germans can either march south upon strasburg or southwest upon metz or nancy but to reach this latter place they will have to cross the spurs of the vosges the french will of course try to bar their further advance we may expect a great battle in a day or two  the news came but too soon fortwo days laterdijon as well as all france stood aghast at the news of the utter rout of macmahons division after the desperately contested battle of woerth and the not less decided though less disastrous defeats of the french left at forbach by the troops of steinmetz some little consolation was however gleaned by the fact that the french had been beaten in detail and had shown the utmost gallantry against greatly superior numbers they would now no doubt fall back behind the moselle and hold that line and the position of the vosges until fresh troops could come up and a great battle be fought upon more even terms  fresh levies were everywhere ordered and a deep and general feeling of rage prevailed no one thought of blaming the troopsit was evident that they had done their best the fault lay with the generals and with the organization  captain barclay pointed out to the boys that the officers and men were somewhat to blame also for the utter confusion which prevailed among macmahons troops in their retreat showed that the whole regimental system was faulty and that there could have been no real discipline whatever or the shattered regiments would have rallied a few miles from the field of battle  in dijon the change during the last fortnight was marvelous the war spirit was higher than ever cost what it might this disgrace must be wiped out the mobiles were hard at work drilling the soldiers who had long left the army were starting by every train to the depots the sound of the marseillaise rang through the streets night and day the chorus to arms gained a fresh meaning and power and in spite of these first defeats none dreamed of final defeat  every day however the news became worse strasburg was cut off and the prussians marched unopposed across the spurs of the vosges where a mere handful of men might have checked them  boys there are terrible days in store for france captain barclay said when the news came that the enemy had entered nancy the line of the moselle is turned bazaine will be cut off unless he hurries his retreat and then nothing can stop the prussians from marching to paris  the boys sat speechless at this terrible assurance  surely it cannot be as bad as that mrs barclay said frenchmen cannot have lost all their old qualities and all france will rise like one man to march to the defense of paris  raw levies will be of no use whatever against the prussian troops flushed with victory captain barclay said even if they were armedand where are the arms for a levy en masse to come from if bazaine be beaten the only hope of france is for all the troops who remain to fall back under the guns of the forts of paris and for france to enter upon an immense guerrilla war for hosts of skirmishers to hang upon their flanks and rear cutting every road destroying every bridge checking the movements of every detached body and so actually starving them out on the ground which they occupy  this however will demand an immense amount of pluck of endurance of perseverance of sacrifice and of patriotism the question is does france possess these qualities  surely richard you cannot doubt the patriotism of the french mrs barclay said a little reproachfully  my dear melanie her husband said i am sorry to say that i very greatly doubt the patriotism of the french they aremore than any people more even than the english whom they laugh at as a nation of shopkeepersa moneymaking race the bourgeoise class the shopkeepers the small proprietors are selfish in the extreme they think only of their money their business and their comforts the lower class are perhaps better but their first thoughts will be how the war will affect themselves and unless there is some chance of the enemy approaching their homes driving off their cattle and plundering their cottages they will look on with a very calm eye at the general ruin  i believe remember that those who will be called out will go and if affairs go as i fear that they will do every man under fifty years old in france will have to go out but it is not enough to go out for a war like this it will require desperate courage and endurance and an absolute disregard of life to counterbalance the disadvantages of want of discipline want of arms want of artillery and want of organization i may be wrongi hope that i am sobut time will show  and do you think that there is any chance of their coming down here as well as of going to paris papa percy asked  that would depend upon the length of the resistance percy if france holds out and refuses to grant any terms which the prussians might try to impose upon them they may overrun half the country and as this town is directly upon their way for lyonsthe second town of francethey are exceedingly likely to come this way  well if they do papa ralph said with heightened color i feel sure that every man who can carry a gun will go out and that every home will be defended  we shall see ralph captain barclay said we shall see  another pause and then came the news of that terrible three days fightingon the 14th 16th and 18thnear metz when bazaine his retreat towards paris cut off vainly tried to force his way through the prussian army and failing fell back into metz even now when the position was wellnigh desperatewith the only great army remaining shut up and surrounded and with nothing save the fragment of macmahons division with a few other regiments collected in haste and the new levies encamped at chalons between the victorious enemy and the capitalthe people of france were scarcely awake to the urgency of the position the government concealed at least a portion of the truth and the people were only too ready to be deceived  in dijon however the facts were better known and more understood the swiss newspapers containing the prussian official telegrams and accounts arrived daily and those who received them speedily spread the news through the town the consternation was great and general but there was no sign of despair those of the mobiles who were armed and equipped were sent off at once to chalons at every corner of the street were placards calling out the mobiles and soldiers who had served their time and although not yet called to arms the national guard drilled in the place darmes morning and evening  you will allow richard that you were mistaken as to the patriotism of the people mrs barclay said one evening to her husband everyone is rushing to arms  they are coming out better than i had expected melanie but at the same time you will observe that they have no choice in the matter the mobiles are called out and have to go all who can raise the most frivolous pretext for exemption do so there is a perfect rush of young men to the prefecture to obtain places in the clothing medical arming and equipping departments in any sort of service in fact which will exempt its holder from taking up arms  at the same time there is a great deal of true earnest patriotism many married men with families have volunteered and those belonging to the categories called out do go as you say cheerfully if not willingly and once enrolled appear determined to do their duty  france will need all the patriotism and all the devotion of her people to get through the present crisis there is no saying how it will end i have no hope whatever that macmahons new army can arrest the march of the enemy and his true course is to fall back upon paris our chance here of remaining free from a visit of the enemy depends entirely upon the length of time which strasburg and metz hold out bazaine may be able to cut his way out but at any rate he is likely to remain where he is for some little time under the walls of metz for he occupies the attention of a considerably larger force than that which he commands  the vital point at present is to cut the roads behind the germans if it were not for this cork leg of mine melanie i would try and raise a small guerrilla corps and set out on my own account i have lived here for seventeen years now and the french fought by our side in the crimea could i do so i should certainly fight for france now it is clearly the duty of anyone who can carry a musket to go out  just at this moment the door opened and ralph and percy entered hastily they both looked excited but serious  what is it boys  papa ralph said there is a notice up signed by your friend captain tempe he calls for a hundred volunteers to join a corps of franc tireursa sort of guerrillas i believeto go out to harass the germans and cut their communication those who can are to provide their own arms and equipments a meeting is to be held tonight for subscribing the money for those who cannot afford to do so  we have come to ask you to let us join papa louis and philippe have just gone to ask uncles leave  captain barclay listened in silence with a very grave face their mother sat down in a chair with a white face  oh my boys you are too young she gasped out  we are stronger mamma than a great many of the men who have been called out and taller and stouter in every way we can walk better than the greater portion of them we are accustomed to exercise and fatigue we are far more fit to be soldiers than many young men who have gone from here you said yourself mamma that everyone who could carry a gun ought to go out  but you are not french boys mrs barclay said piteously  we are half french mamma not legally but it has been home to us since we were born and even if you had not been french we ought to fight for her  mrs barclay looked at her husband for assistance but captain barclay had leaned his face in his hands and said nothing  ah ralph but percy at least he is only fifteen  i am nearly as big nearly as strong as ralph mamma besides would it not be better to have two of us if one is ill oror woundedthe other could look after him you know  mamma dearest we have talked it over and we think we ought to go we are very strong for our ages and it is strength not years which matters mamma you said a frenchwoman should not grudge those she loves to france and that if france was invaded all even the women should go out  mrs barclay was silent she could not speak she was so deadly pale and her face had such an expression of misery that the boys felt their resolution wavering  captain barclay looked up  boys he said very gravely i have one question to ask which you will answer me truly upon your faith and honor do you wish to go merelyor principallyfrom a desire to see the excitement and the adventure of a guerrilla war or do you go out because you desire earnestly to do your best to defend the country in which you were born and lived are you prepared to suffer any hardship and if it is the will of god to die for her  we are papa both boys said  and ralph went on  when we first talked over the possibility of everyone being called outand of our going toowe did look upon it as a case of fun and excitement but when the chance really came we saw how serious it was we knew how much it would cost you and dear mamma and we would not have asked you had we not felt that we ought to go even if we knew we should be killed  in that case boys captain barclay said solemnly rising and laying one hand on the shoulder of each of his sons in that case i say no more you are a soldiers sons and your example may do good it is your duty and that of everyone to fight for his country i give you my full consent to go i should not have advised it at your age there was no absolute duty still if you feel it so i will not stand in your way  go then my boys and may god watch over you and keep you and send you safe home again  so saying he kissed them both on the forehead and walked from the room without saying another word  then the boys turned to their mother who was crying silently and falling upon her neck they kissed her and cried with her it was understood that her consent was given with their fathers  milly coming in and hearing what was the matter sat down in sudden grief and astonishment on the nearest chair and cried bitterly it was a sad half hour and the boys were almost inclined to regret that they had asked for leave to go however there was no drawing back now and when they left their mother they went on to tell their cousins that they were going  they found louis and philippe in a state of great disappointment because their father had altogether refused to listen to their entreaties upon hearing however that ralph and percy were going they gained fresh hope for they said if english boys could go and fight for france it was shameful that french boys should stay at home in idleness  captain barclay after giving permission to his sons to go as franc tireurs first went for a walk by himself to think over the consequences of his decision he then went down into dijon and called upon captain tempe the commander of the proposed corps had served for many years in the zouaves and was known to be an able and energetic officer he had left the service five or six years previously upon his marriage he lived a short distance only from captain barclay and a warm friendship had sprung up between them  upon captain barclay telling him why he had come to see him captain tempe expressed his satisfaction at the decision of the young barclays  i have already the names of one or two lads little if any older than your eldest boy he said and although the other is certainly very young yet as he is very stout and strong for his age i have no doubt he will bear the fatigue as well as many of the men  i wish i could go with you captain barclay said  i wish you could indeed captain tempe replied warmly but with your leg you never could keep up on foot and a horse would be out of the question among the forests of the vosges mountains  you might howeverif you willbe of great use in assisting me to drill and discipline my recruits before starting  that i will do with pleasure captain barclay said i had been thinking of offering my services in that way to the municipality as very few of the officers of the mobiles still less of the national guard know their duty as it is i will devote myself to your corps till they march  in the first place how strong do you mean them to be  one strong company say one hundred and twenty men captain tempe answered more than that would be too unwieldy for guerrilla work i would rather have twenty less than more indeed i should be quite satisfied with a hundred if i find that volunteers come in in greater numbers than i can accept i shall advise them to get up other similar corps there ought to be scores of small parties hanging upon the rear and flank of the enemy and interrupting his communication  how do you think of arming them  either with chassepots or with your english rifles it is of no use applying to government they will not be able to arm the mobiles for months to say nothing of the national guard we must buy the rifles in england or belgium it will be difficult to get chassepots so i think the best plan will be to decide at once upon your sniders  i know a gentleman who is connected with these matters in england and will if you like send out an order at once for say eleven dozen sniders to be forwarded via rouen and thence by rail  i should be very glad if you would do so captain tempe said i have no doubt about getting that number of recruits easily enough i have had a good many calls already this morning and several thousand francs of subscription have been promised in another three or four days the money will be ready so if you write to your friends to make an agreement with a manufacturer i can give you the money by the time his answer arrives when the guns arrive those who can pay for them will do so and the rest will be paid for by the subscriptions  of course we shall want them complete with bayonets if at the same time you can order ammunitionsay two hundred rounds for each rifleit would be perhaps a saving of time as the government may not be able to supply any at first however after the meeting this evening i shall see how the subscriptions come in and we can settle on these points tomorrow the municipality will help i have no doubt  what is your idea as to equipment tempe  as light as possible nothing destroys the go of men more than to be obliged to carry heavy weights on their shoulders we shall be essentially guerrillas our attacks to be successful must be surprises speed therefore and the power to march long distances are the first of essentials  i do not propose to carry knapsacksmere haversacks bags capable of containing a spare shirt a couple of pairs of socks and three days biscuits each man must also carry a spare pair of boots strapped to his belt behind a thick blanketwith a hole cut for the head so as to make a cloak by day a cover by nightwill be carried rolled up over one shoulder like a scarf and each man should carry a light waterproof coat  i do not propose to take even tents dabri they add considerably to the weight and unless when we are actually engaged in expeditions we shall make our headquarters at some village when the men can be dispersed among the cottages or sleep in stables or barns when on expeditions they must sleep in the open air  i quite approve of your plan captain barclay said exclusive of his rifle and ammunition the weight need not be above fifteen pounds a man and with this they ought to be able to march and fight with comfort the way your soldiers march out laden like beasts of burden is absurd it is impossible for men either to march or fight with a heavy load upon their backs  have you thought about uniform  no i have not settled at all i thought of letting the men fix upon one of their own choice  do nothing of the sort captain barclay said the men will only think of what is most becoming or picturesque you cannot do better than fix upon some good serviceable uniform of a darkgrayish color something similar to that of some of our english volunteer corps i will give you a drawing of it  let the tunics be made of a thick and good cloth let the men have short trousersor as we call them knickerbockerswith leather gaiters and lace boots the shoes of your soldier are altogether a mistake i will bring you a sketch tomorrow and you will see that it is neat as well as serviceable  thank you  by the way i suppose that you have no objection to my mentioning at the meeting this evening that your sons have joined if there should be any inclination to hang backwhich i hope there will not bethe fact that your boys have joined may decide many who would otherwise hesitate  certainly  i will not detain you longer at present i shall see you in a day or two and any assistance which i can give is at your service  thanks very much i only wish that you could go with us  goodbye tell the boys that their names are down and that we shall begin drill in a day or two    chapter 3 death to the spy   the next morning madame duburg arrived at ten oclock an hour at which she had never as far as mrs barclay knew turned out of her house since her marriage she was actually walking fast too it was evident that something serious was the matter  mrs barclay was in the garden and her visitor came straight out from the house to her  is anything the matter was mrs barclays first question  yes a great deal is the matter madame duburg began vehemently you and your english husband are mad your wretched boys are mad they have made my sons mad also andmy faithi believe that my husband will catch it it is enough to make me also mad  notwithstanding the trouble in which mrs barclay was at the resolution of her sons she could scarcely help smiling at the excitement of madame duburg the cause of which she at once guessed however she asked with an air of astonishment  my dear sisterinlaw what can you be talking about  i know what i say madame duburg continued i always said that you were mad you and your husband to let your boys go about and play and tear and bruise themselves like wild indians i always knew that harm would come of it when i saw my boys come in hotoh so unpleasantly hot to look atbut i did not think of such harm as this my faith it is incredible when i heard that you were to marry yourself to an englishman i said at once  it is bad harm will come of it these english are islanders they are eccentric they are mad they sell their wives in the market with a cord round their neck  my dear sisterinlaw mrs barclay interrupted i have so often assured you that that absurd statement was entirely false and due only to the absolute ignorance of our nation of everything outside itself  i have heard it often madame duburg went on positively they are a nation of singularities i doubt not that it is true he has hidden the truth from you true or false i care not they are mad for this i care not my faith i have not married an englishman why then should i care for the madness of this nation of islanders  this i said when i heard that you were to marry an englishman could i imagine that i also was to become a victim could i suppose that my husbanda man sensible in most thingswould also become mad that my boys would grow up like young savages and would offer themselves to go out to sleep without beds to catch colds to have red noses and coughs perhaps evenmy faithto be killed by the balls of german pigs my word of honor i ask myself  am i living in france am i asleep am i dreaming am i too mad  i said to myself  i shall go to my sisterinlaw and i will demand of her is it possible that these things are true  if you mean by all this sisterinlaw is it true that i have consented to my boys going out to fight for france it is quite true mrs barclay said quietly  madame duburg sat down upon a garden seat raised her hands and nodded her head slowly and solemnly  she says it is true she actually says that it is true  why should they not go mrs barclay continued quietly they are strong enough to carry arms and why should they not go out to defend their country in a short time it is likely that everyone who can carry arms will have to go i shall miss them sorely it is a terrible trial but other women have to see their sons go out why should not i  because there is no occasion for it at all madame duburg said angrily because they are boys and not men because their father is english and stupid men like my husband will say if these young english boys go it will be a shame upon us for our own to remain behind  what i ask you is the use of being well off what is the use of paying taxes for an army if our boys must fight it is absurd it is against reason it is atrocious  madame duburgs anger and remonstrance were alike lost upon mrs barclay and she cut her visitor short  my dear sisterinlaw it is of no use arguing or talking i consider rightly or wrongly that the claims of our country stand before our private convenience or inconvenience if i were a man i should certainly go out to fight why should not my boys do so if they choose at any rate i have given my consent and it is too late to draw back even if i wished to do sowhich i say frankly that i do not  madame duburg took her departure much offended and late in the evening her husband came in and had a long talk with captain barclay the following morning louis and philippe came inin a high state of delightto say that their father had that morning given his consent to their going  in three days after the opening of the list a hundred and twenty men had inscribed their names and captain tempe refused to admit more numbers were he argued a source of weakness rather than of strength when the men were almost entirely ignorant of drill for sudden attacks for night marches for attacks upon convoys number is less needed than dash and speed among large bodies discipline cannot be kept up except by immense severity upon the part of the officers or by the existence of that feeling of discipline and obedience among the men which is gained only by long custom to military habits besides which the difficulty of obtaining provisions for a large body of men would be enormous  indeed captain tempe determined to organize even this small corps into four companies each of thirty men to act under one head and to join together upon all occasions of important expeditions but at other times to be divided among villages at such distance as would enable them to watch a large extent of country each company sending out scouts and outposts in its own neighborhood  by far the larger proportion of those who joined were either proprietors or the sons of proprietors in and around dijon at that time government had made no arrangement whatever concerning franc tireurs and no pay was therefore available the invitation was therefore especially to those willing and able to go out upon their own account and at their own expense other recruits had been invited but as these could join the regular forces and receive pay and other advantages the number who sent in their names was small the men who did so were for the most part picked men foresters wood cutters and others who preferred the certainty of active and stirring service among the franc tireurs to the pay and comparative monotony of the regular service there were some forty of these men among the corps the rest being all able to provide at least their outfit subscriptions had come in rapidly and in a week an ample sum was collected to arm and equip all those not able to do so for themselves and to form a military chest sufficient to pay for the food of the whole corps in the field for some time  when the list of volunteers was complete a meeting was held at which for the first time the future comrades met besides ralph and percy and their cousins there were six or eight others of their school friends all lads of about sixteen it was an important moment in their lives when they then felt themselvesif not actually menat least as going to do the work of men upon the table in the room in which the meeting was held was a document which each in turn was to sign and behind this captain tempe took his seat  as many of those present knew each other there was a considerable buzz and talk in the room until captain tempe tapped the table for silence and then rose to speak  my friends he began for i cannot call you comrades until you have formally entered your namesbefore you irrevocably commit yourselves to this affair i wish you each to know exactly what it is that we are going to do this will be no holiday expedition i can promise all who go with me plenty of excitement and a great deal of fighting but i can also promise them with equal certainty an immense deal of sufferingan amount of hardship and privation of which at present few here have any idea whatever the winter is fast coming on and winter in the vosges mountains is no trifle let no one then put down his name here who is not prepared to suffer every hardship which it is well possible to suffer  as to the danger i say nothing you are frenchmen and have come forward to die if needs be for your country  here the speaker was interrupted by loud cheering and cries of vive la france  next as to discipline this is an extremely important point in our absence from military stations it is essential that we ourselves should keep and enforce the strictest discipline i have this morning received from general palikaounder whom i served for many yearsan answer to an application i wrote to him a week since he highly approves of my plan of cutting the roads behind the prussians and only wishes that he had a hundred small corps out upon the same errand he has already received other proposals of the same nature he enclosed with his letter my formal appointment as commandant of the corps of franc tireurs of dijon with full military authority and power  great cheering again broke out  this power in case of need i warn you that i shall use unhesitatingly discipline in a corps like ours is everything there must be no murmuring under hardships no hesitation in obeying any order however unpleasant prompt willing cheerful obedience when at work a warm friendship and perfect good fellowship at other times this is my programme  the speaker was again interrupted with hearty cheering  i intend to divide the corps into four companies each of thirty men each company will have an officer and will at times act independently of each other i have deliberated whether it is best to allow each company to choose its own officer or whether to nominate them myself i have determined to adopt the latter course you can hardly be such good judges as to the qualities required by officers during an expedition like the present as i am and as i know every man here and as i shall have the opportunity of seeing more of each man during the three weeks which we shall spend here upon drill i shall then choose an officer for each company but i will leave it to each company to decide whether to accept my choice or not there may be points in a mans character which may make him unpopular  now as to drill we have three weeks before us not long enough to make men good soldiers but amply sufficientwith hard workto make them good skirmishers i have already arranged with four men who have served as noncommissioned officers in the army one of whom will take each company  captain barclaywho is well known to most of youhas kindly offered to give musketry instruction for four hours each morning ten men of each company will go each morning for a week to drill at the range so that in three weeks each man will have had a weeks instruction the hours will be from seven to eleven the others will drill during the same hours  all will drill together in the afternoon from three to six the officer commanding the troops here has promised us the loan of a hundred and twenty old guns which are in store and also of twenty chassepots for rifle practice  that is all i have to say all who are ready and willing to enter upon these terms can now sign their names those who are not perfectly sure of their own willingness can draw back before it is too late  when the cheering ceased each man came forward and signed his name  the first parade will take place at seven tomorrow morning in the place darmes a suit of uniform complete will be exhibited here at twelve oclock a man has offered to supply them at contract prices but any who prefer it can have it made by their own tailor  now good night boys  vive les franc tireurs du dijon  vive la france and with a cheer the men separated  the next morning the corps met and were divided into companies the division was alphabetical and the young barclays and duburgs were all in the first company this was a matter of great pleasure to them as they had been afraid that they might have been separated  the following day drill began in earnest and accustomed as the boys were to exercise they found seven hours a day hard work of it still they felt it very much less than many of the young men who for years had done little but lounge in cafes or stroll at the promenade all however stuck to their work and as their hearts were in it it was surprising how quickly they picked up the rudiments of drill fortunately they were not required to learn anything beyond the management of their firearms the simplest movements and the duty of skirmishers as all complicated maneuvers would have been useless in a small corps whose duties would be confined entirely to skirmishing  with this branch of their work captain tempe was determined that they should be thoroughly acquainted and they were taught how to use cover of all kinds with advantage how to defend a building crenelate a wall fell trees to form an obstacle across roads or a breastwork in front of them and how to throw themselves into square rapidly to repel cavalry  captain barclay was indefatigable as a musketry instructor and with the aid of a few friends got up a subscription which was spent in a number of small prizes so as to give the men as much interest as possible in their work captain tempe impressed most strenuously upon the men the extreme importance of proficiency in shooting as it was upon the accuracy and deadliness of their fire that they would have to rely to enable them to contend with superior forces in the combats they would have to go through and each man would probably have frequently to depend for his life upon the accuracy of his fire  the original planof instructing a third of the men each week in musketrywas abandoned and the parties were changed each day in order to enable all to advance at an equal rate besides their ammunition was supplied so that those who chose to do so could practice shooting for their own amusement between their morning and afternoon drill  the barclays were constant in their attendance at the shooting ground and the steady hand and eye which cricket fencing and other exercises had given them now stood them in good stead for by the end of the time they became as good marksmen as any in the corps they still lived at home as did all those members of the corps whose residences were in and around dijon for those who lived too far away to come in and out every day to drill a large empty barn was taken and fitted up as a temporary barracks  the time did not pass away without great excitement for as the end of august drew on everyone was watching in deep anxiety for the news of a battle near chalonswhere macmahon had been organizing a fresh army then came the news that the camp at chalons was broken up and that macmahon was marching to the relief of bazaine two or three days of anxious expectation followed and thenon the 3rd of septembercame the news through switzerland of the utter defeat and surrender of the french army at sedan  at first the news seemed too terrible to be true people seemed stunned at the thought of a hundred thousand frenchmen laying down their arms two days later came the news of the revolution in paris this excited various emotions among the people but the prevailing idea seemed to be thatnow there was a republicpast disasters would be retrieved  what do you think of the news papa the boys asked as drill over they hurried up to talk the matter over with their father  with any other people i should consider it to be the most unfortunate event which could have possibly occurred captain barclay said a change of governmentinvolving a change of officials throughout all the departments and a perfect upset of the whole machinery of organizationappears little short of insanity at the same time it is possible that it may arouse such a burst of national enthusiasm that the resistance which as far as the civil population is concerned has as yet been contemptiblein fact has not been attempted at allmay become of so obstinate and desperate a character that the prussians may be fairly wearied out  there is scarcely any hope of future victories in the field raw levies however plucky can be no match for such troops as the prussians in the open the only hope is in masses of franc tireurs upon the rear and flanks of the enemy every bridge every wood every village should be defended to the death in this way the prussians would only hold the ground they stand on and it would be absolutely impossible for them to feed their immense armies or to bring up their siege materiel against paris  the spirit to do this may possibly be excited by the revolution otherwise france is lost success alone can excuse it for a more senseless more unjustifiable more shameful revolution was in my mind never made it has been effected purely by the radicals and roughs of paristhe men who have for years been advocating a war with prussia and who a month ago were screaming to berlin for these men to turn round upon the emperor in his misfortune and without consulting the rest of france to effect a revolution is in my mind simply infamous  even regarded as a matter of policy it is bad in the extreme austria italy and russiato say nothing of englandwould sooner or later have interfered in favor of an established empire but their sympathies will be chilled by this revolution the democratic party in all these countries may exult but the extreme democratic party do not hold the reins of power anywhere and their monarchs will certainly not feel called upon to assist to establish a republic  prussia herselfintensely aristocratic in her institutionswill probably refuse to treat altogether with the schemers who have seized the power for the king of prussia is perhaps the greatest hater of democracy in europe  still boys these changes make no difference in your duty you are fighting for france not for an empire or a republic and as long as france resists it is your duty to continue in fact it is now more than ever the duty of you and of every frenchman to fight her army is entirely gone and it is simply upon the pluck and energy of her population that she has to trust  do you think paris will hold out papa  she is sure to do so boys she has made the revolution and she is bound to defend it i know paris well the fortifications are far too strong to be taken by a sudden attack and it will be a long time before the prussians can bring up a siege train paris will only be starved out and if her people are only half as brave as they are turbulent they ought to render it impossible for the prussians to blockade such an immense circle at any rate france has two months perhaps much longer but two months ought to be quite enough if her people have but spirit to surround the enemy to cut off his supplies and to force him to retreat  the next morning when the corps assembled for drill captain tempe addressed them on the subject of the events in paris he told them that whether they approved or disapproved of what had taken place there their duty as frenchmen was plain for the present they were not politicians but patriots and he hoped that not a word of politics would be spoken in the corps but that everyone would give his whole thought his whole strength and if must be his life in the cause of france  his address was greatly applauded and gave immense satisfaction to the men for already differences of opinion were becoming manifest among them some had exulted loudly at the downfall of napoleon others had said little but their gloomy looks had testified sufficiently what were their opinions while many among the gentlemen in the corps especially those belonging to old families were well known to be attached either to a legitimist or orleanist prince the proposal therefore that no politics should be discussed during the war but that all should remember only that they were fighting for france gave great satisfaction and promised a continuance of the good fellowship which had hitherto reigned in the corps  it was a great day when a fortnight from its first organization the corps turned out for the first time in their uniforms the band of the national guard headed them as they marched down the high street of dijon to the parade ground andas the spectators cheered the ladies waved their handkerchiefs and the whole corps joined in cheers to the stirring notes of the marseillaisethe young barclays felt their cheeks flush their hands tighten upon their rifles and their hearts beat with a fierce longing to be face to face with the hated prussians  a day or two after this the snider rifles ordered from england by captain barclay arrived and although the men at first preferred the chassepots with which they were familiar they were soon accustomed to the new weapons and readily acknowledged the advantage whichas their commander pointed out to themthe darkbrown barrels possessed for skirmishers over the bright barrels of the chassepots which with the sun shining upon them would betray them to an enemy miles away  a day or two afterwards as ralph and percy were returning in the evening from drill they heard a great tumult in the streets they hurried forward to see what was the matter and found an excited crowd shouting and gesticulating  death to the spy  death to the spy  hang him  kill the dog were the shouts and two gendarmes in the center of the crowd were vainly trying to protect a man who was walking between them he was a tall powerfullooking man but it was impossible to see what he was like for the blood was streaming down his forehead from a blow he had just received  just as the boys came up another blow from a stick fell on his head and this served to rouse him to desperation for he turned round with one blow knocked down the fellow who had struck him and then commenced a furious attack upon his persecutors for a moment they drew back and then closed upon him again blows from sticks and hands rained upon him but he struggled desperately at last overwhelmed by numbers he fell and as he did so he raised a wild shout hurroo for ould ireland  he is an englishman percy ralph exclaimed he is not a prussian at all come on  here louis philippe help they are killing an englishman  followed by their cousinswho had just arrived at the spotthe boys made a rush through the crowd and arrived in another moment by the prostrate man whom his assailants were kicking savagely the rush of the four boysaided by the buttend of their rifles which they used freely on the ribs of those who stood in their waycleared off the assailants for an instant and the two gendarmeswho had been hustled awaydrawing their swords again took their place by the side of their insensible prisoner  the mob had only recoiled for a moment and now furious at being baulked of their expected prey prepared to rush upon his defenders shouting as they did so  death to the spy  the moments delay had however given time to the boys to fix bayonets  illustration rescue of a supposed spy  keep off ralph shouted or we run you through the man is not a spy i tell you he is an englishman  the noise was too great for the words to be heard and with cries of death to the spy the men in front prepared for a rush the leveled bayonets and drawn swords however for a moment checked their ardor but those behind kept up the cry and a serious conflict would have ensued had not a party of five or six of the franc tireurs come along at the moment  theseseeing their comrades standing with leveled bayonets keeping the mob at baywithout asking any questions at once burst their way through to their side distributing blows right and left heartily with the buttend of their rifles this reinforcement put an end to the threatened conflict and the gendarmes aided by two of the franc tireurs lifted the insensible man and carried him to the maine the rest of the franc tireurs marching on either side as a guard and the yelling crowd following them  once inside the maine the gates were shut andthe supposed spy being laid down on the benchcold water was dashed in his face and in a few minutes he opened his eyes  the murdering villains he muttered to himself theyve kilt me entirely bad luck to them a hundred to one the cowardly blackguards  where am i and he made an effort to rise  youre all right ralph said youre with friends dont be afraid youre safe now  jabers exclaimed the irishman in astonishment sitting up and looking round him heres a little french soldier speaking as illegant english as i do meself  im english laughed ralph and lucky it was for you that we came along we heard you call out just as you fell and got in in time with the help of our friends to save your life another minute or two and we should have been too late  god bless your honor the manwho had now thoroughly recovered himselfsaid earnestly and it was a tight shave entirely youve saved tim doyles life and your honor shall see that hes not ungrateful whenever you want a lad with a strong arm and a thick stick tims the boy  thank you tim ralph said heartily now you had better let the surgeon look at your head you have got some nasty cuts  sure and my heads all right your honor it isnt a tap from a frenchman that would break the skull of tim doyle  the gendarmes now intimated that as the prisoner was restored he must go in at once before the maire the young barclays accompanied him and acted as interpreters at the examination the story was a simple one and the passport and other papers upon the irishman proved its truth conclusively  tim was an irishman who had come out as groom with an english gentleman his master had fallen ill at lyons had parted with his horses and carriage and returned to england tim had accepted the offer of the horse dealer who had purchased the horses to remain in his service and had been with him six months when the war broke out he had picked up a little french but had been several times arrested in lyons as a spy and his master had at last told him that it was not safe for him to remain and that he had better return to england  he had reached dijon on that morning but the train instead of going on had been stopped as large numbers of mobiles were leaving for paris and the ordinary traffic was suspended tim had therefore passed the day strolling about dijon the hour had approached at which he had been told that a train might leave and tim had asked a passer by the way to the station  his broken french at once aroused suspicion a crowd collected in a few minutes and tim was in the first place saved from being attacked by the arrival of two gendarmes upon the scene he had at once told them that he was english and had produced his passport and they had decided upon taking him to the maire for the examination of his papersbut on the way the crowd increased by fresh arrivals had determined to take the law into their own hands and only the arrival of the young barclays and their cousins had saved his life  the maire saw at once upon examination of the papers that the story was correct and pronounced that tim was at liberty to go where he pleased the poor fellow howeverthough he made light of his wounds and bruiseswas much shaken and it would moreover have been dangerous for him to venture again into the streets of dijon ralph therefore at once offered to take him out and to give him a nights shelter an offer which the irishman accepted with many thanks  it was now getting dark and accompanied by their cousins the barclays were let out with tim doyle from a back entrance to the maine and made their way unnoticed through the town and arrived half an hour later at home captain and mrs barclay upon hearing the story cordially approved of what the boys had done and captain barclay havingin spite of tims earnest remonstrance that it was of no consequence in the worldput some wet rags upon the most serious of the wounds bandaged up his head and sent him at once to bed  in the morning when the lads started for drill the irishman was still in bed but when they returned to dinner they found him working in the garden as vigorously as if the events of the previous day had been a mere dream when he saw them coming he stuck his spade into the ground and went forward to meet them  god bless your honors but im glad to see you again and to thank you for saving my life which them bastes had made up their minds they were going to have i aint good at talking your honors but if its the last drop of my blood that would be of any use to you youd be heartily welcome to it  i am very glad we arrived in time tim ralph said and its lucky for you that you shouted hurrah for old ireland as you went down for of course we had no idea you were a countryman and although we were disgusted at the brutality of that cowardly mob we could hardly have interfered between them and a german spy  what are you thinking of doing now it will hardly be safe for you to travel through france while this madness about spies lasts for with your broken french you would be getting taken up continually  im not thinking of it at all your honor the irishman said the master has been telling me that your honors are starting for the war and so ive made up my mind that i shall go along wid ye  the boys laughed  you are not in earnest tim  as sure as the gospels your honor ive served five years in the cork militia and wore the badge as a marksman and so i mean to list and go as your honors sarvint  but you cant do that tim even if we would let you ralph laughed there wont be any servants at all  sure your honor is mistaken entirely tim said gravely in the sarvice a soldier is always told off as a sarvint for each officer  but we are not going as officers tim percy said we are going as simple soldiers  what going as privates tim doyle said in astonishment does your honor mane to say that you are going to shoulder a firelock and just go as privates  thats it tim you see this is not a regular regiment it is a corps of irregulars and more than half the privates are gentlemen  holy mother ejaculated tim in astonishment did one ever hear of the like  then after a pause  then your honor will want a sarvint more than iver who is to clean your boots and to pipeclay your belts to wash your linen to clean your firelock and cook your dinners and pitch your tent if you dont have a sarvint the things against nature entirely  we shall do it all ourselves timthat is to say as far as cleaning the rifles washing our linen and cooking the dinner as for the other things i dont suppose we shall ever have our boots cleaned we have no white belts to pipeclay for they are made of buff leather and we shall not have to pitch tents for we dont take them with us but shall when necessary sleep in the open air  tim was too surprised to speak for a time at last he said doggedly  sarvint or no sarvint your honor it is evident that its rough times youre going to have and tim doyle will be there with you as sure as the piper  we should like you with us very much tim if you make up your mind to go ralph said but the corps is quite full we have refused dozens of recruits  tim looked downcast at last he said  well your honor it may be that they wont have me as a soldier but ill go sure enough if i die for it theres no law to punish a man for walking after a regiment of soldiers and wherever your regiment goes sure enough ill tramp after ye theres many an odd way i might make myself useful and theyll soon get used to see me about and let me come and go into the camp  no persuasion could alter tims determination and as they felt that having so attached a fellow near them might be of real utility and comfort when the boys went down in the afternoon they spoke to captain tempe about it at first he said that it was impossible as he had already refused so many offers of service but upon hearing all the story and thinking the matter over he said suddenly  by the bye there is a way by which he might go with us you know i have ordered a light twowheel cart built very strong for the mountains to carry our spare ammunition powder for blowing up bridges cooking pots and stores i have not engaged a driver as yet if your irishmanwho you say understands horseslikes to go as a driver to begin with i will promise him the first vacant rifle i fear that he will not have long to wait after we once get near the enemy and as he has already served you say he will be better than a new recruit and we can get a countryman to take his place with the cart  upon their return in the evening with the news tim doyles joy knew no bound and he whooped and shouted till milly laughed so that she had to beg of him to stop  the next day tim went down with captain barclay and signed the engagement he remained with the captain during the time that the latter was giving his instructions in musketryentering upon his duties in connection with the corps by going down to the butts and acting as markerand then returned with him to the cottage as it was agreed that he had better remain there quietly until the corps was ready to marchas if he were to venture alone in the town he might at any time be subject to a repetition of the attack upon the day of his arrival  at the cottage he soon became a general favorite his desire to make himself useful in any way his fund of fun and good temper pleased everyone even marie and jeannettethe two servants who could not understand a word of what he saidwere in a constant broad grin at the pantomime by which he endeavored to eke out his few words of french milly became quite attached to him and captain and mrs barclay both felt cheered and comforted at the thought that this devoted fellow would be at hand to look after and assist the boys in time of danger suffering or sickness    chapter 4 starting for the vosges   the day for the departure of the corps was near at hand the party at the barclays were all filled with sadness at the thoughts of separation but all strove to hide their feelings for the sake of the others captain and mrs barclay were anxious that the boys should leave in good spirits and high hope while the boys wished to keep up an appearance of merely going upon an ordinary excursion in order to cheer their parents  the day before starting the whole corps marched to the cathedral where mass was celebrated a sermon preached and a blessing solemnly prayed for for them the boys had asked their father if he had any objections to their taking part in this ceremonial in a roman catholic church but captain barclay had at once said that upon the contrary he should wish them to do so protestants might not approve of many things in the catholic church but that could be no reason whatever against a protestant taking part in a solemn prayer to god wherever that prayer might be offered up  the young duburgs were unaffectedly glad that the time for their departure had come for the month that had passed had been a most unpleasant one to them their mother had in vain tried to persuade them to stay first by entreaty and then by anger and finding these means fail she had passed her time either in sullen silence or in remaining in bed declaring that her nerves were utterly shattered and that she should never survive it she had refused to see mrs barclay when the latter called a day or two after their visit to the cottage and she had not been near her since julie and justine were forbidden to go in to see milly and altogether there was quite an estrangement between the two families  the boys however were of course constantly together and monsieur duburg came in as usual every day or two for a chat with captain barclay  september the fifteenththe day of separationarrived they were to march at eight in the morning and left home therefore at seven this was so far fortunate that it left less time for the painful adieus captain barclay had a long talk with the boys the night before repeating all the hints and instructions which he had before given them  it is not necessary to describe the parting every one of my readers can imagine for themselves how sad was the scene how milly sobbed aloud in spite of her efforts how mrs barclay kissed her boys and then ran up to her own room to cry alone how their father wrung their hands and after giving them his blessing turned hastily away that they might not see the tears which he could not keep back and how the boys in spite of their uniform and their dignity as soldiers cried too tim doyle had gone on an hour before taking their blankets so they had nothing to do but to snatch up their guns and hasten away half blinded with tears towards the town they reached it just as the bugle sounded the assembly by this time they had steadied themselves and in the work of preparing for the start soon lost all feeling of despondency  it would be difficult to find a more workmanlike little corps than the franc tireurs of dijon as with the band of the national guard at their head playing the marseillaise they marched through the old city their uniform was a brownish gray their blanketsrolled up tight and carried like a scarf over one shoulder and under the other armwere brown also their belts and gaiters were of buff leather their caps had flat peaks to shade their eyes but round the cap was rolled a flap lined with fur which let down over the ears and back of the neck tying under the chin on the outer side of the fur was thin indiarubber to throw the rain off down over the light waterproof cloaks which each man carried in a small case slung to his belt the waterproof on the caps when rolled up did not show the caps then looking like fur caps with a peak  slung over the shoulder on the opposite side to the blanket was a haversackor stout canvas bagbrown like the rest of the equipments each bag was divided into two compartments the larger one holding a spare shirt a few pairs of socks and handkerchiefs a comb and other small necessaries in the other bread biscuits or other provisions could be carried each man had also a water bottle slung over his shoulder  on either side of the ammunition pouch behind was strapped a new boot so placed that it in no way interfered with the bearer getting at the pouch next was fastened the tin box the lid of which forms a plate the bottom a saucepan or frying pan on one side hung the bayonet upon the other a hatchet a pick or a shorthandled shoveleach company having ten of each implement  it will be judged that this was a heavy load but the articles were all necessaries and the weight over and above the rifle and ammunition was noteven including the pick or shovelmore than half that ordinarily carried by a french soldier  at the head of the corps marched its commandant the french term commandant answers to an english major and he will therefore in future be termed major tempe each of the four companies was also headed by its officer major tempe had chosen for these posts four men who like himself had servedthree in the army and one in the navy he had written to them as soon as the corps was organized and they had arrived ten days before the start one or two only of the franc tireurswho had entertained a hope of being made officerswere at first a little discontented but as it was evidently vastly to the advantage of the corps to have experienced officers the appointments gave great satisfaction to the rest of the men fortunately there were in the ranks several men who had served as privates or noncommissioned officers and from these major tempe selected a sergeant and a corporal for each company  behind the corps followed the cart loaded with the stores of the corps a considerable amount of ammunition two or three cases of gun cotton for blowing up bridges several small barrels of powder a large quantity of fine iron wire three or four crowbars bags of coffee and rice and a keg of brandy four kettles and as many large saucepans together with all sorts of odds and ends by the side of the horse walked tim doyle dressed in the uniform of the corps but without the equipments and with a long blouse worn over his tunic he was in fact already enrolled as an active member of the corps this was done in the first place at his own earnest request and upon the plea that thus only could he escape the chance of being seized as a spy whenever he might for a moment be separated from the corps and also that unless he had a uniform like the rest how could he take any vacancy in the ranks even when it should occur  major tempe in exceeding the hundred and twenty determined upon was influenced partly by these arguments but more by the fact that difficulties would arise about food cooking and various other points if the driver were not upon the same footing as the rest of the corps  the march was not a long oneonly to the railway station a few carriages with a truck for the cart and a horse box were drawn up alongside the platform in readiness and in ten minutes more all were in their places the carriages attached to the ordinary train andamidst great cheering and waving of handkerchiefs and hats from hundreds of people collected in the station to see them offthey started for the vosges  railway traveling at no time rapid was extremely slow at this period and it was evening before they arrived at epinal where they were to pass the night the journey shortened by innumerable songs and choruses had scarcely seemed long the railway ran throughout its whole distance through pretty undulating country indeed towards the end of their journey when they were fairly among the vosges the scenery became wild and savage at vesoul which was about halfway the train had stopped for two hours and here wine bread and cheese cold sausages and fruits were distributed to the men by the inhabitantswho were assembled in large numbers at the station and gave the corps an enthusiastic reception they were the first band of franc tireurs who had passed through and the inhabitants regarded them as protectors against the wandering uhlans whose fame although as yet far off had caused them to be regarded with an almost superstitious fear  at epinal a similar and even warmer greeting awaited them epinal being so much nearer to the enemy that the fear of uhlans was more acute the station was decorated with green boughs and the maire with many of the leading inhabitants was at the station to receive them the corps formed upon the platform and then marched through the little town to the hotel de ville loudly cheered by the people as they passed along here they were dismissed with the order to parade again at halfpast four in the morning  there was no trouble as to billets for the night as the maire had already made out a list of the inhabitants who had offered accommodationthe number being greatly in excess of the strength of the corps these persons now came forward and each took off the number of franc tireurs who had been allotted to them  the sergeant of the first company knowing the relationship and friendship of the young barclays and duburgs had promised them thatwhen practicablehe would always quarter them together upon the present occasion the four were handed over to a gentleman whose house was a short distance outside the town upon the way he chatted to them on the proposed course of the corps upon its organization and discipline and they asked for the first time the question which was so often in future to be upon their lips  had he any news of the enemy  the answer was that none as yet had come south of luneville and that indeed at present they were too much occupied at metz and strasburg to be able to detach any formidable parties small bodies of uhlans occasionally had made raids and driven in sheep and cattle but they had not ventured to trust themselves very far into the mountains  upon arriving at the residence of their host they were most kindly received by his wife and daughter who however could not refrain from expressing their surprise at the youthfulness of their guests  but these are mere boys the lady said to her husband in german are all the franc tireurs like these  oh no her husband said in the same language the greater part are sturdy fellows but as they marched by i observed some twelve or fourteen who were scarcely out of their boyhood  it is cruelty to send such youngsters out as these what can they do against these prussians who have beaten our best soldiers  fortunately ralph said in germanwhich he spoke fluently as has already been statedand with a merry laughwhich showed that he was not offended at the remarkfortunately fighting now is not an affair of spears and battle axes age has nothing to do with shooting and as for fatigue we shall not be the first in the corps to give up  i must really apologize very much but i had no idea that you understood german or i should not have made any remarks the lady said smiling but so few french boys out of alsace do understand it that it never struck me that you spoke the language you will find it an immense advantage for outside the towns you will scarcely meet a person understanding french but i am sure you must be all very hungry and supper is quite ready  they were soon seated at a wellspread tablewaited upon by the daughter of the familywhile their host and hostess sat and chatted with them as to their corps while the meal went on  excuse another remark upon your personal appearance the lady said smiling but two of you look more like alsatians than french you have the fair complexion and brown wavy hair you do not look like frenchmen  nor are we ralph laughed my brother and myself although french born are actually english our father is an english officer but our mother is french and as you see we take after him rather than her  but i wonder that as your father is english he lets you go out upon this expeditionwhich is very perilous  we wished to gothat is we thought it was our duty ralph said and although they were very sad at our leaving they both agreed with us  i wish all frenchmen were animated by the same feeling their host said warmly your gallant example should shame hundreds of thousands of loiterers and skulkers  you speak french perfectly i should have had no idea that you were anything but frenchor rather from the way you speak german that you were alsatian  we have lived in france all our lives except for two years which we passed in germany and two years at one time together with one or two shorter visits in england  and do you speak english as well as french  oh yes we always speak english at home our father made a rule that we should always do so as he said it would be an immense disadvantage to us when we returned to england if we had the slightest french accent our mother now speaks english as purely and correctly as our father  are your friends any relations of yours  they are our cousins ralph said their father is our mothers brother  for some time longer they chatted and then their host said  it is halfpast nine and we are early people here you will have to be up by five so i think that it is time you were off to bed we shall scarcely be up when you start but you will find a spirit lamp on the table with coffeewhich only requires heatingtogether with some bread and butter you will have some miles to march before you breakfast  and now you must all promise me that if you come to this place again you will come straight up here and look upon it as your home if you get ill or woundedwhich i hope will not happenyou will of course go home but something may occur not sufficiently important for you to leave the corps but which could be set straight by a few days nursing and rest in that case you will come to us will you not  the boys all gratefully promised to avail themselves of the invitation in case of need and then said good night and goodbye to their host and went off to the room prepared for them in the morning they were up in good time dressed as quietly as they couldso as not to disturb their hostand went downstairs lit the spirit lamp under a glass bowl full of coffee and milk and in ten minutes were on their way towards the town  we shall be lucky if we are often as comfortable as that percy said looking back and there was a general assent  there goes the bugle louis duburg said we have a quarter of an hour yet  what pretty girls those were  louis was nearly seventeen and at seventeen a french lad considers himself a competent judge as to the appearance and manners of young ladies  were they percy said carelessly with the indifference of an english boy of his age as to girls i did not notice it i dont care for girls they are always thinking about their dress and one is afraid of touching them in case you should spoil something there is nothing jolly about them  the others laughed  i am sure milly is jolly enough philippe duburg said  yes milly is jolly percy answered you see she has been with us boys and she can play and doesnt screech if you touch her or mind a bit if she tears her frock so are our cousins in englandsome of them yes there are some jolly girls of course still after all whats the good of them taking them altogether they are very nice in their wayquiet and well behaved and so onbut they are better indoors than out  the clock was just striking halfpast five as the boys reached the place of assembly most of the men were already upon the spot and the bugler was blowing lustily in another five minutes all were assembled including tim doyle with his horse and cart  goodmorning tim the boys said as they came up to him i hope you had as comfortable quarters as we had last night  splendid your honordownright splendid a supper fit for a lord and a bed big enough for a duchess  the boys laughed at the idea of a duchess wanting a bed bigger than anyone else and tim went on  ah your honor if campaigning was all like this sure id campaign all my life and thank you but its many a time i shall look back upon my big supper and big bed not that i should like it altogether entirely i should get so fat and so lazy that i shouldnt know my own shadow  and now the bugle sounded again and the men fell in as they started they struck up a lively marching song and several windows opened and adieus were waved to them as they passed down the street into the open country everyone was in high spirits the weather which had for some time been unfavorable had cleared up the sun was rising brightly and they felt that they had fairly started for work the road was rough the country wild and mountainous thick forests extended in every direction as far as the eye could carry  there is one comfort percy ralph said if we are beaten and driven back we might get into this forest and laugh at the prussians  percy cast rather a doubtful eye at the dark woods  the prussians might not be able to discover us ralph but i would as leave be killed by prussian balls as die of hunger and our chances of getting food there for a hundred men would be very slight  they dont look hospitable certainly percy i agree with you we had better keep in the open country as long as possible  the first village at which they arrived was deyvilliers here a halt was called for ten minutes five miles having already been marched many of the menless fortunate than the barclays and duburgshad had nothing to eat upon starting and when the arms were piled there was a general dispersal through the village in search of provisions bread had been bought over night at epinal and brought on in the cart which was fortunate for the village was a very small one and there would have been a difficulty in obtaining more than a loaf or two cheese and fruit were in abundance and the boys bought some apples and sat down by the little feeder of the moselle which passes through the village and watched it tumbling past on its way to join the main stream a few miles below epinal  in a quarter of an hour they were again on the march in another five miles they reached fontaine lying a little off the road to their right they had now marched ten miles and major tempe ordered a halt for three hours a piece of level ground was chosen arms were piled blankets and haversacks taken off and then preparations began for their first meal men were sent off with kettles for water others went up to the village with cans for wineor beer for in alsace beer is more common than wine tim took the horse out of the shafts and gave him some oats some of the men were sent from each company to fetch wood and the old soldiers prepared for the important operation of cooking  several little fireplaces were made with stones and turf open on the side facing the wind in these sticks were placed and when they were fairly alight the saucepanseach holding the allowance of ten menwere placed on them in these the meatcut up in pieces of about half a poundwas placed with pepper salt onions rice and potatoes peeled and cut up and the whole filled up with water  when the preparations were finished the men threw themselves down under the shade of some trees and smoked and chatted until in about an hour the cooking was complete each man then brought up his tin canteen and received his portion of soup in the deep side and his meat and vegetables in the shallow can the bread had already been cut up the tin drinking pots which with knives forks and spoons were carried in the canteens were filled with beer and with much laughing and fun each man sat down on the grass or scattered rocks to eat his breakfast  many of the villagers had come down and these brought for the most part little presents a few apples a little fresh cheese or a bunch of grapes it was a merry meal and the boys agreed that it was the jolliest picnic that they had ever been at  at two oclock the bugle sounded the cooking things were packed up and placed in the cart again the blankets and haversacks slung on and the rifles shouldered and with many a good wish from the peasants they marched forward again  eight miles further marching brought them to the end of their days journey the village of destord it was a tiny place with scarcely over a halfdozen houses major tempe in consequence determined as the weather was fine upon bivouacking in the open air for a time all were busy collecting wood a sheltered place was chosen for the village lay very high close to the source of a little stream running into the river mortagne  the cooking places were again prepared for supper at seven oclock the meal was served differing but little from that of the morning except that after the men had eaten the soup and the meat from it in france called bouilli they fried some thin slices of meat in the lids of their canteens and concluded the meal with a cup of coffee  then four large fires were litone for each companyand a smaller one for the officers blankets were spread out on the ground round these fires and the men lit their pipes and chatted gaily all were more or less tired for although their months hard drill had accustomed them to work eighteen miles with arms ammunition and accouterments had tired them more than they had anticipated  as this was their first night out major tempe told them that he should not place a regular cordon of sentries but that in future he should do so whether they were near the enemy or not by nine oclock the fires began to burn low the talking gradually ceased and the menrolling themselves up in their blankets and putting their haversacks under their heads for pillowssoon dropped off to sleep a solitary sentry keeping guard against pilferers  a short march of ten miles took them next day to rambervillers where they were billeted among the inhabitants and fourteen miles on the day after to baccarat on the river meurthe where they also obtained quarters they were now approaching the neighborhood of the enemy and major tempe advised a halt for the next day in order that he might make inquiries and investigate thoroughly the best route to be pursued    chapter 5 the first engagement   the news which the commandant of the franc tireurs heard at baccarat determined him to change his intentions and to push on without delay to hallovillea tiny hamlet on the lower spurs of the vosges some four miles from blamont and overlooking the valley of the vexouse in which the latter town was situated  it was a long march and the weather had again changed the rain descending all day in a steady pour the menin their light waterproof cloaks and the flaps of their forage caps downplodded steadily on their spirit sustained by the thought that ere another twentyfour hours they might be in action the news which hurried them forwards had been to the effect that a body of two hundred uhlans had left sarrebourg and were advancing towards blamont they were going quietly stopping to levy contributions at the villages on the way it was probable that they would enter blamont on the same evening that the franc tireurs reached halloville it was supposed that they would proceed with the sheep and cattle that they had swept up by the valley of the vexouse to luneville  to within four miles of halloville the road had been a fair one but it was here necessary to turn off by a track that was little better than a goat path in vain a dozen of the men were told off to help with the cart in vain they pushed behind and shoved at the spokes of the wheels the road was altogether impracticable at last the horse and cart were taken aside into a thick wood and left there with tim doyle a corporal and six of the men who were the most footsore and incapable of pushing on tim was dreadfully disgusted at being thus cut off from the chance of seeing and joining in any fighting and only consoled himself with the hope that a vacancy would be likely to occur the next day and that he would then be able to exchange his whip for a rifle  the rest of the corps plodded on until long after dusk they arrived at the halfdozen houses which form the village of halloville their appearance as they marched up to it was greeted by a scream from a woman followed by a perfect chorus of screams and cries men women and children were seen rushing out of the houses and taking to flight and it was with the greatest difficulty that they were made to understand the truth that the formidable body which had so suddenly dropped upon them was not composed of the dreaded invaders  when the truth was known they did their best to receive them hospitably their means however were small their houses equally so however in a short time blazing fires were lighted on the hearths blankets having been put up before the windows to prevent any light being visible from the valley a fire was allotted for the cooking of each company and preparations for supper were soon commenced then an examination was made of the facilities in the way of sleeping and two barns were found well provided with straw this was shaken out and after eating their suppers the men packed close together upon the straw and soon forgot both damp and fatigue numerous sentries being thrown out in various directions to prevent the possibility of surprisefor the peasants had informed them that the information which they had received was correct and that the uhlans about two hundred strong had entered blamont that afternoon and had laid a requisition of twenty thousand francs upon the inhabitants besides a considerable amount of stores of all sorts  at three oclock they were roused and found to their great pleasure that the rain had ceased guided by one of the villagers they made their way down to a point where the wood approached quite close to the road at a narrow point of the valley here major tempe posted his men along in the wood several coils of wire had been brought with them and these were now stretched tightly from tree to tree at a distance of about eighteen inches from the ground some forty yards farther back young trees were felled and branches cut and these were laid with the bushy parts towards the road wires being twisted here and there among them so as to form abattis perfectly impenetrable for horsemen and difficult in the extreme for infantry all worked hard and by eight oclock in the morning everything was in readiness  a small party had been left upon the high ground near halloville and one of them had brought down news every half hour soon after daybreak a party of uhlans had been seen to leave blamont and to visit barbas and harboisetwo villages in the flat of blamontand then to retire driving some cattle and sheep before them at ten oclock the rest of the men from halloville came down with the news that the uhlansabout two hundred stronghad just left blamont and were coming down the valley  each man now took the station allotted to him thirty men behind the trees next to the road the main body being stationed behind the abattis each man having previously settled upon a spot where he could fire through the leaves which entirely concealed them from view from the road number one company was placed to the right and consequently near to blamont ralph and percy were both in the front line behind the trees  not a shot was to be fired on any consideration until major tempe gave the word the men behind the trees were all ordered to lie down among the low undergrowth and brushwood the line extended nearly a hundred yards the waterproofs blankets and all other impediments had been left behind at halloville so that the men had the free use of their arms the rifles were loaded the pouches shifted round so as to be ready at hand andorders having been given that not a word should be spoken even in a whispera perfect silence reigned over the spot  ralph and percy were near to each other they had exchanged a hearty grip of the hand before lying down and now lay with beating hearts and hands firmly grasping their rifles in readiness for the signal  the time was not very longonly a few minutesbut it seemed to them an age before they heard the tramp of horses nearer and nearer they came and now they could hear the jingling of accouterments first through their leafy screen they could see two uhlans pass at a walk scanning keenly the woods and looking for possible danger the bushes were thick and they noticed nothing and kept on at the same pace it is probable indeed that they really anticipated no possibility of an attack as the dijon franc tireurs were the first who appeared upon the scene of action and the prussians were consequently in entire ignorance of the vicinity of any armed body of the enemy and at worst apprehended a stray shot from a straggler from one of the french armies hidden in the woods  in another minute or two four more uhlans passed and after the same interval came the main body escorting a number of cattle and sheep the greater portion had passed the spot where the boys were lying and were opposite the whole line of franc tireurs when the silence of the wood was broken by major tempes shout  now  before the uhlans had time to rein in their horses or to ask each other what was the meaning of the cry the flash of thirty rifles broke from the trees and several men fell from their horses there was a momentary panic followed by a hurried discharge of carbines at the invisible foe  the captain of the uhlansa handsome young officer with light mustache and beardshouted to his men  steady they are only a handful form line charge  quickly as the maneuver was executed the franc tireurs had time to fire again and thenin accordance with their ordersretreated and joined their comrades by passages left in the abattis on purpose in another instant the uhlans charged but as quickly the direst confusion reigned where before had been a regular line the wire had served its purpose horses and men went down on the top of each other and thirty rifles again fumed their deadly hail into the confused mass  the second line of uhlanswho had not chargedreturned the fire of their invisible enemies and although they could not see them several of the balls took effect nothing could be cooler than the officers of the uhlans and their voice and example steadied their men under cover of the fire of their comrades the men in part extricated themselves and their horses and drew back behind the wood orders were then given for all to dismount and leaving their horses to be held by parties of their comradesfour horses to one manthe rest advanced on foot against their apparently greatly inferior foe keeping up a heavy fire with their carbines this was what the commandant of the franc tireurs had hoped for and expected  the wire had been broken down by the weight of the horses and the prussians advanced opposed only by a feeble return to their heavy fire until within five paces of the leafy wall then the fire from a hundred rifles flashed out upon them  the effect was terrible and a cry of surprise and rage burst from those who had escaped its effect it was evident that they had fallen into an ambush the captainwild with rage and mortification at the fault he had committedrushed forward and his men gallantly seconded his efforts in vain however did they try to separate the interlaced boughs while as they struggled the shots from the enemy flashed out thick and fast in another moment the young captain threw up his arms and fell shot through the heart the officer next in command ordered a retreat the horses were regained and amidst a continuous fire from the franc tireurs the diminished troop galloped back towards blamont  the franc tireurs now quitted their leafy fortress a small party was at once sent forward up the valley to give notice if the uhlans showed any signs of returning a strong body set to work to drive in the scattered animalswhich were galloping wildly about the valleywhile the rest collected the dead and wounded  of the franc tireurs eight were killed fourteen wounded of the uhlans fortyseven were killed and nineteen wounded remained on the ground their large number of killed in proportion to the wounded was accounted for by the fact that the firing was so close that in many cases the coats of the dead men were actually singed by the explosion while the slightly wounded men had been able to regain their horses and escape  the first impulse of the young barclays when the fire ceased was to turn round and to embrace each other with delighton finding that they had each escaped without a scratchand then to shake hands heartily with their cousins whose fortune had been equally good there was no time for words however for major tempes order came sharp and decisive  you the barclays you also the duburgs sling your arms and go assist to drive in the cattle quick lose no time  you have done well i am content with you my boys  with a flush of pleasure the boys started off to carry out the orders which had been given by their commander with the kind thought of sparing the lads the terrible sight of the battle ground  the short but desperate conflict through which they had passed seemed to the young barclays almost like a dream in the excitement of loading and firing in the tumult and the rattle they had scarcely had time even to give a thought to the danger  fear is seldom felt by the soldier when engaged in close conflict the time when his nerves are most tried is while waiting inactive at a distance exposed to a heavy shell fire or while advancing to an attack under a storm of musketry and artillery in a handtohand conflict he has no time to think his nerves are strung up to so high a pitch that he no longer thinks of danger or death his whole thoughts are given to loading and firing  any thought that the boys had given to danger was not for themselves but for each other and ralphthough his own position was unshelteredhad once or twice spoken to percy to keep his body better sheltered by the trees behind which he was standing  it was a long chase before the frightened animals were collected together and driven up towards the spot where the fight had taken place by the time that it was accomplished the wounded had been collected and the surgeons had bandaged many of their wounds a qualified surgeon had accompanied the corps as its regular doctor and two other young surgeons had enlisted in its ranks and these their arms laid by were now assisting to stanch the wounds and to apply bandages of the franc tireurs there were only four so seriously wounded that they were unable to walk  by that time two carts arrived from the village of douteppe which stood in the valley half a mile only from the scene of action and to which place major tempe had sent off a messenger directly the affair had terminated in one of these the wounded were placed while in the other were piled the arms and accouterments of the fallen uhlans one of the young surgeons was to accompany the wounded as far as baccarat where they were to remain for treatment  twentythree horses of the uhlans had also been captured by the party who had driven in the cattleamong whom they were galloping four men were told off to take them back to epinal and there dispose of them with their accouterments for the benefit of the military chest of the corps  the question then arose as to what was to be done with the prussian wounded major tempe decided this by saying that as it was quite impossible for the corps to be burdened with wounded men the best plan was to allow one of the slightly wounded among the prisoners to walk back to blamont with a message that the uhlans could come back to fetch their wounded without molestation as the franc tireurs were upon the point of taking their departure  the corps then assembled round a grave which had already been dug and into it the bodies of their comrades who had fallen were placed major tempe then said a few brief words of adieu hoping that all who fell might die equally bravely and victoriously then the sods were shoveled in and the men saddened by the scenethough still flushed with the triumph of their first and signal successprepared to leave the spot  major tempe had already held a consultation with his officers and their plan of operation had been decided upon the difficulty which they had encountered the evening before with the horse and cart had already proved that it would be impossible to drag it about with them they had also taken thirty fine cattle and upwards of a hundred sheep from the enemy and it was therefore resolved to establish a sort of headquarters in the mountains where they could retire after their expeditions and defy the efforts of the prussians to disturb them the spot fixed upon was the forest of bousson high up among the vosges and distant two hard days marching  a portion of the troop therefore went round to halloville to fetch the accouterments blankets etc which had been left there while the rest marched by the road to the place where the cart had been left the night before two peasants were engaged as guides and in the afternoon the corps started for their destination  it was a terrible march the roads were mere tracks and the weather was terrible over and over again the men had to unload the carts shoulder the contents and carry them for a considerable distance until ground was reached where the cart could again be loaded  it was not until late on the evening of the third days march that thoroughly done up by fatigue and hardship the corps reached the little village of raon in the heart of the forest of bousson there was no possible fear of attack here and the commandant decided that for the night there was no occasion for any of the men to be out as sentries the villagers at once took charge of the animals and turned them into a rough enclosure the men were too much done up even to care about keeping awake until supper could be cooked andbeing divided among the houses of the villagethey threw themselves down and were fast asleep in a few minutes  the next morning the sun shone out brightly and the men turning out after a long sleep felt quite different creatures to the tired band who had wearily crawled into the village the bright sky the fresh morning air the pleasant odor of the great pine forest around them and the bracing atmosphereat the height of fifteen hundred feet above the seaat once refreshed and cheered them  there was a brief morning paradeat which tim doyle for the first time took his place with a rifle on his shoulderand then the major dismissed them saying that there would be no further parade that day and that the men could amuse themselves as they liked in a short time every man was following the bent of his own inclination first however there was a general cleaning of the rifles and accouterments then most of the men went down to the stream and there was a great washing of clothes accompanied with much laughing and joking then needles and thread were obtained from the women of the village and there was much mending and darningfor the past three days work among rocks and woods had done no little damage to their uniforms  next came the grand operation of breakfast for which two of the sheep had been killed this being the first regular meal that they had had for three days was greatly enjoyed after it was eaten most of the men lit their pipes and prepared to pass a day of delightful idleness two or three of the village boys had been engaged as cowherds and shepherds and the animals were all driven out into the woods where in the open glades they would find an abundance of food  the cart was unanimously condemned as worse than useless an empty shed was turned into a storehouse and it was determined that such stores of powder etc as might be required upon each expedition should be packed upon the horses back and if the horse could not take all required that other horses should be hired  the barclays with their cousins started for a ramble in the wood taking with them the irishman whose good humor and unflagging spirits during the last three days had made him a general favorite  sure and are there any wild bastes in the wood your honor because if there be it would be well to take our rifles with us it would be mighty unpleasant to come across a lion or a tiger and not to be able to pass him the time of day  no tim we shall meet neither lions nor tigers so you need not trouble yourself with a rifle a hundred years ago we might have met with a bear or a wild boar but they have disappeared long since it is possible that there are a few wolves scattered about but they are never formidable to any but a solitary person even in winter and at all other times fly from mans approach  the party had a charming ramble for the scenery here was very fine at times the forest was so thick that they could see no glimpse of the sky and the trunks of the trees seemed to make a wall all round them then again it would open and they would obtain a glimpse over the country far away rise beyond rise to the plain of champagne orif the view were behind instead of in front of themthey could see the tops of the highest range of the vosges rising hill above hill and often wooded to the very summitthe donon one of the highest points of the range being immediately behind them  the villages are here few and far between and the people extremely poor for the soil is poor and although in summer the cattlewhich form their only wealthare able to pick up an abundance of food in the forests they have a hard struggle to keep them alive during the winter their language is german and their appearance and dress rather german than french but notwithstanding this they were thoroughly french in spirit and regarded the invaders with an intense hatred  another day passed in rest completely restored the most exhausted of the band orders were therefore issued for an early start the next morning the object this time being to endeavor to cut the railway the band were to march in a body for the slopes of the vosges behind sarrebourg and saverne and were then to divide into companies and scatter themselves among the villages between lorquin and marmontier so as to act together or separately as it might seem expedient    chapter 6 the tunnel of saverne   it is needless to follow the corps step by step through their marches for the names of the little villages through which they passed would not be found in any maps published in england and would therefore possess little interest for english readers after two days long marches the main body of the corps reached a village situated in a wood at about four miles from the great rock tunnel of saverne the fourth company had been left at a village five miles to the left while the third company were next day to march forward to a place at about the same distance to the right their orders were to keep a sharp lookout to collect news of the movements and strength of the enemy but not to undertake any expedition or to do anything whatever to lead the enemy to guess at their presence in the neighborhoodas it was of vital importance that they should not be put upon their guard until the great blow was struck  as soon as they had marched into the village the principal inhabitants came forward and a consultation was held as to providing lodgings after some conversation it was agreed that the officers should have quarters in the village and that the schoolroomstwo in numbershould be placed at the disposal of the men they were goodsized rooms and would hold thirty men each without difficulty the company who were to march forward in the morning were provided with quarters in the village  ralph and percy barclay as usual acted as interpreters between major tempe and the inhabitants for neither the major nor any of his officers spoke german that language indeed was spoken only by a few men in the whole corps and these the commandant had divided among the other companies in order that each company might be able to shift for itself when separated from the main body  have you seen this proclamation one of the villagers asked you see that we are running no little risk in taking you in  ralph read it and as he did so his face flushed with indignation and he exclaimed  this is infamous infamous  what is it major tempe asked  it is a proclamation from the prussian general commanding the district major giving notice that he will shoot every franc tireur he may catch and also giving notice to the inhabitants that if any prussian soldier be killed or even shot at by a franc tireurif a rail be pulled up or a road cutthat he will hold the village near the spot accountable will burn the houses and treat the male inhabitants according to martial law and that the same penalties will be exacted for sheltering or hiding franc tireurs  impossible major tempe said astounded no officer of a civilized army could issue such an edict besides during an invasion of germany the people were summoned by the king of prussia to take up arms to cut roads destroy bridges and shoot down the enemyjust as we are going to do now it is too atrocious to be true  there it is in black and white ralph said there can be no mistake as to the wording  major tempe looked grieved as well as indignant  this will be a terrible business he said if the war is to be carried on in this way of course if they give us no quarter we shall give them none that is we must make as many prisoners as we can in order that if any of our men are taken prisoners we may carry out reprisals if they shoot them  it will besides this do us great harm naturally the villagers instead of looking upon us as defenders will regard us as the most dangerous of guests they will argue  if we make no resistance the prussians may plunder us but at least our houses and our lives are safe whereas if these franc tireurs are found to have been with us or if they make any attack in our neighborhood we are not only plundered but burnt out and shot  of course we are always liable to treachery there are scoundrels always to be found who would sell their own mothers but now even the most patriotic cannot but feel that they are running an immense risk in sheltering us  never before i believe in the annals of civilized nations did a man in authority dare to proclaim that persons should suffer for a crime with which they had nothing whatever to do if we arrive at a little village how are the people to say to us we will not allow you to pull up a rail and yet if they do not prevent us they are to be punished with fire and sword and these people call themselves a civilized nation  one of the evil consequences of this proclamation is that we shall never dare trust to the inhabitants to make inquiries for us they will be so alarmed in case we should attempt anything in their neighborhood that they would be sure to do and say everything they could to dissuade us from it and if inclined to treachery might even try to buy their own safety by betraying us  major tempe was speaking to the other officers who thoroughly agreed with his opinion ralph and percy had remained in the room in case any further questions might be asked in reference to the proclamation they now asked if anything else were required and upon a negative answer being given saluted and took their leave it was dusk when they went out and as they walked towards the schoolroom they heard a great tumult of voices raised in anger among which they recognized that of tim doyle  howld yer jaw you jabbering apes he exclaimed in great wrath give me a lantern or a candle and let me begone the boys are all waiting for me to begin  hurrying up they found tim surrounded by a few of the principal inhabitants of the village and soon learned the cause of the dispute supper was served but it was too dark to see to eat it and timalways ready to make himself usefulhad volunteered to go in search of a light he had in vain used his few words of french with the villagers he met and these had at last called the schoolmaster the only person in the village who understood french this man had addressed tim first in french and then in german and upon receiving no coherent answer in either language had arrived at the conclusion that tim was making fun of them hence the dispute had arisen  the boys explained matters and the villagerswhose knowledge of england was of the very vaguest description and most of whom indeed had previously believed that all the world spoke either french or germanwere profuse in apologies and immediately procured some candles with which tim and the boys hastened to the schoolroom two candles were given to each company andone being lighted at each end of the room and stuck upon nails in the wallthe boys were enabled to see what the place was like  clean straw had been littered a foot deep down each side of the room and fifteen blankets were folded side by side along by each wall upon pegs abovemeant for the scholars capshung the haversacks water bottles and other accouterments while the rifles were piled along the center of the room leaving space enough to walk down upon either side between them and the beds at the farther end of the room was a large fireplace in which a log fire was blazing and a small shed outside had been converted into a kitchen  we might be worse off than this a long way ralph said louis duburg as ralph took his place on the straw next to him  that we might louis the fire looks cheerful too and the nights are getting very cold  that they are ralph  ah here is supper i am quite ready for that too  the men who officiated as cooksand who by agreement had been released from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupationnow brought in a large saucepan full of soup and each man went up with his canteen and received his portion returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it  anything new barclay one of the men asked from the other side of the room  yes indeed ralph said new and disagreeable mind none of you get taken prisoners for the prussian general has issued a proclamation that he shall shoot all franc tireurs he catches  impossible came in a general chorus from all present  well it sounds like it but it is true enough and ralph repeated word for word the proclamation which he had translated to major tempe  as might have been expected it raised a perfect storm of indignation and this lasted until at nine oclock the sergeant gave the word  lights out  in the morning after parade ralph and percy strolled away together and had a long talk and at the end of an hour they walked to the house where major tempe had established his headquarters  good morning my friends he said as they entered is there anything i can do for you sit down  we have been thinking sirpercy and ithat we could very easily dress up as peasants and go down to saverne or anywhere you might think fit and find out all particulars as to the strength and position of the enemy no one would suspect two boys of being franc tireurs it would be unlikely in the extreme that anyone would ask us any questions and if we were asked we should say we belonged to some village in the mountains and had come down to buy coffee and other necessaries the risk of detection would be next to nothing for we speak german quite well enough to pass for lads from the mountains  major tempe was silent a minute  you know you would be shot at once if you were detected  no doubt sir but there is no reason in the world why we should be detected the prussians cant know everyone by sight even within the town itself and will not notice us at all if they do our answer is sufficient  i tell you frankly boys i was thinking only last night of the matter buthowever much you may make light of itthere is of course a certain amount of danger in acting as spies and your fathermy friend captain barclaymight say to me if evil came of it  i gave you my boys to fight for france and you have sent them to their death as spies  so i resolved to say nothing about it  but now we have offered sir the case is different ralph said from our knowledge of the language and from our age we are better fitted than anyone in the corps to perform this service and therefore it would be clearly our duty to perform it were it greatly more dangerous than it is our father said to us at starting  do your duty boys whatever the danger  we will see about our clothesthere can be no difficulty about that there are several lads in the village whose things would fit us shall we come in this afternoon for instructions  thank you lads major tempe said warmly i trust with you that no harm will come of it but your offer is of too great advantage to the corps for me to persist in my refusal  upon leaving the quarters of the commandant the boys went at once to the house of a farmer a short distance from the village where the day before they had noticed two boys of about their own size they explained to the farmer that they wanted to buy of him a suit of the working clothes of each of his sons greatly surprised at this request the farmer had inquired what they could possibly want them for and ralphwho thought it better not to trust him with the secretreplied that as the prussian general had given notice that he should shoot all franc tireurs he might take prisoners they wanted a suit of clothes each which they might slip on in case of defeat or danger of capture the pretense was a plausible one and the farmer sold them the required clothes charging only about twice their cost when new  the boys took the parcel and instead of returning to the village direct they hid it carefully in a wood at a short distance away they then returned and in the afternoon received detailed instructions from major tempe  it was arranged that the matter should be kept entirely secret lest any incautious word might be overheard and reported they were to start at daybreak upon the following morning their cousins and tim doyle beingalonetaken into their confidence their friends regretted much that they could not accompany them and share their danger the boys pointed out however thateven could they have spoken german fluentlythey could not have gone with them as although two strangers would excite no attention whatever five would be certain to do so  the next morning they started together as if for a walk upon reaching the spot in the wood where the peasants clothes were hidden the boys took off their uniformswhich were wrapped up and concealed in the same placeand put on the clothes they fitted fairly and more than that was not necessary as peasants clothes are seldom cut accurately to the figure rounding their shoulders and walking with a clumping sort of stride no one would have imagined that they were other than they pretended to betwo awkwardlooking young alsatian lads  they cut two heavy sticks exchanged a hearty goodbye with their friends and started for saverne two hours later they were walking in its streets staring into the shop windows and at everything that was going on with the openmouthed curiosity of two young country lads then they made a few purchasessome coffee sugar and peppertied them in a colored pocket handkerchief and then went into a small cabaretwhere they saw some german soldiers drinkingsat down at a table and called for some bread and cheese and beer  while they were taking them they listened to the conversation of the soldiers the only information that they gleaned from it was that the men seemed to have no expectation whatever of any early movement and that they were heartily sick of the monotony of the place and the hard work of patrolling the line of railway night and day presently the soldiers paid for their beer and left and some of the townspeople came in and took the places they had left their conversation of course turned on the prussian occupation and deep were the curses heaped upon the invaders the only thing mentioned in their favor was the smallness of their number there were not over two hundred men and this amount weighed but lightly upon saverne compared with the fifty sixty or a hundred quartered at every little village along the line of railway  the boys had now learned what they most wanted to know and paying for their refreshment went out again into the street then they walked to the railway stationwhere they saw several soldiers on guardand then set off to a point where they could see the entrance to the tunnel there two soldiers were on guard while others were stationed at short distances all along the line  the boys now went up to a wood whence unseen themselves they could watch the trains passing they came along nearly every half hour immensely long trains filled with stores of all kinds as it became dusk they saw a body of prussian soldiers marching down the line relieving the sentries and placing fresh ones at distances of little more than fifty yards apart these marched backwards and forwards until they met each other then returning until they faced their comrade at the other end of their beat  we can be off now percy ralph said rising our news is bad for it will be by no means so easy to cut the line as we had expected these weasels wont be very easily caught asleep  no indeed percy said the idea of cutting the line sounded so easy when we were at a distance but it is quite a different matter now we are here  upon their return they foundwith some difficultythe place where they had hidden their uniforms again changed clothes and thencarrying those they had just taken off made up into bundlesthey reentered the village and went straight to headquarters  major tempe was at dinner with the other officers and received them with great pleasure for he had been anxious all day lest any misfortune might befall them finding that they had had nothing to eat since early in the morning he at once invited them to sit down to dinner for military discipline is far less strict in these matters in france than it is in england and among the corps of franc tireurs especiallyas among the english volunteers where the private is in many cases equal to or superior to his officer in social standingthe difference of rank is very much put aside except on duty  and you say that they have a sentinel at every fifty or sixty yards along the line major tempe said when ralph had given an account of their days investigation that appears to me to be fatal to our plans  why so lieutenant de maupaswho commanded the first companyasked it seems to me that nothing could be easier suppose we fell upon any given point the sentries near it would be at once killed or made prisoners and even allowingas young barclay saysthat there are troops in all the villages it would be a good half hour before a force sufficient to disturb us could arrive  that is true enough major tempe answered but what could we do in half an hour we might pull up two hundred yards of rail what real advantage would be gained by that the line of sentries along the rail would by firing their rifles pass the news ten miles in half as many minutes and the trains would be stopped long before they arrived at the break each train carries i know workmen and materials for repairing the line and as it would be impossible for us to carry away the rails after pulling them up they would be replaced in as short a time as it took us to tear them up and the consequence would be that the traffic would only be suspended for an hour or two at most for a break to be of any real utility whatever it must last for days if not for weeks  the great coup of course would be the destruction of the rock tunnel of saverne which was the special object of our presence here failing that we must try a bridge the tunnel however is the great affair once destroyed there would be no repairing it for many weeks my proposition is therefore that we turn our attention at once to that point  there was a general murmur of assent  the best course would be for hardins company to march direct to the other end of the tunnel seize it and prevent interference from that end while the others then seize the saverne end and hold it while preparations are made for blowing it up then when the match is lighted fall backif possiblebefore the arrival of heavy bodies of the enemy  nothing could be better lieutenant de maupas exclaimed and the other officers agreed with him  what day do you propose for the movement  the day after tomorrow at daybreak major tempe said that will give us plenty of time to send orders to the other two companies and the sooner it is done the better  the conference was about to break up when the surgeonwho had listened in silencesaid  the general plan is simple enough but tell me how do you propose to set about blowing the tunnel up you may be able to hold it for half an hour at most how do you think of proceeding  major tempe and his officers looked at each other they had not as yet thought the matter over but the instant it was put plainly before them they saw the difficulty  oh lieutenant de maupas said confidently we shall of course put the nitroglycerine somewhere in the middle of the tunnel and blow the whole affair up  lieutenant de maupas had been a sailor and his quickness of decision and goahead straightforward way of doing everything made him at once a favorite and an amusement to the men who had nicknamed him grande vitesse or as we should say in english the express  i am afraid the matter is rather more difficult than you imagine de maupas major tempe said with a smile this is in ribouvilles way as he was in the engineers he will know all about it  the officer named however did not reply for some little time but sat with his head on his hand in deep thought  i feel ashamed to own it he said at last but i really do not know how one could set about the matter so as to have a chance of really destroying the tunnel after so short a time for preparation were the tunnel an ordinary bricklined tunnel the proposition of de maupasslightly modifiedwould no doubt have the effect of bringing down the brick lining and the earth behind would fall in of itself but with a tunnel cut in the solid rock it would be difficult the natural strength of the tunnel would be so great that the force of the explosion would simply be lost through the ends it might or might not bring down a few masses of rock but one could not rely upon it doing even that  if i had time the matter would be easy enough i should make a deep chamber in the solid rock at the side of the tunnel insert my charge and then tamp or fasten it in with masonry this would ensure its destruction at the point of explosion but i have no hope of any great damage being done by merely putting two barrels of nitroglycerine down upon the line and then firing them i can assure you the point mooted by the doctor is more serious and as far as i see at present i could do nothing in half an hour which would in any way ensure the destruction of the tunnel to make such a chamber as i speak of to hold two barrels of nitroglycerine would be the work of four or five days working night and dayeven with the aid of powderand of course it would be out of the question to hope for as many hours  there was a pause of consternation as lieutenant ribouville spoke here was the end of the grand scheme from which they had expected so much at this time the germans had no other line of rail at their command and the destruction of the tunnel would have been a disaster equal to that of the loss of a pitched battle  there would be no chance would there of our hiding in the woods under which the tunnel runs so as to bore down to it and blow it in from above major tempe asked  none whatever the depth to be bored would be considerable the stone is hard and it could not be pierced without the use of powder which would betray our presence and even could we use it and were the men all good miners it would be a work of months at the very least  there was a silence for some minutes and then the commandant said  we cannot give it up without a trial think it over ribouville for the next three or four days you may be able to pitch upon some plan if you cannot do so we must at least try the experiment of exploding our nitroglycerine in the middle of the tunnelor at any rate as far in as we can carry itand make our retreat in the half hour which is all the time we can calculate upon holding the entrance    chapter 7 a baffled project   before leaving the headquarters of the commandant the young barclays asked if he wished that they should continue to keep silence upon the subject of their expedition the commandant replied that he did not see that it could do any harm provided that they impressed upon their comrades the necessity of maintaining an absolute silence upon the subject when any of the people of the neighborhood were present although the villagers might appear to understand no language but german they might yet know enough french to glean what was said and if traitorously inclined to warn the germans and thus enormously increase the danger when the barclays should again go down to the town  their cousins had already heard of their return for the boys upon sitting down to dinner at the commandants had requested leave to send a line to their cousins who would be anxiously expecting them  hallo you barclay where have you been to all day was the general exclamation as they entered  on duty ralph said  on dutyyes but what duty the duburgs have been mysterious and would say nothing the sergeant here knew nothing about it except that our lieutenant told him that you had leave and irish tim has been hanging about all day as restless as a cow that has lost its calf  we have been down to saverne ralph said  there was a general exclamation of astonishment those of the men who had already lain down upon their straw for the night sat up again and all crowded round to hear ralphs story which he at once told at length and which when finished gave rise hereas it had done at the officers tableto an animated discussion several of the men shook hands warmly with the barclays congratulating them on their offer to undertake this dangerous service and upon the valuablethough unfavorableinformation which they had obtained  from this time forward the men ceased to attempt to pass jokes at the expense of any of the boys when the corps was first raised many of the young men had been inclined to protest against boys being accepted when the list could have been readily filled with men but by this time the boys had proved that they were quite as capable of supporting fatigue as were the men they had behaved equally well in action and now the enterprise of the barclays testified to the fact that in a dangerous expedition requiring coolness presence of mind and nerve they were equally to be relied upon henceforward there was no distinction or difference between the various members of the corps  another four days passed andas the exofficer of engineers could suggest no certain plan for the destruction of the tunnel which could be carried out in the time which a surprise of the sentries at its mouth would give themmajor tempe resolved upon delaying no longer but on sending four men into the tunnel under lieutenant ribouville with instructions to go as far as they could in a quarter of an hour to set down the barrels against the rock to light a fuse cut to burn a quarter of an hour and then to return at full speed to the mouth of the tunnel  one company was to seize the other end to tear up seven eight or ten rails and to retire at once into the woods as the delay in getting the rails into their places again would prevent any train entering from that end in time for its occupants to see and extinguish the burning fuse  the other companywhich was absentwas to join the headquarters the evening before the attempt and it was hoped that the three companies would be able to keep the enemy at bay for half an hour so as to give time to the party with the nitroglycerine to take it to the required position and rejoin their comrades immediately upon their doing so the retreat was to commence as the enemy could not possibly penetrate the tunnel and extinguish the fuse before the explosion took place  the attempt was not to be made till the following evening in order that the barclays might go down and see that all was as before at saverne and along the line the next day accordingly the boys again put on their disguises and started as before taking the precaution to change in the wood so as not to be seen by any of the villagers upon reaching the spot from which a view of the tunnel was obtainable they stopped with a simultaneous exclamation of dismay not only were two sentries stationed near the entrance but some fifteen or twenty german soldiers were sitting or standing by a small building at a short distance which had evidently been turned into a guard house  this looks very much against us ralph one would think that they had got information of our being near  it looks bad indeed percy let us go on into the town we shall perhaps learn something about it there  a sharp walk soon brought them to saverne a sentry was on duty at the entrance to the town and several of his comrades stood near the sentry looked as if about to stop them but seeing when they came up that they were only boys he let them pass without question  worse and worse percy something is up sure enough  this became more evident at every step they took for the little town was absolutely crowded with german soldiers  unless they are merely halting here upon their march through it is all up with our plan percy there must be over two thousand men here at the very least  upon questioning a lad of the town of about their own age they found that the fresh troops had arrived upon the preceding day the infantrytwo thousand strongcoming in by train late in the evening before and three hundred cavalry marched in only half an hour before the boys arrival they were all quartered upon the inhabitants and there appeared to be no sign of their early departure  for some time the boys walked about without obtaining any information although they entered a dozen cabarets and drank considerable quantities of beer at last before one of the principal cafes they saw ten or twelve german officers sitting talking none of the inhabitants were sitting at the cafe and the boys dared not go in to ask for anything there as it would not have been in accordance with their appearance  how are we to get within hearing percy  look here ralph i will limp along as if i had something in my shoe which hurts me then i will sit down on a doorstep close to them and take off my boot you can sit down too and take some of the bread and cheese which we put in our pockets because we could not eat it at the last place we went in i will keep my boot off to ease my foot and we can eat our bread and cheese as slowly as we like  that will do capitally percy  in another couple of minutes the two lads were sitting as agreed upon the step of a door close to the cafe they could not hear all that was said but could catch the sense as the german officersas is their customspoke in a very loud voice they belonged to the infantry and were it appeared in ignorance of the reason of their sudden move to saverne  presently a captain of the cavalry came along the street  ah von rausen a major in the infantry exclaimed are you here i have not seen you since the day you marched from coblentz  no indeed major the other said salutingas a prussian officer always does to his superior in rankthe other infantry officers all rising and saluting in turn we have just come in from hagenau  are you in a hurry asked the major if not sit down and let us talk  the cavalry officer accepted the invitation and for a few minutes their talk ran upon mutual friends then the major said  by the way do you know what we are here for we were bustled off at a moments notice no one knows why except of course the colonel and he has not thought necessary to tell us and naturally we have not asked him  do you not know captain von rausen said it is no secretat least no secret from us but a secret from the people here i will speak in french no doubt there are plenty of spies about  there is no one in hearing the major said except those two stupidlooking lads munching bread and cheese  the more likely to be spies von rausen said fellows who look like fools are just the people chosen  well speak in english then von rausen the major said we both understand it and we should be safe then if all saverne were listening  yes that will be safe  well then the general received information yesterday that that corps of franc tireurs who cut up our cavalry near blamont the other day are hid up in some village in the woods four or five miles from here no doubt with the intention of making an attempt to blow up the tunnel the idea is a daring one and if the plan had succeeded it would have done us incalculable harm as it is we are safe and tomorrow night we shall i believe make an expedition and sweep the woods clear of these troublesome gentry  these franc tireurs will be mischievous if we do not give them a sharp lesson the generals proclamation gave notice that every one of them taken would be shot and our colonel is just the man to carry out the order  this is indeed important the major said but how did we get the information is it certain  quite certain a scoundrel of a schoolmaster at grunsdorfa village somewhere up in the woodsturned traitor and sent a letter to the general bargaining that he should be taken on as a spy at some fabulous salary and offering to begin by leading the troops to the village where these franc tireurs are hidden  an infamous scoundrel the major said warmly of course one cannot refuse to deal with traitors when the information is of importance but one longs to put a pistol bullet into them badly as the french have come out in many particulars since the war began there is not one which gives me such a mean idea of them as the number of offers which have been sent in to supply information and betray their countrymen  put on your boots percy ralph said in a low voice it is time for us to be off dont hurry and above all if they should take it into their heads to address us suddenly in french or english dont start or seem to notice  the major was however so absorbed in the information he had receivedand so confident that the english in which it had been told would be unintelligible to anyone who might overhear itthat he paid no attention to the boys whoone of them limping badlywent slowly down the street stopping occasionally to look in at the shop windows it was not until they were fairly outside the town and out of sight of the german sentries that they either spoke or quickened their pace  the franc tireurs of dijon may thank their lucky stars that they sent down spies to saverne today percy and especially that we of all the members of the corps were selected if we had not been where we were just at that moment and if we had not understood english it would have been all up with the corps and no mistake  what an infamous scoundrel as the major said that schoolmaster must be ralph what do you think the commandant will do  he has nothing to do but to retreat as quickly as we can go percy but if it costs him half the corps i hope he will hang that schoolmaster before he goes  i hope so too percy said and scarcely another word was spoken until they reached the village  it was still early scarcely two oclock and major tempe was drilling the whole corpsthe two detached companies having arrived that morningwhen the boys having again put on uniform approached him  major tempe nodded to them as they came up  you are back early he said you are excused from drill i will see you at my quarters when it is over  if you please major ralph said respectfully you had better dismiss the men at once we have news of the highest importance to tell you  the major looked surprised but seeing by the boys faces that the news was very serious he at once dismissed the men telling them to keep near as they might be wanted then calling his officers he proceeded at once with the barclays towards his quarters  excuse me major ralph said but instead of going to your quarters would you move to some open space where we can speak without a possibility of being overheard by anyone  still more surprised major tempe led the way to some felled trees at the edge of the forest a short distance from the village here he sat down and motioned to the others to do the same ralph then told his story interrupted many times by exclamations of rage upon the part of his auditors and giving full credit to percy for his idea of the plan by which unnoticed they had managed to get within hearing of the german officers the fury of the french officers knew no bounds they gesticulated they stamped up and down they swore terribly they were ready to cry from sheer rage  major tempe alone uttered no remark during the whole narration when it was concluded he sat silent for a minute or two with his lips pressed together and a look of deep indignation on his face then he rose and said in a solemn tone  as sure as the sun shines and as sure as my name is edward tempe so sure shall that schoolmaster of grunsdorf be hung before tomorrow morning  lieutenant ribouville order the assembly to be sounded and form the men here in hollow square  messieurs barclay you will fall in with your company  a little surprisedand hurt that the commandant had said no word of commendation to them for the service they had performedthe boys hurried off to their quarters to get their rifles  sure master ralph and what is the matter at all tim doyle said as they entered sure the major honest man must have gone off his head entirely scarcely had we finished our male and began to smoke the first pipe in aise and comfort when the bugle blows for parade  confound the bugle says i and i shoved me pipe aside and put on my belt and fell in  hardly had we begun the maneuvers when your honors arrived and said a word private to the major the words werent out of your mouth before he dismisses us from drill  botheration says i is there no pace for the wicked  back i comes again and takes off me belt and piles me firelock and before i had got three draws at me pipe and was just beginning to enjoy the creetur when crack and there goes the assimbly again sure and the major honest man has lost his head entirely and its a pity for he is an illegant man and a good officer says i  come along tim ralph said laughing else youll be late for parade you will hear all about it in time i have no doubt  in five minutes the men were all assembled in a hollow square two deep facing the officers in the center the men saw at once by the faces of major tempe and the officers that something very serious had happened and they had no sooner taken their places than there was a deep hush of expectancy for it was evident that the commandant was about to address them  my men he said after a pause of a minute or two a great calamity has happened and a still greater one would have happened had we not providentially received warning in time it had been resolvedas you would have heard this evening had all gone wellthat tonight we should attack the german sentries and blow up the rock tunnel of saverne the affair would have been hot but it would have been a vital service to france and the franc tireurs of dijon would have merited and obtained the thanks of all france it was for the purpose of the attack that the two companies detached from us were recalled  all promised well for success two of your number had been down into saverne in disguise and had brought us full information respecting the force and disposition of the enemy all was prepared the chance of success favorable and the force the enemy could have brought against us was no larger than our own we should have saved france and immortalized ourselves  at the present moment there are two thousand five hundred men in saverne tomorrow night this village is to be attacked and every franc tireur found here put to the sword  a cry of surprise and rage broke from the men  and how think you has the change been wrought by treachery  those cries of rage were renewed  by treachery a frenchman has been found base and vile enough to sell us to prussia all hope of success is over and we have only to retreat  who is he who is he burst from the infuriated men death to the traitor death to the traitor  yes men death to the traitor the major said solemnly it is the schoolmaster of grunsdorf who has sold you to the prussians who wrote that letter to their general telling him of your intentions which has caused these great reinforcements to be sent and who has offered to guide a force to surround us tomorrow night  another low cry of horror and indignation broke from the men  is it your opinion that this man has deserved death  yes was the unanimous answer  then he dies major tempe said solemnly you were to have been his victims you are his judges  grunsdorf is three miles from here in the woods not far from saverne a party will be told off presently who will be charged with the execution of this sentence  i have now another duty the corps has been saved from destruction youall of ushave been preserved from death by the intelligence and courage of two of your number  ralph and percy barclay stand forward  the two boys stepped two paces forward into the hollow square  selected by me continued major tempe for the duty from their perfect acquaintance with german they upon their first visit to saverne obtained all the information required upon their second visit this morningfinding the enemy had been immensely reinforcedthey perceived the extreme importance of discovering the reason for the arrival of the reinforcements and their intention with a coolness and tact which does them the greatest credit they contrived to arrive and to remain within hearing of a number of officers and then learned the whole particulars of the treachery of this man and of the intention of our enemies so important was the secret judged that the germans were afraid of telling it in german or in french lest they might be overheard to prevent the possibility of this they conversed in english and the consequence is that we are saved almost by a miracle  ralph and percy barclay your names will be inserted in the order of the day being the first of the corps to whom that honor has been given and i hereby offer you in the name of myself my officers and the whole corps my hearty thanks for your courage coolness and devotion  the parade is dismissed the men will assemble at five oclock in full marching order with all necessaries and accouterments  as major tempe ceased speaking the men broke up from the order in which they had been standing and crowded round the young barclays shaking them by the hand patting them on the shoulder and congratulating them heartily upon the service that they had rendered and upon the terms in which their commandant had thus publicly acknowledged it  at five oclock the corps assembled again in heavy marching order and after inspection the second third and fourth companies marched off with their officers who alone knew their destination at their head major tempe remained on the ground with the first company after waiting for a few minutes they were marched off in the direction which the others had taken butafter getting out of sight of the village and fairly entering the forestthey turned sharp off and took the direction of saverne    chapter 8 the traitor   after the company had marched for half an hour a halt was called and their commandant said  i daresay you have all guessed the object which we have in view we are going to carry out the sentence pronounced by the whole corps we are going to have that schoolmasterthat traitorwho has sold our lives to the prussians and whowhich is of infinitely greater importancehas done immense injury to france by betraying our intention of blowing up the tunnel that traitor i intend to have tonight and if i have him i will hang him as sure as fate  this lane which we are following leads to grunsdorf which according to the information i collected before leaving cannot be above a mile distant now we must be cautious it is quite possible that a detachment of the enemy may have been sent up to the village and in that case we might catch a tartar even if there are no germans there we must be cautious or the bird will escape we neither know him nor the house he lives in andas he would naturally guess that his treachery had been discovered and that we had come for himhe would slip out into the forest the instant he saw the first bayonet approaching it is essential therefore that we should obtain accurate information of the state of affairs and of the position of this traitors house  in another half hour it will be dusk the barclays have again volunteered to go in and find out what we require they will go on at once and in an hour we will follow and remain concealed just outside the village until they return  sergeant you will go forward with them and agree upon the place where we shall remain hid until they join us  now my lads you have already received your instructions change your things and go forward at once  the distance was farther than they had expected and it was nearly dark before the boys entered grunsdorf there was no one moving in the quiet village for a fine rain was falling as the boys walked slowly along  there is no one to ask percy we must go into the public house as arranged and ask where the priests house is it would not do for two strangers to ask for the schoolmaster the priest will tell us where he lives  so saying they entered the little cabaret walked down a long passage leading from the door and paused for a moment at the thresholdfor in the room were some eight or ten prussian soldiers  it is too late to retreat percy come in boldly  lifting their caps they walked up to an unoccupied table and called for some bread cheese and beer the landlord brought the refreshments and the boys had scarcely begun to eat when a prussian sergeantwho had exchanged a word with the landlord evidently in reference to themstrode up to them and laying his hand upon ralphs shoulder said  who are you young fellows the landlord says you do not belong to the village  we belong to a party of woodcutters from colmar ralph said quietly  illustration among the german soldiers  oh indeed the sergeant said in an incredulous voice and where are your party  out in the forest at the place where we have begun to fell trees ralph said  but people do not come to cut wood without horses or carts to take it away the sergeant persisted  they are up in the forest with our father ralph said  have you heard anything about this party the sergeant asked the landlord  the man hesitated a moment he evidently suspected also that the boys might belong to the franc tireurs and was anxious to say nothing which could harm them  no he said after a pause i cant say that i have heard of them but i know some of the forest was sold not long ago and they might have come from colmar without coming this way  we only arrived this morning percy said quietly so that you could hardly have heard of us unless some of the people of your place happened to pass when we were at work and we have not seen anyone all day  at any rate the sergeant said i shall see if your story be true and you will at once take us to the place  corporal get ten men in readiness  certainly ralph said if you will allow us to finish our supper we will show you the way at once  the sergeant nodded and resumed his seat  look here percy ralph said quietly we are in a nasty fix this time there is only one thing to be done that i can see if we both go they will shoot us to a certainty for although one might make a bolt in the wood it is certain we could not both get away  only one thing is to be done i will say your foot is bad and ask for you to stay here directly we have gone you slip out and goas hard as you canto the place where our men are hid i will bring them in that direction we shall have passed the place before you can reach itat least unless you can get out at onceand pass on in the darkness take off your shoes so as to run lightly as we pass fire a volley right into us and i will make a dart into the wood in the confusion  but you might be shot by our men ralph they could not possibly distinguish you in the dark no i will go with the men and you make your way to tempe  no no percy i wont have that  very well percy said doggedly then we will go together  there was a silence for a minute or two and then ralph said  look here percy this is madness however as you wont do as i tell you we will draw lots i will put a piece of crumb in one of my hands you shall guess which it is in if you guess right i will go with the germans if you guess wrong you shall go  very well percy said i agree to that  ralph then broke off a small piece of bread and put it in one of his handshaving already before he made the proposition broken off a similar piece unobserved by percy he then put both hands under the table and then lifted them again all the time trying to appear not to be engaged upon anything out of the way as he knew that some of the germans were watching them  left percy said  ralph replied by opening the left hand and dropping the piece of bread on the table at the same time putting his right hand back into his pocket as if to get out his handkerchiefand dropping as he did so the piece of bread it contained into the place  there percy fortune has decided it  goodbye god bless you i daresay i shall get out of it but if not give my love to them all at home  then he finished his beer and rose without giving percy time to reply even could he have done so but the lad was so much choked with the effort to keep from crying that he could not have spoken ralph turned to the sergeant andstretching his arms with the natural air of a tired boy objecting to be disturbedsaid  now sir i am ready to start i suppose there is no occasion for us both to go for my brother has hurt his foot we shouldnt have come in tonight but it is his first time out with the woodmen and he is not accustomed to sleeping out in the wet  yes one is enough he can stay the sergeant said  you had better ask the landlord to show you a corner where you can sleep on the straw karl ralph said it is no use waiting for me i shall be back in an hour  with a nod to percy ralph now walked steadily to the door the sergeant with the men told off for the duty accompanied him when they reached the street it was raining heavily  i wonder ralph said whether the landlord would lend me a sack to put on my shoulders  is this place far off youngster the sergeant asked peering out into the darkness  ralphs heart gave a jump for he detected in the tone a certain hesitation as to taking the men out in such a night upon such slight suspicion he was however too shrewd to show any desire to dissuade the sergeant from it so he replied  no it is no distance to speak of not a mile at most we should be there and back in half an hour if it was light but there is only a path among the woods and it is dark  i think we had better have some lanterns for i do not think i could find my way without them tonight at any rate it would take us much longer  there boy that will do the sergeant said laying his hand on his shoulder i am satisfied now with the truth of your story i thought for a bit you had something to do with the franc tireurs who are about here but i see i was mistaken  turn in again lads it is no use taking you out on a useless search such a night as this among these forests  ralph laughed aloud as they turned to go down the passage again to the corner  wont father laugh he said when he hears that you thought i was a franc tireur we havent seen any about colmar i dont think you need be afraid of them if they aint bigger or older than i am  by this time they had entered the room again and ralph saw that percy was already talking to the landlordwith whom indeed he was on the point of leaving the room he turned round upon hearing the party come in again and gave a slight start of pleasure  i am soon back karl and am glad that it is so for frankly i too am tired and it is not a night for a dog to be out i will go in with you  stay landlord the sergeant said give the boys another glass each before they go off  thank you ralph said a glass of good beer never comes amiss  the boys stopped while the landlord filled their glasses  now said the sergeant raising his arm heres a health to king william  heres a health to king william ralph repeated i am sure i wish him no harm  and now with your permission i will be off  the landlord led them to an outhouse in which were some trusses of straw just as he was about to leave them ralph said suddenly  ah i had nearly forgotten about the priest you have a priest here have you not  of course the landlord said do you take us for heathens  not at all ralph said apologetically but father told me to call and pay him for some masses my eldest sister was very ill when we came away and father worries about her  where does the priest live  the last house on the left as you go out from the farther end of the village but anyone will show you it in the morning  you dont want the light any longer  for the boys had while speaking been taking off their boots and making a show of preparing to lie down on the straw  no thank you good night  oh i forgotwhat do you charge a cask for your best beer father wanted to know and if the price suits will send down a cart to fetch it  the landlord named the price and then said good night and left them  when he returned to the room where he had left the german soldiers the sergeant asked him a question or two concerning the boys and the landlord repeated the substance of the conversation which he had just had this allayed the last suspicions which had remained in the sergeants mind and he congratulated himself greatly that he had not taken his men out in such a night upon a mere groundless suspicion  if the landlord repeats that yarn to the germans it will allay all suspicion ralph said when they were left alone otherwise the sergeant might have taken it into his head to come to have a look at us and although it would not very much matter that he should discover that the birds had flown still it would have put him on his guard and he might have doubled the sentries and made it much more difficult for us  we have had a very narrow squeak for it this time percy old boy  very ralph i would rather go through twenty battles again than feel as i felt when i saw you start and thought that i should never see you again alive  well we have no time to lose now percy have you got your boots on again if so let us start at once the major and men must be very anxious long before this it must be full an hour since we came  it has been the longest hour i ever passed ralph there now i am ready if you are  we must go out very quietly percy i have no doubt that they have got sentries posted all about they know that we are in the neighborhood i wish i knew how many there are of them  i found out from the landlord that all the fifteen men we saw here were billeted upon him percy said he told me at first when i asked him that he could do nothing for me in the way of a bed because there were three or four in every room i said that a stable and a little straw would do for us very well and then he thought of this outhouse  at the same rate there must be at least a hundred men in the village  they now opened the door of the outhouse went quietly out and made their way through a garden at the back of the house towards the wood  stand still a few minutes percy ralph said in a whisper and let us see if we can find out where the sentries are placed i expect that they form a cordon round the village  lie down by this wall we can see them there and they cannot see us  it was well that they did so for in another minute they heard a tread quite close to them and a prussian soldier passed within a yard of where they were lying they could dimly see that his hood was over his head and hear that he was humming to himself a scrap of some german air they lay there until he had again passed the spot and thenhaving found out the direction of his beatthey crawled noiselessly away and in five minutes had reached the edge of the forest  they did not enter it as it would have been impossiblein the dense darknessto have made their way without running against trees and snapping off boughs which would have given the alarm they therefore skirted the edgeknowing that with the trees behind them they would be invisible at the distance of a yard or twoand in ten minutes reached the place where their company was awaiting them as they approached the spot they gave a short low whistle which was the agreed sign among the band for knowing each other on night expeditions it was answered at once and in another minute they were among their friends  what has happened major tempe asked we were getting very anxious about you i sent favarts to reconnoiter ten minutes ago and he has just returned saying that he can hear someone pacing backwards and forwards on the road and that he believes it to be a sentry  he was quite right ralph said the village is full of germans there mustas far as we can seebe seventy or eighty of them at the very lowest and there are probably a hundred we have been prisoners or something very like it and have had a monstrously close shave of it  but i will tell you all that when we have time do you still think of carrying out your plans  certainly major tempe said that schoolmaster i am determined to have even if we fight our way in and shoot him in bed have you found out where he lives  no sir but we have found out where the priest lives it is this end house the end of the village on the lefthand side as you come out  are the sentries very close together  they are pretty close but not too close to prevent our crawling between them unobserved on such a night as this  major tempe hesitated for a while  it would be too hazardous he said we know nothing of the ground over which we should have to crawl and it would be hardly possible for thirty menwith our accouterments and firearmsto crawl along without snapping sticks or striking rifles against a stone and giving the alarm  no the sentry at the entrance of the village must be silenced  so saying the commandant turned to the men who were standing round and explained briefly the purport of the whispered conversation which he had had with ralph he then chose two active young men and told them to take off their cloaks belts and accouterments of all kinds and to leave them with their rifles with the men who were to remain at the spot at which they then wereto cover their retreat if necessary they were to take nothing with them but their sword bayonetswhich were not to be used except in case of necessityand a coil of light rope definite instructions were given them as to the manner in which their attack was to be made  they then took off their boots and set off noiselessly upon their enterprise they went on rapidly until they were within plain hearing of the footsteps of the sentinel and then very cautiously and crouching almost to the ground so as not to bring their bodies on a level with his eye they crept up foot by foot to the end of his beat here they waited a short time while he passed and repassed them unthinking of the deadly foe who had they stretched out their hands could have touched his cloak as he went past them  at last the second time he passed them on his way towards the village they rose together behind him in an instant one had garroted himwith a choking grip that almost strangled him and prevented him uttering the slightest soundwhile the other grasped his rifle by the lock so as to prevent the possibility of its being fired in another instant the rifle was torn from the grasp of the almost stupefied man cords were passed tightly round his arms and legs a handkerchief was thrust into his mouth and fastened there by a cord going across the mouth and tied behind the head and before the bewildered man fairly knew what had happened he was lying bound and gagged by the roadside  one of the franc tireurs now ran back to tell the commandant that the men could advance while the otherselected specially because he understood a little germanput on the spiked helmet of the captured sentry and began to walk up and down in readiness to repeat the cry of all well should it be passed round  the whole company were now moved up ten men were left at the point where the sentry was posted to cover a retreat or to assist the sentry in case of any party coming out to relieve guard and so discovering the change which had taken place the others led by the commandant proceeded forward until opposite the priests house in which lights were still burning for it was not as yet ten oclock  major tempe accompanied only by two menand by ralph barclay to interpret if necessarynow went cautiously up to the house the light was in a room on the ground floor to this major tempe advanced and looking in saw the priest sitting reading alone he tapped very gently at the window and the priest looking up gave a start upon seeing an armed man looking in at the window  major tempe put his finger to his lips to enforce the necessity for silence and made signs to him to open the window after a moments hesitation the priest rose from his seat came to the window and unfastened it taking great precautions against noise  are you french he asked in a whisper  yes a commandant of franc tireurs  hush then for your life the priest said earnestly the village is full of prussians the officer with a soldier as his servant is upstairs he arrived in a state of fever and is tonight quite ill the soldier is up with him i believe the sergeant who is at the inn is in command for tonight a soldier was dispatched this evening to ask for another officer to be sent out  what can i do for you  i only want you to tell me in which house the schoolmaster lives he is a traitor and has betrayed us to the prussians it is owing to him that they are here  he has a bad name in the village the priest said and we had applied to have him removed he lives in the third house from here on the same side of the road  has he any germans quartered upon him  twenty or thirty men the priest said the schoolroom is full of them  do you know which is his room major tempe asked it would be a great thing if we could get at him without alarming the enemy i have thirty men here but i do not want to have a fight in the village if i can help it  i know his house the priest said the schoolroom is at the side of the house and his sitting room and kitchen on the ground floor of the house itself there are three bedrooms over his room is in front of the house to the right as you face it  thank you major tempe said have you a ladder  there is one lying on the ground by the wall to the left i hope you do not intend to shed blood  no major tempe said grimly i think that i can promise that there will be no blood shedthat is to say unless we are attacked by the prussians  good night and thank you i need not say thatfor your own sakeyou will not mention in the morning having seen us  the commandant now rejoined his party and they advanced to the house indicated he then chose ten men to accompany him ordering the rest to remain at a distance of twenty yards with their rifles cocked and in readiness for instant action the ladder was then brought forward by the men selected and placed against the window  major tempe had before starting provided himselffrom the carpenter of the villagewith an auger a small and fine saw a bottle of oil and a thin strip of straight iron he now mounted the ladder and after carefully examining the windowwhich was of the make which we call in england latticedhe inserted the strip of iron and tried to force back the fastening this he failed in doing being afraid to use much force lest the fastening should give suddenly with a crash he had however ascertained the exact position of the fastening  having before mounting carefully oiled the auger and saw he now applied the former and made a hole through the framework at the junction of the two sides of the window just above the fastening introducing the saw into this hole he noiselessly cut entirely round the fastening with a semicircular sweep to the junction of the window below it and as he did so the window swung partially open by its own weight he now descended the ladder again took off his boots and ordered two of the men to do the same and to put aside all arms and accouterments that could strike against anything and make a noise  then taking a coil of strong rope in his hand and followed by the two men he again mounted the ladder the instructions to the men were that one was to enter at once with him the other to remain where he was until he received the signal the major entered the room noiselessly and dropped at once on to his hands and knees and was a minute after joined by his follower he now crawled forwardgroping his way with the greatest caution so as to make no noiseuntil he found the bed then rising to his feet he threw himself upon the sleeping man and in a moment had him tightly by the throat with one hand while the other was placed firmly on his mouth  paralyzed by the suddenness of the attack and with his arms tightly kept down by the bedclothes and the weight of his assailant the schoolmaster was unable to struggle  now light the light major tempe said quietly  his follower at once struck one of the noiseless german matcheswhich are used almost exclusively in these parts of franceand lighted a lamp which was standing upon the table he then came up to the bed and assisted the major to securely gag and bind the prisonerwhose looks when he saw into whose hands he had fallen betokened the wildest terror  search his pockets major tempe said we may find something of importance  in the breast pocket of his coat was a pocket book and in it among the papers was a letter from the colonel commanding at savernewhich had evidently been brought to him by the officer of the detachment that morningtelling him to come down to saverne on the following evening to guide the troops to the village in which the franc tireurs were stationed the letter also enclosed ten hundredthaler notes a thaler is about equal to two shillings  they are part of our blood money the major said grimly bring them away they are the fair spoil of war  tell barre to come in  the man on the ladder now joined them and together they quietly lifted the schoolmaster and carried him to the window they then fastened a rope round the prisoners body lifted him out on to the ladder and lowered him gradually down to the men below  they now blew out the light and descended the ladder the two men who had waited at its foot raised the prisoner on their shoulders and carried him off to their comrades while the commandant and the other two men hastily put on their boots seized their arms and accouterments and in two minutes the whole party were marching quietly down the village no incident whatever marked their retreat the sentry had been undisturbed during their absence and in a few minutes the whole party were out of the village without the slightest alarm having been raised  they followed the road by which they had come for about a mile and then turned off a side path in the forest to the left they followed this for a short distance only into the forest and then when they arrived at a small open space a halt was ordered the prisoner was dropped unceremoniously to the ground by the two franc tireurs who carried him on their shoulders and a fire was speedily lighted  major tempe then ordered the prisoner to be unbound and ungagged and with a guard upon either side of him to be placed in front of the companydrawn up in a semicircle by the fire the prisoner was a man of about fiftyfive with a sallow cunning face he could scarcely stand and indeed would have sunk on his knees in his abject terror had not the guards by his side held him by the arms  men major tempe said undoubted as the guilt of the prisoner appeared to be we had got no absolute proof and a mistake might have been possible as to the name of the village whose schoolmaster had betrayed us this letter found in his coat pocket and this german moneythe price of our bloodleave no further doubt possible  and here the major read the prussian colonels letter  are you still of opinion that he merits death  yes yes the men exclaimed unanimously  prisoner major tempe said you have heard your sentence you are a convicted traitorconvicted of having betrayed your country convicted of having sold the blood of your countrymen i give you five minutes to ask that pardon of god which you cannot obtain from man  the miserable wretch gave a cry of terror and fell on his knees and would have crawled towards his judge to beg for mercy had not his guard restrained him for the next five minutes the forest rang with alternate cries entreaties threats and cursesso horrible that the four boys and several of the younger men put their hands to their ears and walked away so as not to see or hear the terrible punishment at the end of that time there was a brief struggle and then a deep silence and the body of the traitor swung from a branch of one of the trees with a paper pinned on his breast  so perish all traitors  louis duburg major tempe said take this paper with those who seek a traitor will find him here and fasten it to a tree so that it may be seen at the point where this path turned from the road  louis took it and ran off in a quarter of an hour when he returned he found the company drawn up in readiness to march he fell in at once and the troop moved off leaving behind them the smoldering fire and the white figure swinging near it    chapter 9 a desperate fight   daylight was just breaking when major tempe marched with his men into marmontier at which place the other three companies had arrived the night previously it was a large villagethe chief place of its cantonand the corps were most hospitably received by the inhabitants had they arrived the evening before it would have been impossible to provide them all with beds and they would have been obliged like the majority of their comrades to sleep on straw in the schoolroom the inhabitants however were up and about very shortly after the arrival of major tempes command and his men were soon provided for in the beds which they had left  beds were now a luxury indeed as the corps had not slept in them since they had been quartered at baccarat two nights before their first encounter with the prussians near blamont it was with great unwillingness then that they turned out when the bugle sounded at two oclock in the afternoon they partook of a hearty mealprovided by the people upon whom they were quarteredand an hour later the whole corps marched out towards wasselonne a small town situated on the breuche a little river which winding round by molsheim falls into the rhine at strasburg a branch line of railroad terminates at this place  when they arrived within three miles of it they turned off to the rightfor wasselonne had frequently been visited by the prussiansand slept at the little village of casswiller at the edge of the forest of oedenwald another days short but weary marching over the mountains brought them to the village of still lying high upon the western slope of the vosges above mutzig  from this point they had a splendid view over the valley of the rhine from their feet at mutzig the railway ran through molsheim straight across the country to strasburg the beautiful spire of whose cathedral rose above the flats at a distance of about fifteen miles the day happened to be a quiet one and the deep booming of the guns of the besiegers could be distinctly heard the inhabitants reported that the german troops patrolled the whole valley pushing sometimes down to the walls of schlestadt levying contributions and carrying off cattle  the village was very poor and was able to furnish little accommodation in the way of quarters still less in that of food six of the villagers were therefore sent through the forest of oedenwald to raon with an order to fetch over two oxen and thirty sheep of those left there in charge of the head man of the village they returned in three days raon being only about fifteen miles east of still  the corps was now broken up into its four companies who were stationed in the villages on the vosges and at the edge of the forest of trieswald and barthe first company remaining at still from these villages they commanded a view over the whole plain and could with the aid of glasses distinctly see any bodies of men going south from strasburg each company was to act independently of the other uniting their forces only when ordered to do so by major tempe who took up his headquarters with the second company that having the most central position each company was to keep a sharp watch over the country to attack any body of the enemy not superior to themselves in force and to cut off if possible any small parties pillaging in the villages of the valley near the foot of the mountains  the first companyunder their lieutenant de maupasturned their special attention to mutzig which was not they learned actually occupied by the germans but which was frequently visited by parties from molsheim where a portion of the army of the besiegers was stationed the young barclays their cousins and tim doyle were quartered together in one of the largest houses in the village and from thence a fine view over the plain was attainable  they were not destined to remain long in inactivity upon the fourth day after their arrival they saw a party of some twenty horsemen approaching mutzig in five minutes every man had assembled and at once rapidly marched down the hill taking advantage of its irregularities so as to follow a track in which they would be invisible from the road making a long detour they gained the road about half a mile beyond mutzig and posting themselves among some trees by its side awaited the return of the uhlans  it was upwards of two hours before they returned they were laughing and singing and the boys felt a sensation of repugnance as they raised their rifles to their shoulders and awaited the order to fire into their unsuspecting foes they had not as yet become hardened to the horrors of war as the word was given the rifles flashed out and six of the horsemen fell the rest putting spurs to their horses galloped furiously away molsheim was so closeand the enemy might come back again largely reinforced in so short a timethat the order was given to retreat at once  reaching the hill and looking back an hour later they saw a dark mass coming from molsheim and the glasses soon made them out to be about a hundred cavalry and as many infantry it was dark as they entered mutzig andalthough it was not probable that they would ascend the hill at nightsentries were thrown out far down its sides to give the alarm and the men were ordered to hold themselves in readiness for an immediate retreat to the forest it happened that none of the boys were on duty and just as they were sitting down to dinner timwho had been out to fetch some woodcame running in  heavenly mother the brutes are setting fire to mutzig your honor  the boys ran out below a mass of red flame was rising and it was evident that several houses were in flames the sight was a grand one for the light showed the outline of the slopes of the hills and reflected on the roofs of the houses of the little town made them look as if red hot out upon the plain round molsheim were the scattered lights of innumerable camp fires while in the distance flickering flasheslike the play of summer lightningtold of the ceaseless rain of fire kept up upon the unhappy town of strasburg  what a shame percy said indignantly as if the inhabitants of mutzig could help our attacking the uhlans  look ralph there are six distinct fires  i suppose that is one for each man we killed or wounded percy you may be sure they will make them pay too thirty thousand francs i should think at least  war used to be looked upon as a chivalrous proceeding there is no romance in german warfare they call us a nation of shopkeepers they make war themselves in the spirit of a nation of petty hucksterers  what do you think of that lads lieutenant de maupas said coming up to where they were standing  it is shameful sir shameful ralph said  yes the officer said gloomily this is to make war as the vandals made it not as it is made in the nineteenth century in the crimea in italyay even in chinawe did not make war in this way in china we burnt the emperors summer palace because his soldiers had murdered our prisoners in cold blood but we did not burn a single village  no ralph said and i have read that in abyssinia we never as much as took a fowl or a bundle of grass from the natives without paying for it and we only burned the fortress of magdala after offering it in succession to the various kings of the country and destroyed it at last to prevent it becoming a stronghold of the gallasthe enemies of abyssinia  dont you think he asked after a pause we shall have fighting tomorrow sir  i think it very likely indeed the lieutenant said i have just sent off a messenger to the commandant with a full report and asked him to send over a reply whether he will come to our assistance or if we are to fall back  faith and i hope that its not falling back well be till after weve had the satisfaction of spaking to them a bit tim doyle put in barring the little affair of todaywhich isnt worth mentioningi havent had a chance of a scrimmage since i joined the corps its been jist marching and countermarching over the most onraisonable country nothing but up hill and down hill and through trees with big stones breaking our poor feet into pieces and the rain running down us fit to give us the ague  sure lieutenant ye wont be for marching us away till weve had a little divarshin  the boys all laughed at tims complaint which had been delivered in english for although he could now understand french he never attempted to speak it except to ask some necessary question percy translated it to the lieutenant  you will have fighting enough before you have done tim whether you will have it tomorrow i dont know there are a hundred infantrythey cant use their cavalryand we are only twentysix men all told fortunately we have a strong line of retreat or i should not even wait for the chance of being attacked  at any rate you think that we are safe until morning sir  yes i think so the lieutenant said  then we will go in to our dinner ralph said who knows where we may dine tomorrow  day was just beginning to break when percy barclay started up in his bed he listened for an instant and heard the crack of a rifle  up ralph up all of you he shouted we are attacked  the others were on their feet in an instant none of them had thought of undressing and as they seized their arms and equipments the whistle of lieutenant de maupas sounded loud and shrill as they issued out there was already a scene of bustle and confusion in the village the franc tireurs were rushing from the doors the villagers were also pouring out women screaming and men swearing  you had better drive off your animals up into the forest and carry off whatever you can of value and send the women and children off at once de maupas shouted to the head man of the village we will give you as much time as we can but if they are in full strength it will not be long  now lads forward dont throw away a shot take advantage of every possible cover and fall back as slowly and steadily as you can the commandant will be here with the second company in half an hour i had a message from him late last night  the men advanced at once at the double and in an instant had a view of what was going on the six men out as sentries were falling back rapidly towards the village and two dark bodies of infantry were approaching abreast of each other but at a distance of two or three hundred yards apart they were some five hundred yards beyond the retreating sentries who were themselves a few hundred yards below the village the enemy had at present made no reply whatever to the fire of the sentries  advance slowly in skirmishing order de maupas said one flank of the company oppose each column open fire at once sight for seven hundred yards take advantage of cover and fire steadily  a steady fire was at once opened and although its effects could not be perceived they were evidently sensible for the columns immediately threw out half their strength as skirmishers and opened fire in a hundred paces de maupas halted his men and told them to lie down behind shelter  the enemy were now five hundred yards off and the franc tireurs had been joined by the sentries the numbers were four to one and although the position was of considerable advantage to the smaller forceas well as the fact that they were lying quiet in shelter while their adversaries had to fire as they advancedthe odds were far too great to hope for success every moment however it was getting lighter and the franc tireurs could see that their fire was doing considerable execution whereas only two of their men had received slight wounds the enemy however pushed on steadily and were now little more than three hundred yards distant  fall back the lieutenant shouted six men alternately of each half company back fifty paces at the double  at the word twelve men retreated at full speed for fifty yards the others redoubling the fire from their breechloaders to cover the retreat the instant that the first men had gone fifty yards they turned threw themselves upon the ground and opened fire while those in front ran back at full speed passed them and halted in turn fifty paces in the rear the maneuver was repeated three times and they then gained the end house of the village  under shelter of a low wall another stand was made but the superior force of the enemy enabled them to threaten to outflank them many of the germans had fallen but the rest advanced with as much coolness and precision as if on parade  how beautifully these fellows do fight ralph exclaimed in admiration  now lads we must retreat the lieutenant said we have done very well now across the village and then make for the forest as hard as you can its not over five hundred yards when you are once there make a stand again  the men turned and in another moment would have carried out the order whenfrom a house in a line with them but about fifty yards offa heavy fire of musketry suddenly broke out  hurrah lads theres the commandant stand to your wall well thrash them yet  staggered by this sudden and heavy fire the germans paused and then fell back to a spot where a dip in the ground sheltered them from the fire from above for a short time there was a cessation of the fight at this moment the commandant joined the first company  well done indeed he exclaimed gallantly done lads we heard the firing and feared you would be crushed before we could get up it is fortunate i started half an hour before daybreak we have done the last two miles at a run  have you suffered much  there was a general look round four men had fallen in the retreat another lay dead shot through the head as he fired over the wall four others were wounded three seriously while ralph barclay had a ball through the fleshy part of his arm  fortunately major tempe said half a dozen men from the other village volunteered to come over to help the wounded i will send them over here at once they can take some doors off their hinges and carry these three men right back into the forest at once we have not done yet  get your men into skirmishing line de maupas i will form mine to join you occupy the line of gardens and walls  scarcely was the movement effected when the germans again appeared on the hillside they had still a very great superiority in numbers for the two companies of franc tireurs only numbered now fortyfive men while the germanswho had lost upwards of twenty menwere still nearly eighty strong  ralph barclay still kept his place in the ranks tim doyle had bandaged up his arm for percy who had at first attempted it had nearly fainted at the sight of the blood the irishman was in the highest glee and occasionally indulged in whoops of defiance and in taunting remarkswhich would not have flattered the enemy could they have heard and understood them  the germans as they emerged from their shelter were about four hundred yards distant and the fire at once recommenced the franc tireurs were all lying down and this gave them a great advantage over the germans and the disparity of numbers being less the fight raged with greater obstinacy than before very gradually the enemy won their waytaking advantage of every rock and inequality of grounduntil they were within two hundred yards of the village nearer than this they could not come for the ground was open and in the face of the force in shelter armed with breech loaders it would have been madness to have attempted a rush  for some time the combatants remained in the same position merely exchanging an occasional shot when a head or a hat was exposed at last major tempe became uneasy at the prolonged inaction upon the part of the enemy  de maupas he said run up to the upper story of that house and try and see what they are doing look all round i dont like this long hesitation they are greatly superior in force and know it i think that they must be going to try some flanking movement  the lieutenant obeyed and going up to the upper story of the house pointed out by his commander peered cautiously out as far as he could see nothing was stirring the germans appeared to be lying in the little hollow in which they were sheltered he was about to descend when he remembered his orders to look around in all directions he therefore went to a window at the end of the house and looked carefully out  as he did so he gave a start and his heart seemed for a moment to stand still then with a bound he reached the door sprang downstairs and rushed out to where major tempe was standing behind a wall  the cavalry are upon us he said they are not five hundred yards off they have made a great detour and are  major tempe stopped to hear no more  fall back men he shouted keep well together the cavalry are upon us now at a double to the forest for your lives  steady steady  the men sprang from the position behind which they had been firing fell in hurriedly in the street and then went off at a fast double towards the forest there were a few trees near but no shelter sufficient to be of any use nearer than five hundred yards fortunately they were unimpeded by wounded every man having been carried back into the forest immediately he was struck still it was evident that they could not gain the forest in time they had seen the leading horsemen turn into the end of the village not more than three hundred yards distant as they started and the carbine balls were already whizzing over their heads  with the rapidity and steadiness which mark the movements of the prussian cavalry they formed in line as they issued from the village and before the fugitives were halfway to the forest a line of horsemen fifty abreast were in full gallop behind then followed another of equal strength fifty yards behind the franc tireurs with their rifles and accouterments were already slackening their speed  we must form square major they are not a hundred and fifty yards behind de maupas exclaimed we can beat them off easily enough  major tempe shook his head and shouted cheerily  keep on to the last moment men well together i will tell you when the moment is come hold your rifles in readiness  in ten more seconds he gave the word the men were in readiness and the square was formed as if by magic the uhlans were not more than eighty yards off  file firing the major shouted steady dont throw away a shot  now was the time for breechloading weapons and so deadly was the fire that the center of the prussian line melted away before it and the men who remained reined aside their horses as they reached the hedge of bayonets the flanks kept on and united again behind the square drawing up near the edge of the wood a hundred and fifty yards distant  the charge of the second line was attended with precisely similar results the instant that they had passed however major tempe shouted to his men  on again for the woods steady keep square reserve your fire till i tell you we must break through the cavalry they only want to keep us their infantry will be here in three minutes they are through the village already  the position of the franc tireurs was now critical in the extreme the enemys cavalrybetween them and safety only a hundred yards distanthad unslung their carbines and opened fire the infantry were nearly two hundred yards behind but fortunately dared not fire for fear of hitting their own cavalry  at a rapid pacefor they were running for lifethe little knot of franc tireurs dashed forward one or two fell from the fire of the cavalry and as they were fifty yards distant from the wood there was a cry and philippe duburg fell to the ground in an instant tim doylewho was his next manstopped caught him up as if he had been a feather and with a desperate effort again joined the others just as they were within twenty yards of the cavalry  fire major tempe cried and from the front and from each side of the little squarewhich was but six deep either waythe rifles flashed out  level bayonets charge  there was a short struggle the second ranks poured their fire into the cavalry line there was a clashing of bayonets against swords and then the band ran through the broken line of cavalry there was a rush into the brushwood and then from behind the shelter of the trees the fire opened again and the cavalry fell sullenly back having lost upwards of thirty men in that short five minutes since they had left the village  the german infantry halted at a distance of two hundred yards but they would have lost too many men in crossing the open to make it worth while to attack the sheltered foewho could pick them off to the last moment only to withdraw deeper into the forest when they approached its edge accordingly they too fell back exchanging fire with the franc tireurs until they gained the shelter of the village  the conflict over the men sank exhausted upon the ground where they stood major tempe went round to each saying a word of praise and giving a little of the brandywith which he had filled his canteen before startingwith some water from their own kegs then he gave a sharp whistle and the men again gathered round him  once more lads i must thank you for your conduct he said you have defended yourselves against forces altogether four times your own you fairly kept at bay an infantry force of twice your own number you have withstood a charge of cavalry also double your own strength and have performed the unusual feat of successfully charging cavalry you have inflicted a very heavy loss upon the enemy not less than forty of the infantry must have been placed hors de combat and fifteen or twenty of the cavalry at the lowest estimate altogether although forced to fall back the affair is more creditable than many a brilliant victory  our own loss has been heavyas heavy in proportion to our numbers as that of the enemythough owing to an advantage of position while engaged with the infantry it is actually far less than theirs still lads it is very very heavy and the major looked round with a saddened face on the diminished band  our only consolation is that our friends have died doing their duty and setting a noble example if all frenchmen were but animated with a spirit like that which i am proud to say animates the franc tireurs of dijon there are few of the invaders who would ever recross the rhine  lieutenant ribouville go through the muster roll of the two companies our brave friend de maupas has alas fallen he was at my side when a rifle ball struck him in the temple  the list was now called over and the result was a sad one the two companies including officers had gone into the fight fiftyfive strong only thirtyone answered to their names besides these eight had been removed farther into the forest severely wounded and philippe duburg lay a short distance offthe surgeon being employed bandaging his leg which a rifle ball had entered above the knee fifteen therefore were dead or missingwhich as the germans bayoneted all wounded franc tireurs was the same thing of the thirtyone who answered to their names nine had wounds more or less severe and the surgeon with his assistants had work on his hands which would take him far into the night  the instant that they were dismissed from parade the boys hurried to their cousin he was very pale from loss of blood but was perfectly sensible his brother sat on a bench beside him holding his head on his knee  philippe smiled faintly as the boys came up  i am so glad you have escaped he said in a low voice  they clasped his hand  does it hurt you much philippe  not very much not so much as i should have thought  did the doctor say anything about it philippe  yes he said that it had just missed the great arteries and that he thinks it struck the bone and has glanced up somewhere but he cant say till he probes it when  then your leg is not broken  no he says it is certainly not broken but it may be splintered  thank god for that anyhow the boys said  we owe his life to tim doyle louis said i was not next to him and did not see him fall or know he was hit till i saw tim come up with him on his shouldersand even if i had i could not have lifted him and carried him off tim saved his life there is no doubt about that  as it was evident that philippe was too weak to talk and would be better for being quiet awhile the boys now left him with his brother  looking through the trees towards the village a dense smoke could now be seen rising in several places and in a few minutes the whole village was in a blaze moved by the sight the unfortunate inhabitants came out from their hiding places in the forest wringing their hands crying and cursing the invaders in spite of the advice of major tempe several of the women went off towards the scene of conflagration to endeavor to save some little household treasure from the flames in a short time one of them returned to fetch her husband saying that the enemy had all left before they reached the village and were already far down the hillside major tempe at once sent forward the unwounded men to assist the villagers to put out the fire and to save property their efforts were however altogether unavailing the germans had scattered large quantities of petroleum before leaving upon the beds and such other furniture as they could not carry away or destroy  it was a pitiable sight to see the poor homeless people sitting about looking at the ruins of their houses some cried piteously others gazed with listless faces but with a cold despair even more painful to see fortunately they had saved all their animals but at present they were too much absorbed in the thoughts of what they had lost to bestow even a thought of satisfaction on what they had saved  major tempe grieved and touched at the painful scene of which he and his men had been the cause called the franc tireurs together and made a proposition to them which was at once heartily agreed to he then called together the cure and schoolmaster andafter a few wellchosen words of regret at the ills which he and his had involuntarily brought upon the villagehe handed over to them in the name of the whole corps the hundred pounds in thaler notes which had been found upon the schoolmaster whom they had executed for treachery to be distributed among the inhabitants according to their necessities  the offer was gratefully received and the priest and schoolmaster at once went round and told the poor people whose gratitude and delight were unbounded to so poor a population the sum seemed immense and although it would not replace what was destroyed it would go far towards making their abodes habitable the village only contained about twenty houses the walls were still standing timber for the roofs and floors was to be had for cutting in the forest bushes for thatching could be found in abundance the principal portion of the houses therefore would cost only labor and this money would suffice to keep them alive while engaged upon it and enough would remain to get at least a few blankets to lay upon the strawwhich would for the time serve for bedstogether with a few other simple necessaries the sale of a portion of the animals would do the rest and in their gratitude to the franc tireurs for having thus relieved their first and most pressing difficulties the inhabitants altogether forgot the illfeeling which they had before felt against them as the authors of their disaster  after burying their dead the men set to work to assist the villagers in building temporary hutsor rather bowersto the edge of the forest in which before nightfall they had the satisfaction of seeing them installed the few articles of bedding blankets etc saved at the approach of the prussians were spread on heaps of freshlycut grass and one of the oxen of the franc tireurs which had arrived the day before was killed and divided great fires were lighted andhad it not been for the bandages on the heads and the arms in slings of several of the franc tireursno one coming upon the scene would have guessed how desperate a skirmish had raged here  the next day the carts which had been sent for arrived and the wounded were placed in them upon heaps of straw and sent off with one of the surgeons with instructions to travel among the hills until they reached a point where it would be quite safe to descend into the valley and take the train to dijon at the first station at which it was open among them was philippe duburg who was accompanied by his brother louis had obtained a weeks leave of absence for the purpose and was the bearer of letters and innumerable messages from the boys to their parents and sisters a few hours later the remnants of the first and second companies marched to join their comrades    chapter 10 the bridge of the vesouze   the very day after the fight news arrived which induced a sudden change of position upon the sixteenth of september the baden troops occupied mulhouse having entered colmar on the preceding day it was evident that the railway was so strongly guarded between strasburg and nancy that it was hopeless to expect to be able to interrupt it seriously with so small a force as that at major tempes command still less possible was it to render any assistance whatever to the doomed city of strasburg after taking counsel therefore with his officers major tempe decided to march more to the south so as to assist to oppose the passage of the enemy west from colmar or mulhouse through the passes of the vosges  the alarm was however but temporary for having made requisitions as usual the prussians retired and the corps returned to their old quarters there another ten days passed spent not in ease but in constant marchings and countermarchings whenever news arrived that any parties of uhlans were approaching the mountains with the object of making requisitions the corps were instantly set in motion sometimes severe skirmishes were the result sometimes the news turned out to be untrue and after a long days march and a night spent watching the men had nothing to do but to march back again  upon the 28th came the news of the surrender of strasburg upon the preceding day after one of the most heroic defenses in history there was now no doubt that the germans would ere long advance seriously by this time the total of the french forces among the vosges mountains was considerable scarce a day passed without the arrival of a corps of franc tireurs andhad all these corps been animated with a spirit such as that evinced by the franc tireurs of dijon and had they acted in unity with discipline and intelligencethey might have rendered immense services to france  unfortunately this was very far from being the case very many of the men had entered the ranks only to avoid being called upon to go out with the mobilesor mobilized national guard others had only entered from the impulse of the moment very many were altogether unwilling to submit to any steady discipline while in a great number of cases the corps were completely paralyzed from the utter incapacity of their officers owing to these various causes the corps of franc tireurs distinguished themselves in a great number of cases only by the extreme ingenuity and foresight which they displayed in keeping at a prudent distance from the enemy some too earned a bad name not only for themselves but for the whole body of franc tireurs by their conduct towards the villagers helping themselves freely to what they required and making themselves almost as much dreaded by the peasantry as even the germans themselves  at the same time the villagers had in very many cases only themselves to blame for the rough measures adopted by the franc tireurs for often instead of doing all in their power for the men who had taken up arms in the cause of france the villagers looked upon them only as strangers out of whom the richest possible harvest was to be obtained and charged the most exorbitant prices for all articles of necessity supplied to them in fact they sometimes did not hesitate to say that they would not provide them at any price with the provisions required as these would be wanted to satisfy the requisition of the germans upon their arrival  perhaps in the whole world there is no class of people so completely engrossed by the thought of gain as are the french bourgeois and rustic population every change of government every political alteration every law passed is regarded by them simply and solely from the view of how it will affect their own pockets thus instead of driving away their flocks and herds at the approach of the invaders the people remained quietly in their houses and shamelessly trafficked with the invaders this apathy faint heartedness and want of patriotism upon the part of the inhabitants of the small towns and villages caused innumerable difficulties to the franc tireurs and major tempe was sometimes obliged to take the law into his own hands when the villagers absolutely refused to sell provisions or to give quarters to his men  in these cases he summoned the priest the schoolmaster and two other head men of the place and formed a committee with them and his own officers these fixed a fair price upon the articles required and major tempe then sent round a notice to the effect that if these articles were furnished in two hours they would be paid for at the agreed rates but that if not furnished he should quarter his men upon the inhabitants in accordance with the size of their houses and should remain there at least a weeka threat that never failed in producing the required effect  it was but seldom however that the major encountered any difficulties of this sort the corps was for the most part composed of men with some money they had now too sold the sheep and cattle which they had captured at blamont finding the inconvenience of sending for them whenever meat was required the proceeds of these and of the horses captured at the same time had given them a good sum in their regimental chest and they were therefore able and willing to pay a fair price for such articles as they required besides this the report of the actions of blamont and still had now widely circulated andas a general thingthe people were glad to do all in their power for a corps composed of men who really meant work and had given good proofs of their courage and energy  by this time the boys had received several letters from home and it may be readily imagined the pleasure these letters afforded them major tempes official report of the doings of his corps had been published in the dijon papers and from these had been copied far and wide through france and the people of dijon were not a little proud of their corps the names of the two barclays had appeared in the report as specially distinguishing themselves and their father had written saying how pleased and gratified he was at their conduct mrs barclay and milly had also written but their expressions of pleasure were mingled with many hopes that the boys would not expose themselves unnecessarily  the band had dwindled much in the month since they left dijon upwards of thirty had been killed or disabled in the fights of blamont and still half as many more had been killed or wounded in smaller skirmishes and ten or twelve had gone home or into hospital completely knocked up with the hard work and exposure only about sixty men therefore remained  schlestadt and neu brisach were now invested by the germans and after waiting for a few days to ascertain the course that they were likely to take major tempe determined as general cambriels was forming an army down by besancon to defend the upper passes of the vosges andas it was rumored that a second german army was likely to advance south from nancythat he would recross the vosges and aid in the defense against this second army of invaders  three days fatiguing marches brought them to epinal where the boys in accordance with their promise went straight to the house of the gentleman who had so hospitably served them at their last visit their friends were delighted to see them and expressed great regret that one of the party was missing the boys were however able to say that their last letter from dijon had given good accounts of philippe duburg who was now considered out of danger there was however no hope of his being able to rejoin them as the surgeon considered it probable that his leg would be a very long time before it would be sufficiently healed to allow him to use it  their host had read the account in the papers of the doings of the franc tireurs and his wife laughingly made a further apology to the barclays and their cousin for her remark at their first visit about boys  my girls have talked about nothing else but your doings ever since we had the news of your attack upon the uhlans near blamont she said one would think from the interest they take in the corps that the whole future of france depended upon the franc tireurs of dijon  the young barclays laughed and percy muttered something under his breath while louis duburg replied seriously that he hoped the franc tireurs of dijon would always do their best to deserve the kind thoughts of mademoisellesat which piece of politeness percy muttered bosh  epinal had as yet escaped but it was feared that ere long the enemy would advance the town looked deserted for all the young men had left with the mobilesor mobilized national guardand all men under forty were drilling in readiness to march at a moments notice no serious movement of the enemy south of luneville was as yet signalized  after two days rest the corps again marched north their destination being kept a profound secret even from the men so anxious apparently was major tempe that this time their object should not be foiled by treachery that after the first days march he left the main road and having secured the services of a peasant as a guide he made two long days marches through forests and over mountainsavoiding even small villages four led horses accompanied the march one laden with the gun cotton and the other three carrying provisions so that they might be independent of the local supply each night they bivouacked in the forests but as the weather was now finealthough the nights were coldthis was no hardship whatever  upon the morning of the fourth day from their leaving epinal major tempe told his men that he had learned at epinal that the line was no longer so closely guarded as beforethe germans being confident now of the impotence of the french to harm themand that they were now in the forest of moudan within three miles of the railway between luneville and rechicourt on the line to strasburg his intention was to reconnoiter that day andif success should be found possibleto attempt at daybreak next morning to blow up the railway bridge over the vesouze  the news was received with great satisfaction as the corps were burning to distinguish themselves and in no way could they do such service as to cut the line of communicationalthough as the germans were no longer dependent upon a single line the advantage would not be of so signal a nature as it would have been could they have cut it at the time when they first made the attempt the barclays were naturally selected to reconnoiter and as their change of clothes had been alwaysby major tempes orderscarried on the baggage horse they had no difficulty upon that score  their expedition was uneventful at the village nearest to the bridge they went in and bought some cheese and other articles andafter gaining all the information they were able without exciting attentionthey made their way through broken ground to a point near enough to the bridge to enable them to reconnoiter it undiscovered  a sentry was posted at each end at a cottage hard by were ten others while there were twenty in the village they had just left there were also sentries down the line but these were far enough apart to render it certain that they could not muster in time to interfere seriously with the enterprise with this information they returned to the forest  a council of war was held and it was decided that the news was satisfactory and that the attack should take place at daybreak each man was instructed in the work he would have to perform lieutenant houdin with thirty men was to surprise the german party in the village the resthaving made a detour to avoid the villagewere to be in readiness to attack the posts near the bridge immediately a gun was fired in the village the attack was to be made at daybreak from the bridge to the nearest point where the forest was thick enough to afford a safe shelter was a distance of about two miles  as soon as it became dark the camp fires were allowed to bum low and shortly afterwards the whole corps with the exception of the sentries were sound asleep at four oclock they were roused and marched silently off in the appointed direction by five oclock each party was at its post and for half an hour they lay in expectancy the barclays were with major tempes party near the bridge louis duburg and tim were with the party at the village  the attack upon the village was to take place at halfpast five and never did moments appear so slow to the boys as those which passed as they awaited the signal at last the silence was broken by the sharp crack of a rifle followed by three or four others  there goes the prussian sentry and there is our reply major tempe said now lads forward  as he spoke the sentry on the bridge fired his rifle immediately this was repeated by the next sentry on the line and the signal was taken up by each sentry until the sound died in the distance as it had done so the franc tireurs had made a rush forwards they were met by a straggling discharge from the germans as half asleep they hurried out from the guard room this was answered by the fire of the franc tireurs who surrounded them five fell and the others surprised and panic stricken threw down their arms they were instantly secured and the bridge was at once seized  the firing still continued in the village but in another five minutes it ceased and shortly afterwards louis duburg ran up with the tidings that the village was taken the germans surprised in their beds had offered but a slight resistance four were killed and sixteen taken prisoners one franc tireur only was slightly wounded  take two men with you major tempe said and escort those five prisoners to the village give them over to lieutenant houdin and tell him to send them with the prisoners he has taken under charge of six men to the forest let their hands be tied behind their backs for we cannot spare a larger escort tell him to be sure that the escort are loaded and have fixed bayonets directly he has sent off the prisoners let him join me here with the rest of his force  lieutenant ribouville now set to work to inspect the bridge and ordered the menwho were provided with the necessary implementsto set to and dig a hole down to the crown of the principal arch it was harder work than they had expected the roadway was solid the ballast pressed down very tightly and the crown of the arch covered to a considerable depth with concrete  only a few men could work at once and after a halfhours desperate labor the hole was nothing like far enough advanced to ensure the total destruction of the bridge upon the charge being fired in the meantime the prussian sentries were arriving from up and down the line and although not in sufficient force to attack had opened fire from a distance  dont you think that will do ribouville major tempe asked  no sir the other replied it might blow a hole through the top of the arch but i hardly think that it would do so its force would be spent upwards  at this moment ralphwho had done his spell of work and had been down to the stream to get a drink of watercame running up  if you please lieutenant ribouville there is a hole right through the pier just above the waters edge it seems to have been left to let any water that gets into the pier from above make its escape i should think that would do to hold the charge  the very thing lieutenant ribouville said delightedly what a fool i was not to have looked to see if such a hole existed  stop work men and carry the barrels down to the edge of the water  the stream was not above waist deep and the engineer officer immediately waded into it and examined the hole he at once pronounced it to be admirably suited to the purpose it did notas ralph had supposedgo straight through but there were two holes one upon each side of the pier nearly at the same level and each extending into the center of the pier the holes were about four inches square  the barrels of gun cotton were now hastily opened on the bank and men waded out with the contents lieutenant ribouville upon one side and ralph upon the other took the cotton and thrust it with long sticks into the ends of the hole in five minutes the contents of the two barrels were safely lodged the fuse inserted and the operation of tampingor rammingin dry sand earth and stones commenced  make haste major tempe shouted their numbers are increasing fast there are some fifteen or twenty on either side  a brisk fire of rifles was now going on the day had fairly broken and the franc tireurs sheltered behind the parapet of the bridge on the bank of the river were exchanging a lively fire with the enemy threequarters of an hour had passed since the first shot was fired  suddenly a distant boom was heard followed in a few seconds by a slight whizzing noise which grew rapidly into a loud scream and in another moment there was an explosion close to the bridge the men all left off their work for an instant  and what may that be mister percy a more unpleasant sound i niver heard since i was a baby  i quite agree with you tim as to its unpleasantness it is a shell the artillery are coming up from luneville the fire of the sentries would take the alarm in a couple of minutes give them another fifteen to get ready and half an hour to get within range  here comes another  are you ready ribouville the commandant shouted they have cavalry as well as artillery we must be off or we shall get caught in a trap  i am ready was the answer  barclay strike a match and put it to the end of your fuse till it begins to fizz  have you lit it  yes sir ralph said a moment later  so have i the lieutenant said they will burn about three minutes  now for a run  in a couple of minutes the franc tireurs were retreating at the double and they had not gone a hundred yards when they heard the sound of two tremendous explosions following closely one upon another looking back they saw the pier had fallen in fragments and that the bridge lay a heap of ruins in the stream  hurrah lads shouted the commandant you have done your work well those who get out of this with a whole skin may well be proud of their days work  dont mind the shells he continued as two more of the missiles burst in quick succession within a short distance of them they make an ugly noise but they wont hurt us at this distance  the german artillerymen had apparently arrived at the same conclusion for they now ceased to fire and the retreating corps were only exposed to an occasional shot from the infantry who had followed them from the bridge  the artillery and cavalry will be up before we reach the wood percy said to his brother as they trotted along side by side  they may come up ralph said but they can do us no harm on the broken ground and will catch a tartar if they dont mind  the ground was indeed unfavorable for cavalry and artillery it was broken up with the spurs of the hill here and there great masses of rock cropped out of the ground while patches of forest extended over a considerable portion of the ground in one of these standing upon rising and broken ground major tempe halted his men and opened so heavy a fire upon the enemys cavalry when the column appeared that they were at once halted and although when the artillery arrived a few shells were fired into the wood the franc tireurs had already retired and gained the forest without further molestation upon calling the roll it was discovered that six men only were missing these had falleneither killed or woundedfrom the fire of the enemys infantry during the time that the operation at the bridge were being carried out  there was great rejoicing at the success of their enterprise the effect of which would certainly be to block the traffic along that line for at least a week their satisfaction was however somewhat damped by the sight of several dense columns of smoke in the plain showing that the germans had as usual wreaked their vengeance upon the innocent villagers the feeling of disgust was changed to fury when some of the peasantswho had fled into the woods upon the destruction of their abodesreported that the germans having found that three of the franc tireurs were only wounded had dragged them along to the entrance to the village and had hung them there upon some trees by the roadside had it not been for major tempes assurance that their comrades should be avenged the franc tireurs would at once have killed their prisoners  in the evening the men were formed up the prisoners ranged in line and twelve were taken by lot and these with the officer taken with themwhen night fellwere bound and marched off under a guard of thirty men neither of the boys formed part of the escort which was an immense relief to them for although they were as indignant as the rest at the murder of their wounded comrades by the germans and quite agreed in the justice of reprisal still they were greatly relieved when they found that they would not have to be present at the execution  two hours later major tempe returned with the escort the officer and eleven of his men had been hung on trees by the roadside at a distance of half a mile only from the village the twelfth man had been released as bearer of a note from major tempe to the german commanding officer saying that as a reprisal for the murder of the three wounded franc tireurs he had hung twelve germans and that in future he would always hang four prisoners for every one of his men who might be murdered contrary to the rules of war  this act of retributive justice performed the corps retreated to join the army of the vosges under general cambriels the news of the destruction of the bridge across the vesouze had preceded them and when after three days heavy marching they reached the village which formed the headquarters of the general they were received with loud cheers by the crowds of mobiles who thronged its little streets it was out of the question to find quarters and the major therefore ordered the men to bivouac in the open while he reported himself to general cambriels  the commandant of the franc tireurs was personally known to general cambriels having at one time served for some years under his command and he was most warmly received by the veteran one of the bravest and most popular of the french generals as general of the district he had received all major tempes reports and was therefore acquainted with the actions of the corps  ah major he said after the first greetings if i had only a few thousand men animated with the spirit and courage of your fellows the germans would never get through the vosges as it is i shall of course do my best but what can one do with an army of plow boys led by officers who know nothing of their duty against troops like the germans  as for my franc tireurs they are in many cases worse than useless they have no discipline whatever they embroil me with the peasantry they are always complaining the whole of them together have not done as much real service as your small band they shoot down uhlans when they catch them in very small parties but have no notion whatever of real fighting  however i cannot thank you too warmly your name will appear in the gazette tomorrow as colonel and i must ask you to extend the sphere of your duties we want officers terribly and i will brigade four or five of these corps of franc tireurs under your orders so as to make up a force of a thousand men you will have full authority over them to enforce any discipline you may choose i want you to make a body to act as an advanced guard of skirmishers to my army of mobiles i have a few line troops but i want them as a nucleus for the force  what do you say  personally general i should greatly prefer remaining with my own little corps upon every man of whom i can rely at the same time i should not wish for a moment to oppose my own likings or dislikings to the general good of the service many of these corps of franc tireurs are composed of excellent materials and if well led and disciplined would do anything i can only say i will do my best  thank you tempe is there anything else i can do for you  i should like to see a step given to the three officers serving under me the major said they have all served in the regular army and all have equally well done their duty  it shall be done and two of them shall be posted to other corps while one takes the command of your own the general said do you wish commissions for any of the men  major tempe named three of the men and then added  the two members of the corps who have most distinguished themselves i have not mentioned general because they are too young to place over the heads of the others at the same time their services certainly deserve recognition i mentioned them in the dispatches i sent to you as having done immense service by going down in disguise into the midst of the germans in fact at saverne they saved the corps from destruction they are two young english lads named barclay  i remember distinctly general cambriels said they speak french fluently i suppose as well as german  both languages like natives the major answered  and can they ride  yes admirably major tempe said i knew them before the war and they are excellent horsemen  then they are the very fellows for me general cambriels said i will give them commissions in the provisional army at once and put them upon my own staff they would be of great value to me  you will spare them i hope  i shall be extremely sorry to do so general but for their own sakes and for the good of the service i will of course do so  thanks colonel i shall put the franc tireurs of dijon in general orders tomorrow as having performed good service to the country and please to thank them in my name for their services  thank you very much general it will give me more pleasure than even the step that you have been kind enough to give to myself  good evening colonel we must have a long chat together one of these days  the chief of my staff will give you the names of the corps to be placed under your orders the matter was settled this morning and i have picked out the best of those here orders have been sent for them to assemble at raoula village a mile from herein the morning with a notification that they are placed under your command  goodbye    chapter 11 a fight in the vosges   upon colonel tempes rejoining the menwho were already busy preparing their suppershe ordered the assembly to be sounded and when they were formed up he formally thanked them in the name of the general for the service that they had rendered adding that they would appear in general orders upon the following day  the men replied with a cheer of vive la france  their commander then informed them that he himself had received a step in rank and would in future command them with several other corps that lieutenant ribouville would in future be their special commander with the rank of captain that the other two lieutenants would be promoted and that three of their number would receive commissions and while one of them remained under captain ribouville the others wouldwith the newlymade captainsbe attached to other corps the two barclays would receive commissions as officers on the staff of general cambriels himself  when colonel tempe finished speaking the boys could hardly believe their ears and looked at each other to inquire if they heard aright there could be no mistake about it for colonel tempe called them forward and shaking hands with them congratulated them on the promotion which he said they had well earned the men gave a hearty cheer for the young english lads were general favorites for their good temper and willingness to oblige  directly the men were dismissed the colonel again called the lads to him  i am sorry to lose you he said but of course it is for your good come with me at once to general cambriels i will introduce you and you had better ask for four days leave you can get the railway in four hours ride from here you will have no difficulty in finding a place in some of the commissariat cities going to fetch stores if you start tonight you can catch a train before morning and be in dijon quite early a couple of days will be sufficient to get your uniforms made and to buy horses  your cousin will go with you i gave him leave last night to start upon our arrival here he is not so strong as you are and the surgeon says that he must have rest and quiet he is quite worn out  now pile your riflesyou will not want them any moreand come with me i have said good night to the general but he will excuse me  still bewildered the boys did as they were ordered as they were piling their rifles they heard a loud blubbering looking round they saw tim doyle weeping most copiously  what is the matter tim  matter your honor aint yer going to lave us what am i going to do at all  the boys hurried away without replyfor colonel tempe was waiting for themand on the way to headquarters mentioned tims grief at parting with them  the general received the lads most kindly and at once granted them four days leave to go to dijon to procure uniform  colonel tempe then said  you do not want orderlies do you general  i do indeed the general answered i have about a dozen cavalry men of different regiments who form my escort and act as orderlies but they are my entire force of cavalry  i have an irishman in my corps general who only joined to be near these young fellows he was brought up among horses and you have only to put him in a hussar uniform and he would make a capital orderly and would act as servant to your new staff officers  by all means the general said send him over in the morning we will make a hussar of him in half an hour we have got a few uniforms in store  what a meeting that was near dijon the boys upon reaching the station had found a train on the point of starting and it was seven in the morning when they reached the town the shops open early in french country towns and although their tailor had not as yet taken his shutters down he was up and about and willingly measured them for their new uniformspromising that they should have them without fail the next afternoon they then walked up to the cottage and dropped in just as the party there were sitting down to breakfast  there was a loud exclamation from captain barclay and a scream of delight from their mother and milly and it was a good ten minutes before they were sitting round the table talking coherently it was but six weeks since they had left but it seemed like years and there was as much to tell and to talk about as if they had just returned after an absence of half a lifetime in india  how long have you got leave for was one of the first questions  only four days percy said the corps has now joined the army of the vosges and will act regularly with it a move forward will take place in a few days so that we could not ask for longer  only four days mrs barclay and milly repeated aghast  it is not much mamma ralph put in but it is better than nothing you see you did not expect us at all  quite so captain barclay said cheerfully it is a clear gain and we waste the time in regretting that it is not longer it is a great delight to have you back again even for a few hours you both look wonderfully well and fully a year older than when you left roughing it and exposure evidently suits you  has louis come back with you  yes papa he has come back to stay for some time he is completely done up and the surgeon has ordered rest and quiet for a while  how is philippe  he is getting on well and will walk the doctor hopes in another fortnight or three weeks but i have not seen him foralthough your uncle comes in as usual for a chat with memadame duburg has never forgiven me for having as she says influenced him in allowing the boys to go and of course since this wound of philippes she has been more angry than ever  the boys laughed they understood their aunts ways  tim has not been hurt i hope milly asked  oh no tim is as well as ever and the life and soul of the corps  as breakfast went on the boys gradually related the changes that were taking place major tempes promotion to be colonel and the fact that he was placed in command of several corps of franc tireurs who were hereafter to act together they said no word however about their own promotion having agreed to keep that matter secret until the uniforms were completed they had also asked their cousin to say nothing about it at home as otherwise their uncle would have been sure to have come in to congratulate them and the secret would have been at an end at once  an hour later monsieur duburg came in to see them after the first talk he said to captain barclay  the way in which your boys have stood the fatigue is a proof in itself how much the prosperity of a nation depends upon the training of its boys england is strong because her boys are all accustomed from their childhood to active exercise and outdoor violent games in case of a war like this which we are going through almost every man could turn soldier and go through the fatigues of a campaign and what is more could make light ofnot to say enjoythem  here upon the contrary our young fellows do nothing and in an emergency like the present want both spirit and strength to make soldiers almost all the boys who went from here in tempes corps have returned completely worn out even louis is a wreck although thanks to the companionship of your boys he has supported it better and longer than the majority of them had he began as a child to take pleasure in strong exercise no doubt he could have stood it as well as ralph and percy who look absolutely benefited by it unfortunately i allowed my wifes silly objection to prevail until the last three years when i insisted that they should do as they liked  as i have said before barclay i say again i congratulate you on your boys you have a right to be proud of them i wish the race of young frenchmen were only like them  great indeed was the astonishmentupon the afternoon of the following daywhen ralph and percy walked into the sitting room dressed as staff officers feeling a little awkward with their swords but flushed with an honorable pleasure and pridefor their epaulets had been gained by no family interests no private influence they were worn as the reward of good service captain barclay wrung the boys hands silently their mother cried with delight and milly danced round the boys like a small possessed one  it is not for the absolute rank itself boys that i am pleased their father said when they had related the whole circumstances for you have no idea of remaining in the french service and consequently the rank will be of no use to you after the end of the war still it is a thing all your lives to be proud ofthat you won your commission in the french army by good service  what i am thinking of most mrs barclay said is that now they are officers in the regular army they will run no risk of being shot if they are taken prisoners  we dont mean to be taken prisoners mamma still as you say it is certainly an advantage in favor of the regular uniform  and what is to become of tim milly asked  oh tim is going to become a hussar and act as one of the generals orderlies and be our servant when he has nothing else to do you see now we are officers we have a right to servants  i am very glad tim is going with you mrs barclay said my brother tells us that he saved philippes life and it seems a comfort to know that he is with you  the next morning captain barclay went down with them to the town and purchased a couple of capital horses which by great good fortune were on sale  upon the morning of the fourth day of their visit the boys took leave of their father and mother and left to join the headquarters of general cambriels the parting was far less trying than it had been the first time they went away the boys were not now going out to an unknown danger although the risk that a staff officer runs is absolutely somewhat greater than that incurred by a regimental officer still it is slight in comparison with the risk run by a franc tireur employed in harassing an enemy and in cutting his communicationsespecially when capture means death those who remained behind were encouraged partly by this thought but still more by the really irrational one that as the boys had gone away and come back safe once they would probably do so again  the evening of the same day the barclays reported themselves for duty to the general and next morning began work their duty was hard though simple by day they were constantly on dutythat is to say either riding over the country or waiting near the generals quarters in readiness for a start ormore seldomwriting and drawing up reports in the office by night they took it in turns with the other staff officers to be on dutythat is to say to lie down to sleep in uniform with the horse saddled at the door in readiness to start at an instants notice  tims duties as an orderly were not heavy and were generally over by five oclock after which he acted as servant to the boys it was impossible under the circumstances for the staff to mess together as usual there was neither a room available nor indeed any of the appliances among tims other duties therefore was that of cooking they had also another orderly allotted to them and he devoted himself to the care of the horses tim undertaking all other work  the boys liked their new duties much the work was hard but pleasant their fellow officers were pleasant companions and their general most kind and genial  a week after they had joined general cambriels advanced into the vosges to oppose the prussians who were marching south the progress of the army was slow for they had to carry what supplies they required with them colonel tempe kept with his command a few hours march ahead and one or other of the boys was frequently dispatched with orders etc to obtain reports from him  after three days marching they neared the enemy all was now watchfulness and excitement the franc tireurs were already engaged in skirmishing and early one morning ralph received orders to ride forward and reconnoiter the enemys position passing through the posts of franc tireurs he rode cautiously along the road with his hand on the butt of his revolver and his horse well in handready to turn and ride for his life on an instants notice  presently as the road wound through a narrow gorge lined with trees he heard a voice say close in his ear stop  he reined in his horse and drew his pistol the leaves parted and a man of some sixty years of age armed with an old doublebarreled fowling piece stepped out  the germans are just beyond he said i expect them every moment  and what are you doing here ralph asked  what am i doing repeated the peasant i am waiting to shoot some of them  but they will hang you to a certainty if they catch you  let them the old man said quietly they will do me no more harm than they have done me i had a nice farm near metz i lived there with my wife and daughter and my three boys someone fired at the prussians from a wood near no one was hit but that made no difference the blackhearted scoundrels came to my farm shot my three boys before their mothers eyes ill treated her so that she died next day and when i returnedfor i was away at the timei found a heap of ashes where my house had stood the dead bodies of my three boys my wife dying and my daughter sitting by screaming with laughtermadquite mad  i took her away to a friends house and stayed with her till she died too a fortnight after then i bought this gun and some powder and lead with my last money and went out to kill prussians i have killed thirteen already and please god and the peasant lifted his hat devoutly i will kill two more today  how is it that you have escaped so long ralph asked in surprise  i never fire at infantry the peasant said it was uhlans that did it and its only uhlans i fire at i put myself on a rock or a hillside where they cant comeor in a thick woodand i content myself with my two shots and then go i dont want to be killed yet i have set my mind on having fiftyjust ten for each of mineand when ive shot the last of the fifty the sooner they finish me the better  youd better not go any farther sir the valley widens out round the corner and there are prussians in the nearest village  thank you ralph said but my orders are to reconnoiter them myself and i must do so i am well mounted and i dont think that they will catch me if i get a couple of hundred yards start there are franc tireurs in the village a mile back  ralph now rode carefully forward while the peasant went back into his hiding place by the wood as he had said the gorge widened into a broad valley a few hundred yards farther on upon emerging from the gorge ralph at once saw a villagealmost hidden among treesat a distance of less than a quarter of a mile after what he had heard he dared not ride on farther he therefore drew his horse aside from the road among some trees dismounted and made his way carefully up the rocky side of the hill to a point from which he could command a view down the whole valley  when he gained this spot he looked cautiously round below beyond the village he could see large numbers of men could make out lines of cavalry horses and rows of artillery a considerable movement was going on and ralph had no doubt that they were about to advance in his interest in what he saw he probably exposed his figure somewhat and caught the eye of some sharpsighted sentry in the village  the first intimation of his danger was given him by seeing some twenty uhlans dart suddenly out of the trees in which the village lay at the top of their speed while almost at the same moment eight or ten rifles flashed and the balls whizzed round him in most unpleasant propinquity ralph turned in an instant and bounded down the rock with a speed and recklessness of which at any other moment he would have been incapable fierce as was the pace at which the uhlans were galloping they were still a hundred yards distant when ralph leaped upon his horse and galloped out in front of them  there was a rapid discharge of their carbines but men at full gallop make but poor shooting ralph felt he was untouched but by the convulsive spring which his horse gave he knew the animal was wounded for a couple of hundred yards there was but little difference in his speed and then ralphto his dismayfelt him flag and knew that the wound had been a severe one another hundred yards and the animal staggered and would have fallen had not ralph held him up well with knee and bridle  the uhlans saw it for they gave a shout and a pistol bullet whizzed close to his head ralph looked round an officer twenty yards ahead of his men was only about forty yards in his rear in his hand he held a revolver which he had just discharged  surrender he shouted or you are a dead man  ralph saw that his pursuers were too close to enable him to carry out his intention of dismounting and taking to the woodwhich here began to approach thickly close to the roadand was on the point of throwing up his arm in token of surrender when his horse fell heavily with him at the moment when the prussian again fired almost simultaneously with the crack of the pistol came the report of a gun and the german officer fell off his horse shot through the heart  ralph leaped to his feet and dashed up the bank in among the trees just as another shot was fired with a like fatal result into the advancing uhlans the restbelieving that they had fallen into an ambushinstantly turned their horses heads and galloped back the road they had come  ralphs first impulse was to rush down into the road and catch the officers horse which had galloped on a short distance when its master fell and was now returning to follow its companions as he did so the old peasant appeared from the wood  thank you ralph said warmly you have saved my life or at any rate have saved me from a german prison  the peasant paid no attention to him but stooped down to examine carefully whether the germans were both dead  two more he said with a grim smile that makes fifteen three apiece  then he picked up the officers revolver took the cartridge belonging to it from the pouch and with a wave of the hand to ralph strode back into the wood  ralph removed the holsters from the saddle of his own horsewhich had fallen deadplaced them on the horse of the german officer and then mounting it rode off at full speed to inform general cambriels of the results of his investigation  hallo barclay one of his fellow officers said as he rode up to the headquarters what have you been up to doing a little barter with a german hussar you seem to have got the best of him too for your own horse was a good one but this is a good deal better unless i am mistaken  how has it come about  quite a crowd of idlers had collected round while the officer was speaking struck like him with the singularity of the sight of a french staff officer upon a horse with german trappings ralph did not wish to enter into explanations there so merely replied in the same jesting strain that it had been a fair exchangethe small difference in the value of the horses being paid for with a small piece of lead then throwing his reins to his orderlywho came running uphe went in to report to the general the evident forward movements of the germans  are they as strong as we have heard the general asked  fully i should say sir i had no means of judging the infantry but they seemed in large force they were certainly strong in cavalry and i saw some eight or ten batteries of artillery  let the next for duty ride with all speed to tempe and tell him to hold the upper end of this valley send herves battery forward to assist him have the general assembly sounded  ralph left to obey these orders while the general gave the colonel of his staff the instructions for the disposition of his forces  the army of the vosgespompous as was its nameconsisted at this time of only some ten thousand men all mobiles or franc tireurs with the exception of a battalion of line and a battalion of zouaves the mobiles were almost undisciplined having only been out a month and were for the most part armed only with the old muzzle loader many were clothed only in the gray trousers with a red stripe which forms part of the mobiles uniform and in a blue blouse great numbers of them were almost shoeless having been taken straight from the plow or workshop and having received no shoes since they joined half disciplined half armed half clothed they were too evidently no match for the germans  the fact was patent to their general and his officers still his instructions were to make a stand at all hazards in the vosges and he now prepared to obey the ordersnot hoping for victory but trusting in the natural courage of his men to enable him to draw them off without serious disaster his greatest weakness was his artillery of which he had only two batteries against eight or ten of the germanswhose forces were even numerically superior to his own  in half an hour the dispositions were made the valley was wide at this point and there were some five or six villages nestled in it it was pretty thickly wooded and two miles behind narrowed again considerably just as the troops had gained their appointed places a faint sound of heavy musketry fire was heard in the gorge ahead mingled in a few minutes with the deep boom of cannon  the general surrounded by his staff moved forward towards the spot from the road at the entrance to the narrow part of the valley nothing could be seen but the cracking of rifles among the trees and rocks on either side the bursting of shells and the whistling of bullets were incessant the general and his staff accordingly dismounted handed their horses to the men of the escort and mounted the side of the hill  after a sharp climb they reached a point from whence they could see right down the long narrow valley on beyond the treesexcept near the roadwere thin the steep sides of the hills being covered with great blocks of stone and thick brushwood among theseall down one side and up the otherat a distance of some five hundred yards from the post taken up by the general a succession of quick puffs of smoke told where colonel tempes franc tireurs were placed while among the trees below there came up great wreaths of smoke from the battery which was supporting them by firing at the germans  these formed a long line up and down the sides of the valley at three or four hundred yards distance from the french lines two german batteries were down in the road a few hundred yards to the rear of their skirmishers and these were sending shells thickly up among the rocks where the franc tireurs were lying hid while two other batterieswhich the germans had managed to put a short way up on the mountain sides still farther in the rearwere raining shell with deadly precision upon the french batteries in the road  a prettier piece of warfare it would have been difficult to imaginethe lofty mountain sides the long lines of little puffs of smoke among the brushwood and rocks the white smoke arising from the trees in the bottom the quick dull bursts of the shellsas a spectacle it was most striking the noise was prodigious the steep sides of the mountain echoed each report of the guns into a prolonged roar like the rumble of thunder the rattle of the musketry never ceased for an instant and loud and distinct above the din rose the menacing scream of the shells  this is grand indeed ralph percy said after a moments silence  splendid ralph said but it is evident we cannot hold the gorge their skirmishers are three to our one and their shells must be doing terrible damage  barclay general cambriels said go down to the battery and bring me back word how they are getting on  the scene quite lost its beauty to percy now as he saw ralph scramble rapidly down the hillside in the direction of the trees among which the french battery was placed and over and among which the shells were bursting every second it seemed like entering a fiery furnace  it was a terribly long ten minutes before ralph was seen climbing up the hillside again and percys heart gave a jump of delight when he first caught sight of his figure as ralph came near his brother saw that he was very pale and had a handkerchief bound round one arm this was already soaked with blood he kept on steadily however until he reached the general who had upon seeing he was wounded advanced to meet him  one gun is dismounted sir and half the men are killed or wounded  go down harcourt and tell herve to fall back at once and to take position in the clump of trees a quarter of a mile down the valley so as to sweep the entrance  laon go to the right and you dubois to the left order the franc tireurs to retreat along the hillside and when they get to the end of the gorge to form in the plain and fall back to the first village  you are wounded barclay not seriously i hope he said kindly as the officers hurried away on their respective missions  a splinter of a shell sir ralph said faintly i dont think it has touched the bone but it has cut the flesh badly  ralph was just able to say this when his head swam and he would have fallen had not percy caught him in his arms with a little cry  he has only fainted from loss of blood the general said two or three handkerchiefs gentlemen  now major bind them round his arm  now take off his sash and bind it as tightly as you can over them thats right  now carry him down the rocks to the horses we have no time to lose  two of the officers at once put their arms under ralphs shoulders while percy took his feet and they hastened down to the horses as they did so ralph opened his eyes  i am all right now he said faintly  lie quiet the major said kindly it is only loss of blood there is no real harm done  there here are the horses  ralph was placed sitting on the ground a little brandy and water was given to him and as the blood was oozing but slowly through the bandage he felt sufficiently restored to sit on his horse  doyle you go with lieutenant barclay the colonel of the staff said ride slowly and keep close beside him so as to catch him if you see him totter you will find the surgeons ready at the generals quarters  halt stand aside for a moment here comes the artillery  well done lads well done the general said as the diminished battery rattled past at full gallop  then he himself with his staff put spurs to his horse and went off at full speed while tim followed at a walk riding by the side of ralph the flow of blood had now stopped and ralph was able to sit his horse until he reached the house which had served as the generals headquarters in the morning here one of the staff surgeons had fitted up a temporary ambulance and ralphs bandages were soon taken off and his coat removed tim turned sick at the sight of the ugly gash in his young masters arm and was obliged to go out into the air  the artillery were already at work and their fire told that the franc tireurs had retired from the gorge and that the germans were entering the wider valley  you have had a narrow escape the surgeon said after examining ralphs arm a quarter of an inch lower and it would have cut the main artery and you would have bled to death in five minutes as it is there is no great harm done it is a deepish flesh wound but with your youth and constitution it will heal up in a very short time i will draw the edges together with a needle and thread put a few straps of plaster on and a bandage and then you had better get into an ambulance wagon and go to the rear at once  cant i go into the field again now ralph asked i feel as if i could ride again now  no you can do nothing of the sort the surgeon said you have lost a lot of blood and if you were to ride now it might set off the wound bleeding again and you might be a dead man before you could be brought back here keep quiet and do as you are ordered and in a week you may be in the saddle again  it seems very hard ralph began  not at all hard the surgeon said you will see plenty more fighting before this war is over  this is a hard case if you like you have every reason to be thankful  as he spoke he pointed to a young mobile who was brought in his chest literally torn open with a shell  i can do nothing for him the surgeon said after a brief inspection of his wound he has not half an hour to live and will probably not recover consciousness if he does give him some weak brandy and water  wounded men were now being brought in fast and ralph went out and sat down by the door  fasten my horse up here tim the ambulance will be full of poor fellows who will want them more than i shall if i see that we are being driven back i shall mount and ride quietly back  no there is nothing more you can do for me go and join percy  the fight was now raging furiously the germans covered by the fire of their artillery had debouched from the pass and were steadily pressing forward they had already carried the village nearest to them this the french had set fire to before retreating to prevent its serving as a shelter for the enemy the mobiles stood their ground for the most part well under the heavy fire of shot and shell but their muzzle loaders were no match for the germans needle guns and the enemy were pressing steadily forward just as tim doyle rode up to the staff the germans had taken another village  that village must be retaken the general said barclay ride and order the zouaves to carry it with the bayonet  percy galloped off to where the zouaves lying behind a ridge in the ground were keeping up a heavy fire in answer to the storm of shot and shell which fell around them he rode up to the officer in command  the zouaves are to retake the village with the bayonet he said  the colonel gave the order but the fire was so heavy that the men would not face it again and again the officer reiterated the order standing exposed on the bank in front of his men to give them confidence it was in vain and the colonel looked towards percy with an air of despair percy turned his horse and galloped back to the general  the colonel has done all he can sir but the men wont advance  the fire is very heavy the general said but we must have the village back again  and he rode off himself to the battalion of zouaves the shot and shell were flying around him but he sat on his horse as immovable as if at a review  my lads he said in a loud clear tone generally the difficulty has been to prevent the zouaves rushing to an attack dont let it be said that a french general had to repeat to french zouaves an order to charge before they obeyed him  in an instant the zouaves were on their feet and with a cheer went at the village the germans in possession fired rapidly as the french approached and then hastily evacuated it the zouaves taking possession and holding it under a tremendous fire  all the afternoon the battle raged villages being taken and retaken several times the germans however were gradually gaining ground some of the regiments of mobiles had quite lost all order and discipline and their officers in vain tried to persuade them to hold the position in which they were placed two of the staff officers were killed three others wounded  percy had escaped almost by a miracle over and over again he had carried the generals orders across ground swept by the enemys shot and shell a horse had been killed under him but he had not received even a scratch and now mounted upon the horse of one of the officers who was killed he was returning from carrying an order across a very open piece of ground at full gallop suddenly he came upon a sight whichhurried as he was and exposed as was the positioncaused him instantly to draw his rein and come to a full stop  illustration the children on the battlefield  there in the open field were two children the one a boy of six or seven years old the other a little flaxenhaired blueeyed girl of five they were quietly picking flowers  what are you doing here percy asked in astonishment  he spoke in french and receiving no answer repeated the question in german  what are you doing here  if you please sir the boy answered i have been out in the wood with lizzie to pick flowers and when i came back there was a great fire in the house and a great noise all round and i couldnt find father and mother and so we came out to look for them  percy did not know what to do it was too pitiful to leave the poor little creatures where they were and yet he could not carry them away he had no doubt that their parents were hid in the woods  look here he said if i take lizzie upon my horse will you run along after me  no no the little girl said vehemently  there was no time for parley  look here do you see those soldiers lying down in a ditch percy asked pointing to a line of mobiles not fifty yards in front  the children nodded  now look here the best thing you can possibly do is to play at being soldiers it is capital fun you lie down quite flat in that ditch and throw little stones over the bank dont you go away dont get up whatever you do and if you are good children and play nicely i will send father and mother to you if i can find them if they dont come you go on playing at soldiers till all this noise stops and then when it is quite quiet you go home and wait there till father and mother come back  the children were delighted with the idea and threw themselves flat in the bottom of the ditch and percy went on again at full gallop the french were now being driven back towards the point where the valley narrowed again and many of the mobiles were in full flight general cambriels therefore withdrew his artillery to a point where they could cover the movements and then ordered a rapid retreatten regiments of line and the zouaves acting as rear guard  it was already getting dark and the movements were carried out with but slight loss the germans contented with their success attempted no movement in pursuit    chapter 12 the surprise   after the check in the vosges general cambriels found it impossible to restore sufficient order among the mobiles to enable him to show face again to the enemy he was besides in want of many articles of urgent necessity half his force were shoeless and the thin blouses which wereas has been saidall the covering that many of the mobiles had were ill calculated to resist the bitter cold which was already setting in ammunition too as well as food was short  the general determined therefore upon falling back upon besancon and reorganizing his forces there a wound in his head too which was insufficiently healed when he took the command had now broken out again and his surgeon ordered absolute repose for a while  upon the day of the fight ralph had ridden slowly to the rear when he saw that the fight was going against the french hardened as he was by his work and with an excellent constitution his wound never for a moment assumed a troublesome aspect but at the end of a week he was ablekeeping it of course in a slingto mount his horse and report himself ready for duty the headquarters were now at besancon and ralph could had he applied for it have obtained leave to go to dijon but he had not done so as he had been so lately at home and he thought that the sight of his arm in a sling would be likely to make his mother more nervous and anxious on their account than before  the germans were still at some distance from besancon being watched by colonel tempe and his franc tireurs and by the irregular forces a considerable army was now fast gathering at besancon and the regimental and superior staff officers were hard at work at the organization as aidesdecamp the boys had little to do and therefore requested leave for two or three days to go up to their old friends the franc tireurs of dijon the general at once granted the required permission adding with a smile  dont forget you are officers now lads and get into any harebrained adventures you know and be sure you are back on thursday as i expect general michelmy successorto arrive on friday and i shall have to give you as part of my belongings  we are sure to be back general  and so they set off taking as usual tim doyle with them as orderly and servant  faith and i am glad enough to be out in the open again mister ralph tim said as they left besancon behind after living out in the woods for six weeks there does not seem room to breathe in a crowded town  its jolly to be out again tim but i dont know that i mind a town again for a few days  ah its all very well for the likes of yees mister ralphwith your officers uniform and your arm in a sling and the girls all looking at you as a herobut for me its different entirely out in the open i feel thatexcept when theres anything to do for your honorsi am my own master and can plase myself here in the town i am a common hussar and my arm is just weary with saluting to all the fellows with a sword by their side that i meet in the street  then theres no chance of any fighting as long as were shut up in the walls of a town and whats the use of being decked up in uniform except to fight is there any chance of just the least scrimmage in the world while we are back again with the boys he asked persuasively  the boys laughed  not much tim but we shall be pretty close to the enemy and something may turn up at any moment but surely youve had enough in the last six weeks  pretty well mister percypretty well but you see the last affair didnt count  oh didnt it count ralph said looking at his arm i think it counted for two or three fights and if you were not hit i am sure you were fired at often enough to satisfy the most desperate lover of fighting tim  i was fired at often enough i daresay mister ralph and i cant say that i liked it entirely it isnt so mighty pleasantsitting like a stiff statue behind the general with the shells falling about you like peas and not allowed the divarshin of a single shot back in return  shoot away says i as hard as you like but lets shoot back in return  the boys laughed and the day passed pleasantly as they rode and talked the dusk had already fallen when they reached a party of franc tireurs it was not their own corps nor could the officer in command tell exactly where they could find them  we are scattered over a considerable extent of country he said and the colonel alone could tell you how we are all placed i expect that he will be here tonight and your best plan will be to stay here till he comes we have not much to offer you but such as it is it is at your service  after a moments consultation the boys agreed to accept the offer as they had palpably more chance of meeting colonel tempe there than in a journey through the woods at night and in another ten minutes their horses were tied to trees and they were sitting by a blazing fire with the officers of franc tireurs the village consisted of only three or four houses and as there were fifty men in the party upon which they had come they bivouacked under the trees hard by  how far off are the germans ralph asked when dinner was over and they lay by the fire smoking cigars  ten miles or so the officer answered carelessly  no chance of their coming this way i hope ralph laughed we were very nearly caught near saverne once  so i heard the officer said but i am rather skeptical as to these night surprises in nine cases out of tenmind i dont mean for a moment that it was so in your casebut in nine cases out of ten these rumors of night attacks are all moonshine  perhaps so ralph said a little gravelyfor he had already noticed that the discipline was very different among these men than that to which he had been accustomed among the franc tireurs of dijon perhaps so but we can hardly be too careful  how do you all like colonel tempe  the colonel would be an excellent fellow were he not our colonel the officer laughed he is a most unconscionable man for ever marching and drilling and disciplining if he had his way he would make us like a regiment of line as if there could be any good in carrying out all that sort of thing with franc tireurs he had about half of us together for three or four days and i give you my word it was as bad as slavery drill drill drill from morning till night i was heartily glad i can tell you when i got away with this detachment  ralph saw that his new acquaintance was one of that innumerable class who conceived that drill and discipline were absurdities and that it was only necessary for a frenchman to shoulder a gun for him to be a soldier so he easily avoided argument by turning the subject for a couple of hours they chatted and then as the fire was burning low and the men had already laid down to sleep ralph suggested that they should do the same  i will walk round the sentries first with you if you like he said  sentries the other said with a laugh there is my sentry and he pointed to a man standing ten paces off leaning against a tree the men have marched all daythey only came in an hour before you didand i am not going to waste their strength by putting half of them out to watch the forest  no no i am no advocate for harassing my men  good night then ralph said briefly and he wrapped himself in his cloak and lay down  we are not accustomed to this sort of thing percy he whispered to his brother in english and i dont like it no wonder our franc tireurs do so badly if this is a sample of their discipline  i dont like it either ralph the prussians are advancing and if that fellow last heard of them as ten miles off they are as likely as not to be only two i shant be sorry when morning comes  nor i either percy however here we are and we have no authority over this fellow so we must make the best of it and hope thatfor oncefolly will not have its just reward  so saying the boys remained silent for the night but although silent neither of them slept muchralph especially whose arm was still very sore and at times painful hardly closed his eyes he told himself it was absurd but he could not help listening with painful attention  had the night been a quiet one he need not have strained his ears for as he knew from the many hours he had passed at night upon guard the hush is so intensein these great foreststhat one can hear the fall of a mountain stream miles away and the snapping of a twig or almost the falling of a leaf will catch the ear the night however was windy and the rustle of the pine forest would have deadened all sound except anything sharp and near  the sentry did not appear similarly impressed with the necessity for any extraordinary attention he was principally occupied in struggling against cold and drowsiness he walked up and down he stamped his foot hummed snatches of songs yawned with great vigor and so managed to keep awake for two hours when he roused the next for duty and lay down with a grunt of relief  at last after keeping awake for hours ralph dozed off how long he slept he knew not but he was roused into full wakefulness by a touch on the shoulder and by hearing tim doyle whisper  hist mister ralph ive my doubts that there is something wrong i couldnt sleep in this camp without watch or outposts and for the last quarter of an hour i fancy ive been hearing noises i dont know which way they are coming but it seems to me they are all round us i may be wrong sir but as sure as the piper  hush tim ralph said to the irishman who had crawled noiselessly along and had lain down by his side  percy are you awake  yes i woke at tims whisper listen  they did listen and distinctly above the sighing of the wind they could hear a rustling cracking noise day was just breaking but the light was not sufficiently strong to show objects with any distinctness among the trees  by jove we are surrounded percy said and was just going to alarm the camp when the sentry startled into wakefulness challenged and fired  the franc tireurs woke and leaped to their feet percy and tim were about to do the same when ralph held them down  lie still he said for your lives  his words were not out of his lips when a tremendous volley rang out all round them and half the franc tireurs fell  now ralph said leaping up make a rush for a house  to the houses all of you he shouted loudly it is our only chance we shall be shot down here like sheep  the officer of the franc tireurs had already atoned for his carelessness by his life and the men obeyed ralphs call and amidst a heavy fire rushed across the fifty yards of open space to the houses the door was burst in with the rush  ralph had not stopped at the first house but followed by his brother and tim doyle had run farther on and entered the last house in the village  why did you not go in with the others ralph we have no chance of defending ourselves here we have only our revolvers  we have no chance of defending ourselves anywhere percy ralph said there must be a couple of hundred of them at least and not above fifteen or twenty at most of the franc tireurs gained the houses resistance is utterly useless and yet had i been with those poor fellows i could not have told them to surrender when they would probably be shot five minutes afterwards we should be simply throwing away our lives without doing the least good  there was a heavy firing now heard and a moment after half a dozen shots were fired through the window then there was a rush of soldiers towards the door which ralph had purposely left open  we surrender ralph shouted in german coming forward to meet them we are french officers  dont fire a voice said and then a young officer came forward  you are not franc tireurs he asked for the light was still insufficient to enable him to distinguish uniforms  we are officers of the army upon general cambriels staff this man is an orderly  here are our swords we surrender as prisoners of war  the german officer bowed  keep your swords for the present gentlemen i am not in command  at this moment another officer came up  who have we here von hersen why do you make prisoners  they are two staff officers major  hem said the major doubtfully  well if you are an officer he continued order your men to cease their resistance  the franc tireurs most of whom had taken refuge in the same cottage were still defending themselves desperately and were keeping up a heavy fire from the windows  i will order them to surrender at once ralph said quietly if you give me your word that they shall be treated as prisoners of war  i will do nothing of the sort sir the german answered  then i shall certainly not advise them to surrender ralph said firmly i have no authority whatever over them but if i give advice it would be that they should sell their lives as dearly as possible  the officer swore a deep german oath and strode off for five more minutes the fight continued round the cottage many of the germans falling then a rush was made there was a fierce contest inside the houseshouts shrieks cries for mercyand then all was still  the young barclays and tim were now told to sit down near a tree at a short distance off with two sentries with loaded rifles standing over them the german soldiers took from the houses what few articles they fancied and then set fire to them sitting down and eating their breakfast as the flames shot up at a short distance from where the barclays were sitting was a group of some eight or ten franc tireurs and six or seven peasants guarded by some soldiers  near them the german major and two lieutenants were talking one of the young men appeared to take little interest in the conversation but the other was evidently urging some point with great earnestness and the major was equally plainly refusing his request for he stamped his foot angrily and shook his head  what a type that major is of the brutal species of german ralph said one used to meet them sometimes their officers are either particularly nice fellows mere machines or great brutes apparently we have a specimen of each of them here  the officers passed near enough for the barclays to catch what they were saying  the young lieutenant was very pale  for the last time major i implore you  for the last time lieutenant von hersen the major said brutally i order you to do your duty and by heavens if you speak another word i will put you in arrest  the young lieutenant turned silently away called up twenty men and ordered them to place the franc tireurs and the peasants against a wall  this is horrible ralph percy said that scoundrel is going to shoot them in cold blood  i protest against this execution ralph said in a loud tone advancing towards the major as a coldblooded murder and a violation of all the rights of war  hold your tongue sir the german major said turning to him furiously or by heavens i will put you up there too  you dare not ralph said firmly outrage as you do every law of civilization and humanity you dare not shoot an officer of the army in cold blood  the major turned black with passion  by heavens he exclaimed  but the officer who had nothithertointerposed threw himself before him  pardon me major he said respectfully but the frenchman is right it would bring discredit upon the whole army to touch these prisoners of war  in the other matter i have nothing to say the order has been published that franc tireurs and peasants sheltering them shall be shot and it is not for me to discuss orders but to obey thembut this is a matter affecting all our honors  the major stood for a moment irresolute but he knew well that the german military authorities would punish probably with death the atrocity which he meditated and he said hoarsely to some of the men near  tie their arms behind their backs and take them farther into the wood  ralph his brother and tim doyle were hurried into the wood by their guards butstrict as is the discipline of the german armythey could see that they disapproved in the highest degree of the conduct of their commanding officer  they were still near enough to see what was passing in the village not a man of the franc tireurs begged his life but stood upright against the wall two of the peasants imitated their example as did a boy of not over thirteen years of age two other lads of the same age and a peasant fell on their knees and prayed piteously for life  the young officer turned round towards the major in one now mute appeal it was in vain  put your rifles within a foot of their heads the lieutenant said fire  when the smoke cleared away the soldiers were standing alone and the peasants and franc tireurs lay in a confused mass on the ground  the lieutenant walked up to the major with a steady step but with a face as pale as ashes  i have done my duty major kolbach your orders are obeyed  then without another word he drew out his revolver put it rapidly to his temple and blew out his brains an historical fact  brutal as major kolbach was he started back in horror as the young lieutenant fell dead at his feet while a cry of surprise and consternation broke from the men the major did not say a word but turned away and paced up and down with disturbed steps while the other lieutenant bent over the body of his comrade and seeing that he was dead in a hushed voice ordered the men who had run up to dig a grave under the trees and bring him there  when this was done he ordered the men to fall inplacing the barclays and tim in their midstand then went up to the major and saluted saying coldly that the men were ready to march the major nodded signed to the orderly who was holding his horse to approach vaulted into the saddle and rode along the road back toward the main body of the army the lieutenant gave the word and the column marched off leaving behind it the still smoking houses and the still warm bodies of some sixty men  there was a general gloom over the faces of the men and no one could suppose from their air that they were returning from a successful expedition in which they had annihilated a body of enemy fifty strong with the loss of only five or six of their own men discipline was however too strict for a word of blame or even of comment to be spoken and not a sound was heard but the heavy measured tramp as the troops marched back through the forests the major rode on moodily some forty or fifty yards ahead of the main body  they had not gone half a mile before there was a shot fired in the wood close to the road the major gave a start and nearly fell from his horse then recovered himself and turned to ride back to the column when there was another shot and he fell off his horse heavily to the ground  the column had instinctively halted and the lieutenant gave the word load  a shout of triumph was heard in the wood thirtyone and then all was still  thats the old fellow who saved my life ten days ago percy ralph said and by jove much obliged to him as i was then i do think that i am more grateful now  finding that the shots were not repeated some twenty or thirty skirmishers were sent into the woods but returned in ten minutes without finding any trace of the man who had shot the major  the lieutenant now took the command there was a continuation of the halt for ten minutes while the major was hastily buried by the roadside a rough cross being put up to mark the spot and a deep cross cut made in the two nearest trees so that even if the cross were overthrown the place of the burial might be found afterwards if necessary then the corps marched on again  the first use which the lieutenant made of his authorityeven before giving directions for the burialwas to order the cords of the prisoners to be cut then the corps continued its march and by the brightened faces of the men it could be seen easily enough how unpopular their late commander had been and that they cherished but slight animosity against the slayer in a short time they struck up one of their marching songs andprisoners as they werethe barclays could not but admire the steady martial bearing of the men as they strode along making the woods echo with the deep chorus  in three hours march they reached the village which the troops had left the evening before to surprise the franc tireurs having as ralph had learned from the lieutenant in command received information from a spy of their arrival at the village late at night and having started at once under his guidance  here a considerable german force was assembled the prisoners were not unkindly treated but tim doyle was of course separated from them some astonishment was expressed at their youth but it was assumed that they had been pupils at saint cyr or the polytechnic many of whom received commissions owing to the impossibility of finding officers for the immense new levies several of the officers came in to chat with them and as these had been also engaged in the fights ten days before there were many questions to ask upon either side  the boys learned that they would be sent on next day would be marched to luneville and sent thence by train  they are a fine set of fellows ralph said when their last visitor had left them good officers unquestionably and when they are nice capital fellows i cant make out why they should be so brutal as soldiers for they are undoubtedly a kindly race  no doubt percy said but he was thinking of other matters and not paying much attention to his brother  do you think we have any chance of making our escape ralph  oh we shall escape fast enough ralph answered confidently with our knowledge of german and looking so young there can be no great difficulty about it when we once get to the end of our journey but its no use our thinking about it at present we shall be a good deal too closely looked after i only hope they will send us to mayence or coblentz and not to one of the fortresses at the other end of germany  mind we must not give our parole  the next day when they were summoned to start they found that there were fifty or sixty other prisoners who had been brought in from other directions some belonged to line regiments but the greater portion by far were mobiles who in the retreat of general cambriels had been cut off or left behind and after hiding in the woods for some days were being gradually found and brought in the barclays were the only officers they therefore took their places at the head of the prisoners who formed four deepwith an escort of uhlansand set off on their march  it was four days march the weather was cold and clear and the barclays were but little fatigued when they marched into luneville the greater part of the prisoners were however in a pitiable condition some were so footsore that they could hardly put one foot before the other others tottered with fatigue and the men of the escort frequently used the flats of their swords to compel them to keep together as they marched through the streets of luneville the people in the streets uncovered and the women waved their hands to them and pressed forward and offered them fruit and bread in spite of the orders of the escort  they were taken straight to the railway station where they were put into a shed ralph and percy had gained the goodwill of the sergeant in command of the escort by the manner in which they had aided him by interpreting to the rest of the prisoners and by doing their best to cheer them up and take things smooth and they now asked him to request the officer in command at the railway station to allow them to walk about until the train started on parole the request wasupon the favorable report of the sergeantgranted at once and they were told that no train would go off until next morning and that they might sleep in the town if they chose  thanking the officer for the permission they went out of the station when a tall bigbearded german sergeant stopped before them  donner wetter he exclaimed so here you are again  the boys gave a little start for they recognized at once the sergeant who had so closely questioned them in the cabaret upon the night when they had carried off and hung the schoolmaster ralph saw at once the importance of conciliating the man as a report from him of the circumstances might render their position a most unpleasant one andeven in the event of nothing worse coming of itwould almost ensure their captivity in some prison upon the farther side of prussia instead of at one of the frontier fortresses  ah sergeant how are you he said gaily it is our fate you see to be made prisoners you were very nearly taking us and now here we are  a nice trick you played me the sergeant said surlily with your woodcutters and your lame brother and your sick sister and your cask of beer i got a nice reprimand over that affair  come sergeant ralph said laughing let bygones be bygones all is fair in war you know and we did not touch a single hair of any of your mens heads all we wanted was the schoolmaster it would not do you any good to talk about it now and it might do us harm its quite bad enough for us as it is  youre nice boys you are the sergeant said with his face relaxing into a smile to think of my being taken in by two lads like you well you did it wellmonstrously well i will sayfor you never flinched an eyelash  so you are officers after all i never suspected anything about it till three hours afterwards when we went to relieve the sentry and found him lying there tied up like a bundle we couldnt think even then what it meant for you had made no attack and it wasnt till morning that we found that the old schoolmaster had been fetched out of bed and carried off on the heads of twenty men  well it was well done and i bear you no malice  thats right sergeant now come and have a jug of beer with us you know we had one with you before dont you remember we drank to the health of king william if you like you shall return the pledge by drinking to napoleon  the sergeant laughed  ill do that he said you said if you remember when i proposed the king that you did not wish to hear of his death and i can say the same for your napoleon especially he added with a chuckle as hes our prisoner  the boys went into a cabaret near and drank a glass of beer with the sergeant and thensaying goodbye very heartilyleft him and went into the town well pleased to have got so well out of a scrape which might have been a very unpleasant one  they slept at a hotel and were down at the station at the appointed time it was a long journeythirtysix hoursto mayence but the boys were too pleasedwhen they saw the line that the train was followingto have cared had it been twice as far the difficulties of escape from the western fortresses would have been immense whereas at mayence they were comparatively close to the frontier at mayence too the position of the prisoners was comfortable they were allowed to live anywhere in the town and to take their meals when they chose they were obliged twice a day to answer at the muster roll and were not of course allowed to go outside the fortifications  the one drawback to the position of the french officers was the utterly insufficient sum which the prussian government allowed them for board and lodgingonly fortyfive francs a month that is to say fifteen pence a day it is needless to say that the officers who had nothing else to depend upon literally starved upon this pittance which was the more inexcusable that the french government allowed more than twice this sum to the german officers who were taken prisoners  upon this head however the boys had no discomfort they had plenty of money in their pockets for present uses and they knew that they could obtain further supplies by writing home via switzerland they were therefore unaffectedly glad when the train came to a stop at the station of mayence and the order was given for all to alight    chapter 13 the escape   the first thing that the barclays did after reporting themselves was to settle themselves in a lodgingno very easy thing to find for the town was crowded with troops and prisoners however as they were able to pay a higher sum than the great majority of french officers in their position they had no very great difficulty in finding a place to suit them the rooms were purposely taken in a large house with a staircase common to a number of families living on different floors so that anyone going in or out would be less likely to be noticed than in a smaller house they were also careful in choosing rooms so placed that they could go in and out of the door on to the staircase without being noticed by the people with whom they lodged  ralphs arm was now extremely painful the long march having inflamed the wound he had therefore on reporting himself begged that a surgeon might attend him and had also asked as a great favor that his servantthe hussar doylemight be allowed to remain with him stating that in that case he would pay for his lodgings and provide him with food as the prison in which the private soldiers were confined was at the time crowded the request was complied with  for the next week ralph suffered greatly with his arm and had to keep his room after that the inflammation subsided and in another fortnight he was able to dispense for the first time since he received his wound with a sling in the meantime he had made the acquaintance of the people with whom he lodged who were very kind to their wounded lodger and whose hearts he completely won by being able to chat to them in their native tongue like one of themselves the family consisted of a father who was away all day at the railway station where he was a clerk the mother a garrulous old woman and a daughter a pretty blueeyed girl of about ralphs age who assisted her mother to wait upon them she had a lover away as a soldier in the army besieging paris and the thought that he might be wounded or taken prisoner made her very pitiful to the young officers  ralph barclay hadfor some daysbeen intending to sound her as to her willingness to aid them when she herself began it one day she had cleared away their dinner and was standingas she often didtalking with them when she lowered her voice so as not to be overheard by her mother in the next room  i wonder you dont try to get away lots of french officers have done so  that is just what we are thinking of christine we have only been waiting till my arm was out of a sling and we want you to help us  how can i help you the girl asked  in the first place you can buy us clothes it would excite suspicion if we were to buy them ourselves percy and i were thinking of going as girlsnot pretty girls of course like you christinebut great rough peasant girls  christine laughed and colored  you would be too tall she said  we should be rather tall ralph said ruefully we have grown so horribly in the last few months still some women are as tall as we are  yes some women are christine said but men look after them and say what big gawky women and you dont want to be looked after if people did so they would see that you didnt walk one bit like a woman and that your shoulders were very wide and your arms very strong and  oh no it wouldnt do at all i must think it over  i suppose you want that great bluecoated bear to go and she nodded at tim doyle whonot being able to speak a word of her languagewas always indulging in the most absurd pantomime of love and devotion causing screams of laughter to the merry german girl  yes tim must go too christine  ha ha laughed the girl fancy him as a woman  what is she saying about me mister percy  she says you would make a very pretty woman tim  tare and ages mister percy tim said taking it quite seriously how could i do it at all id have to shave off all my beautiful beard and mustaches and even then i doubt if you would mistake me for a woman  the boys screamed with laughter and translated the irishmans speech to christine who laughed so that her mother came into the room  look here children she said smiling i dont want to know what you are talking about if anything of any sort happens i may be asked questions and i dont want to have to tell stories i cant help hearing if you leave the door open and laugh soindeed all the neighborhood might hear it so please shut the door in future  so saying she again went back to her work in the next room  goodbye im going too christine said i will think it over by tomorrow morning and tell you what you are to do  the next morning the boys were very anxious to hear christines proposals for although they had quite made up their minds to try their own plan if hers was not feasible still they felt that with her knowledge of the country she was likely at any rate to give them good advice  until she had cleared away breakfast christine said nothing then she took out her knitting and sat against the window  now she began i will tell you what i have thought of it would be easy enough if it was not for him hes so big and so red and he doesnt speak german  oh dear hes very tiresome and she shook her head at tim who smiled laid his hand on his breast and endeavored to look affecting  christine laughed  the only thing i can think of for him is that he shall go out as a jew peddler with one of their broad hats and a tray of little trinkets he might pass if none of the soldiers took it into their heads to buy  the proposition was translated to tim doyle  is it me your honorme tim doyle a good catholic and come of honest peoplethats to turn myself into a haythin jew the irishman burst out with great indignation it was bad enough that i should be made into a woman but a haythin jew i put it to your honors its nayther sinsible nor dacent  the boys went off in screams of laughter christine laughed for a moment too when they translated tims speech to her and then looked indignant that the proposition which had cost her so much thought should be so scornfully rejected  tim saw the look and at once went on persuasively  sure now darlint miss christine dont be angry wid me out of your bright blue eyes but is it raisonableis it natural to ask a christian man to make a haythin jew of himself would you like it yourself  when the boys could stop laughing they translated tims appeal  did you ever see such an absurd man she said laughing as if it could make any difference to his religion tell him i am a good catholic too but i should not mind dressing up as a jewess  sure thin darlint tim exclaimed when her speech was translated i will go as a jew directly if youll go with me and be my jewess  christine laughed blushed shook her head and said nonsense upon hearing tims proposition  but seriously christine ralph said the objection which you mention to the jew pedlars disguise is important full as the streets are of soldiers looking about he could hardly hope to go from here through the streets and out at the gate without someone asking him about the contents of his box  christine alloweda little pettishly at the failure of her planthat it certainly was likely  the real difficulty is to get outside the gate ralph said thoughtfully after that i should have no fear  what are you thinking of doing then christine asked  i was thinking of dressing percy and myself in the clothes of young peasants and putting tim into something of the same sort with a great bandage round his face then i should say that we were two lads from some place near the frontier who had come here to meet our uncle who had had his jaw shattered in battle that would explain tims not being able to talk at all and as to looks he is red enough for a german anywhere  yes christine said that would do very well but of course you would be liable to be asked for papers  of course ralph said but we must risk something  i have an idea christine said suddenly clapping her hands i have some cousins living at wiesbaden these are three boys and i am sure they would do anything for me i will go out to wiesbaden tomorrow and ask them to lend me their papers just for one day wiesbaden is not your way at all but for that very reason you would get out more easily there and be less likely to be suspected or followed you could cross the rhine somewhere near saint goar  i shall have to tell some sad stories to my cousins and coax them a great deal still i daresay i shall succeed and then you can go boldly across the bridge and into the railway station and take a ticket for wiesbaden you can have an envelope ready directed and put the papers into the post there  the very thing christine you are a darling ralph exclaimed catching her by the waist and kissing her before she had time to think of resistance  i shant do anything at all for you christine said laughing and blushing if you misbehave in that way  i couldnt help it christinenot even if your mother had been looking on  and now about our clothes  i couldnt buy them christine said i never could go into a shop and buy mens clothes  the thing was so evident that for a moment the boys looks fell then christine said coloring very much  there is a box in my room of karls things he is my cousin you know and he was working as a gardener here till he had to go out in the landwehrso of course he left his things here for us to take care of he is about your size i will take out one suitit wont hurt itand you can put it on and go out into the town and buy the things for all three of you  capital the boys exclaimed it couldnt be better  ten minutes afterwards ralph went down the stairs and out into the street dressed as a german laborer in his best suit he was a little uneasy at first but no one noticed him and he was soon in a shop haggling over the price of a peasants coatas if the matter of a thaler one way or other was a thing of vital importance to him he bought the three suits at three different shopsas he thought that it would look suspicious if he were to get them all at the sameand in an hour was back again an hour afterwards christine started for wiesbaden  the barclays had reason to congratulate themselves that they had not longer deferred their preparations for escape for when presenting themselves as usual that afternoon at the roll call they were told that they must hold themselves in readiness to leave for one of the eastern fortresses upon the following evening as another large batch of prisoners from metz was expected to arrive upon the following day  in the evening christine returned from wiesbaden which is distant only a quarter of an hour by rail from mayence  i have got them she said but if you only knew the trouble i have had what a bother boys are to be sure  especially cousinseh christine  especially cousins christine said demurely  after thanking her very warmly for her kindness the barclays started out and bought a variety of things which they thought might be useful they also bought a pretty gold watch and chain to give to christine as a parting present  the next morning they answered as usual to their early roll call and then returning at once to their lodgings changed their clothes for those which ralph had purchased it was agreed that they should not say goodbye to christines mother in order that whatever she might suspect she might be able to say that she knew nothing of any idea on the part of her lodgers to make their escape then christine herself came in to say goodbye and went half wild with delight at the present then she said goodbye kissed the boyswithout any affectation of objecting to itand then went to a window to watch if they went safely down the street  the boys had no uneasiness whatever upon their own accountfor they had before passed so easily among the prussian troops that they felt quite confident in their disguisebut they were uncomfortable as to tim whose inability to answer questions would have at once betrayed them had anyone addressed him they had not ventured to bandage up his face as if wounded as he would have naturally in that case had a military pass as the best thing they could think of they had shoved a large lump of cotton into one of his cheekswhich gave him the appearance of having a swelled faceand had instructed him to frequently put his hand up to it as if in great pain tim had plenty of shrewdness and acted his part admirably  they passed across the bridge of boats without question and into the railway station which is just opposite its end here soldiers and other officials swarmed but the three walked along carelessly the two boys chatting together in german tim walking with his hand up to his face and giving an occasional stamp of pain he sat down with percy on a seat in the station while ralph went to the little window where tickets were being delivered there were a good many people waiting and when it came to ralphs turn and he put the papers in at the window and asked for three thirdclass tickets to wiesbaden the clerk scarcely glanced at them but handed the tickets over without a question  they then went into the thirdclass waiting room and sat down there were a good many peasants and others there and when the doors opened for them to go on to the platform and enter the carriages they saw it was hopeless to try and get a carriage to themselves they did therefore the best they could putting tim next to the window while percy sat next to and ralph opposite to him the rest of the compartment was filled with country people  he seems in great pain a goodnatured peasant woman said to ralph as tim rocked himself backwards and forwards in his anguish  yes he is very bad ralph said  toothache asked the woman  worse than that ralph said gravely an abscess in the jaw he has just been to the hospital  poor fellow the woman said why does he not poultice it  i should advise you to poultice she said addressing tim  tim gave a gruntwhich might have meant anythingand ralph said in a whisper  dont talk to him poor uncle he is so bad tempered now it puts him in a rage if anyone speaks to him because it hurts him so to answer at ordinary times he is very good tempered but now oh and ralph made a little pantomime to express the extreme badness of tims temper  you are not of wiesbaden are you the woman asked i do not know you by sight  no ralph said we are from holzhausen a village some eight miles upon the other side of wiesbaden  ah the woman said i have a sister living there surely you must know her she is the wife of klopstock the carpenter  surely ralph said she is my neighbor everyone knows her she is very like you  well now you are the first person who has ever said that the woman said surprised i am so short and she is so tall  yes she is tallvery tall ralph said very gravely but there is something about the expression of your eyes which reminds me of mrs klopstock  yes the more i look at you the more i see it and ralph looked so earnestly at the woman that percy had the greatest difficulty in preventing himself going off into a shout of laughter  i wonder i have never seen you at holzhausen ralph continued  well the woman said it is years since i have been there you see it is a long way and my sister often comes into wiesbaden and i see her but in truth her husband and i dont get on very well together you know his temper is and she lifted up her hands  yes indeed ralph said his temper is as you say terrible between ourselves it is so well known that we have a saying as bad tempered as klopstock the carpenter one cant say more than that  but we are at wiesbaden good morning  good morning i hope your uncles tooth will be better ere long  i hope so indeed for all our sakes ralph said he is as bad as klopstock at present  so saying they got out of the train and walked into the town when they had separated from the crowd percy could restrain himself no longer and went off into a scream of laughter  what is it mister percy tim asked opening his lips for the first time since they had left the house  oh tim if you had but heard percy said when he recovered his voice do you know you are as bad tempered as klopstock the carpenter  sure i never heard tell of him mister percy and if i have been bad tempered i havent said much about it and if the carpenter had a wad of cotton as big as a cricket ball in one cheek as i have its small blame to him if he was out of temper  both the boys laughed this time and then ralph explained the whole matter to tim who laughed more heartily than either of them  which way shall we go ralph  i looked at the map the last thing before starting percy and i noticed that the road went out past the gambling place i dare not take out the map again to look at the plan of the townit would look too suspiciousso let us wander about till we find the place it has large grounds so we cannot miss it  they were not long in finding the place they were looking for there was no mistaking it with its long arcades leading up to the handsome conversation rooms its piece of water and its beautifully laidout grounds  i should like to go in and have a look at it percy said i can hear the band playing now  so should i ralph said but time is too precious they will find out at the muster this afternoon that we are missing and as we answered this morning they will know that we cannot have got far we had better put as many miles between us as we can  first of all though let us put those papers christine got us into the envelope and drop them into that post box we should not do badly either to buy three darkcolored blankets before we start it is terribly cold and we shall want them at night  they therefore turned up into the town again and then ralph separated from the others and went in and bought the blankets ten minutes later they were walking along at a steady pace from the town each carried a stick the boys carried theirs upon their shoulder with a bundle containing a change of clothes and other articles slung upon it tim carried his bundle in one hand and walked using his stick in the other when a short distance out of the town they stopped in a retired place and put some strips of plaster upon tims cheeks and wrapped up his face with a white bandage it was as he said mighty uncomfortable but as he was now able to dispense with the ball of cotton in his mouth he did not so much mind it  the day was bitterly cold for it was now the beginning of the second week of november but the party strode on full of the consciousness of freedom they met but few people upon their way and merely exchanged a brief good day with those they did meet they had brought some bread and cold meat with them from mayence and therefore had no need to go into any shops at the villages they passed  they did not dare to sleep in a house as it was certain that some official would inquire for their papers and therefore when it became dark they turned off from the road and made for a wood at a short distance from it here they ate their supper laid a blanket on the ground put the bundles down for pillows and lay down close together putting the other two blankets over them  its mighty cold tim said but we might be worse  its better than a prison in pomerania by a long way ralph answered by the look of the sky and the dropping of the wind i think we shall have snow before morning  at daybreak next morning they were up but it was some little time before they could start so stiffened were their limbs with the cold ralphs prognostication as to the weather had turned out right and a white coating of snow lay over the country they now set off and walked for an hour when they arrived at a large village here it was agreed they should go in and buy something to eat they entered the ale house and called for bread cheese and beer  the landlord brought it and as they expected entered into conversation with them after the first remarkson the sharpness of the weatherralph produced a tin of portable soup and asked the landlord if he would have it heated for their uncle  he cannot as you see eat solid food ralph said he had his jaw broken by a shell at woerth  poor fellow the landlord said hastening away with the soup  are you going far he asked on his return  to saint goar ralph said  but why does he walk the landlord asked he could have been sent home by train  of course he could ralph said we walked over to see him and intended to have walked back again but when the time came for us to start he said he would come too the surgeon said he was not fit to go uncle had made up his mind to be off and as the surgeon would not give him an order he started to walk he says it does not hurt him so much as the jolting of the train and we shall be home to breakfast  an hour later they arrived at saint goarshaus they were now quite out of the track which prisoners escaping from mayence would be likely to take and had not the slightest difficulty in getting a boat to cross the rhine  how beautiful the river is here percy said  yes it is indeed ralph answered i believe that this is considered one of the most lovely spots on the whole river i cant say that i think that that railway opposite improves it  they landed at saint goar and tramped gaily on to castellan and slept in a barn near that village  the next morning they were off before daybreak and eight miles farther crossed the moselle at zell they left the road before they arrived at alf for they were now approaching the great road between coblentz and the south and might come upon bodies of troops upon the march or halting and might be asked troublesome questions they therefore struck upon a country lane and keeping among the hills crossed the main road between bertrich and wittlech and slept in a copse near dudeldf they had walked fiveandthirty miles and were so dead beat that even the cold did not keep them awake  next morning they got a fresh supply of bread and cheese at a tiny village between dudeldf and bittburg and leaving the latter place to the left made straight for the frontier across the hills the road to the frontier ran through bittburg but they were afraid of keeping to it as there were sure to be troops at the frontier several times they lost their way but the pocket compass and map which they had brought with them stood them in good stead and late in the evening they arrived at the stream which forms the frontier it was fortunately very low for the cold had frozen up its sources they had therefore little difficulty in crossing and tired as they were gave a cheer upon finding themselves in luxembourg  they tramped along merrily until they came to a cottage where they boldly entered and were received with the greatest kindness and hospitality the luxembourg people at once feared and hated prussia and were delighted to do anything in their power for the escaped prisoners the peasant made a blazing fire and some hot coffee and the tired travelers felt what a blessing it was to sit down without listening every moment for the step of an enemy  the peasants told them however that they were not yet altogether safe for that owing to the complaints of prussia both the dutch and belgian governments were arresting and detaining escaped prisoners passing through their territories after some discussion the boys agreed that next morning they should dress themselves in the change of clothes they had broughtwhich were ordinary shooting suitsand should leave their other clothes behind and then walk as far as spa twenty miles to the north they would excite no suspicion in the minds of anyone who saw them arrive as they would merely be taken for three englishmen staying at one of the numerous hotels there returning from a walk their feet however were so much swollen the next morning that they were glad to remain another day quiet in the cottage and the following day they started and walked gaily into spa  after strolling about the place some time they went to the railway station at the time the evening train started for brussels asked for ticketsin very english frenchand at eleven oclock at night entered brussels here their troubles were over a good nights rest in a good hotel completely set them up again and the next morning they left by train for dunkirk  there they reported themselves to the french officer in command and received permission to go on board a government steamer which was to leave the next morning for cherbourg    chapter 14 a perilous expedition   upon the eleventh of november the boys arrived at tours they had started for that place as the national headquarters the moment they arrived at cherbourg at tours mens hopes were high for a week before aurelles de paladine had driven back von der tann and reoccupied orleans every hour fresh troops were arriving and passing forwards the town was literally thronged with soldiers of all sorts batteries of artillery regiments of cavalry squadrons of arab spahislooking strangely out of place in their white robes and unmoved countenance in this scene of european warfarefranc tireurs in every possible variety of absurd and unsuitable uniform  in all this din and confusion the young barclays felt quite bewildered the first thing was evidently to get new uniforms then to report themselves there was no difficulty about the former matter for every tailor in tours had for the time being turned military outfitter and by dint of offering to pay extra their uniforms were promised for the next morning that matter settled they determined to go at once to the prefecture and report themselves  as they turned out of the crowded rue royal they received two hearty slaps on the shoulder which almost knocked them down while a hearty voice exclaimed  my dear boys i am glad to see you  they looked round andto their astonishment and delightsaw colonel tempe for a minute or two the hand shakings and greetings were so hearty that no questions could be asked  i thought a german prison would not hold you long boys the colonel said i saw your father as i came through dijon and i said to him that i should be surprised if you did not turn up soon especially when i heard from him that you were at mayence only two days tramp from the frontier  but what are you doing here colonel  just at present i am working at headquarters between ourselves the army of the east is coming round to join aurelles our poor fellows were pretty nearly used up and i found that i could do little real good with the other corps so i gave up the command and was sent here to confer with gambetta and he has kept me  now what are you going to do  we were going to report ourselves colonel  no use going todaytoo late come and dine with me at the bordeaux have you got rooms  not yet colonel  then i can tell you you wont get them at all the place is crowdednot a bed to be had for love or money ive got rooms by the greatest good luck one of you can have the sofa the other an armchair or the hearth rug whichever suits you best  thank you very much we shall do capitally the boys said  and now have you any news from paris  we have no late news from paris but worse still the news gets very slowly and irregularly into paris the pigeons seem to get bewildered with the snow or else the prussians shoot them  but surely with such an immense circle to guard there could be no great difficulty in a messenger finding his way in  there is a difficulty and a very great one colonel tempe said for of all who have tried only one or two have succeeded now come along or we shall be late for dinner  it was a curious medley at the table dhote at the hotel de bordeaux generals with their breasts covered with orders and simple franc tireurs officers of every arm of the service ministers and members of the late corps legislatif an american gentleman with his family english newspaper correspondents army contractors and families refugees from paris after dinner they went to a cafeliterally crowded with officersand thence to colonel tempes rooms where they sat down quietly to chat over what had taken place since the last visit  but where is your irishman your father told me he was with you i suppose you could not get him out  oh yes tims here ralph said laughing but he ran across a couple of irishmen belonging to the foreign legion andas he would have been in our way and we did not know where we were going to sleepwe gave him leave till tomorrow morning when he is to meet us in front of the railway station  by the way boys i suppose you know you have each got a step  no the boys cried really  yes really the colonel said that good fellow cambriels sent in a strong report in your favor upon resigning his command rehearsing what you did with us and requesting that the step might be at once given to you as a matter of course it was in the next gazette  of course we feel pleased colonel but it seems absurd so young as we are why if we go on like this in another six months we may be majors  in ordinary times it would be absurd lads and it would not be possible for you to hold the grade you do nowstill less higher onesunless you understood thoroughly your duty at the present moment everything is exceptional a man who perhaps only served a few months in the army years ago is made a general and sent to organize a camp of new levies of course he could not command these troops in the field could not even drill them on the parade ground but that is of no matter he has a talent for organization and therefore is selected to organize the camp and to enable him to do so efficiently he receives the nominal rank of general  in ordinary times a man could not get promotedthree or even four times in as many weeksover the heads of hundreds of others without causing an immense amount of jealousy without in fact upsetting the whole traditions of the army  now it is altogether different the officers of the regular army are almost all prisoners everyone is new everyone is unaccustomed to his work and men who show themselves to be good men can be rewarded and promoted with exceptional rapidity without exciting any feeling of jealousy whatever besides which the whole thing is provisional when the war is over everyone will either go back into private life or if they continue to serve will be gazetted into the regular army according to some scale or other to be hereafter determined upon some inconveniences no doubt will arise but they will hardly be serious  i was offered a generals rank a month ago but i declined it as it would have entailed either my undertaking duties for which i am unfit or setting to to organize young levies and giving up active service  no if you go on as you have hitherto done boys you may be colonels in another six months for when a name is recommended for promotion for good service by a general you may well suppose there is no question asked as to his age of course no general would recommend you as captains to command companies in a regiment because you are altogether ignorant of a captains duty but you are quite capable of filling the duties of captain on the staff as those duties require only clear headedness pluck attention and common sense  what i should like to win even more than a companywere i in your placewould be a commanders cross in the legion of honor i had the cross years ago but i only had the commanders cross a fortnight ago for the bridge of vesouze  ah yes ralph said that would be worth winning but that is hopeless  colonel tempe was silent ralph and percy looked at him  you mean ralph said after a pause that there is a chance of our winning it  well boys colonel tempe said i dont know that i am right in leading you into danger but i do think that you might win it i was mentioning your names only yesterday to gambetta a dispatch had just come in from paris grumbling at receiving no news from the country and gambetta was lamenting over the impossibility of arranging for simultaneous movements owing to the breakdown of the pigeons and the failure of the messengers when i said  there were two young english fellows with us in the vosgesthey were on cambriels staff last and are now prisonerswho if they were here would i believe get in if anyone could they went down over and over again among the germans and i could lay any money that they would succeed  how did they get taken prisoners gambetta asked as sharp as a knife  by no fault of their own i answered they went out on leave to see me and slept with a party of franc tireurswhere they of course had no authority as to sentriesand the party was surprised at night and completely cut up they were taken prisoners but i do not expect that they will remain so for long  gambetta did not say anything then but when i left him an hour afterwards he remarked  if you hear of those young fellows you were speaking of having returned send them to me tempe  ralph looked at percy and checked the offer to go which he saw was on his brothers lips  i think it might be done colonel he said quietly but it is a serious matter and we will think it over before we give an opinion  ralph then changed the subject and they talked over the events which had happened in the vosges the strategy and maneuvers of general michel the arrival of garibaldi the doings of the franc tireurs etc  by the way the colonel said there was a telegram in this eveningjust as i left the officethat the germans occupied dijon yesterday  you dont say so the boys said jumping from their seats was there any fighting  yes some mobiles and franc tireurs made a very plucky defense outside the town owing to some gross mismanagement the great bulk of the troops had been withdrawn only the day before after two or three hours fighting our men fell back the prussians as usual shelled the town and the authorities surrendered  the fighting could not have been our side of the town ralph said thoughtfully  no just the other side colonel tempe said as my wife is still at home and our place is not many hundred yards from yours that was the first thing i thought of  i wonder if papa was in the fight percy said anxiously  i should think it probable boys that my old friend would have gone out but i do not think that you need be uneasy about it for from what the telegram said our loss was small the troops fell back into the town and retreated unmolested through it so your father would no doubt have changed his things in the town and have walked quietly back again  he had volunteered into the national guard when i came last through dijon and was hard at work drilling them of course he had his old rank of captain  at ten oclock the boys said that they would go for a stroll before lying down for the night they were out upwards of an hour and returned at the end of that time with serious but resolved faces the colonel was out when they returned and found them stretched on the sofa and hearth rug when he came in they gave him a sleepy good night and no other word was exchanged  in the morning they were up at eight oclock colonel tempe was already dressed and they went out together to get their coffee and milk as they were taking it ralph told him that they had made up their minds to make the attempt to enter paris with dispatches but that they saw but one way to do so and that unless they could be furnished with the necessary papers they should abandon all idea of the enterprise  ten minutes later they entered the prefecture colonel tempe went in at once to see gambetta while the boys remained in the anteroom in ten minutes their friend came out again and beckoned to them to come into the next room  these are the lieutenants barclay he said  the boys bowed and examined with attentive curiosity the man who was at that time the absolute ruler of france a dark man with a short black beard keen eyes and a look of self reliance and energy a man who committed endless mistakes but who was the life and soul of the french resistance a man to whomhad he lived in olden timesthe romans would have erected a statue because in her deepest misfortunes he never despaired of the republic  he looked keenly at the young men  colonel tempe tells me that you have rendered very great service by going among the enemy in disguise and that you are willing to make an attempt to carry dispatches into paris  we are ready to try ralph said respectfully but after talking it over in every way we can see but one disguise which would enable us to penetrate the enemys lines near enough to the ground between the two armies to render an attempt possible and even that disguise will be useless unless we can procure certain papers  what is your plan monsieur gambetta asked  we intend to go as german jews ralph said the prussians strip all the clocks pictures and furniture of any value from the villas they occupy and send them back to germany there are a number of jews who follow the army and either buy these stolen goods from them or undertake to convey them back to germany at a certain price several of these jewswith their wagons full of clocks and other articleshave been captured by our franc tireurs or troops and no doubt papers of some kind have been found upon them these papers would naturally be sent here if we could be provided with them we could i have little doubt penetrate their lines  an excellent idea the minister said i have no doubt that we have such papers  and he struck a small hand bell on the table an attendant entered  tell captain verre i wish to speak to him  captain verre he said when that officer entered there were some papers came last week from general faidherbe relative to those wagonsladen with clocks ladies dresses and so onthat were captured near mezieres just look through them and see if there were any german permits for the bearers to pass freely for the purpose of trading if so let me have them at once  the officer at once left the room  supposingas i have no doubtthat we can give you the papers what is your course  speed is naturally an essential ralph said we shall disguise ourselves at once and upon receipt of the dispatches start from here to orleans by train with two good horseswhich can of course be furnished us we shall ride through the forest of orleans and so to montargis cross the loing there and make straight for melunkeeping always through bylanes as far as we know there are no large bodies of the enemy along that line  when we get near the town we shall leave our horses with some village maire or give them to a farmer and walk into the place boldly you will furnish us with a note to the maire of melun as well as a circular to all french authorities to give us any help and we shall get him to assist us at once to buy a wagon and two strong horses with these we shall drive round direct to versailles our pass will admit us into the town without difficulty and then we shall naturally be guided by circumstances we must be furnished with a considerable sum of money to make purchases of plunder  an admirable plan said the minister warmly and one that deserveseven should it not obtainsuccess  i need not speak to you of reward because as gentlemen i know that you make the attempt from the love of honor colonel tempe has before spoken to me of you and you were highly commended by general cambriels your names will therefore be in the next gazette for the cross of the legion of honor and if you succeed you will come back captains and commanders of the legion i may mentionalthough i know that it will not add to your motive to succeedthat you will be entitled to the reward of fifty thousand francs which has been offered to anyone who will carry in dispatches to paris  at this moment the officer entered  here are the papers the jews with the captured wagons carried he said they are signed by the general at frankfort and countersigned by at least a dozen military authorities there are three of them  the minister glanced at them  they will do well he said will you be ready to start tomorrow morning  quite ready ralph said  very well then if you will be here at halfpast five the dispatches will be ready written of course so as to fold up in the smallest possible compass  captain verre will you see that two of the best horses in my stable are put into boxes in the train that leaves at six tomorrow morning  the boys now rose to leave  good morning the minister said all the letters of recommendation the dispatches and the money will be ready when you come in the morning  the boys on going out held a long consultation over their disguises examining the papers they found that one was for two persons of the same nameisaac kraph and aaron kraphfather and son the father as described in the pass fortyfive years old the son eighteen this pass they determined to use  the task of changing percy into a jew boy of eighteen was evidently an easy one his clear complexion was the only difficulty and this could be readily disguised ralphs disguise was a more difficult one and there was a considerable debate as to whether he had better go as a red jew or a dark jew the latter was finally determined upon as otherwise the contrast between the supposed father and son would be too striking  they then went to their tailor and found their uniforms ready they at once put them on as the peculiarity of the purchases they intended to make was so great that had they been in their civilian dress it was certain that they would have been regarded with suspicion and would have perhaps had difficulty in obtaining what they wanted  their first visit was to a hairdressers shop rather to the astonishment of the proprietor they told him that they wished to speak to him in a private room and still more to his astonishment when the door was closed they told him that they wanted their hair dyed quite black the hairdresser could hardly believe his ears the boys had both brown wavy hairpercys being the lightestand that two young officers of the staff should at such a time desire to dye their hair struck the man almost dumb with astonishment  ralph smiled  no wonder you are surprised but we have an important mission to carry out and it is essential that we should be completely disguised we are going as spies into von der tanns camp this of course is in the strictest confidence  the hairdresser was at once struck with the importance of the occasion  you want an instantaneous dye he asked  certainly ralph said and one that will last at any rate for a week  there was no difficulty whatever in complying with the request and in ten minutes the boys heads were raven in their blackness  now ralph said i want my brothers hairwhich is fortunately very longto be completely frizzled and i want a pair of the tongs you do it with so as to be able to do it for ourselves  this also was easy enough  now ralph went on for myself i want my hair to be very long to come down over my ears on to my collar all the way round  but the only way to do that is to have a wig specially made for you  not at all ralph said i could not put on a wig even if you had one just as i want it ready the parting always shows if it is narrowly looked at i want some long flat bands of hair like those you use for chignons it must be black to match my hair as it is now but put a few streaks of gray into it i must have a band of this hair long enough to go round the head from just above one ear to just above the other if you part my hair just at the place where the band is to go brush the hair up put the band of artificial hair on with shoemakers wax or something else to hold tight then brush the hair back again over the band it would be absolutely impossible to see it was not all natural then cut the long hair so as to lie on my coat collar frizzle it and the natural hair and i will defy the keenesteyed prussian to see anything wrong about it  as soon as the hairdresser understood exactly what ralph wanted he entered heartily into his plans and several of the short flat bands of black hair used for chignons were sewn on to a band this was fastened on to ralphs head in the way he had suggested the long tresses were cut to the required length the tongs were used on them and on the natural hair and plenty of oil put on and in an hour his headdress was perfectan immense bush of frizzly hair the cloth was taken from round his neck and as he looked at himself in the glass he joined heartily in percys shout of laughter  but ralph how are you to go out in your uniform and that head of hair  dear me ralph said i had quite forgotten that go to the tailors percy and tell them to send the suit i changed there in here directly  percy went off for the clothes and ralph then went on  now i want a black or grayish beard whiskers and mustache  i have not got such a thing the hairdresser said but i know a man who keeps them i will get it for you in a quarter of an hour  in a few minutes percy returned with a boy with ralphs clothes in a short time they were ready to start  you do look a strange object ralph  never mind percy there are plenty of strange objects here no one will notice me  then saying that they would call in again in half an hour for the beard they went to a chemists from whomafter some talkthey obtained a mixture to give a slightly brown tinge to their faces  they now dived into the back streets of the town found a secondhand clothes shop and speedily got the articles they required ralph had a long greatcoat with a fur collar and a pair of high boots coming up to his knees and to be worn over the trousers a black fur cap completed his costume percy had a black cap made of rough cloth with a peak and with flaps to come down over the ears an old greatcoat with fur round the pockets and collar a brightcolored handkerchief to go two or three times round the neck and high boots like those of ralph  they then returned to the hairdresser and ralph insisted that the beard and mustache should be fastened on not only in the ordinary mannerwith springsbut with cobblers wax  my life he said might depend upon the things not slipping at any moment  they now went home the moment that they entered their rooms ralph exclaimed  why we have forgotten all about tim  so we have percy said he was to have met us in front of the railway station at nine oclock and of course he has no idea where to find us i will go there very likely the poor fellow is waiting still  percy hurried off and found tim as he had expected sitting upon the steps going up to the railway station he jumped up with a cry of joy upon seeing percy  the vargin be praised mister percy i began to think that you must have been sent off somewhere without time to warn me and i couldnt for the life of me make out what to do  we have not gone tim percy said not wishing to hurt the attached fellows feelings by telling him that he had been forgotten but we are starting tomorrow i will tell you all about it when we get in we have been to see monsieur gambetta this morning and do you know we met colonel tempe last night and are stopping in his rooms  so saying he walked along at a quick pace towards their lodgings tim occasionally glancing a puzzled look at him by the time they reached the room ralph had stained his face and hands and was busy dressing in his disguise his back was to the door when they entered but he had heard the irishmans voice on the stair  well tim how are you he said turning round  holy vargin ejaculated tim dropping into a chair and crossing himself with great fervor sure im bewitched heres an ould gentleman wid a wonderful head of hair has been staleing mister ralphs voice  the two boys went off in a shout of laughter at tims genuine terror  sure im bewitched entirely he went on he laughs for all the world like mister ralph did ye iver see the like  what is it all mister percy dear  percy had by this time taken off his cap and tim as he looked him fairly in the face gave another start  by the mother of moses he exclaimed in terror were all bewitched mister ralphs turned into an ould man with a furze bush of hair and mister percys beautiful hair has all turned black and shriveled itself up am i turning myself i wonder and he looked into the glass to see if any change had taken place in his own abundant crop of red hair  the boys were laughing so that they could not speak for some time and tim sat gazing at them in speechless bewilderment at last percy by a great effort recovered himself and explained to him the whole circumstances of the case the irishmans astonishment ceased now but his dismay was as great as ever  then is it alone youre going he said at last are you going into danger again without taking me with you youd never do that surely mister ralph  i am very sorry tim to be separated from you ralph said but it is quite impossible for you to go with us if you understood french and german as well as we do the case would be different but as it is the thing is absolutely impossible you know how great a trouble it was to disguise you before and it would treble our anxieties and difficulties not only that but even if in the face of every possible danger we got you into paris with us there would be great difficulty in getting you out gambetta will give orders for us to be allowed to come out in the first balloon but it is by no means easy to get places in balloons and it is unlikely in the extreme that we should be able to bring you out with us so there you would be shut up in paris and separated from us for months  no no tim the matter is altogether impossible you stay quietly here and in ten days or a fortnightif all goes wellwe shall be back again with you  and is it in a balloon youre thinking of coming out mister ralph flying like a bird through the air och wirra wirra ill never see yees again  nonsense tim theres no danger in a balloon if getting in were no more dangerous than getting out there would not be much peril in the matter  ah mister ralph dear how can you be risking your life and the life of your brother in that way shooting at a prussian or getting shot at is all well enough or going among them with your hair all puffed out and your face painted brown and the hair growing all over your face before its time i say nothing against but flying through the air in a balloon is just tempting the good providence i know what it will be youll be just touching against a cloud and tumbling out and breaking yourselves into smithereens and nothing to take home to your dear father and mother not to mention miss milly and tim fairly blubbered with grief at the thought  the boys had great difficulty in pacifying the attached fellow at last with a face expressive of mournful resignation he agreed to remain with colonel tempe until they returned or until their prolonged absence rendered it likely that they would not return at alltim evidently making up his mind that the latter contingency would happen in that case as timnow his corps had ceased to existneed no longer serve he expressed his determination to return to dijon and to stay with captain barclay until the end of the waras he should not he said have the heart to fight any more when his masters were both killed  while the conversation had been going on the boys had continued their toilettes the preparation which they had obtained gave them an olive complexion and their transformation was now so complete that the boys would have passed each other unknown even had they looked steadily at each other ralph especially was utterly unlike himself  they now told tim to go out and get his breakfast and to return in two hours time and then started themselves rounding their shoulders and so narrowing their chests as much as possible ralph stopped at an opticians bought a pair of slightlycolored spectacles and put them on  it was now twelve oclockthe preparations having taken them three hoursand they went to the cafe where they were to meet colonel tempe to breakfast he was already there and they walked up to the table where he was sitting  these seats are engaged colonel tempe said shortly  the barclays sat down at the next table and called in a foreign accent for two glasses of beer then they spoke together for some little time about a journey from saint malo which they had just made and ralph then turned to colonel tempe still speaking french with a strong foreign accent  pardon me colonel he said we have just arrived from england we have a very large quantity of army shoes and i should feel under a great obligation if you could inform me who is the proper person to whom to apply  colonel tempe at once informed them adding  if your shoes are good ones and the price fair and you can deliver them soon you will not have to wait long for they are greatly wanted  we have also some harness for artillery horses ralph added  i do not know about that the colonel said but you will obtain all information from the officer i have mentioned  thank you very much ralph said and returned to his seat  colonel tempe looked at his watch a little impatiently ralph after a minute or two again approached him  dont you think we may as well have breakfast colonel he said in his natural voice  the colonel looked at him in speechless surprise  so the disguises are pretty good ralph said smiling  impossible the colonel exclaimed do my eyes or my ears deceive me can it really be  its us sure enough colonel and now i suppose we may as well sit down  so saying the boys took their seats at the table but colonel tempe still looked from one to the other in astonishment  wonderful he at last said wonderful even now i know who it is i do not see the faintest possible resemblance  percy is of course less altered than you are ralph because he is still young looking but even now i should not recognize him as for you with that wonderful head of hair and that beard you look fifty and as unlike yourself as possible upon my word if it were anywhere else but here in tourswhere there are all sorts of odditiesi should be ashamed as a colonel in the army to sit down to table with you  you are a little ashamed as it is ralph laughed we had not intended to come out in our new character so soon but when my hair was once done you see it was impossible to go about in uniform  but what in the world have you done with your hair the colonel said examining him closely for ralph had taken off his fur cap and laid it beside him you have not got a wig on and yet all that frizzly bunch cannot be your own  ralph explained how it was managed and added  and now colonel that you have recovered from your surprise let us have breakfast  breakfast was ordered to which the boys did full justice but colonel tempe was still getting on but slowly for he could not take his eyes off ralphs face  will all that frizzle keep in he asked presently  yes the man said that the false hairwhich is the greater portion of itwill keep as well for a week and we have got a small curling iron so we can beautify ourselves up when we like  well boys i have no doubt now that you will be able to get as far as versailles as to getting through thats another matterbut if anyone can you will i am convinced  i have not much doubt about it colonel ralph said i seem to see my way quite clearly into paris much more clearly indeed than i do to getting out again  oh it does not matter about getting out again boys you can stop quietly in there until the end of the siege  that is just what we dont want to do percy said would you kindly ask them to put into the dispatches a request that we may be sent out again by the first balloon that comes we have no fancy either of us for eating rats and cats which i suppose is what it will come to before it is over  i will see to it boys the colonel said smiling but really i should advise your staying there you have done alland more thanyour share of work  the boys shook their heads and it was arranged that if they got in they should come out again in a balloon  the next morning the boys were up at halfpast four and at halfpast five were at the prefecture colonel tempe sent in his name to the minister and they were at once admitted gambetta was at his writing table  good morning colonel tempe he said cordially and then added in some surprise who are these men you have with you and where are your young englishmen i hope they will not be late  these are they the colonel said smiling  they are who gambetta said puzzled i do not understand you colonel  these are the lieutenants barclay colonel tempe said  the minister looked from the colonel to the two boys and back again  do you mean to say he began incredulously  yes sir it is us ralph said and i do not think there is much fear of our being recognized  so little that i do not recognize you now  there is no mistake colonel he said gravely no mystification you give me your pledge and assurance that these are the officers who have volunteered for this duty remember any mistake might be fatal  these are certainly the barclays sir i give you my word  it is a marvelous disguise gambetta said his doubts now laid at rest and does them immense credit  there are the dispatches gentlemen they are done up in these two quills and sealed they are of the utmost importance and must not at any hazard fall into the hands of the enemy the dispatches are in duplicate so that in case one only gets in the purpose is served  this is a circular letter to all maires and other french authorities ordering them to give you every possible assistance  this is a special note to the maire of melun  here is a letter to general aurelles at orleans if he is not in when you arrive the chief of his staff will do he is ordered to send a staff officer with you through the lines as far as you require him the horses are in the train  now goodbye i wish you a very good future for you are gallant young fellows  so saying he shook them warmly by the hand and they hurried off to the train    chapter 15 the expedition   a special telegram had been sent forward from tours to station master at orleans to request him to order the two horses sent forward in the train to be got out of their boxes without any loss of time and to do anything else which the owners of the horses required accordingly as the train was waiting outside the station the guard came round and asked at each carriage for the owners of the horses he appeared a little surprised when two jews answered the inquiry as he had expected that they were officers of high rank and importance  the compliments of the stationmaster he said and is there anything he can do with the horses  yes ralph said give my compliments to the station master and say that i shall be much obliged if he will get them out of the horse boxes without loss of time and send them on at once to the headquarters of general aurelles we will go on at once in a vehicle  five minutes afterwards the train drew up at the platform and the guard ran up  this way gentlemen a carriage is engaged  upon arriving at headquarters they found thatowing to the forethought of colonel tempethey were expected for upon sending in their names they were at once admitted although several officers of all grades were waiting in the anteroom  the colonel of the staff gave a movement of surprise  there is some mistake here he said to the orderly who had shown them in i ordered the lieutenants barclay to be admitted  these are the gentlemen who gave me the card colonel the orderly answered  it is so ralph said if you will favor us with a moment alone we will explain the matter to you  the colonel led the way into a small cabinet adjoining  we are bearers of dispatches for general trochu ralph said and have disguised ourselves to endeavor to pass through the german lines  oh is that it the colonel said i must really apologize but no one he said smiling could recognize you in that disguise to be french officers before we speak further i must ask you for some proof that you are what you state yourselves to be for at present i have only your cards  here is our letter from monsieur gambetta to general aurelles ralph said it is directed to be opened by you should he be absent  that is all right the colonel said when he had read it my surprise at your appearance was natural for the telegram we received this morning only said  the two lieutenants barclay will arrive by six oclock train their business is most important have a wellmounted officer of staff ready to accompany them through lines  i thought of course that you had orders to report on position of troops and felt i admit rather angry that gambetta should wish to send subaltern officers to inspect matters concerning which he has full reports  you wish of course to go on at once  our horses will be here in five minutes ralph said and we wish to get as far as possible tonight we mean to cross the loing at montargis and get as far as we can tonight so as to arrive either at meaux or melun tomorrow evening we should of course prefer melun as being much the shortest route towards versailles we shall of necessity be guided by the position of the germans  you have not breakfasted of course the colonel said i was just going to sit down when you came in for i go out to the front at ten and it is halfpast nine now you will have no chance of getting anything before you arrive at montargis  i can introduce you to the officer who will accompany you  the boys readily accepted the invitation and at once followed the colonel into another room where breakfast was laid and several officers of the staff were waiting for the arrival of the colonel to begin there was a general look of surprise when he entered with two strangelooking jews which was not a little increased when he said  gentlemen the lieutenants barclay you look surprised but your astonishment will cease when i tell you that they are upon an important mission and do not look like themselves and now to table for they have to start in ten minutes  captain duprat let me make you specially acquainted with these gentlemen they are bound for montargis and you will see them through our outposts  in another quarter of an hour the boys were issuing from the streets of orleans and were soon going along at a hand gallop by the road along the banks of the loire while to the north stretched the flat and denselywooded country known as the forest of orleans as far as chateauneuf they kept near the river here they halted half an hour to give breathing time to their horses then started again and rode fast to bellegarde here was the last post of regular troops but cathlineaus franc tireurs were scattered throughout the country as far as montargis and it would have been more difficult for the barclays to have passed through them than through the regular troops as they had less respect for passes  after another halt they again started and captain duprat accompanied them as far as montargis where there was a small body of franc tireurs captain duprats orders were to sleep at montargis and then return to chateauneuf the next day  the boys felt rather stiff and tired as they rode into montargis for they had not been on horseback since the day when they were taken prisoners in the vosges and they had ridden forty miles since breakfast they would however have willingly pushed on another twenty miles but their horses had even a longer days work before them on the morrow  being accompanied by a staff officer no questions whatever were asked them and after a good dinner at the hotel they went to the maire to inquire whether he could tell them as to the advanced posts of the germans this functionarylike such functionaries in generalcould give them but slight information but as far as he knew there were no german troops on the right bank of the loing south of its junction with the yonne beyond the yonne they were scattered pretty thickly everywhere  at daybreak the next morning they started captain duprat turned his horses head westward again while the barclays rode north their pace was rapid as they never drew rein except at villages to ask whether the prussians had been heard of they heard of parties at lorrez and cheroy but as they kept through bylanes and as the country was thickly wooded the risk wasat presentsmall they had with them an excellent map which enabled them to follow the smallest footpaths  at eleven oclock they stopped at the little hamlet of montarlet there they breakfasted and gave the horses an hours rest while they consulted with the maire he was a miller and turned out a shrewd fellow entering into the matter with great warmth he advised them to ford the yonne between montereau and its junction with the loing to keep to the woods for ten miles and then to turn to the left and to cross the seineat one of the numerous fords thereinto the forest of fontainebleau and they would then find themselves between that town and melun and could ride boldly into melun as if they had come from fontainebleau  i know every foot of the country he said and will guide you till you are safely across the seine if we should by any chance fall upon a patrol of the enemy it will be simple enough to say that i am a miller of montarlet and that you have shown me your permission to travel about through the german line and have asked me to guide you by the shortest way to melun  they had every reason to be thankful to their guide for they found that there were a great many scattered parties of uhlans about by dint of making detours through woods however they succeeded in striking the seine at fontaine le port without once meeting them  this village was however occupied by some halfdozen cavalry and it was impossible to pass the river unseen by them the barclays thanked very warmly their friend the maire and promised to mention his conduct upon their return to tours and then saying goodbye to him rode into the village alone the sergeant of uhlans came to the door of the principal cabaret and looked out  good day ralph said in german reining up his horse is it here that i cross the river for fontainebleau they told me at le chatelet that it was shorter than going round by the main road  yes you are right here the sergeant said have you passes  oh yes ralph said laughing it would have been no easy matter to get from frankfort here without them  so saying he pulled out the prussian permit  that is right the sergeant said your horses look very done  we have ridden from coulommiers through rozoy and normant  it would have been an easier road to have gone from normant through melun the sergeant said and he took out a map and examined it no i see le chatelet is a more direct line  we have time to wait an hour ralph said turning to percy and it will be better for our beasts see that they are rubbed down and fed  the sergeant gave a peremptory shout and the master of the wine shop ran out the sergeant pointed to the horses  do you speak french he asked ralph  no ralph said but my son does  aaron tell him to rub them down and feed them well and see to it yourself these dogs are capable of cheating even a horse  ralph then entered the cabaret and called for some bread and cheese and a bottle of the best wine with three glasses the prussian sergeant sat down with them and talked of germany for an hour then they started again crossed the river and an hour and a half later entered melun here as they came in by the road from fontainebleauwhich was held in force by the germansno question was asked  they rode their tired horses through the streets until they saw a quiet hotel riding into the yard they told the hostler to put up their horses and to clean and feed them well enforcing their request with a fivefranc piece they then entered the hotel and found that they could have beds as the number of german officers quartered upon this house was smaller than usual owing to the greater portion of the troops having been pushed on to reinforce von der tann  it was now halfpast five and was already dusk they therefore went at once to the maire to whom they presented gambettas letter and requested his assistance in purchasing a van with a pair of good strong horses at once  it will be next to impossible to get horses the maire said but i will do my best i have two carriage horses of good breed but i fear if i were to let you have them the prussians might remark it  we have two firstrate animals ralph said from gambettas own stables they have carried us a hundred miles since breakfast time yesterday they are likely to be at least as good as yours are only they want a few days rest will you exchange  certainly the maire said at once if any inquiries were to be made about it i need make no secret of that transaction  as for the covered cart i will send round at once to those of my neighbors who have one and as you are ready to pay for it and as the prussians are requisitioning them without payment you can rely upon having one tomorrow morning ready for your start i will send a note round to you tonight to tell you where it is at present  we had better go now to the german commandants office and get our passes countersigned when that is done we shall be all right for versailles  yes i should advise you to do that the maire said you will not have much difficulty they are civil enough about passes and matters of that kind will you mention you have seen me  not unless any question is asked about horses in which case we should of course mention thathearing you had a pair of horses and ours requiring restwe had changed with you  they now went boldly to the orderly room an officer was on duty  will you please to visa this for versailles ralph said in german  the officer took it glanced at it and at them  the last visa i see was at meaux a fortnight since  we have been traveling on horseback since ralph said and have had no occasion to have it visaed as it has always passed us without trouble as we are now going to versailles with a wagon we thought it better to have the pass visaed here  where have you come from now  from fontainebleau ralph said we have been down to pithiviers and i sent off four wagon loads of things from there for the frontier  your best way is through corbeil and longjumeau the officer said handing back the paper  thank you sir ralph replied that is the way we are intending to go  in the evening the maire himself came in to look at the horses and told them that he had obtained a good lightcovered wagon with springs which had been used for the removal of furniture the price was a thousand francs  if you like he said to come round with me now my servant shall take the horses round there put them in and bring the wagon here and he can then take your horses back with him to my stables  please to write me a papersigned by the name on your german passsaying that you have bought my horses of me and have sold me yours put down any figures you like as having passed between us you are upon a very perilous expedition and in case of anything happening to you it would be well for me that nothing beyond a mere business transaction could be traced between us  at seven oclock the next morning they started the distance was only thirty miles but the roads were terribly slippery from the deep snow now trampled flat by the immense traffic of the army it was five in the afternoon when they reached the first sentries at the entrance to versailles the pass was sufficient and they went on uninterrupted percy drove and ralph sat beside him  the town swarmed with officers and soldiers of all ranks no one paid them any attention and they drove through the place darmes and on to the marketplace where they knew there were many inns frequented by the market people hereas they expectedthey found it impossible to get a bed but they had no difficulty in obtaining permission for the wagon to stand in a yard and were lucky enough to get stable room for the horses they went into the town and bought four blankets and as at starting they had filled the wagon two feet deep with straw they hadin spite of the cold weatherevery hope of passing a comfortable night  dinner was the next thing and that over they strolled about until nine oclock it was a singular sight this army of invaders comfortably quartered in the ancient capital of france the palace the statues in front of it everything told of the glories of france every park around every little palace was infinitely associated with its sovereigns and here in the midst of these memorials the german invaders stalked carelessly drank in the cafes or feasted in the hotels as if the place had belonged to them from time immemorial afar off in the quiet of the evening could be heard the distant boom of the guns round the beleaguered city  there were several things which the barclays wanted to get but they had no difficulty with them as the shops were all open as usual the population had a depressed look all classes were suffering much with the exception of the shopkeepers whose business was as brisk as eversave only those tradesmen who dealt in articles of female attire for which there was no demand whatever the ladies of versailles went as little as possible into the streets and when they did so all dressed themselves in black or other somber colors  by nine oclock the shops were all closed and the barclays returned to their wagon with their purchases in their hands  its awfully cold ralph percy said as they rolled themselves in their blankets and covered themselves over with straw  it is percy but it will be a deal colder in the river  percy gave a shudder at the thought  dont you think ralph that there is any possibility of entering on either of the other sides  not the slightest percy it must be across the river or not at all the sentries will not be anything like so thick upon that side  had anyone looked into the wagon at eight oclock next morning he would have been surprised at the occupation upon which the boys were engaged each was sewing a piece of thin waterproof cloth upon a pair of white woolen gloves so that the fingers when outspread had the appearance of the webbed foot of a frog  that ought to help us ralph said when they finished for a really long swim i daresay they would be very fatiguing but it is cold not fatigue we have to fear and speed is therefore everything  at nine oclock ralph went to the office of the general in command there were a number of other persons waiting for permits and ralph waited his turn to go in to the officer engaged in signing them  i am from frankfort as my papers show he said handing the officer his pass i wish for a pass to go with my horse and cart to bellevue there are i hear many officers desirous of selling or sending home articles they have saved  saved it may be mentioned was the word employed in the german army for stolenwhich has an ugly sound  the officer signed the paper  you must not go by the sevres route he said you must turn off at viroflay and go by chaville  half an hour later they started in the wagon at the gates of versaillesa mile from the townthey were stopped by sentries but allowed to pass on production of the order with the necessary stamp  everything is going on well thus far ralph said as they turned off from the main road at viroflay it looks like snow too which would exactly suit us  viroflay was crowded with prussian troops an officer stopped them as they passed  where are you going to  we are going to bellevue ralph said we are purchasers of any curiosities or souvenirs of the warsuch as pictures or clocksand we also undertake to deliver in germany any article which may be entrusted to our charge we have our passes and papers in regular order  wait a minute the officer said draw up at that villa there  the wagon drew up to the villa the officer walking in front he motioned to ralph to dismount and to follow him into the house leaving percy in charge of the wagon five or six officers were sitting in what had been the drawing room of the villa  who have you got here one of them asked as ralphs conductor entered  a worthy hebrew the other laughed who will either purchase or carry home articles saved  there was a general movement of interest the furniture of the room was a wreck the papers were hanging in strips a broken chair was blazing upon the fire several family portraits on the wall were pierced with holes having evidently served the purpose of targets for pistol shooting  ralphs conductor left the room for a moment and returned with a very handsome drawing room clock worth ralph knew at least fifteen hundred francs  how much will you give for that  ralph examined it critically  four hundred francs he said  nonsense it cost five times that  about four times ralph said when it was new it is not new now and it has to be taken to germany if you prefer it i will carry it to frankfort and send it on thence by rail at ten percent upon its value  yes i will agree to that the officer said how much will that be  i am content to take it at your own valuation ralph said the value you set upon the clock was two thousand francs  there was a laugh among the other officers  he has you there major  not at all the officer said he shall take it at the valuation he placed upon itfour hundred francs  pardon me ralph said i did not value it at that sum i only offered to give that sum for it besides which that was an estimate of the value i set upon it at viroflay not the value i should set upon it at frankfort  i will say one thousand francs that is i will undertake it at a hundred if you will get it put into a case of some sort  the other officers now offered various objects either for sale or transportpictures vases clocks and even pianos ralph haggled over the price of each article in a way which would have done honor to his appearance at lasthaving arranged all their mattershe said that he was going on to bellevue but would call and complete the purchases and receive the goods entrusted to him either that night or the next morning  if any of you gentleman would kindly give me your card to give to the officer of the regiment at bellevue saying that you have found me fair in my dealing i should feel very grateful ralph said humbly  the officer laughed but one of them took out his card and wrote upon it  dear von koch this man isfor a hebrewtolerably fair in his ideas  that is for the major of the regiment at bellevue he said and ralph bowed as if he had received a recommendation of the warmest kind  i was beginning to be alarmed ralph percy said when his brother again took his place in the wagon  i have been haggling over prices ralph said fortunately we are not pressed for time  they had another stop of some duration at chaville and it was nearly three oclock in the afternoon before they came down to the back of bellevue here they were stopped and upon ralph producing his pass an officer came up  you cannot go any farther he said you are close to bellevue now but if you were to take this wagon into the main road you would draw valeriens fire upon us at once  you will find most of the officers there pointing to a large house near  i have this card for major von koch ralph said i am here to buy or carry home on commission goods of all kinds  the officer went with ralph and the scene at viroflay was repeated but upon a much larger scale viroflay is a small village containing only a few large villas bellevue is composed almost entirely of handsome residences owned by parisians the quantity of articles saved was proportionately large  after examining and bargaining for a large number of valuable articles of furniture pictures and clocks ralph left with some of the officers to view other articles in the villas upon the side of bellevue looking down upon the river percy had taken the horses out of the wagon and accompanied his brother ostensibly to carry back any articles purchased  at one of the villas ralph expressed a great desire to go out into the garden to look over paris and the officer with himbeing in an excellent humor at the disposal of some articles at much higher prices than he had expected to receive and at having the proceeds in german bank notes in his pocketswent out himself and pointed out all the various objects of interest  the fog of a winters evening was already shutting in the view but the boys could see the principal buildings of paris the towers of notre dame the domes of the pantheon and invalides the heights of montmartre and vilette and the forts of issy and vanves were distinctly visible the boys eyes turned however more to the river at their feet and the intervening ground than upon the objectshowever interestingof distant paris  do not show yourself the officer said if we were caught sight of from issy or point du jouror from that gunboat belowwe should have a rain of shells about us in no time you can look out from among the trees but do not get beyond their shelter or you will be seen instantly  the house in whose garden they were standing stood upon the brow of the hill behind was a little wood and gardens sloping prettysteeply down then along by the water was a street with houses upon either side the river was here divided by an island the lower end of which however scarcely extended low enough to be opposite to the spot upon which the boys were standing  bless me ralph said it must be very dangerous living down there why that gunboat could blow the place into the air  that she could the officer said and consequently none of our men live there we have sentries along the river bank and a few others scattered about but none of the troops are quartered there nor even in this line of villas where we now are if we were to show a light at night in any window here we should have a shell in in a couple of minutes we have no fear whatever of a sortie in this direction and have plenty of force behind  ralph and percy lingered upon one excuse or another asking questions as long as they could and making the best use of their time to gain a fair idea of the ground that they would have to cross they had with them in the wagon a map of bellevue and meudon upon a large scale with every house marked upon it  it is going to be a dark night the officer said as they hurried away and we shall have snow before midnight  another hour or two was spent in purchasing various articles taken from the french villas darkness had come on and ralph told the officers that he should not return until the next morning to versailles and that if the articles to be entrusted to his care for delivery were put in rough casesof which there were plenty which had come full of storesand brought by ten oclock in the morning carefully directed it would be in sufficient time  will you give us leave to sleep in one of the villas upon the farther side of the road ralph asked the officer in command my boy has never seen a shot fired in earnest and i should like him to be able to say he had watched the fire of the forts round paris  if you sleep there the colonel said you must not light a fire or show a light or you would bring the fire of a hundred guns upon us  i will be very careful sir ralph answered will you kindly let an orderly go with us to pass us through the sentries for as its dark now they would not let us pass  the colonel gave the order and an orderly went with them they stopped at the wagon and each took out a large bundle  we shall want our blankets tonight ralph said it is bitterly cold  would you like a glass of brandy to help keep it out my man  the soldier smiled an assent drank off a glass of brandy and then accompanied them to the villa short as was the distance they were challenged twice and the sign and countersign had to be exchanged they reached the deserted villa threw down the bundles in a corner and then the orderly said good night and left them to themselves    chapter 16 a desperate attempt   so far so good percy ralph said when they heard the street door slam as the orderly left hitherto we have had the most extraordinary good fortune and as its going to snowfor i felt a few flakes as we came alongi look upon it as good as done  it will take away from us risk of being hit but i dont see that it will make much difference in our risk of being drowned percy said i own ralph i am a great deal more afraid of that than of the other  but it does percy it makes all the difference in the world we had agreed that we would put on life belts but that we would blow the smallest quantity of air possible into them so that they might give us some slight assistance and yet not be too buoyant to prevent us from diving now we can blow them up with wind so as to prevent the possibility of our being drowned once in the water and we are safe from everything except a stray bullet in a snowstorm on such a dark night as this they could not see our heads five yards off  but what is worse ralph we shall not be able to see five yards either and should have no idea where we were swimming  i had not thought of that percy yes that would be very serious and ralph thought for some time it seems a risk this percy but i can see no plan except to draw their fire  how do you mean percy asked puzzled  you see percy our idea before was to get down to the shore to put our dummy into the water and to let it float down a hundred yardsthe length of its stringand then to start ourselves holding the other end of the string in hopes thatif the sentries are really sharply on the lookoutthey would see the dummy instead of us as it will be a much more conspicuous object especially as we intended to do as much diving as we could and our movements forward would jerk the dummys string and make him bob like a man swimming if they once caught sight of it they would be too busy firing at it to look about for anyone else  well now i think that instead of giving up the dummy altogetheras we might have done now that the snow has come onwe must let it float gently down for seventy or eighty yards and then throw a stone into the water by it so as to draw the attention of the sentry orif the sentries are pretty far apartone of us might make a great splash in the water when the dummy is floating and then run back before the sentry gets up and get into the water quietly higher up their fire will act as a guide to us  we had better start soon ralph it may take us an hour or even two to get down to the water for we must go along like ghosts so as not to alarm the sentries and we shall have walls to get over and all sorts of difficulties  all right percy i do not see the use of waiting we shall not get any warmer by stopping here its like having a tooth out ones got to do it and the sooner its done the better  now for our bundles  they went downstairs into a cellarwhere the light could not be seen from outsidestruck a light and lit a candle the first thing taken out of the bundle was the dummya net rather larger than a mans head tightly filled with corks with a cord a hundred yards in length attached next were two complete suits made of white calico with caps with long flaps of the same material next were two large rolls of india rubber webbing about six inches wide which they had brought from tours with them  i cant think that that will be any good ralph  it will indeed percy the water will of course soak through but what gets in will remain in and the heat of the body will warm it a good deal i can assure you it will be a great deal warmer than having the icy water flowing past you  both boys now took off their coats and waistcoats put on a warm flannel jersey over their flannel shirts and then wound the bandages of india rubber round each others bodies they began under the arms drawing the webbing tight as they wound it round so that its natural elasticity caused each turn to press tightly upon the turn above which it overlapped this bandage was continued down to the lower part of the body then they put on the life belts over them they put their suits of white calico white shoes with india rubber soles the white caps and swimming gloves  they then put the dummy in a pillow case which they had bought for it at versailles before putting on their caps they fastened the quills with the dispatches in their hair in a belt underneath their jackets each carried a heavy revolver  this india rubber stuff regularly squeezes me ralph  all the better percy you will feel the benefit of it when you are in the water believe me  the boys now knelt down together and asked for protection through the peril which they were about to encounter a few minutes later they rose grasped each others hand and thenblowing out the lightgroped their way upstairs opened a window which led into the garden and stepped out  the wind was blowing strongly snowflakes were being whisked hither and thither like spray from a wave had it not been for the gleam from the snowcovered ground it would have been impossible to see ten paces here as it was it was intensely dark  its lucky that its downhill percy or we should never find our way to the waters edge if we keep descending we must be there at last  before starting the boys went a few paces from each other and were pleased to find that their white costumes suited admirably as between the driving snow and the white sheet upon the ground they could not make each other out at more than eight or ten yards even when they knew exactly where they stood they now began to descend the hill very carefully step by step the snow upon the ground made walking much more easy than it otherwise would have been their footstepsmuffled alike by the indiarubber soles and the snow upon which they walkedwere inaudible even to themselves they had several walls to climb and the noiseless indiarubber soles were of good service here several times they could hear the sentries beating their feet upon the ground to warm them but in no case were they near enough to see them  at last after an hour and a halfspent in passing the three hundred yards which separated them from the riverthey reached in safety the wall of the road which runs along by the river here the sentries were pacing along at distances of thirty or forty yards apart the white houses upon the opposite side of the road could be faintly seen and the boys moved along until opposite an opening between them by which they could get through to the river looking over the wall they could watch the sentries andchoosing their time when one had just passed so that his back would be turned towards themhe no sooner disappeared in the darkness than they dropped noiselessly into the road ran across the street climbed a low railing and stood in a garden which reached down to the river  they stood watching for some time to assure themselves that no sentry was placed in the garden but at last they stole forwards and stood at the end of the garden with the river at their feet the snowwhich was at their backswas falling faster than ever the river deepened rapidly from the wall but the water was low enough for anyone to get along on the sloping sidefaced with rough stonebetween the foot of the wall and the water  the boys got over the wall took the dummy from the bag and holding one end of the cord put it quietly into the water and allowed it to float down about sixty yards  now percy ralph said you get ready to slip into the water as quietly as possible the moment you hear a splash i will leave this bag here so as to know exactly where you have gone in andas the rope is plenty long enoughyou keep hold of it here at sixty yards from the dummy and i will fasten the slack end to the stone so that when i go in i have only to hold the rope in my hand to be able to join you i will take this heavy coping stone in my hand will crawl along on this shelving bank till i arrive at the dummy and will then throw the stone in and run back at full speed and be in the water a few seconds after you are  all right ralph i understand keep your pistol cocked in your hand as you go  ralph crept quietly along under the wall until he saw the dummy floating at the edge of the water a few feet below him he rose on his feet to throw in the stone when he heard a deep exclamation behind him and looking round he saw a dark figure within two feet of him another moment and the sentry would have brought his rifle to his shoulderfor he sprang back giving a loud shoutbut ralph wheeled round instantaneously threw up his revolver and fired at the sentinels body  he saw him fall turned round hurled the heavy stone with a loud splash into the water and thencrawling low under the wallran at full speed back again as he did so two sentries in the garden over his head fired in the direction of the splash in the water and shouts were heard all along the bank  in another instant ralph grasped the line and slid down the snowy slopes into the water entering so quietly that no sound whatever betrayed his entry it was icy cold and almost took away his breath twenty strokes and he joined percy  all right old man they cant see us now  you are not hit are you ralph percy gasped  no it was my revolver i had to shoot a sentry to save my life its lucky we have got these life belts on for i am sure we should never get across  there there was shouted in german i see his head bobbing up and down and eight or ten rifle shots were fired from the garden where the sentry had fallen in the direction of the dummy  the boys swam on desperately then ralph said  you can slip the string now percy the dummy has done its work it must be quite out of sight from the bank  do not you feel the benefit of the india rubber  yes percy said i am warm enough in the body but my legs are in agony from the cold these gloves are helping us on though at a great rate  well there is one blessing ralph said we cant miss the way now  as he spoke a heavy fire of musketry opened from the french upon the other side alarmed at the sudden fire on the part of the germans they fired at the flashes of their guns and fresh reinforcements coming up on either side a heavy exchange of musketry shots took place across the river partially over the boys heads but principally a hundred yards lower down the stream in the direction where the dummy was seen by the germans  the boys swam with long steady noiseless strokes  we must be halfway across ralph said  i am getting deadly cold all over ralph i cant sink of course but i shall freeze to death before i reach the opposite bank  no no percy ralph said as cheerily as he could though he felt himself that the intense cold was rapidly overcoming his strength keep up your heart strike as hard as you can the more you exert yourself the better  in another minute or two ralph found he was leaving percy behind and slackened his speed  goodbye ralph my legs are all cramped up and my arms are numbed i cant swim another stroke it is all up with me he said faintly god bless you dont stop with me you can do no good and your only chance is to go on  ralph however put one hand upon percys life belt and struck out for shore but he felt that it was hopeless frightful pains were shooting through his limbs and he breathed what he believed to be a last prayer when a boom like thunder a few yards off galvanized him into life againfor he saw the gunboat which they had seen in the morning only a few yards distant she had just fired a gun loaded with grape in the direction of the germans who were firing she was still at anchor and the stream was drifting them down fast upon her  help ralph shouted help we are drowning and have dispatches throw a rope quick  where are you answered a voice  here close to you just abreast ralph shouted  in another instant a rope struck his face he grasped it twisted it tightly round percys body and his own tied a rough knot with his last strength and then lost consciousness  when he recovered his senses his first sensation was that of intense painso intense that it extracted a groan from him  thats right rub away and pour some more brandy down his throat a voice said  then he became conscious that he was being rubbed with hot flannels he opened his eyes and saw a gleaming of moving machinery and the red glare of furnaces  where am i he asked at last  in the engine room of the gunboat farcey a voice said  i am suffering agony ralph murmured between his teeth  i daresay the officer who was standing by him answered you were pretty near frozen to death luckily your life belts kept you from taking in any water but it was a near squeak another three minutes in the water and the doctor says it would have been all up with you  where is my brother ralph asked suddenly sitting up with a full consciousness of all that had passed  he is coming round the officer said he was farther gone than you were and his hearts action was altogether suspended from the cold his limbs are twitching now and the doctor says he will do  you call him your brother but i suppose you mean your son  please lend me some clothes ralph said i can stand now  some clothes had already been got in readiness and warmed and in a couple of minutes ralph was kneeling by his brothers side percy was now coming to and was suffering agonies similar to those which ralph himself had experienced from the recommencement of circulation in his limbs he looked round utterly bewildered for he had become insensible before the farceys gun had given notice of her proximity he smiled however when his eyes fell on ralphs face  it is all right percy thank god ralph said we are on board the gunboat farcey and in ten minutes we shall be landed in the heart of paris  in another five minutes percy was sufficiently recovered to begin to dress the commander of the farcey now turned to ralph  your son has had a very narrow shave of it sir  son ralph said he is my brother  the officer looked surprised  how old do you take me to be ralph asked  fortyfive or fifty the officer said  i shall not be seventeen for some months ralph answered  the officer looked at him with an air of intense astonishment and there was a burst of laughter from the men standing round the commandant frowned angrily at them  quite so my dear sir he said soothingly i was only joking with you it is evident that you are not yet seventeen  you think i have lost my senses with the shock ralph said smiling i can assure you that that is my age my beard and whiskers are so firmly fixed on with cobblers wax that i shall have an awful trouble to get them off and my hair the same if you feel along here from one ear to the other you will feel a ridge that is the cobblers wax that sticks all this mass of frizzled hair on  did you not notice that both my brothers and my face and hands were much darker than the rest of our skin  yes the doctor did notice that the captain saidnow beginning to think that ralph was not insane after all  passing his finger where ralph directed him he felt the ridge of the false hair  who are you then may i ask he said  my brother and myself are named barclay ralph said we are lieutenants in the army and are both decorated for service in the field we left tours four days ago and are bearers of dispatches from gambetta to general trochu  a cheer broke from all who were standing within hearing and the boys handsfor percy came up at the momentwere warmly shaken by the officers of the boat one after another congratulations of all sorts were heaped upon them and those around were unable to make enough of them  no pigeon has come in for ten days the commander said you will indeed be welcome  at this moment a sailor came down to say that they were passing the louvre and in another two minutes the gunboat lay alongside the wharf  you do not know i suppose where trochu is to be found the commander of the farcey asked  no indeed ralph said  i will go with you myself the officer said if the general has gone to bed we must knock him up he wont mind when he hears the reason  it was but a short distance to walk but the boys had great difficulty in getting there for their limbs were stiff and aching and they felt a burning sensation all over them as if they had been dipped in boiling water general trochu had not yet gone to bed andupon the message being delivered by the orderly the commander of the farcey with officers bearing dispatches from tourshe ordered them to be instantly admitted  these are the lieutenants barclay general the commander of the farcey said a heavy firing broke out suddenly from the water side at lower meudon it was answered from our side andthinking that it might be someone trying to swim acrossi fired a round of grape into the germans and ordered a sharp lookout to be kept i had scarcely spoken the words before we were hailed for a rope and in another minute these officersboth insensible from coldwere pulled on board thinking they might have dispatches i at once started up the river and when they were brought round by the surgeon they stated that they were the lieutenants barclay bearers of dispatches from tours  gallantly done gentlemen bravely done the general said warmly shaking both boys by the hand  the burning heat of percys hand struck him at once  where are your dispatches gentlemen you have preserved them i hope  ralph produced the two quills  they are duplicate general he said we each carried one in case any accident might befall one of us  thank you the general said i need now detain you no longer i have work here for all night and you had better go instantly to bed your brother is in a high state of fever  he touched a bell and an officer in waiting came in  captain bar will you kindly take these gentlemen to a hotel at once the horses are as usual in the carriage i suppose andhe dropped his voicesend a message from me to request doctor marcey to see them at once the younger one is in a state of high fever  in another quarter of an hour the boys were in comfortable beds in rooms adjoining each other ralphwho was heavy and stupid with the effects of the coldwas asleep almost the instant his head touched the pillow he was roused a short time afterwards by being shaken and opening his eyes he saw someone leaning over him  drink this the gentleman said holding a glass to his lips  ralph mechanically did as he was told and fell off again into a heavy sleep from which he did not awake until late the next afternoon  his first impulse was to look at his watch it had stopped at eleven oclock the night beforethe hour at which he had entered the seine then he rang the bell  what oclock is it he asked when the servant entered  just struck five sir  what five in the afternoon ralph exclaimed  yes sir  i have slept ralph said with a laugh however i feel all right again now  is my brother up  no sir the man said  percy ralph shouted it is five oclock in the afternoon get up  the other gentleman is not in the next room sir the servant said  is he not ralph said puzzled i was desperately sleepy last night certainly but not too sleepy i should have thought to have made a mistake about that i feel sure he was in the next room  he was sir the servant said but doctor marcey when he came to see youjust after you got into bedordered him to be carried at once into another room in order that he might not disturb you he said it was essential that you should have your sleep out undisturbed  but why should my brother disturb me ralph asked anxiously is he not well  no sir he has got fever he has been calling out a great deal he has got two sisters with him and the doctor has been every hour  by this time ralph was out of bed  here are some clothes sir the man said handing them to him the landlord thought you would want some at once when you woke and ordered three or four suits for you to try  ralph seized the first that came to hand and threw them on  all paris was talking about your getting through the enemy last night sir there have been hundreds of people here to call  ralph did not even hear what was said  now he said take me to him at once  the servant led ralph along a passage and stopped at a door at which he knocked a sister of mercy opened the door  this is the other gentleman  the sister opened the door for ralph to enter  he is quiet now she said in a soft compassionate tone  ralph went into the room percy lay in the bed with his head surrounded with ice his face was flushed and his eyes wild he was moving uneasily about talking to himself  it is that schoolmaster who is at the bottom of it he muttered he was a traitor and i thought we hung him but i suppose we didnt perhaps he got down after we had gone off if not how could he have betrayed us again  i have heard of liquid fire but that was liquid ice it got into my veins somehow instead of blood i tell you ralph its no good i cant stand it any longer but i will pay off that schoolmaster first let me get at him and he made an effort to rise  the sister tried to restrain him but so violent were his efforts to rise that ralphwho was looking on with tears streaming down his cheekswas obliged to assist to hold him down when he became quiet the sister forced some medicine between his lipsralph holding up his head  shall i speak to him ralph asked he may know my voice  better not sir the nurse said it would probably only set him off again  what does the doctor say about him ralph asked  he says it is brain fever the nurse said he only said it might be some days before the crisis came and that he could not give any decided opinion at present but he seemed to have hope  thank god at least for that ralph said earnestly  percy turning his head round again caught sight of ralph  ah there is that schoolmaster again if no one else will hang him i will do it myself let me get at him  and he again made desperate efforts to get out of bed  you had better go sir one of the sisters said urgently the sight of you makes him worse and you can do him no good  seeing that it was so ralph reluctantly left the room his only comfort being that percy was as carefully tended and looked after as it was possible for him to be he had scarcely returned to his room when an officer was shown in  i daresay you hardly remember me he said i came here with you last night  i am very glad to see you again and to thank you for the trouble you took ralph said i was too sleepy to do so last night  not at all the officer answered however i am here with a message from the general now he would have asked you to dine with him but hearing of the state of your brother he could not ask you to leave him for so long a time but he would be glad if you would come to see him for an hour this evening he wishes to know how you managed to pass through the german lines and he also desires to be informed as far as you can give such information of the number and position of the enemy  what surprises us all more than anything is that the dispatches are dated the morning of the thirteenth instant and you were picked up by the farcey upon the evening of the sixteenth it seems incredible that you should have done the distance and managed to get through the german lines in the time only one other messenger has got through and his dispatches were more than ten days old when they reached us and had been forestalled by some pigeons your news is six days later than any we have received  we slept on the night of the thirteenth at montargis ralph said on the fourteenth at melun on the fifteenth at versailles and last nightas you knowhere  i must not get the information before the general the officer said with a laugh it is halfpast six now the general dines at seven at what time will you be with him shall we say nine  i will be there at nine ralph said but the general will i hope excuse my coming either in uniform or full dress of any kind i have of course nothing with me  general trochu will of course understand that the officer said goodbye  ralph now went back to percys room the doctor had just come he was accompanied by another medical man ralph stood by in silent attention while the doctor felt percys pulse and asked a few questions of the nurse they then gave some orders and said that fresh medicine should be sent in in a quarter of an hour and that they would come in again at ten oclock to see how he was going on  what do you think of him sir ralph asked as the doctor came out  he has a sharp attack of brain fever the doctor said but he is young with an excellent constitution i trust we shall pull him through i cannot say anything for certain at presenttill the fever takes a turn one way or the otherbut i have strong hopes  ralph ordered some dinner to be sent up to his room for he began to be keenly awake to the fact that he had eaten nothing for more than twentyfour hours after he had taken the meal he sat in percys room until it was time to go to general trochus keeping himself however in a position so as to be hidden by the curtainfor the sight of him evidently excited the patient percy was as far as his brother could see in just the same state as before sometimes talking to himself in disconnected sentences sometimes raving wildly and imagining himself repeating the scenes through which he had passed since he left home  at nine oclock exactly ralph sent in his name to the governor and was at once shown in the general had already left the table and was smoking in a small study with him were generals ducrot and vinoy general trochu rose and shook him cordially by the hand presented him to the other generals and asked him to take a cigar and sit down  generals ducrot and vinoy are surprised i see at your appearance captain barclay general trochu began  by the way he interrupted himself you are in the gazette this morning as captain  ralph bowed and expressed his thanks  no thanks are due at all captain barclay the old veteran said you have well earned your promotion and gambettawho speaks of you i may say in the highest termstells me that he promised you the step if you got in i need not say that whether he had done so or not i should have given it to you  but i was saying i see generals vinoy and ducrot are surprisedas i am myselfat your appearance gambetta in his letter twice uses the expression young officers once he said these young officers have greatly distinguished themselves and have gained the cross of the legion of honor and again he says these young officers have volunteered to carry dispatches  naturally my friends were looking for a younger man and having only seen you for an instant last night and not having observed your features specially i confess that i was expecting a younger man  you see he said with a smile we can quite understand gambettas calling your brother a young officer for he is a mere lad but one would hardly have applied the same term to yourself  ralph had flushed crimson at the commencement of this speech  i must apologize very greatly general he said when the governor of paris stopped for the mistake is certainly due to my own forgetfulness  his hearers looked surprised  i slept until five oclock this afternoon ralph continued owing i believe to a powerful opiate that the doctor you kindly sent us gave me since i woke my thoughts have been entirely given to my brother and the thought of my singular appearance never entered my mind i have become so accustomedin the few days since i left toursto this beard mustache and hair that i never thought of them for a moment had i thought of it i could not have presented myself before you this evening for i should not have presumed to do so in my present state and it will take me some hours of hard work and not a little pain before i get rid of themfor they are fastened on with shoemakers wax and i fear will not come off without taking a considerable portion of skin with them  the three generals laughed heartily at ralphs apology and their own mistake and general trochu then asked him to give them a full account of what had happened to him what he had seen and what information he had gained since he left tours ralph told the story unaffectedly from beginning to end and received warm commendation from his listeners  your story began at tours general trochu said where had you last been before that  we had only arrived ten days before from a german prison ralph answered  the generals all laughed  you are adventurous fellows you and your brother general vinoy said how did you get taken and how did you get out  ralph again told his story  you are cool hands you barclays general ducrot said how did you get commissions first were you at the polytechnic or saint cyr  no general ralph said modestly we had no such advantages we won our commissionsand the cross of the legionin the vosges as franc tireurs  in which corps general trochu asked a little sharply they have not done any very great things the franc tireurs  we were in the franc tireurs of dijon ralph said a little proudly we several times beat superior forces we blew up the bridge of the vesouze and should have blown up the tunnel of saverne had it not been for treachery  yes yes general trochu said i remember gambetta has once or twice mentioned your corps especially you see we dont hear much from outside  let us hear of the affairs you have mentioned your account will give us a better idea of the state of things in the vosges than fifty dispatches would do  thus asked ralph gave an account of the doings of the corps from the day they arrived in the vosges to the day he had left themreduced to a fourth of their original strength the three generals sat and smoked their cigars while he spoke asking questions occasionally  very good general trochu said when he finished and the other generals cordially assented  but how come you to speak german so well general trochu asked and how was it you understood the english in which the officer spoke at saverne  we are english ralph said and his hearers gave a simultaneous start of surprise that is to say our nationality is english though we are half french our fatheran officer in the english armywas wounded left the service married a french lady and settled in france for a time we have been educated partly in england germany and france so that we speak the three languages nearly equally well  well captain barclay general trochu said i am almost sorry that you are not french for you would be a credit to any country  and now i think it is time to be going to bed and he drew out his watch bless me it is one oclock i had no idea it was so late good night  i will not ask you to call again for a day or two as your brother will naturally occupy your attention and care i trust that i shall soon hear good news of him  good night captain barclay the other generals said cordially each giving him their hands and ralph made his way across the dark streetsfor there was no gasback to his hotel  he went at once up to percys room and found that if not decidedly better he was at least no worse and the sisters of charity who were nursing him said that the doctors had spoken hopefully at their last visit ralph had intended to sit up all night but the nurses assured him that he could be of no use whatever and indeed that he would be worse than useless as his presence excited percy they themselves were keeping watch by turns  accordingly ralphwho still felt the effects of the cold immersionwent off to bed andin spite of the late hour at which he had risenwas in a few minutes sound asleep    chapter 17 a balloon voyage   for eightandforty hours percys fever and delirium continued unabated at the end of that time he fell into a long sleep and the doctor as he felt his hand and heard his breathing told his brother that he thought the crisis was over and that he would awaken conscious his prognostication turned out well founded and to ralphs intense delight percy knew him when he opened his eyes he was weakweaker than ralph could have supposed anyone could possibly have become after only two days illness but he was fairly convalescent  ralph had scarcely left him during these two days and had only been out once from the hotel he had sent for a newspaper to read for himself in the gazette the promotion which general trochu had notified to him and after doing so he turned to another portion and there among the lists of decorations given were the names of percy and himself as promoted to be commanders of the legion for having with extreme gallantry conveyed dispatches from tours to paris through the german lines  it was after reading this newspaper that ralph went out his walk was not a long one he went first to a tailor and ordered two captains uniforms for percy was so nearly his own size thatexcept that his shoulders were an inch less in widthralphs clothes fitted him exactly he then went to the palais royal where there are several shops which sell nothing but medals and decorations and bought two ribbons of the commanders rank in the legion of honor  one terrible morning ralph spent in a hairdressers hands and at the cost of no little pain got rid of all that mass of hair which had so transformed him the stain was now nearly worn off the skin and ralph was quite surprised when he again looked at himself in the glass  i was about beginning to forget he said with a laugh that i was a boy after all  the first day of percys convalescence he dozed a good deal but the next day he woke much brighter and better  look here percy ralph said laying the ribbon before him thats better than medicine for you there is the ribbon of a commander of the legion of honor you can safely boast that you are the youngest who ever wore it and earned it well too old man wont they be pleased at home and we are both gazetted as captains  percy smiled with pleasure his attack had been a very sharp one but so short an illness however severe is speedily got over the doctor had that morning said that all he wanted now was building up and that in a very few days he would be about indeed percy wanted to get up that day insisting that he was quite strong when he once stood up however he found he was much weaker than he had imagined but sat up in an armchair all the evening the next day he remained up all day and three days after he felt strong enough to go to the governor with ralph to ask for their promised places in the next balloon  it was now the twentythird of november a carriage was sent for and after some difficulty procured for carriages were already becoming scarce in paris they drove up to the entrance and went in but were told by an orderlywho could scarcely conceal his surprise at these lads in the uniform of captains of the staff and with decorations scarcely ever seen except upon the breasts of superior officersthat the general was out they turned and went out but as they reached the steps a number of officers rode up  there is general trochu himself with vinoy and ducrot ralph said  the generals dismounted and came up the steps as they did so their eyes fell upon the boys who both saluted they paused in surprise  what masquerade is this young gentlemen general trochu asked sternly allow me to ask how you venture to dress up as captains on the staff and still more how you dare to put on the ribbons of commanders of the legion of honor  it is no laughing matter he said angrily as ralph could not resist a smile it is a punishable offence and your impudence in showing yourselves off at my door makes the matter the more unpardonable  i see general that you do not remember us  i do not sir general trochu said looking at him sternly to the best of my belief i never set eyes upon you before  the numerous staff of officerswho had accompanied the generals and who were scattered thickly around themgave an angry murmur for scarce one among them wore the coveted decoration  i am ralph barclay and this is my brother percy ralph said respectfully  impossible the three generals exclaimed simultaneously while there was a general exclamation of surprise from the officers roundfor the courageous deed of the barclays in making their way through the enemys lines had been a general topic of conversation and all paris was familiar with their names  it is so general ralph said respectfully i explained to you at the interview that i had the honor of having with you in the presence of generals ducrot and vinoy that it was the false hair which made all the difference and that i was but little older than my brother  the generals no longer doubted they all shook both boys by the hand  i am astounded general trochu said astounded that two such mere boys as i now see you are should have accomplished what you have done however courage is of no age and i do not think that there are any hereand he turned to the officers round himwho will not agree with me that these ribbons are worthily placed  no indeed was the general reply and the officers all pressed round to shake hands with the boys as they accompanied the governor back into the house  general trochu went at once into his private study and told the boys to sit down  now what can i do for you boys  monsieur gambetta promised us that he would write to ask for us to have places in the first balloon which came out after we arrived ralph said owing to my brothers illness i have not been able to ask before but i am now anxious to leave as soon as possible especially as the doctor says that change is desirable for my brother and that he ought to have at least a months nursing at home before he gets on horseback again  a balloon will start tomorrow morning general trochu said but if you choose to stay here i will promise you both places upon my own staff or upon those of generals ducrot or vinoyeither of whom would i am sure be very glad to receive you  you are very kind indeed sirvery kind and we feel greatly honored by your offer ralph said gratefully had we any intention whatever of remaining in the army we should accept it with many thanks but it is not so we are english and at the end of the war we leave france and go back to live at home we entered the ranks with no thought of winning promotion or favor but simply from a sense of duty to the country to which our mother belonged and in which we were born  there will i suppose be a great battle fought near orleans shortly and i should like to be present if possibleand percy wants rest therefore general while thanking you most warmly for your kindness we would rather go out  very well the general said it shall be as you wish there is certainly more chance of your seeing stirring service in the field than in here i do not blame you for your choice i will send a note at once to monsieur teclierwho has charge of the balloonto say that you will accompany him  goodbye lads goodbye you are fine young fellows and your father has every right to be proud of you tell him so from me  the boys rose and bowed but the general held out his hand and shook theirs warmly  upon leaving the room they found several of the officers of the staff waiting outside who begged them to stay and have a chat with them ralph at once accepted the invitation upon the condition that percy should have a sofa upon which to lie down for his brother was looking pale and faint they were most warmly received in a large drawing room in which were over a dozen officers of different ranks some bottles of champagne were opened cigars were lit and while percy lay quietly upon the sofa ralph chatted with the officers relating at their earnest request several of their adventures in the vosges as well as the story of their entering into paris  his new friends warmly pressed them to stop and dine with them but ralph pleaded that the balloon was to start at five in the morning and that he wished percy to lie down and get a good nights sleep before starting the carriage had been discharged hours since but one of the officers ordered a carriage of general trochus to the door and after a hearty leave taking the boys returned to their hotel  what a curious scene it is percy ralph said who would think that we were in a besieged city everything looks very much as usual the shops are open people walk about and chat and smoke and drink their coffee or absinthe just as usual the only difference is that everyone is in some sort of uniform or other one does not see a single ablebodied man altogether in civilian dress and at night the streets are very dismal owing to there being no gas  how much longer do they seem to expect to hold out ralph  another two months anyhow perhaps three or even more there seems to be a large stock of everything and everyone is put on to a regular allowancejust enough to live upon and no more  i seem to have everything i want ralph lots of beef tea and soup and jelly and so on  yes percy but you obtain your food from the hospital the hotel could not furnish anything of the kind i can tell you  here we are now you lie down at once and get to sleep i will wake you in plenty of time  at ten minutes before the appointed time the boys arrived at the northern railway station which presented a very different appearance to that which it ordinarily wore no whistle of locomotives or rumble of heavy trains disturbed the silence of the station a smell of varnish pervaded the whole place and several empty balloons hung from the roof undergoing the process of drying the officialwho had received them at the entranceconducted them outside the station and there in the light of some torches a great black mass could be seen swaying heavily to and fro the aeronaut was standing beside it  here are the gentlemen who accompany you the officer said to him  how are you gentlemen he said cheerily we have a fine night or rather morning the wind is northerly i suppose this is your first ascent  yes indeed ralph said and i own i hope it will be the last have the dispatches arrived  no i have the mail bags but not the dispatches hush there are a horses hoofs  a few minutes afterwards a railway official brought a note which he delivered to monsieur teclier  bah he said in an annoyed tone why cannot they be punctual  what is it sir ralph asked  a note from the general to say that the dispatches will not be ready for an hour that means an hour and a half and by that time it will be light enough to be seen and we shall have to run the gauntlet however i suppose it cannot be helped  the best thing will be to pass the time as cheerfully as we can and that certainly will not be in waiting out here in this bitter cold i have fortunately a few bottles of excellent wine in the car so i propose gentlemen that we go in to a fire have a glass of wine and smoke a cigar tranquilly  monsieur teclier gave a few directions concerning the balloon and they then adjourned to a work shed near where a good fire was blazing for the use of the men employed in filling the balloon here the hour and a half of waiting passed pleasantly  at a quarter to seven the dispatches arrived they were hastily placed in the car in which everything else had already been packed the barclays took their place the word was given let go all and in another instant the earth seemed to sink away from under them and they were rising over the tops of the houses  the dawn had already broken gray and uncertain light clouds were floating overhead for two or three minutes not a word was spoken the scene was so wonderfulthe effect so extraordinary to the boysthat they were unable to utter a word every instant the earth seemed to sink away from them every instant their view extended farther and farther and the distant fields villages and hills seemed actually to spring into sight  it is wonderful ralph said at last  magnificent percy responded  i wonder whether they see us ralph said  we shall soon know monsieur teclier said we have crossed the river and over the walls already in another five minutes we shall be over their lines  there were good telescopes in the car and the boys directed them upon the immense panorama below them  what fort is that immediately beneath us ralph asked  that is vanves the village you see there is chatillon look out now we may expect visitors in a minute  he had hardly spoken before they heard a faint sound followed by others similar  that is musketry monsieur teclier said listen  they did listen and heard a peculiar whistling sound which seemed below around and about them  that is a whistle of bullets there is no mistaking them ralph said  we are too low monsieur teclier said throw out that bundle of newspapers we will go up a little  ralph did so  what would be the consequence if a bullet hit the balloon  no consequence at all except that a slight escape of gas would take place  there we are going into the clouds now and they will not trouble any more about us  i thought that we were going to have wind ralph said the barometer at the hotel had fallen a good deal and the clouds before we started looked like it but now we are once up here we do not seem to move  in another two minutes they passed through the layer of clouds and the sun shone brightly upon them they looked down on a sea of white mist without a break  there ralph continued we are entirely becalmed these clouds below do not move nor do we  you cannot tell that monsieur teclier said we go in the same direction and at the same speed as the clouds it is just as if you were in a boat at night upon a rapid stream if you could see no banks or other stationary objects you might believe yourself to be standing still while you were being drifted forward at the rate of twenty miles an hour we may be traveling now forty or fifty miles an hour and as i agree with you as to the look of the clouds before starting i believe that we are doing soor at any rate that we are traveling fastbut in what direction or at what rate i have no means whatever of knowing  even if we found that we moved relatively to the clouds below us that would only show that this upper current was somewhat different from that below  but how are we to find out about it percy asked  we must keep a sharp lookout for rifts in the clouds if we could get a peep of the earth only for a minute it would be sufficient to tell us the direction and to some extent the speed at which we are going  the boys in vain hung over the side the sea of clouds beneath them changed and swelled and rolled its masses of vapor over each other as if a contest of some gigantic reptiles were going on with them  there must be a great deal of wind to account for these rapid changes of form percy said after a long silence suppose you see nothing of the earth at what time will you begin to descend  in five hours from the time of starting at twentyfive miles an hoursupposing that the wind holds northwe should fall south of the loire somewhere between orleans and bourges at eleven oclock then i will let out gas and go down below the clouds to see whereabouts we are if we cannot recognize the country or see any river which may guide us we shall at least see our direction and rate of movement and can either throw out more newspapers and keep on for awhile or descend at once  it was just ten oclock when ralph gave a sudden cry  the sea he said the sea  impossible monsieur teclier said hanging over the side i can see nothing  nor can i now ralph said but i caught a glimpse just now and i will almost swear to its being the seathough how we could get there i dont know  if it is the aeronaut said the wind must be blowing half a gale up here and must have changed entirely either to the west or south it is too serious to hesitate we must find out if your eyes have not deceived you  so saying he pulled the valve  keep a sharp lookout and look at the compass  there there the boys cried as the clouds opened again for an instant it is the sea and we are going west  then we are over the atlantic monsieur teclier said  the gas was roaring from the valve above and the balloon sank rapidly into the stratum of clouds for a minute all was silent and then a cry broke from them all they were a considerable distance from the coast and were driving along with great rapidity immediately under the balloon was an island of no great size and beyond that no land whatever was visible  we must descend on that island or we are lost it is our only chance  the valve was still open and its influence was easily seen for the balloon sank rapidly down through the opening of the clouds  we shant be down in time the boys exclaimed simultaneously  it was but too evident the balloon when the first general view of the situation had been obtained was fully a mile high and was traveling seaward at the rate of thirty miles an hour the island at the point at which they were crossing was about three miles wide but they had passed fully half a mile over it before they obtained a fair view in five minutes therefore they would be beyond the land again and they had to fall a mile in that time  cut the balloon to pieces monsieur teclier said tear it up we must risk everything  the boys seized the silk tore and hacked at it as did the aeronaut in two minutes a vast quantity of gas had escaped from the rents and the silk was doubled up near the top of the net  illustration the sea the sea  that will do monsieur teclier said we shall be down in time now  the boys looked over the car and accustomed as they had been to face danger were appalled  it is all up with us this time ralph said we shall he smashed altogether  no the aeronaut exclaimed the silk is acting as a parachute now and checking the descent now help me to throw out all the bundles  they did so working silently and with difficulty for the car was oscillating so greatly that they were obliged to hold on by its side not to be thrown out the descent was less rapid than it had been but was still sufficiently alarming  is there a chance ralph said  we shall get off with a shaking monsieur teclier said the car is made of wicker work and is as elastic as a ball drop the grapnel now in another minute we shall be within holding distance  as the balloon neared the ground the oscillation became less violent and the pace diminished  the grapnel is on the ground percy said looking over  hold tight hold tight monsieur teclier said warningly we shall catch fast on to those trees  there was a tearing and rending a series of tremendous jerks and then a bump against the ground which threw them all into the bottom of the car from which the next jerk threw them out on to the ground fortunately the ground was even and the soil had lately been plowed but the shock was so violent that it was some minutes before either of the boys recovered consciousness when they did so they found that two or three gentlemen were leaning over them while several peasants were endeavoring under the direction of monsieur teclier to hold the balloonwhich was thrashing the ground with great violence  thank god you are all alive one of the gentlemen said  a peasant now came running up with some water the gentleman who had spoken dashed a little in their faces  i do not think any of your limbs are broken he said do you feel any pain  i feel sore and bruised all over ralph said getting up with some assistance but i dont think that anything serious is the matter  how are you percy  i dont think i am hurt seriously ralph but i would rather lie still for the present  ralph explained to the gentlemanwho again leaned over percy and felt his pulsethat his brother had been recently ill and was still weak  ah that accounts for it the gentleman said i do not think that he is seriously hurt i am a doctor and was luckily out riding with these gentlemen when we happened to look up and saw your balloon falling like a stone from the clouds we thought at first that you must be dashed to pieces but when we saw that the speed was being a little checked we had some hope and galloped in the direction in which it was falling we were within five hundred yards when you fell but we hardly expected to see anyone alive  do not try to move he said to percy we sent a man for a vehicle and a few necessaries before we set off ourselves  where have we fallen ralph asked we were astonished to find ourselves over the sea for the wind was north when we started  you have fallen upon belle isle the gentleman said so the wind must have changed materially since you started  monsieur teclier now came up  i must really congratulate you both he said to ralph upon your coolness and presence of mind in a very frightful position the oldest aeronaut could not have shown more nerve  you see ralph said we have been pretty often in danger now and although the sort of danger was new the degree of danger was not  the gentlemen smiled a little as ralph spoke the barclays had come out in plain clothes bringing their uniform in the balloon for in the event of the balloon having fallen among the germans it was of course essential that they should be able to get off unobserved they therefore looked mere lads and their talk of having passed through as great a danger as that which had just made the spectators of it feel faint and sick only to witness appeared to be a mere bit of exaggerated braggadocio  a light cart now arrived in which some mattresses had been laid some bandages and other surgical necessaries had also been added together with a bottle of brandy  fortunately we do not want any of these except the brandy the surgeon said a little of that will do you all good  now a few strips of plasterthis was to monsieur teclier whose face was cut a good dealand then you will do till you get to the town  the three voyagers were now helped into the cart for they were all very stiff and greatly shaken and were glad to stretch themselves out on the mattresses covered over with blankets until they reached the little town here they were met by the whole population cheering lustily another wagon had been sent off for the balloon and a number of people now set out to search for the bags of dispatches etc which had been thrown out during the last part of the descent the sous prefect at the island placed his house at once at their disposal but they said that they would rather go to a hotel first and take a hot bathwhich the doctor recommended thembut should be very happy to breakfast with him after that before going to the hotel however monsieur teclier sent off a dispatch to tours saying that he had arrived at belle isle with news from paris at a quarter to seven and that at that time everything was going on well  he next inquired as to means of reaching the mainland the wind was dead off shore and a sailing vessel would have taken a long time to make the passage however there was a small steamer in harbor and the sous prefect took upon himself to engage that the fires should be lighted at once and that they should cross in two or three hours  after reaching the hotel they were examined carefully by the surgeon who pronounced that no harm whatever had been done to them and that they had escaped with a few contusions and a good shaking  the breakfast was quite an ovation all the principal people of the place were assembled and when monsieur teclier entered followed by the young barclays the gentlemen clapped their hands and cheered and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs after breakfast the sous prefect proposed an adjournment into the drawing room and now the voyagers each became the center of a knot of questioners as to the voyage  monsieur teclieras was naturalconversed with the sous prefect and other leading men of the town while their wives and daughters gathered round the lads ralph had given his name as barclay and had stated that percy was his brother but he had said nothing as to their being in the army as he wished to avoid the oftrepeated tale which the declaration of his rank was sure to necessitate he had even said a word to monsieur teclier begging him to say the messieurs barclay instead of captains barclayunless of course he were actually questioned upon the matter percy was allowed to sit in an easy chair unmolestedfor he was quite done upand ralph talked for both relating many details of their journey from paris and the ladies examined him most minutely as to his sensation and especially whether he was not horribly frightened  among those standing in a group round the young barclays was a lieutenant of mobiles who evidently by no means approved of the attention and interest which they excited among the ladies and who had made several sarcastic remarks during the course of the narrative presently a servant came in and walking up to monsieur teclier said that two swords had been picked up had they fallen from the balloon  yes monsieur teclier said they belong to those gentlemen  the servant came up to ralph and told him that the swords had been picked up ralph at once drew out a fivefranc piece and asked the servant to give it to the man who had found them  ah said the officer of mobiles with a scarcely concealed sneer so you have come out from paris to serve i should have imagined that there were plenty of opportunities to distinguish yourselves there however you must have had good interest to get places in a balloon  we have fair interest ralph said calmly as apparently you have yourself each of us have you see used our interest in the way most pleasing to us we have used ours to enable us to go with the army in the field instead of being forced to remain inactive in paris you upon your part have used yours to get away from the army in the field and to remain inactive here  these words were spoken with such an air of boyish frankness and an apparent innocence of any desire to say anything unpleasant that everyone within hearing was ready to burst with laughter at ralphs hitwhich happened to be thoroughly well deserved  the officer turned white and would have burst out into a violent answer had not a couple of friends at his elbow begged him to restrain himself the boy evidently meant nothing besides he was only a boy and what could be done with him besides which again one of them put in though he was only a boy he looked an awkward customer this latter argument weighed more with the lieutenant than any other  ralph was not yet seventeen and looked much younger than a french lad of the same age would do but in point of size he was considerably taller than the officer of mobiles and his broad shoulders gave promise of unusual strength there was too a look of fearlessness and decision about his face which marked him emphatically as an awkward customer seeing this the lieutenant burst into a constrained fit of laughter and said that it was very goodreally very good for a boy  everyone else was so occupied in the endeavor to stifle their laughter that the lieutenant again took up the part of questioner  i suppose young gentleman that you come from saint cyr or the polytechnic although i should hardly imagine that you have completed your studies in either of them  i have not the advantage of having been at either of the military academies ralph said quietly have you  again there was a laugh and by this time most of those in the room had gathered round  may i ask to which arm of the service you belong the officer asked with difficulty keeping his temper  you may ask certainly and i have no objection to answer ralph said my brother and myself both belong to the general staff  the officer looked surprised  have you served already sir or has your service yet to commence  i have seen some little service already ralph said  may i ask what general has had the benefit of your assistance the lieutenant said with an affectation of politeness  at this moment the sous prefect pushed forward  silence sir he said to the officer there has been too much of this these gentlemen have performed a great service to france and are my guests and i look upon it as a personal attack upon myself  excuse me sir ralph said rising from his seat for the first time i am grateful to you for your interference in my behalf but i can make no claim upon the present occasion to have rendered any service to france i had nothing to do with the dispatches nothing to do with the balloon i came out as a passenger upon my private desire and pleasure at the risk of course of being killed undoubtedly i nearly was killed and i look upon the entertainment that you have given us as a kind congratulation upon our not having broken our necks  kindly then permit me to answer this officer for myself i think i can hold my own  the sous prefect shrugged his shoulders to signify that in that case he washed his hands of the whole business  now sir ralph said i will answer the question the general upon whose staff my brother and myself served was general cambriels  the officer shrugged his shoulders  since that time ralph said more sternly than he had yet spoken my brother and myself have had the offer of posts upon the staffs of general trochu general ducrot and general vinoy  oh come now the lieutenant said with a laugh of derision that is a little too strong imagine a scramble upon the part of trochu ducrot and vinoy for the services of these very young officers  this time the speaker had the laugh with him for no one could believe that ralph could be speaking the truth ralph grew a little pale  monsieur teclier he said do me the favor to introduce my brother and myself to this lieutenant of mobiles in due form  the matter had now become so serious that there was a dead hush in the room while monsieur teclier advanced he had once or twice already made a motion of coming forward to take ralphs part but a motion from the latter had arrested him he was aware of the furore which the gallant and successful expedition of the barclays had created in paris and he had been greatly struck and pleased by the calmness of the boys in a greatand to them altogether newperil he now advanced slowly  may i ask your name sir and regiment he said to the officer  lieutenant desmaret of the mobiles of vienne the officer said frowning  lieutenant desmaret of the mobiles of vienne i beg to introduce you to  no sir the officer said passionately you introduce them to me not me to them the inferior rank is introduced to the superior  i know perfectly well what i am doing sir and require no lesson from you monsieur teclier said quietly i repeat i introduce youlieutenant desmaret of the mobiles of vienneto captain ralph barclay and captain percy barclay staff officers and commanders of the legion of honor  there was a dead silence of surprise throughout the room  is it possible the sous prefect said coming forward again that these gentlemen are the captains barclay of whom the paris paperswhich we received three days sincewere full as having passed through the german lines and having swam the seine at night under fire they had previously been decorated for great acts of bravery in the vosges and were now made commanders of the legion  is it possible that you are those officers gentlemen  it is so monsieur ralph said we had the good fortune to distinguish ourselves but as we did not wish to make ourselves conspicuous by new uniforms and new ribbons we have put aside our uniforms until required for service and asked monsieur teclier to be silent upon the subject of course we could not guess that upon our way we should meet so rude and unmannerly a person as monsieur the lieutenant of the mobiles of vienne  the lieutenant stamped his feet furiously  you shall answer to me sir he said for this insult  stop sir ralph said in a steady voicewhich silenced those who were about to interfere you have asked me questions with rare freedom i have answered them i am now going to give you my opinion of you and my advice to you equally freely  if you mean by what you have said that you are going to challenge me to a duel i tell you at once that i shall not accept it i have sir and he raised his head proudly proved my courage and france has recognized it in the rank and honor she has given me we englishfor i am englishdo not fight duels  but i will make an exception when you monsieur desmaret come to me decorated as i am or having in any signal way proved your courage and devotion to france i will meet you at present i see that youan officer in the french army well in healthare staying here in idleness instead of being in the field go and fight the enemies of france first monsieur desmaret and after that talk if you like about fighting her friends  there was a loud exclamation of applause and satisfaction at these words from those who had been looking on at this unpleasant scene and the sous prefect warmly shook ralph by the hand  well said captain barclay well said indeed i believe i may say that everyone here agrees with you entirely there are too many officers continually absent from the army upon private affairs and those of monsieur desmaret have taken longer to arrange than usual for he has been staying here for five weeks now  however he said significantly he will hardly prolong his stay in the island  enough upon that subject he said as monsieur desmaret left the room pale and furious i am gladi am proud sirto make the acquaintance of yourself and your brother and i can really at heart feel grateful to that fellow for having forced you to declare who you are had he not done so you would have left without our knowing that we had you among us  there was now quite an ovation to the boys the ladies especially would hardly conceive that it was possible that these quietlooking young fellows had performed feats of such daring they now begged to hear the details of the adventures but at this moment word was brought that steam was up and the vessel ready to start and as monsieur teclier was most anxious to get on and as percy was quite done up ralph was glad to seize the excuse and to make his apologies for leaving at once the sous prefect all the breakfast party and a large proportion of the population of the little place accompanied them thence to the landing place and then amidst hearty cheering the little steamercarrying the voyagers the dispatches and the remains of the balloonstarted for the mainland    chapter 18 a day of victory   after traveling all night the barclays arrived at tours at ten oclock on the morning of the day after that upon which they had left belle isle at the station they said adieu to monsieur teclier who went at once to gambetta with the dispatches while the barclays turned away to colonel tempes lodgings and to their great surprise as well as delight found him in  the colonel gave quite a shout of joy when he saw them  ah my brave boys my brave boys i am glad to see you and he took them in his arms and kissed them as heartily and as earnestly as if he had been their father  i am glad to see you he repeated wiping his eyes with his handkerchief i was sure you would do it i never really doubtedi told gambetta it was as good as donebut i could not help being nervous horribly nervous and when the news came five days ago by the balloon which left three days after you got in i almost lost my head i laughed i cheered i shook everyone by the handma foi i dont know what i did i was so pleased  your irishman was the funniest thing he was not surprised or pleased or even interested i explained to him over and over again thinking he did not understand but he only shook his head and said in his strange english  sure colonel i never doubted them for a moment arent they clever enough to decaive the ould gintleman himself it was as sartin as peas is peas that they would slip in somehow and if they did get into a scrape that they were the boys for getting themselves out of it its the coming out i am afraid of  i looked surprised naturally enough and he went on  and doesnt your honor know that they are talking of coming out in a balloon only to think of it colonel flying through the clouds shut up in a big ball of silk its just flying in the face of providence whats the use of scheming or of courage you cant decaive a cloud though its as aisy as dancing to take in a german when you tell me colonel that theyre safe out of the balloon then ill shout as loud as you like  yesterday when the telegram from teclier camesaying that he had fallen in belle isle had had a narrow escape of being driven into the sea but had avoided that by running the risk of breaking his neckand mentioned that you were with him and had like himself escaped with a few bruises tim went nearly out of his mind with joy he has been cleaning his sword and accouterments this morning  i am off tomorrow and you are only just come in time to see the fighting  but you are looking ill percy far too ill for service just at present  yes he has been very ill ralph said he had a touch of brain fever the night we got into paris and was delirious for two days he has picked up quickly but that balloon descent was not the thing for an invalid the doctor in paris ordered a month at least of absolute rest and has given him a sick certificate  he needs rest certainly colonel tempe said but he cannot go home at present the prussians hold dijon in considerable strength there are far too many people in the town who have heard of your connection with the franc tireurs some spy or other would be certain to peach  yes ralph assented we have been talking it over and quite agree that percy could not go back asalthough he would willingly run the risk himselfit would bring such serious consequences upon them at home if he were found there that he has determined to go down to nice for a while and rejoin as soon as he gains strength again  yes colonel tempe said but above all things do not let him be in a hurry  you have gone through an immense deal percy and have done a great deal more than your share for france and have gained great honor and credit be content with that you might ruin your constitution for life by further exertions  but about yourself colonel where are you going  i am starting tomorrow to join general chanzys staff  i have not heard his name before ralph said  he commands the sixteenth corps he has not had much opportunity yet but he is a good soldier if you like ralph i will go with you at once to freysinet and get you attached with me  thank you very much colonel i should like it of all things  come along then freysinet is in his office  percy accompanied them to obtain a signature to his leave of absence and left next day for the south an hour later colonel tempe and ralph were in the train upon their way to orleanstim again in his hussar uniform and half wild with delightbeing with colonel tempes orderly in charge of the horses  colonel tempe as ralph was not mounted had offered to lend him one of his own but ralph had refused it unless the colonel would sell it as he said he should be always afraid of getting the animal shot unless it was his own seeing that ralph was determined upon this score the colonel had reluctantly agreed to take the sum he had paid for the horse ralphs only other purchase in tours was a fur greatcoat  and now colonel ralph said when the train had started we have time to talktell me what chances have we of success  between ourselves barclay colonel tempe said i do not think that our prospects are brilliant in my opinion aurelles de paladineor rather gambetta for it was he who ordered the advancemade an immense mistake in attacking von der tann when he did of course he drove him back and took orleans but what was the use of that absolutely nothing he was not strong enough to push his advantage but the movement served to draw the attention of the germans to his force and prince frederick charleswho was marching south from metzhas been hurried towards orleans and has now united his forces with those of von der tann and the duke of mecklenburg so that although we have received large reinforcementsfor the whole of the army of the east is up nowthe germans have been equally reinforced and are quite as strong as we are  we ought never to have attacked until we were ready to follow up our advantage at once it was nothing short of madness yet what can you expect with a civilian acting as commanderinchief i believe that we shall make a tough fight of it but i can hardly hope that our new levies can prove a match for the veterans of frederick charles  when do we begin do you think  in two or three days at latest you have not seen a great battle yet barclay  no ralph said nor shall i see much of it now for the country is so perfectly flat that it will be impossible to get anything like a general view of it do you know colonel i feel a good deal more comfortable than i did during my last journey between tours and orleans for although i thought that we should manage somehow to get through into paris still i could not conceal from myself that it was a very serious undertaking  how bitterly cold it is  it is indeed colonel tempe assented being upon the staff we shall no doubt manage to get a roof of some sort over our heads but for the sentries it must be terrible the tents dabriif the men can scrape away the snow and get an armful of straw to lie onare snug enough the men lie close together and share their blankets  half an hour after arriving at orleans colonel tempe and ralph were riding out upon the north road followed by tim doyle and the colonels orderly the frost was keen but the afternoon was bright and clear and as they cantered along the roadbeaten flat and hard with the enormous traffictheir spirits rose and ralph regretted that percy was not there to share in his enjoyments  colonel tempe shook his head when the wish was mentioned  no no barclay it is far better as it is you are young enough in all conscience for this iron work of war your brother has done far more than a mans share already and will find it difficult enough to go back as a schoolboy he has escaped thus far almost by a miracle but he was looking shaken and worn i am glad that he is not here  three hours riding took them to the little village near which general chanzy was quartered the sixteenth corps lay to the left of the french army facing the germans who held the line of villages of guillonville terminiers and conier it was already dark when they arrived the generals quarters were in a chateau a quarter of a mile distant from the village when they reached it they were at once shown in and found general chanzy leaning over a map which he was trying to examine by the light of a solitary candle  how are you colonel he asked shaking hands with him heartilyfor they were old friends i am very glad you have come there is plenty to do and few to do it at least very few indeed who know anything about their work  who have you here  allow me to introduce captain barclay general freysinet has attached him to your staff he served with me in the vosges distinguished himself greatly and won his lieutenancy and the cross since then he has been into paris no doubt you saw the account of his swimming the seine with his brother  of course of course general chanzy said warmly i am very glad to have you with me captain barclay you will not be long before you are at work for the affair is just beginning i have just got news that there has been some sharp fighting today at beaurre la rolande  with what results sir colonel tempe asked  we gained a great deal of ground in the morning general chanzy said but they brought up reinforcements and no material advantage is claimed  and now the general went on as to quarters you must shift for yourselves beds are out of the question but you will find some empty rooms upstairs and fortunately there is a little straw in the stable the outhouses are extensive and you will be able to get your horses under shelter i should advise you to see about them at once in an hour we shall have something to eat i cannot call it dining  captain barclay will you kindly see to these matters i shall be glad to go through this map at once with colonel tempe  ralph at once obeyed the order much pleased with his new commander general chanzy was a man to inspire confidence in all those who served under his orders he was a young man for a general but was very bald and had a quiet and thoughtful air which made him look older than he was he was a man of few words and had a sharp steady look which seemed to master at once the important points of anything that was said to him when he smiled the whole of his face seemed to light up  just the man to serve under ralph thought to himself cool self possessed and with an eye that will see a weak point in a moment  is my orderly still at the door he asked a soldier in the passage  yes sir two orderlies with the four horses  can you get me a light of any sort ralph asked i want to go round to the stables and get the horses somewhere in shelter  i will get you a lantern sir the man said but i fear that you will find the place all crowded but of course you can turn some of them out  the orderly accompanied ralph with a lantern across the yard tim and colonel tempes orderly following round the yard were many cavalry horses tied to pegs driven in close by the wall of the stables so as to give them some little shelter from the intense cold the poor animals stood side touching side for warmth  the orderly opened the door of one of the stables and ralph entered and looked round by the light of the lantern the horses were ranged together in the stalls as closely as they could stand while the rest of the area was completely covered with cavalry soldiers some sitting up smoking and talking others already wrapped in their cloaks and stretched at full length  a sergeant seeing the marks of ralphs rank at once rose to his feet and saluted  i have two horses here sergeant my own and one of colonel tempes general chanzy told me i should find room here but it does not look like it  i will turn two of these horses out sir the sergeant said  is there no other place ralph asked  they are all as full as this sir  there is a little shed down at the end of the garden one of the men said i noticed it this afternoon the door was locked i looked in and it seemed a cow shed i dont know whether anyone is there i will go down with you sir and show you the way if you like  the shed was soon found and the soldier forced the door open with his sword bayonet the place had as he supposed been a cow shed but the walls and roof were in good order and the ground hard  this will do first rate your honor tim said there is room for all four horses if they squeeze a bit and for jacques here and myself i suppose your honor there will be no harm in knocking up some of this woodwork to make a bit of a fire its too dark to look for sticks tonight and they would be so damp from the snow that the smoke would choke the bastes entirelyto say nothing of us  well under the circumstances tim i agree with you but dont do more damage than you can help and only make enough fire to make the water hot for coffee and so on you will be warm enough here with the four horses you must go and see if you can get them some forage  but how about your honors and the colonels dinner tim asked i havent drawn rations but i have got plenty of bread and meat in the haversack i got them at tours for i thought there wouldnt be much to be had here  thank you for thinking of it tim but we dine with the general when you have got the horses comfortable and lit your fire one of you bring up our cloaks to the house keep the horses saddles on with loosened girths we may want them suddenly at any moment of the night  the next morning general chanzy said to ralph  i should recommend you captain barclay to spend an hour studying this map and getting up from these lists the exact position of our forces when you think you have mastered them ride through the whole of the positions occupied by the corps and without exposing yourself gain as good an idea as you can of the country beyond tomorrow you may have to ride straight to certain points with orders and it may save important time if you are thoroughly acquainted with the ground and position  after a couple of hours study of the staff map so as to know every little bylane and hamlet for ten miles on either side ralph mounted his horse and went for a long ride when he returned colonel tempe told him that general chanzy was gone over to general daurelles quarters to arrange the details and that the attack was to take place the next day  at five oclock the general returned and colonel tempe and the chief of his staff were occupied with him for two hours in drawing up the specific orders for each corps colonel tempe had not been out all day and he therefore offered his horse to ralph in order that ralphs own might be fresh for the next day  four staff officers set off in various directions with the dispatches and ralph congratulated himself upon having been upon the ground he was now traversing once before that day as even with that previous acquaintance it was hard work to find the way through the darkness from the snow altering the general appearance and apparent distance of each object thanks however to his ride of the morning he reached the various corps to which he was dispatched without any serious mistakes in his way and got back to headquarters by eleven oclock  tim was waiting up for him  sure your honor and its a mighty cold night ive got a pot of coffee on the boil in the stables  thank you tim i will just go in and make my report to the general and then go off to bed bring the coffee into my room we shall be up early for we fight tomorrow  do we now tim said admiringly and its about time for we should be all frozen into skeletons if we were to wait here doing nothing much longer bad luck to the weather says i  at ten oclock the next morning the french troops were in motion the objects of their attack being the villages of guillonville terminiers and conier the country was extremely flat and for an hour they saw no bodies of the enemy a few videttes only were seen these galloped off hastily the moment they caught sight of the heavy masses of the french debouching from the wood ralph was riding with the rest of the staff behind the general  that is terminiers colonel tempe said pointing to a house or two at a distance on the plain  as he spoke a puff of smoke came from the houses  there is the first shell was the general exclamation  in another instant the missile burst near some infantry at two hundred yards to the right  take orders to that battery there to take position on that little eminence to the left there captain barclay tell them to keep the guns a little back among the trees and to open sharply upon terminiers  it was just twelve oclock now and in five minutes there was a roar of cannon along the whole length of both lines for half an hour the combat continued a mere artillery duel the shells fell in all directions cutting the dry branches from the trees tearing up the ground and leaving deep black gashes in the white snow crashing through a wall or occasionally exploding among the troops  their fire is slackening a little general chanzy said it is time to be pushing forward  lieutenant porcet take my orders to the colonel of that regiment of mobiles to advance at once covered by skirmishers  captain barclay order that line regiment to support  captain maillot order the artillery to concentrate their fire upon the village and to advance by batteries  the orders were carried out and the mobiles advanced to within five hundred yards of the village the musketry fire was now tremendous and the mobiles wavered the germans were entrenched in the gardens and walled enclosures of the village every wall every house was loopholed and rough barricades had been erected to fill up the breaks in the walls  general chanzy was sitting on horseback a short distance in the rear of the fighting mounted officers rode up and left again every moment with news of the battle going on near the other villages  ride up and order the mobiles to lie down captain barclay then tell the colonel of the line to bring his troops up in line with them let them lie down also  tempe have the two reserve batteries of artillery brought up at full speed to silence that battery in the wood to the left of the village its fire crosses the ground we have to pass over  ten minutes more of continuous cannonading and then it was apparent that the prussian fire was weakening  now barclay tell them to charge at the double  ralph set spurs to his horse but just as he reached the troops a shell exploded just under his horse ralph heard a crash felt a shock and a whirling through the air and then fell heavily upon the ground believing he was dangerously wounded he made no effort to get to his feet but sat up and shouted to the colonel of the mobiles who were not thirty yards from him  the mobiles and line are to charge at the double and to carry the village with the bayonet  the mobiles had flinched a little before as they had advanced with the deadly fire of shot and shell but they did not flinch now and leaping upon their feet with a cry of vive la france the mobiles and line soldiers literally made a race of it for the village  ralph after having given his message lay back again with a sort of bewildered sensation a minute afterwards he heard a rapid galloping and colonel tempe rode up followed by tim doyle  are you badly hurt my dear boy the former exclaimed as he leaped from his horse the general himself asked me to come and see after you  i dont quite know colonel ralph answered i feel at present as if my head was knocked in and my legs shot off  you had a tremendous shake said colonel tempewho was with tim by this time kneeling beside himand your horse is blown almost to pieces but i dont think as far as i can see at present that you are hit anywhere here take a sip of brandy it will bring you round you are stunned a little you know  there you are better now he said as ralph having drunk a little brandy sat up and looked round  i am all right i think colonel dont stay any longer tim will wait here i dont think i was stunned else i could not have given the order no i imagine i had a near escape of breaking my neck  please dont wait i shall be all right again in five minutes i will take tims horse and join you again tim will pick up a musketthere are plenty aboutand do a little fighting on his own account  colonel tempe jumped on his horse and rode off in a minute or two ralph was able to mount tims horse and ride slowly up to the village where a heavy musketry fire was still going on but as no shell or shot were now coming in the direction in which ralph was it was evident that the french had taken the position and had opened fire upon the retreating germans the fight still raged both to the right and left but in another quarter of an hour it slackened also here and the three villages were all in the hands of the french  in a quarter of an hour ralph felt quite himself again and seeing one of his fellow staff officers gallop up he asked him where he could find the general  he is at guillonville but he will be here in a few minutes the advance is to continue we are to carry the villages of monneville villepani and faverolles  in half an hour the troops were again moved forward but this time the resistance was more obstinate than before the prussians having received reinforcements hour after hour the fight continued the short winter day faded and the gathering darkness was favorable to the assailants and at halfpast five they carried the villages by assault  the scene was a wild one it was perfectly dark save from the incessant flashes of rifle and cannon in the streets of the village men fought hand to hand some of the germans taking refuge in the houses refused to surrender others threw down their arms and cried for quarter shouts screams curses cheers the explosion of firearms and the clash of steel mingled in one wild and confusing din when it ceased the village remained in the hands of the french and the prussians retreated sullenly into the darkness  there was no rest for the staff for hoursthey were galloping about carrying ordersbut at last ralph returned to villepani at which village general chanzy had his headquarters at the door of the cottage which was pointed out as that in which the general was tim was waiting  faith your honor if this is war ive had enough of it  what is it tim  what is it your honor here have we been fighting all day and not a blessed thing to eat or to drink no one knows what became of the wagons and here we are without as much as a biscuit to ateand in such weather as this too and another battle in the morning  ay tim its bad enough but think of the thousands of poor fellows lying wounded and freezing to death on the snow  i do think of them mister ralph and ive been at work ever since we got in here carrying the poor creatures in from the gardens and fields there is not a house here thats not full from the top to the bottom  have you lost the wallet off my saddle your honor  no tim why should i do that  i dont know why you should sir but i have been making up my mind that you would all along either that you would have had it shot off or that youd throw it away to aise the horse now we shall do  why whats in the wallet tim  just a big chunk of bread your honor it was left on the table when you had breakfast this morning and i said to myself it may be useful before night and so just slipped it into the wallet  in another minute the bread was taken out and cut into two portions  i would not eat it all tonight tim if i were you ralph said it is not by any means too large for supper but a mouthful in the morning will be a great comfort i suppose there is no chance of getting anything for the horse  trust me your honor one of the first things i did when the firing was over was to pop into a stable and to get a big armful of hay and take it out and hide it away under a hedge it was lucky i did for the minute afterwards we could not have got a handful if we had offered a napoleon for it  where are you going to sleep tim  under that same hedge mister ralph the horse always lies down and hes so tired he wont break the rule tonight so ill give him half the hay for his supper and when hes laid down ill put the rest between him and the hedge and roll myself up in my cloak andwhat with the cloak and the horse and the hedge and the hay not to mention the supperi shall be as warm as a lord and its a comfort to think that there will be something to eat both for the baste and myself in the morning  well good night then tim  good night your honor  if tim doyle slept there were not many of his comrades that did on that night the cold was fierce in the extreme and those who could obtain wood of any kind made fires and crouched over them  others lay on the ground and huddled together for warmth others dragged their feet wearily backwards and forwards many and deep were the curses poured out upon the intendanceor commissariatwhose utter incompetence throughout the war was one of the great reasons of the continuous bad fortune of the french  when ralph entered the room he was saluted by a variety of voices the only light was a dim lantern the room was half full of officers some dozing in corners others sitting round the table smoking  where is the general  he has got a room about half the size of this for the use of himself tempe and the chief of the staff they are writing and will go on writing all night i expect these are the only two rooms not full of wounded in the whole village  you had a narrow escape today we have had our share of casualties poor maillet and porcet are both killed and we have three wounded were you hurt at all  no ralph said but i was tremendously shaken and feel stiff all over i will lie down by the wall here and get a few hours sleep  and so ended the 1st of december    chapter 19 down at last   at halfpast eight oclock the next morning horsemen came dashing in with the news that the germans were advancing in force stiffmany half frozen and half starvedit was an absolute relief to the men to have some break to the monotony of cold and hunger they were already assembled under arms and in a few minutes the artillery upon both sides was at work  i fear you will see that we shall be beaten today colonel tempe said to ralph as they mounted the men are worn out with hunger disgusted at the wretched mismanagement which sends them into a battle without having had food for twentyfour hours and with no prospect whatever of it for another twentyfour besides we ought to have been reinforced  our line is too long ralph there is neither direction nor management  for a time the french held their position well against the tremendous artillery fire which was maintained upon them gradually however the germans pushed their heavy masses of troops forwards and the french reserves had already been brought up  several of the mobile regiments showed signs of wavering general chanzy rode backwards and forwards along the front of the position exposing himself recklessly in order to give courage and confidence to his men cigar after cigar he smoked as tranquilly as if sitting in an armchair a hundred miles away from the din of battle at last after exchanging a few words with the generals of brigade he called ralphwho happened to be the only aidedecamp unemployedup to him  captain barclay he said ride at once to general sonis tell him that my divisionnot having received the promised reinforcementsmust fall back he has already sent to say he is hard pressed ask him to hold his ground if possible for another half hour by which time i shall have fallen back towards the position i left yesterday morningbut will draw rather to my right so as to keep our connections nearer and to afford him help if necessary  without a word ralph turned his horse and galloped off at full speed a quarter of an hours riding and he rode up to general sonis who was just calling upon several regiments among whom were the papal zouaves to make a charge  this fine body of menthe papal zouavesacquired and justly acquired more glory than any other french corps throughout the war they behaved upon every occasion magnificently in the first fight at orleans upon this 2nd of december and afterwards at the battle of le mans the zouaves of charette fought with the courage of lions a great many of them were men of good family all were inspired by the ardor and spirit of their chief their uniform was similar in cut to that of the french zouaves but was of a quiet gray color trimmed with a little red braid  ralph rode up and delivered his message  i am going to carry that position sir the general said and in that case i shall not have to fall back at all and general chanzy can close up on methrowing back his left so as not to be outflanked if you wait a few minutes you will see the result of this charge  now gentlemen  so saying he rode with his staff in front of the line  forward men he shouted drawing his sword  ralph had naturally fallen in with the staff and was now able to see and admire the daring of the proposed movement which if successful would have changed the fortunes of the day upon an eminence some threequarters of a mile distant were several batteries of artillery supported by a large body of infantry who extended to within about half the distance between the french line and their own reserves the fire was terrificso terrific that several of the french regiments refused to advance others started but withered away so fast under the deadly fire that only two corpsbesides the zouavespersevered to the end  the zouaves advanced at a double but with as much coolness as if on parade they did not fire a shot but made straight at the prussian infantry as they approached the enemys line general sonis and his staff fell in between the zouaves and a regiment of mobiles next to them in order not to interfere with the fire  for god and france charette shouted as he led the charge and the whole regiment responded as one man for god and france  so fierce was this onslaught that the prussian infantry refused to face it and fell back upon their supports still the zouaves rushed on and again the prussians fell back but the assault was growing more and more hopeless the zouaves were unsupported save by a few hundred men the other regiments were far in the rear the shot and shell were mowing lanes through them an army was in front  at last they halted colonel charette marched on in front waving his sword general sonis with his staff again rode forward it was heroic but it was heroic madness  again the zouaves advanced again a storm of shell poured upon them and then a regiment of german cavalry swept down there was a crash charette and his officers disappeared beneath the hoofs of the cavalry general sonis and his staff went down like straw before them but the zouaves stood firm fired a volley into them and thenhaving lost eight hundred men in that desperate attempt to retrieve the fortunes of the daythe remainder retreated sullenly with their faces to the foe  ralph barclay when the cavalry swept upon them had shot the first two of his foes with his revolver and had then been cut down by a tall german dragoon just at the moment that his horse fell dead shot through the head ralph had a momentary vision of gleaming hoofs above him and then he remembered nothing more until he came to himself hours afterwards  his first sensation was that of intense cold he endeavored to rise but was powerless to move hand or foot he lay quiet for a few minutes and then made another effort but with a similar want of success this time however he felt that his limbs would have moved had they not been fastened down by some weight  he now concentrated all his strength upon one arm it yielded suddenly and when it was free he was able to turn partly round so as to feel what it was that had confined it he found that his own blood and that of the horse had frozen his arm fast to the ground it required a considerable effort before he could get altogether free for he was stiff with the cold putting his sword up to his head he found that he had been saved by the very means which were now giving him so much pain the intense cold had frozen the blood as it flowed and stanched it more effectively than any surgeon could have done  ralphafter rubbing his hands and arms to restore circulationnow endeavored by the remains of twilight to see where he was and how he had been saved his horse lay next to him and almost covering him the poor animal had fallen on to its back or had rolled over afterwards and in the latter case it was fortunate indeed for ralph that it had not taken another half turn had it done so it would have crushed him to death as it was it had reached to within an inch or two of him partly concealing him from sight protecting him from the cold and also greatly diminishing his chance of being trampled upon by cavalry passing over  a short distance off ralph could see parties with lanterns and one of them seemed approaching far in his rear he could hear an occasional shot and it rushed across his mind at once that the french had been defeated and were falling back upon orleans these lights therefore must be in the hands of germans  the thought that a german prison awaited him roused ralph from his inactivity it flashed across his mind that as he had escaped before they would take care and give him but little chance of escaping again andalthough stiff and bruised from head to foot half frozen and faint from loss of bloodthe hope of liberty roused him to new exertion with some effort he got at the holster of his pistol in which was a flask of strong brandy and water which though icy cold had yet a sensibly warming influence the lights were still at some distance off and ralph after considerable trouble and after cutting the straps which fastened it to the saddle succeeded in getting at his fur overcoat this he put on picked up the cap of one of the german troopers who had fallen near and then walked slowly away over the deserted battle ground  ten minutes later he heard a horses hoofs upon the hard ground he cocked the pistolwhich had remained fastened to his belt when he fellpulled forward the german soldiers cap and walked quietly on  who goes there shouted a voice and two german officers rode up  it was far too dark now to distinguish faces  karl zimmerman of the seventh dragoons ralph said in german saluting  what are you doing here  i am servant to lieutenant falchen who fell today and i had been to look for his body it was somewhere about here when we charged the gray zouaves  but your regiment is miles off one of the officers said i saw them an hour ago  i dont know where they are sir ralph said for i had my head laid open with a sword bayonet just as i was cutting down the man i had seen shoot my master i was carried to the rear but the surgeon had gone on and my wound stopped of itself and when i reached the hospital the doctors were so busy that i asked leave to go and see if i could find my master  where are the ambulances now one of the officers asked as they turned to ride off  over in that direction look sir there are some of the searchers with lanterns they will direct you at once  thanks the officer said riding off good luck in your search  ralph had noticed a cottage standing by itself at the edge of a wood at some little distance from the bivouac of the night of the 30th of november and had stopped for a moment and asked a few questions of the woman who lived there she had appeared a kindhearted woman full of hatred for the invader and had two sons in the mobiles who had marched north when paris was first threatened and who were now besieged there for this cottage ralph determined to make in orderif the owners would receive himto take shelter in the house otherwise to find a refuge in the wood itself where he doubted not that they would assist him to lie hid for a few days he had no great fear of a very active search being made for fugitives at present as the prussians had only driven back two divisions of the french army and had ralph believed plenty of work on their hands for some time  it was fortunate for ralph that he had studied the ground so carefully for he soon came upon the road and the starswhich were shining brightlygave him his direction and bearings the battle had extended over the whole of this ground many times ralph could hear groans and saw in places dark forms thickly scattered over the groundshowing where a stand had been made or where a regiment had lain exposed for hours to an artillery fire  the distance was considerable to the place ralph had marked out for himself eight miles at least he thought for it was away behind what had two days before been chanzys left it was in ralphs state of feebleness a very long journey over and over again he had to sit down and rest he did not feel the cold now the fur coat and the exertion of walking kept his body in a glow he took great pains however not to exert himself so as to make himself too hot as he feared that his wound might break out if he did so he was fully twelve hours upon the road and daylight was just breaking in the east whenexhausted by hunger fatigue and loss of bloodhe crawled up to the door and knocked  there was a movement inside but it was not until he had knocked twice that a voice within asked  who is there  a wounded officer ralph said  there was a whispered talk inside  let me in my friends he said for the remembrance of your boys in paris there is no danger to you in doing so as if the germans come you have only to say you have a wounded officer i can pay you well  we dont care for pay the woman of the house said opening the door with a candle in her handand then falling back with a cry of horror at the object before her a man tottering with fatigue and with his face a perfect mask of stiffened blood  you do not remember me ralph said i am the captain of the staff who chatted to you two days ago about your boys in paris  poor boy the woman said compassionately come in  monsieur will pardon me she went on apologetically for speaking so but i called you the boy captain when i was telling my good man what a bright  but there what you want now is rest and food the question is where to put you we may be searched at any time though its not likely that we shall be for a few days the battle has gone away in the direction of orleans and we have not seen half a dozen men since i saw you two days ago  the first thing is to give you something warm you are half frozen sit down for a few minutes i will soon make a blaze  ralph sank downutterly exhausted and worn outin the settle by the fireplace and fell into a half doze while the woman lit a bright fire on the hearth in a few minutes she had drawn some liquor from the potaufeuthe soup potwhich stands by the fireside of every french peasant however poor and into which all the odds and ends of the household are thrown this liquor she put into a smaller pot broke some bread into it added an onionwhich she chopped up while it was warmingtogether with a little pepper and salt and in ten minutes from the time of ralphs entry she placed a bowl of this mixture smoking hot before him  at first he seemed too exhausted to eat but gradually his appetite returned and he finished off the hot broth  what shall i do to your wound sir the woman said it is a terrible sight at present  it is the cold which saved my life i fancy ralph said by stopping the bleeding but now it wants bathing in warm water for some time and then bandaging  but where are you going to put me  in the boys room upstairs sir it is just as they left it  i have no doubt it is very comfortable ralph said but all this country is certain to be scoured by the enemys cavalry i do not want to be taken prisoner and rather than that i would go and live out in the woods and only crawl here once a day for some food  the husband had now come downstairs and as he aided his wife to first bathe and then bandage the wound they talked over the matter and agreed that ralph could be hid in a loft over a shed a hundred yards from the house and very much concealed in the woods without much fear of discovery the farmer at once started to make the place as comfortable as he could and the wife followed with a couple of blankets a quarter of an hour later  ralph by this time could scarcely crawl along the fever consequent upon the wound the fatigue and the cold made his head throb so terribly that he could scarcely hold it up and had it not been for the assistance of the farmers wife he could not have crawled across the short distance to the shed the loft was low and small and when the wooden shutter of the windowor rather opening for it was unglazedwas closed it was lighted only by the light which came in at the crevices the shed was altogether of wood so that the shutterwhich happened to be at its backwould scarcely have been noticed while from the shed being high and the loft very low anyone inside would scarcely have suspected the existence of any loft at all it was reached by a ladder and trap door  the farmer assisted ralph up the ladder the shutter was open and ralph saw that the farmer had made a bed of straw upon which his wife was spreading one of the blankets ralph now took off his uniform and lay down and was covered first by the other blanket and then with his own furlined coat the farmers wife had thoughtfully brought a pillow with her and ralph in a few minutes was lying in whathad it not been for the pain of his woundwould have been intense comfort after the cold and fatigue his hostess went away and returned with a large jug of water and a glass which she put down within reach of his arm  there is nothing else you want she asked  nothing thank you except to sleep ralph said  i shall shut this shutter the farmer said enough light will come through the cracks to see well when your eyes get accustomed to the darkness i shall shut the trap close down after me as i go and lift down the ladder it is very light and my wife can easily put it into its place again we will come and see you again in the afternoon goodbye  goodbye ralph answered faintly and before the sound of their footsteps had died away he fell into a sort of feverish doze  for a time he turned uneasily muttered incoherent words and moved his hands restlessly soon however the effects of the cloth soaked in icycold water which the farmers wife had placed on the bandages over the wound began to subdue the feverish heat and in half an hour he was sleeping soundly and quietly he woke at last with a flash of light in his face and opening his eyes saw the good woman again bending over him  i am glad were her first words i thought for a moment you were dead  no no ralph said with a faint smile a long way from that yet my sleep has done me a world of good what oclock is it  nine oclock his hostess said i could not come before for i have had several parties going past and the house was searched once i kept on wondering whether you wanted me until i nearly worked myself into a fever  thank you ralph said i have been all the better for being allowed to sleep on i have had nearly thirteen hours of it i feel queer about the head but otherwise i feel all right  i am terribly thirsty  i have got nothing but water to offer you the woman said the germans drank the last drop of our wine up months ago but i had a few apples and i have roasted them and put them in this jug of water it will give it a taste and is good for fever  in this jug is some herb tea which you must drink when you feel feverish  and now do you feel as if you could eat some broth  that i do ralph said  his hostess put her arm under him and raised him up into a sitting posture in which she retained him by kneeling down beside him and holding him up as if he had been a child then she gave him a basin of bread broth and a drink of water shook up his pillow arranged the things over him and put a fresh cloth dipped in water on his head  here is a box of matches she said and here is the water and herb tea in reach of your arm youre not cold are you  no thank you ralph said and in spite of the sleep i have had i feel as if i could go off again till morning comfortably  be patient if i am late the woman said i will come as soon as i can if i am late you will know that there are germans about  ralphs idea of his capacity for sleep turned out correct it was still dark when he woke but striking a match he found that it was nearly seven oclock he at once blew out the match felt for the apple water took a drink and then nestled down deep into the fur coat  it will be getting light in another hour he said to himself its awfully cold too but i am better off here than i should be in the field i hope she will be here soon i want to know if she has any news well there is only an hour to lay awake and almost as he murmured the words ralph dropped off again and slept until ten oclock  this time he woke with the slight creaking which the trap door made  how are you today monsieur le capitaine his hostess said  i am getting on capitally thanks to your care ralph said and what have you there  your breakfast and some plaster my husband started yesterday evening to walk to the doctor who lives twelve miles off he told him all about you but the doctor would not come himself however he sent word that the wound was to be washed well twice a day with warm water and that a little lint is to be laid in it each time after the bathing and when the inflammation ceases to look angry i am to draw the edges together as closely as i can and strap them together with these strips of plaster  it is very kind of your husband ralph said very kind did the doctor say how long i should be before i could be about again  no the woman said jacques asked him but he said that he could not say without seeing the wound and examining you jacques described its position coming down from the back of the head taking off just a little bit of the top of the ear and then ending on the cheekbone he said that monsieur le capitaine must have a head as thick as a wall or it would have killed him  ralph smiled and his hostess set to work to carry out her instructions  shall i take away your uniform and hide it away so that in case the enemy search and find you they will have no proof against you  no no ralph said the uniform shows i am not a franc tireur and so will prevent my being hung and you having your house burnt over your head besides which i should be entitled to be treated as an officer my uniform is the best protection for us all  have you any news of what is going on  we heard firing yesterday the woman said and today we can hear a constant booming from the direction of orleans  ralph listened but the bandage prevented his hearing anything  you are very kind he said but you can hardly think how i want to be off however i fear that i am here for a week at the very least just think what i am missing  it seems to me the woman said you are missing a great many chances of being killed which i should consider to be a very fortunate miss indeed i should not like jacques to have that gash on the head but i would a great deal rather that he was lying here wounded just as you are than to know that he was in the middle of all that fighting at orleans  be patient my friend we will do our best for you if you have no fever tomorrow jacques will try and buy some meat and some wine for you at one of the villages and then you will soon get quite strong  when ralph had eaten his breakfast he again laid down and his kind hostess left him as her husband was obliged to be out and at work and it was necessary that she should be at home to answer any straggling troops of the enemy who might pass  i wish i had tim with me ralph said to himself tim would amuse me and make me laugh it would be desperately cold for him i am all right under my blanket and this warm coat well i suppose i must try to sleep as many hours away as i can    chapter 20 crossing the lines   ralph was destined to a longer stay upon his hay bed in the loft than he had anticipated the next day instead of being better he was a good deal worse inflammation had again set in and he was feverish and incoherent in his talk he was conscious of this himself by seeing the dismay in the face of the nurse when he had been rambling on to her for some time in english  at last with an effort he commanded his attention and said to her  how far is it from here to orleans  seventeen miles she said  look here he said you are very kind and i know that you do not want to be paid for your kindness but i am well off and i know you have lost your horse and cow and so you must let me pay you for what you do for me  i am afraid i am going to have fever i want your husband to go into orleans the prussians went in yesterday you say and so your husband will not have to cross any outposts to get there there is an english ambulance there i will write a line in pencil and i am sure they will give him some fever medicine and anything else i may require please feel in the breast pocket of my coat you will find a pocket book with a pencil in it  the woman did as he told her and ralph with a great effort wrote  i am an englishman though a captain in the french service i am wounded with a saber in the head and am sheltered in a loft inflammation has set in and i fear fever i am obliged indeed to make a great effort to master it sufficiently to write this please send some fever medicine by the bearer and some arrowroot a lemon or two would be a great blessing  ralph barclay  he then tore out the leaf folded and directed it to the head of the english ambulance orleans  how is he to know the english ambulance  it has a red cross on a white ground as all the others have and an english flagthat is a flag with red and white stripes going from corner to corner and crossing each other in the middle but anyone will tell him  i am sure he will set out at once the woman said and left the loft  in ten minutes she returned  he has started she said but not to orleans my husband directly i gave him the message said that he had heard that there was an english ambulance at terminiers attending to the wounded picked up on the battlefield it is only five miles from here  thank god for that ralph said  three hours later the farmer returned with a bottle of medicine some arrowroot lemons a bottle of wine some liebigs essence of meatfor making brothand a message that the english surgeon would ride over as soon as he could get away the farmer had given him detailed instructions for finding the house but was afraid of stopping to act as his guide as had he been seen walking by the side of the surgeons horse the suspicions of any german they might encounter would be at once excited  the surgeon arrived an hour later and was at once taken to ralphs bedside ralph however could not speak to or even recognize the presence of his countryman for he was in a high state of fever the surgeon examined his wound carefully  i think he will get over it he said to the farmers wife it is a nasty cut but there is nothing dangerous in the wound itself it is the general shock to the system together with the hardships and suffering he had gone through he is a mere boynot above seventeen or eighteen he says in his note he is a captain but it can hardly be so  he is a captain sir there is his uniform hanging up  yes the surgeon said that is the uniform of a captain in the staff and he has got the commanders button of the legion of honor i wonder who he can be  ralph barclay he said thoughtfully looking at the pencil note ralph had sent him ah now i remember the name i thought it was familiar to me this is the young englishman who made his way through the lines into paris with dispatches he is a fine young fellow we must do what we can for him  could you take him into your hospital sir the woman asked  he will be better where he is if you will continue to nurse him  yes i will do that but i thought he would be so much better looked after in the hospital  no the surgeon said that is just what he would not be every room is literally crowded with wounded and wounds do infinitely better in fresh pure air like this than in a room with a close atmosphere and other bad wounds  the fever medicine i sent over will last him for some days i have brought over a tin of little biscuits give him the fever medicine every two hours until there is a change and whenever you can get him to take it give him a little broth made of a spoonful of the essence of meat in a liter of boiling water or for a change some arrowroot i will show you how to make it when we get back to the house  can you manage to stay with him he will want a good deal of looking after for the next two days  yes sir i was talking to jacques about it today he will go over to the next villageit is only a mile awayand will fetch my sister who lives there to keep house for a bit  that is capital the surgeon said and now watch attentively how i put this bandage on and do it the same way once a day when you have put the bandage on you must put wet cloths to his head as long as he remains delirious i am awfully busy but i will ride over again in three or four days to see how he is getting on  by the way it may be an advantage to you if i give you a paper signed by me to say that you are taking care of a wounded french officer at my request asalthough you wished to send him to the ambulancei refused because in the first place he could not bear moving and in the second the ambulance was as full as it could possibly hold that will clear you in case any german parties come along and find him  it was a week before ralph opened his eyes with any consciousness of what he saw he looked round with a vague wonderment as to where he was in a minute or two a look of recognition came into his face looking round he saw that there were changes a small piece had been sawn out of the shutter so as to let in air and light while it remained closed a table and a chair were beside his bed in a corner of the loft was a small flat stove with a few embers glowing upon it and a saucepan standing upon them upon the opposite side of the loft to that where he was lying was a heap of hay similar to his own with a figure rolled up in a blanket lying on it  for some time ralph thought all this over in the vague wondering way peculiar to people recovering from a long illness most he puzzled over the occupant of the other bed and at last concluded that it was some fugitive like himself for some time he lay and watched the figure until presently it moved threw off the blanket and rose and to his surprise he saw that it was his nurse  thanks to all the saints she exclaimed when she saw him looking at her you are better at last i think that i was asleep too but you were sleeping so quiet that i thought i would take a nap for i was so sleepy  how long have i been here ralph asked  just a week from the time the fever took you the english doctor came over and saw you and sent lots of things for you and said you were not to be left so i had the bed made up here and my sister came over to take care of jacques and now you must not talk any more drink this broth and then go off to sleep again  ralph complied he was too tired and weak to ask any more questions and it was not until next day that he heard of the obstinate battles which general chanzy had foughton the 7th 8th and 10thnear beauguency  thank goodness ralph said we cant have been very badly beaten if we were able to fight three drawn battles within about twenty miles of a first defeat  for the next two days ralph improved in health then he had a relapse and was very ill for some days then he began steadily but slowly to gain strength it was three weeks after his arrival at the cottage before he could walk another week before he had recovered his strength sufficiently to think of moving  one of his first anxietiesafter recovering consciousness after his first and longest attack of feverhad been upon the subject of the terrible anxiety which they must be feeling at home respecting him they would have heard from colonel tempe that he was missing and as he would have been seen to fall it was probable that he was reported as dead ralphs only consolation was that as the germans were at dijon the communication would be very slow and uncertain and although it was now ten days since the engagement it was possibleif he could but get a letter sent at oncethat they would get it nearly if not quite as quickly as the one from colonel tempe especially if as was very probable the colonel would be a great deal too engaged during the weeks tremendous fighting which succeeded the day upon which ralph was wounded for him to be able to write letters  the first time that he saw the english surgeon he mentioned this anxiety and the doctor at once offered to take charge of a letter and to forward it with his own in the military post bag to the headquarters of the ambulance at versailles together with a note to the head of the ambulance there begging him to get it sent on in the first bag for dijon in this way it would arrive at its destination within four or five days at most of its leaving orleans  it was on the 2nd of januaryexactly a month from the date of the fight in which he was woundedthat after very many thanks to his kind host and hostess and after forcing a handsome present upon them ralph startedin a peasants dress which had been bought for himfor orleans he had still plenty of money with him for he had drawn the reward of fifty thousand francs in paris the greater portion of this money he had paid into the hands of a banker at tours but percy and he had kept out a hundred pounds each knowing by experience how useful it is in case of being taken prisoner to have plenty of money ralphs wound was still bound up with plaster and to conceal it a rabbitskin cap with flaps had been bought so that by letting down the flaps and tying them under the chin the greater part of the cheeks were covered  the farmer had made inquiries among his neighbors and finding one who was going into orleans with a horse and cart he had asked him to give ralph a lift to that place the start had been effected early and it was three oclock when they drove into orleans here ralph shook hands with his driverwho wished him a safe journey homeand strolled leisurely down the streets  orleans presented a miserable aspect the inhabitants kept themselves shut up in their houses as much as possible the bishop was kept a prisoner by the prussians in his own palace troops were quartered in every house the inhabitants were for the most part in a state of poverty and the shops would have been all shut had not the prussians ordered them to be kept open the streets were thronged with german troops and long trains of carts were on their way through with provisions for the army these carts were requisitioned from the peasantry and were frequently taken immense distances from home the owneror driver if the owner was rich enough to pay onebeing obliged to accompany them  many were the sad scenes witnessed in these convoys the grief of a father dragged away not knowing what would become of his wife and children during his absence the anguish of a laborer at seeing his horse fall dead with fatigue knowing well that he had no means of taking his cart home again and that he had nothing to do but to return to his home and tell his wife that the horse and cartwhich constituted his sole wealthwere gone  ralph waited until late in the afternoon he saw a long train halt by one of the bridges it was evidently intending to cross the next morning and go down south in a short time the horses were taken out and fastened by halters to the carts two or three soldiers took up their posts as sentries and the drivers were suffered to leavethe germans knowing that there was no chance of their deserting and leaving their horses and carts  the poor fellows dispersed through the town those who had any money bought food those who had not begged for the germans allowed them no rations and left them to shift for themselvesor starveas they liked ralph joined in conversation with a group of these who were relating their hardships to two or three sympathetic listeners an old man especially was almost heartbroken his wife was dying and he had been forced from her bedside  what could i do he asked pitifully i was a carrier my horse and cart were all i had in the world if i had not gone with them they were lost for ever what was i to do  no one could answer him but when the party had broken up ralph went up to him  how much are your horse and cart worth he asked  the horse is worth five hundred francs he said the cart is an old onetwo hundred and fifty would pay for it it is not much you see but it is all i have  look here old man ralph said i am not what i look i am a french officer and i want to get down near the prussian outposts but without passes i could not get on besides i have been wounded and am too weak to walk far i will give you the seven hundred and fifty francs which are the value of your horse and cart and will take your place as driver so that you can start back at once to your wife do you agree  the old man was so affected with joy that he burst into tears  god bless you sir he said you have saved my life and my poor wifes life too  very well it is a bargain then ralph said here is half the money you shall have the rest tomorrow  now you must go with me tomorrow morning at the hour for starting and tell the officer in charge that i am a nephew of yoursliving here but out of work at presentand that you have arranged with me to drive the cart as long as its wanted and then to take it home again  after a few more words the peasant took him back and showed him his cart in order that he might know where to find him in the morning  we start at daybreak he said so you had better be here by halfpast six  where do you sleep ralph asked  i oh i dont sleep much i lie down for a bit underneath the carts and then walk about to warm myself  take this warm fur coat of mine ralph said it will keep you warm tonight anyhow i shant want it i shall get a bed somewhere  the coat was the one ralph had worn on his night walk after being wounded he had had all the braid and the fur of the collar and cuffs taken off and had had it purposely dirtied so that it was no longer a garment which could attract attention on the back of a man with a cart  after some difficulty ralph got a bed and was at the agreed place at the appointed time the old man went up to the prussian sergeant in command and told the tale ralph had dictated to him the sergeant agreed to the arrangement with a brief nod the old man handed ralph his whip and returned him the fur coat which ralph was glad enough to put on for the morning was bitterly cold and ralphenfeebled by his illnessfelt it keenly in another five minutes the carts were in motion across the bridge and then away due south  for half an hour ralph walked by the side of his cart andbeing by that time thoroughly warmhe jumped up in the cart and rode during the rest of the day getting down and walkingfor a short time onlywhen he found his feet getting numbed with the cold  in the afternoon they arrived at la ferte some fifteen miles from orleans there they remained for the night there were not very many troops here and ralph could have obtained a bed by paying well for it but he feared to attract attention by the possession of unusual funds and therefore slept in a hay loft afraid in spite of his fur coat to sleep in the open air  the next morning the train was divided twenty of the carts going down towards romorantin while the restnow fifteen in numberkept on towards salbris ralphs cart formed part of this latter division the night after they left la ferte they halted at la motte beuvron where there was a strong force of germans the following day only four carts continued their route to salbris ralph happening again to be among them he had regretted two days before that he had not formed part of the division for romorantin as from that place he would have been less than twenty miles from tours which the prussians had not yet entered but as he had the good fortune to go on to salbris he did not mindas salbris like romorantin was one of the most advanced stations  they arrived late in the afternoon and the carts were at once unloaded the sergeant in charge told them to wait while he got their papers for them and in ten minutes he returned  you will have tomorrow to rest your horses and the next day a train will start for the north your work is over now as there is nothing to go back here are the passes for you saying that you have carried goods down here for the army and are therefore to return back without your carts being further requisitioned  ralph put up his horse and cart for an hour in the village while he went to search for some farm house upon which no prussian soldiers were quartered he was unable for some time to find one but at last over a mile from the town he found a small place which had escaped the attention of the prussian quartermaster and where there was a small unoccupied stable ralph soon struck a bargain with its owner returned to salbris mounted his cart drove out and was soon settled in the little farm house  he anticipated no great difficulty in passing out through the outposts as there was no french force of any importance near and the german troops interfered but little with the movements of the country people the affair however turned out more easy than he had anticipated for towards morning he was awoke by the distant sound of bugles  something is up he said to himself either a french attack a general advance or a recall if it should be the latter i am in luck  it turned out to be as ralph hoped the peasant in whose house he was stopping went into salbris early and came back with the news that there was no longer a german there orders had come for them to fall back towards orleans  i am not at all surprised ralph said when he heard it for orleans was emptying fast of troops this sudden march of bourbaki for the east and the necessity to reinforce frederick charles near vendome must try even prussian resources to the utmost  half an hour later ralph was jogging along on his way to vierzon there he found that the railway was open to bourges from which town he should have no difficulty in getting on to dijon he soon found a purchaser for his horse and cart at ten pounds and the next morning started on his way home    chapter 21 home   it was a long journey from vierzon to dijon at bourges ralph had taken advantage of a delay of some hoursnecessitated by the fact that no train was goingto get some suitable clothes instead of the peasants suit in which he had traversed the lines he had of course brought his papers with him so that he had no difficulty whatever in getting on by the train but the train itself made but slow work of it bourbaki had passed west only the week before with all his army upon his march to the relief of belfort and the railway was completely choked however ralph was not inclined to grumble at the cause of his delay for it was only upon bourbakis approach that the germans had evacuated dijonwhich was now held by garibaldis irregulars and a considerable force of mobiles  so great were the delays that it was evening when the train reached dijon ralph had scarcely stepped out on to the platform when percy bounded upon him and threw his arms round his neck  dear dear old ralph thank god you are back again  my dear percy where did you spring from  i have been home five days i was still down at marseilles when i heard that dijon was open again and i came straight up  and how are you ralph  oh i am getting all right again how are they all at home  wellquite wellbut dreadfully anxious about you  by this time the boys were out of the station and were walking homeward  but you have not told me how you happened to be at the station  well i was waiting there just on the chance of seeing you mamma was so dreadfully anxious about you that i wanted to do something at any rate i could not sit quiet at home there are never more than two trains with passengers in a day sometimes only one so i have been staying down in the town most of the days since i came homehaving paid one of the railway people to send me word directly the train was telegraphed as starting from dole  how long is it since my letter arrived  nearly three weeks ralph fortunately it came four or five days before a letter from tempe saying that he feared you were killed not having heard again they were terribly anxious  i had no means of writing ralph said the english ambulancethrough whom my letter was sentmoved down to vendome the very day after i wrote and i had no other way of sending my letter  i said it was something of that sort i pointed out to them that it was evident by what you said that the fever had passed off and that you only wanted strength but that being in hiding of course you could not write i gave you three weeks to get strong enough to start and four or five days to manage to get through the lines so that by my calculation you were just due when you arrived  it has pulled you down ralph very much i wish i had been there to nurse you  thank you percy fortunately i did fall into very good hands and was well looked after i hope papa has not been over anxious about me  i think he has been nervous ralph but he did not show it but talked cheerfully to keep up mamma and milly  and are you quite strong again percy  yes i think i am nearly as strong as ever ralph  there we are just at the house now you had better wait outside while i go in and let them know gradually that you are home i came in like a fool suddenly and mamma faintedshe says for the first time in her lifeand milly went into hysterics and cried and laughed so wildly that you might have heard her in dijon she frightened me nearly out of my senses  ralph remained accordingly outside the door while percy went in alone the others had finished tea  you are a little late percy mrs barclay said we gave you twenty minutes law it is not the least matter your being late but i do not think it is wise to be out these bitter nights until you are quite strong  i am quite strong mamma as strong as ever percy laughed but his laugh was in spite of himself a little unnatural  his father looked sharply up  percy sat down and drank a little of the tea his mother handed to him  i waited for the train to come in he said andof course it may not be sobut i heard of someone who by the description seemed to be ralph  what was it percy what was it milly cried while her mother gazed at him with a pale face and appealing eyes  dont agitate yourself mamma dearyou see it may not be true after allbut among the people in the train was one who had come straight from bourges i spoke to him and he said that he had heardby a friend who had come straight from vierzonthat a young officer had just arrived there in disguise who had been wounded and in hiding ever since the capture of orleans you know mamma it is just the time i calculated he would be coming and from the fact of his being a young staff officer and in disguise i have very little doubt it is ralph  captain barclay rose from his seat andstanding for a moment behind his wifes chairlooked at percy and then at the door inquiringly percy nodded  captain barclay leaned over and kissed his wife  thank god dear for all his mercies another day or two and we shall be having him home  thank god indeed mrs barclay said but though i hopethough i try to think it was himperhaps it was not perhaps  no mamma percy said from some particulars he gave and from what he said i feel almost surei may say i am quite sureit is ralph i would not say so you know unless i felt very certain  mrs barclay felt that he would not and fell into her husbands arms crying softly with happiness  milly was no longer in the room she had caught the glance between her father and percy and had rightly interpreted it she had risen to her feet but a warning gesture from captain barclay had checked the cry of gladness on her lips and she had stolen quietly from the room closed the door noiselessly had flown to the front door and out into the road beyond and was now crying happily in ralphs arms  and when do you think he can get here richard mrs barclay asked her husband  soon dearquite soon he answered he may come tomorrow he would be certain to come almost as quickly as the news  oh how happy i am mrs barclay said thank god for his mercies to think that tomorrow i may have both my boys back again  will there be another train in tonight percy captain barclay asked  quite possibly percy said indeed indeedand he hesitatedyou see i walked up fast it is just possible that he may have arrived by this train  mrs barclay understood now  he is come she exclaimed looking up i know it now  captain barclay took her up in his arms  you can bear it cant you melanie yes dear he has come  percy saw that it was safe now he went to the door and opened it ralph was standing outside in readiness and in another moment his mother was in his arms  later in the evening captain barclay said to ralph  i suppose tomorrow you will obtain a medical certificate and write to general chanzy saying that you are alive but unable to rejoin  yes ralph answered i suppose that will be the best plan i must have a months rest  that means my dear boy that you will not have to go out any more another month will see the end of the struggleor at any rate if the end has not absolutely arrived it will be unmistakable  the game is i am convinced altogether lost a fortnight ago i had still hope chanzy and bourbaki had each an army nearly or quite equal to that of prince frederick charles he could not attack one in force without leaving the road to paris open to the other  bourbaki has come upon this mad expedition to the east and you will see prince frederick charles will throw his whole strength upon chanzy crush him and then attend to bourbaki bourbaki may relieve belfort but in that corner of france what is he to do prussian reinforcements are coming down to werder every day troops are marching on this town from paris and if bourbaki is not wonderfully quick we shall have another sedan here  after the defeat of these the last two armies of france it would be madness to continue the war paris must surrender for there would be no further possibility of relief and there would be no advantage whatever in enduring further sufferings  no my boys i said go when i thought that there was a possibility of saving france you have done your dutymore than your duty it would be worse than follyit would be wickednessto voluntarily put your lives into danger when success has ceased to be possible i should be the last man to hinder you from what was your duty i said go before when few fathers would have said so i would say go again now if your duty called you but as you can both obtain sick leave for another six weeks i say take that leave do not do more than your duty for heroism is now of no use to france  i agree with you altogether papa ralph said i have seen and had quite enough fighting for my lifetime of course if the war goes on percy and i as officers must return to our duty but i am willing to obtain all the sick leave i can get for although i still believe in the individual bravery of the french soldiers i am quite convinced that it is altogether out of the question thatwith their want of organization want of generals want of officers want of discipline want of everythingthey can drive out the magnificent armies of germany  has percy got his leave extended  yes percy said i am fairly well but i am still shaky i have not quite got over that swim and the surgeon said without my applying for it that i must have prolonged rest so at the end of the month he extended it for two months longer  i thoroughly agree with you both we have had quite enough of it we shall always have the satisfaction that we did our duty to france and our rank and these ribbonsand he touched the rosette of the legion of honor in his buttonholewill prove that we have distinguished ourselves we have had great good fortune hitherto it might turn next time  and so it was settled that the boys should remain at home for the next two months by which time they agreed with their father the resistance would be fairly worn out ralph wrote to general chanzy relating the whole circumstances of his absence general chanzy wrote in replyin spite of the demands upon his timesaying how pleased he was that ralph had escaped as he had quite given him up he ended his note by saying that he had already mentioned his name in dispatches and should now make a fresh report  colonel tempeor rather general tempe for he now commanded a brigadewrote also to congratulate him one portion of his letter contained bad news for he mentioned that tim had lost an arm at the battle of the 8th december but that he was now doing well  those were exciting days at dijon the news of the victory at villersexel followed by the fighting which ended in the capture of montbeliard and then the obstinate contests near belfort when bourbaki in vain endeavored to drive back the germans and to relieve the besieged townall this kept the excitement up at fever heat  it was not fated that the war should end without the boys seeing service once more for upon the 21st heavy firing was heard upon the northwest of dijon the barclays house was on the southwest of the town upon the northwest the ground rises in two steep hillsor rather one steep hill with two summits about a mile apart one of these summits is called talant the other fontaine les dijon behind the latter and upon even higher groundat a distance of two and three miles respectivelylay the villages of daix and hauteville  it was about ten oclock in the morning that the boys heard the faint boom of a cannon  listen papa percy shouted there are cannon the prussians are attacking the heights on the other side  captain barclay came out into the garden and listened for a while with them the enemy had taken up positions upon some of the numerous heights surrounding and were playing upon the batteries at talant fontaine les dijon daix and hauteville the french replied vigorously and it was evident that they were stronger in artillery than were the enemy  i fancy captain barclay said that it is no attack it is merely i think a fire opened to occupy our attention in order that a body of troops may pass along to the northward of dijon to fall upon bourbakis rear however my place is with my company of national guards there is no fear of an attack at present but they will get under arms no doubt  we will go down into the town with you papa  the firing continued until five oclock when it gradually died away the germans retiring an hour later the greater portion of the troops marched back to the town the enemy they reported were not over 15000 strong while in all the garibaldians and mobilized national guards in the town were 30000 to 40000 strong the french were also much stronger in artillery  captain barclay returned home with the boys they sat up late talking over the affair and it was nearly midnight when they went up to their rooms suddenly they were startled by a fresh outburst of fire upon the heights in a minute or two all the household were in the garden  it is a night attack captain barclay said and judging by the sound they are in earnest i can hear musketry as well as artillery  as they listened it came nearer  they have taken daix and hauteville ralph said what shall we do papa we cant stay here quiet it is our plain duty to go down and report ourselves to general pelissier  i think you ought to do so captain barclay answered gravely  the boys went off to put on their uniformsfor ralph had replaced the one he had left behind in the cottage near orleans  i do not think you need be uneasy melanie captain barclay said to his wife it is our duty to go but i hardly think that they can have been reinforced in sufficient strength to attack the town  the boys were soon down  goodbye mamma goodbye milly dont be alarmed about us we have no horses and there can be no risk of our being sent on any perilous service tonight  two silent kisses and then father and sons hurried away towards the town  they have taken fontaine les dijon ralph said we shall soon see if they are in earnest  dijon they found in utter confusion mounted orderlies galloped about the troops were all under arms engineers were at work crenelating the walls and houses upon the side threatened with attack general garibaldi was sitting in his carriage in readiness to move in any direction instantly general pelissierwho commanded the mobilized guardswas in his office and staff officers came in and out with reports every five minutes  the boys entered and briefly reported themselves for service they had already reported their presence in the place upon their arrival  thank you gentlemen he said i do not think that you can be of any use just at present but if the germans press the attack i shall be greatly obliged in that case please dismount two of the orderlies and take their horses  the night passed off however quietly the germans satisfied with the advantage remained in the positions they had taken and the french prepared to drive them back again in the morning  at daybreak the troops began to pour out from the town and the cannonade commenced with greater fury on both sides two of the orderlies in obedience to general pelissiers orders gave up their horses to the barclays who rode out with the generals staff the prussians had evidently been reinforced in the night but the french nevertheless gained ground gradually after several hours heavy cannonading the mobilises were ordered to take the position of fontaine les dijon with the bayonet three zouaveswho happened to be presenttook their places at the head of the column and at the double they went up the hill amidst a storm of shot and shell the germans did not await the assault but fell back upon daix  the spirit of the mobilises was now up and still led by the three zouaves they dashed forward the resistance here was obstinate but the germans were driven back with great loss the pursuers gave them no rest but went forward at the double and drove them out of hauteville at the bayonets point thus winning back all the positions lost in the night the barclays had little to do during the affair as after the orders had once been given the spirit of the troops carried them on over everything the loss upon both sides was considerable and one of general werders sons was among the prisoners taken by the french  the fight over the boys returned home for a few hours their father had come in half an hour before them  the next morning they returned at daybreak to dijon the prussians had received considerable reinforcements in the night and had executed a long detour advancing this time by the langres road nearly due north of the city they left the road and took up their position upon a plateau near the village of pouilly about three miles from dijon the french positions were about a mile nearer to the town extending from the foot of fontaine les dijon through the villages of saint marten and fontaine  from the morning until three in the day a heavy artillery fire was kept up on both sides at that hour the prussians gave signs of an intention to advance their artillery took up fresh positions their fire increased in rapidity and it was evident that the crisis of the day was at hand up to this time the boys had had but little to do sitting on their horses or leaning against them they had chatted with the officers of the general staff at this period however general garibaldi drew up and there was a brief consultation between him and general pelissier a few hasty orders were given and in an instant the whole of the staff were dashing away to different parts of the ground  charge in line was the order and forming shoulder to shoulder the garibaldians and mobiles moved forward in a grand line a mile and a half long uttering loud and inspiriting cheers the boys had been sent to the regiments next to each other and their message delivered they joined each other and rode on with the advancing line  this is grand ralph percy said enthusiastically we have seen a good many defeats we are going to wind up with a victory at last  for a while the germans stood their ground pouring a shower of shot and shell into the advancing french but the dash and go of the latterexcited by their successes of the two preceding dayswere irresistible the germans wavered and fell back as the french advanced and from that moment the fate of the day was decided isolated german regiments fought desperately but in vain the french pushed them back from position to position until nightfall covered the retreat  the german loss was very heavy and the french in addition to a considerable number of prisoners had the satisfaction of taking a german colorthe only one captured throughout the war  this was the last fight in which the barclays took part during the war the boys escaped unhurt as did their father who had joined one of the regiments of mobiles and had advanced with them  the events followed fast day after day in rapid succession they heard of the defeat of chanzy at le mans the retreat of bourbaki the terrible sufferings of the troops as they fell back upon the swiss frontier for refuge simultaneously with the news of this retreat came the intelligence of the surrender of paris and of the armistice and grieving over frances misfortune they were yet heartily rejoiced that the hopeless contest was over  no sooner were the preliminaries of peace signed than captain barclay carried out his intention of leaving for england monsieur duburg had already agreed to purchase the cottage and adjoining grounds which he intends for louis when he marries the barclays were sorry to leave their uncle and cousins but there was no great grief with reference to the separation from madame duburg  general tempe they parted from with regret that officers fighting days were over for he lost a leg in the battle before le mans  ralph obtained the step as major in consequence of general chanzys report in his favor but he never put on the uniform of the rank nor is it likely that he ever will do so although he hopes some day to attain the grade in the british service he is at present studying hard for an examination in the artillery which if practical knowledge goes for anything he is pretty certain to get  percy has had enough of fighting and his present idea is that he shall go to the bar but he has plenty of time before him yet both never boast of their achievementsindeed are straightforward unaffected english lads stilland it is only to intimate friends that they ever speak of their adventures in the war  the barclays live now a short distance out of london and the pony chaise in which captain barclay drives his wife and milly can be seen any day on the richmond road if you stop and watch it turn into the little drive up to the house you will observe that a onearmed manwho has previously been busy in the gardenthrows down his spade and takes the ponies off to the stables and should he not happen to be at the front of the house as the ponies draw up you will hear milly summon him with a loud call of tim
