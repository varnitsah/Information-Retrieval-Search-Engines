8001849	i inscribe this book of adventure to my son arthur john rider haggard in the hope that in days to come he and many other boys whom i shall never know may in the acts and thoughts of allan quatermain and his companions as herein recorded find something to help him and them to reach to what with sir henry curtis i hold to be the highest rank whereto we can attain  the state and dignity

xxii   how umslopogaas held the stair xxiii  i have spoken     introduction    december 23  i have just buried my boy my poor handsome boy of whom i was so proud and my heart is broken  it is very hard having only one son to lose him thus but gods will be done  who am i that i should complain  the great wheel of fate rolls on like a juggernaut and crushes us all in turn some soon some late  it does not matter when in the end it crushes us all  we do not prostrate ourselves before it like the poor indians we fly hither and thither  we cry for mercy but it is of no use the black fate thunders on and in its season reduces us to powder  poor harry to go so soon just when his life was opening to him  he was doing so well at the hospital he had passed his last examination with honours and i was proud of them much prouder than he was i think  and then he must needs go to that smallpox hospital  he wrote to me that he was not afraid of smallpox and wanted to gain the experience and now the disease has killed him and i old and grey and withered am left to mourn over him without a chick or child to comfort me  i might have saved him too  i have money enough for both of us and much more than enough  king solomons mines provided me with that but i said no let the boy earn his living let him labour that he may enjoy rest  but the rest has come to him before the labour  oh my boy my boy  i am like the man in the bible who laid up much goods and builded barns  goods for my boy and barns for him to store them in and now his soul has been required of him and i am left desolate i would that it had been my soul and not my boys  we buried him this afternoon under the shadow of the grey and ancient tower of the church of this village where my house is it was a dreary december afternoon and the sky was heavy with snow but not much was falling  the coffin was put down by the grave and a few big flakes lit upon it  they looked very white upon the black cloth  there was a little hitch about getting the coffin down into the grave  the necessary ropes had been forgotten so we drew back from it and waited in silence watching the big flakes fall gently one by one like heavenly benedictions and melt in tears on harrys pall  but that was not all  a robin redbreast came as bold as could be and lit upon the coffin and began to sing  and then i am afraid that i broke down and so did sir henry curtis strong man though he is and as for captain good i saw him turn away too even in my own distress i could not help noticing it   the above signed allan quatermain is an extract from my diary written two years and more ago  i copy it down here because it seems to me that it is the fittest beginning to the history that i am about to write if it please god to spare me to finish it  if not well it does not matter  that extract was penned seven thousand miles or so from the spot where i now lie painfully and slowly writing this with a pretty girl standing by my side fanning the flies from my august countenance  harry is there and i am here and yet somehow i cannot help feeling that i am not far off harry  when i was in england i used to live in a very fine house  at least i call it a fine house speaking comparatively and judging from the standard of the houses i have been accustomed to all my life in africa  not five hundred yards from the old church where harry is asleep and thither i went after the funeral and ate some food for it is no good starving even if one has just buried all ones earthly hopes  but i could not eat much and soon i took to walking or rather limping  being permanently lame from the bite of a lion  up and down up and down the oakpanelled vestibule for there is a vestibule in my house in england  on all the four walls of this vestibule were placed pairs of horns  about a hundred pairs altogether all of which i had shot myself  they are beautiful specimens as i never keep any horns which are not in every way perfect unless it may be now and again on account of the associations connected with them  in the centre of the room however over the wide fireplace there was a clear space left on which i had fixed up all my rifles  some of them i have had for forty years old muzzleloaders that nobody would look at nowadays  one was an elephant gun with strips of rimpi or green hide lashed round the stock and locks such as used to be owned by the dutchmen  a roer they call it  that gun the boer i bought it from many years ago told me had been used by his father at the battle of the blood river just after dingaan swept into natal and slaughtered six hundred men women and children so that the boers named the place where they died weenen or the place of weeping and so it is called to this day and always will be called and many an elephant have i shot with that old gun  she always took a handful of black powder and a threeounce ball and kicked like the very deuce  well up and down i walked staring at the guns and the horns which the guns had brought low and as i did so there rose up in me a great craving   i would go away from this place where i lived idly and at ease back again to the wild land where i had spent my life where i met my dear wife and poor harry was born and so many things good bad and indifferent had happened to me  the thirst for the wilderness was on me i could tolerate this place no more i would go and die as i had lived among the wild game and the savages  yes as i walked i began to long to see the moonlight gleaming silvery white over the wide veldt and mysterious sea of bush and watch the lines of game travelling down the ridges to the water  the ruling passion is strong in death they say and my heart was dead that night but independently of my trouble no man who has for forty years lived the life i have can with impunity go coop himself in this prim english country with its trim hedgerows and cultivated fields its stiff formal manners and its welldressed crowds he begins to long  ah how he longs  for the keen breath of the desert air he dreams of the sight of zulu impis breaking on their foes like surf upon the rocks and his heart rises up in rebellion against the strict limits of the civilized life  ah this civilization what does it all come to  for forty years and more i lived among savages and studied them and their ways and now for several years i have lived here in england and have in my own stupid manner done my best to learn the ways of the children of light and what have i found  a great gulf fixed no only a very little one that a plain mans thought may spring across  i say that as the savage is so is the white man only the latter is more inventive and possesses the faculty of combination save and except also that the savage as i have known him is to a large extent free from the greed of money which eats like a cancer into the heart of the white man  it is a depressing conclusion but in all essentials the savage and the child of civilization are identical  i dare say that the highly civilized lady reading this will smile at an old fool of a hunters simplicity when she thinks of her black beadbedecked sister and so will the superfine cultured idler scientifically eating a dinner at his club the cost of which would keep a starving family for a week  and yet my dear young lady what are those pretty things round your own neck  they have a strong family resemblance especially when you wear that very low dress to the savage womans beads  your habit of turning round and round to the sound of horns and tomtoms your fondness for pigments and powders the way in which you love to subjugate yourself to the rich warrior who has captured you in marriage and the quickness with which your taste in feathered headdresses varies  all these things suggest touches of kinship and you remember that in the fundamental principles of your nature you are quite identical  as for you sir who also laugh let some man come and strike you in the face whilst you are enjoying that marvellouslooking dish and we shall soon see how much of the savage there is in you  there i might go on for ever but what is the good  civilization is only savagery silvergilt  a vainglory is it and like a northern light comes but to fade and leave the sky more dark out of the soil of barbarism it has grown like a tree and as i believe into the soil like a tree it will once more sooner or later fall again as the egyptian civilization fell as the hellenic civilization fell and as the roman civilization and many others of which the world has now lost count fell also do not let me however be understood as decrying our modern institutions representing as they do the gathered experience of humanity applied for the good of all  of course they have great advantages  hospitals for instance but then remember we breed the sickly people who fill them  in a savage land they do not exist  besides the question will arise how many of these blessings are due to christianity as distinct from civilization and so the balance sways and the story runs  here a gain there a loss and natures great average struck across the two whereof the sum total forms one of the factors in that mighty equation in which the result will equal the unknown quantity of her purpose  i make no apology for this digression especially as this is an introduction which all young people and those who never like to think and it is a bad habit will naturally skip  it seems to me very desirable that we should sometimes try to understand the limitations of our nature so that we may not be carried away by the pride of knowledge  mans cleverness is almost indefinite and stretches like an elastic band but human nature is like an iron ring  you can go round and round it you can polish it highly you can even flatten it a little on one side whereby you will make it bulge out the other but you will never while the world endures and man is man increase its total circumference it is the one fixed unchangeable thing  fixed as the stars more enduring than the mountains as unalterable as the way of the eternal  human nature is gods kaleidoscope and the little bits of coloured glass which represent our passions hopes fears joys aspirations towards good and evil and what not are turned in his mighty hand as surely and as certainly as it turns the stars and continually fall into new patterns and combinations but the composing elements remain the same nor will there be one more bit of coloured glass nor one less for ever and ever  this being so supposing for the sake of argument we divide ourselves into twenty parts nineteen savage and one civilized we must look to the nineteen savage portions of our nature if we would really understand ourselves and not to the twentieth which though so insignificant in reality is spread all over the other nineteen making them appear quite different from what they really are as the blacking does a boot or the veneer a table  it is on the nineteen rough serviceable savage portions that we fall back on emergencies not on the polished but unsubstantial twentieth  civilization should wipe away our tears and yet we weep and cannot be comforted  warfare is abhorrent to her and yet we strike out for hearth and home for honour and fair fame and can glory in the blow  and so on through everything  so when the heart is stricken and the head is humbled in the dust civilization fails us utterly  back back we creep and lay us like little children on the great breast of nature she that perchance may soothe us and make us forget or at least rid remembrance of its sting  who has not in his great grief felt a longing to look upon the outward features of the universal mother to lie on the mountains and watch the clouds drive across the sky and hear the rollers break in thunder on the shore to let his poor struggling life mingle for a while in her life to feel the slow beat of her eternal heart and to forget his woes and let his identity be swallowed in the vast imperceptibly moving energy of her of whom we are from whom we came and with whom we shall again be mingled who gave us birth and will in a day to come give us our burial also  and so in my trouble as i walked up and down the oakpanelled vestibule of my house there in yorkshire i longed once more to throw myself into the arms of nature  not the nature which you know the nature that waves in wellkept woods and smiles out in cornfields but nature as she was in the age when creation was complete undefiled as yet by any human sinks of sweltering humanity  i would go again where the wild game was back to the land whereof none know the history back to the savages whom i love although some of them are almost as merciless as political economy  there perhaps i should be able to learn to think of poor harry lying in the churchyard without feeling as though my heart would break in two  and now there is an end of this egotistical talk and there shall be no more of it  but if you whose eyes may perchance one day fall upon my written thoughts have got so far as this i ask you to persevere since what i have to tell you is not without its interest and it has never been told before nor will again     chapter i  the consuls yarn   a week had passed since the funeral of my poor boy harry and one evening i was in my room walking up and down and thinking when there was a ring at the outer door  going down the steps i opened it myself and in came my old friends sir henry curtis and captain john good rn  they entered the vestibule and sat themselves down before the wide hearth where i remember a particularly good fire of logs was burning  it is very kind of you to come round i said by way of making a remark it must have been heavy walking in the snow  they said nothing but sir henry slowly filled his pipe and lit it with a burning ember  as he leant forward to do so the fire got hold of a gassy bit of pine and flared up brightly throwing the whole scene into strong relief and i thought what a splendidlooking man he is  calm powerful face clearcut features large grey eyes yellow beard and hair  altogether a magnificent specimen of the higher type of humanity  nor did his form belie his face i have never seen wider shoulders or a deeper chest  indeed sir henrys girth is so great that though he is six feet two high he does not strike one as a tall man  as i looked at him i could not help thinking what a curious contrast my little driedup self presented to his grand face and form  imagine to yourself a small withered yellowfaced man of sixtythree with thin hands large brown eyes a head of grizzled hair cut short and standing up like a halfworn scrubbingbrush  total weight in my clothes nine stone six  and you will get a very fair idea of allan quatermain commonly called hunter quatermain or by the natives macumazahn  anglicchar e grave he who keeps a bright lookout at night or in vulgar english a sharp fellow who is not to be taken in  then there was good who is not like either of us being short dark stout  very stout  with twinkling black eyes in one of which an eyeglass is everlastingly fixed  i say stout but it is a mild term i regret to state that of late years good has been running to fat in a most disgraceful way  sir henry tells him that it comes from idleness and overfeeding and good does not like it at all though he cannot deny it  we sat for a while and then i got a match and lit the lamp that stood ready on the table for the halflight began to grow dreary as it is apt to do when one has a short week ago buried the hope of ones life  next i opened a cupboard in the wainscoting and got a bottle of whisky and some tumblers and water  i always like to do these things for myself it is irritating to me to have somebody continually at my elbow as though i were an eighteenmonthold baby  all this while curtis and good had been silent feeling i suppose that they had nothing to say that could do me any good and content to give me the comfort of their presence and unspoken sympathy for it was only their second visit since the funeral  and it is by the way from the presence of others that we really derive support in our dark hours of grief and not from their talk which often only serves to irritate us  before a bad storm the game always herd together but they cease their calling  they sat and smoked and drank whisky and water and i stood by the fire also smoking and looking at them  at last i spoke  old friends i said how long is it since we got back from kukuanaland  three years said good  why do you ask  i ask because i think that i have had a long enough spell of civilization  i am going back to the veldt  sir henry laid his head back in his armchair and laughed one of his deep laughs  how very odd he said eh good  good beamed at me mysteriously through his eyeglass and murmured yes odd  very odd  i dont quite understand said i looking from one to the other for i dislike mysteries  dont you old fellow said sir henry then i will explain as good and i were walking up here we had a talk  if good was there you probably did i put in sarcastically for good is a great hand at talking  and what may it have been about  what do you think asked sir henry  i shook my head  it was not likely that i should know what good might be talking about  he talks about so many things  well it was about a little plan that i have formed  namely that if you were willing we should pack up our traps and go off to africa on another expedition  i fairly jumped at his words  you dont say so i said  yes i do though and so does good dont you good  rather said that gentleman  listen old fellow went on sir henry with considerable animation of manner  im tired of it too deadtired of doing nothing more except play the squire in a country that is sick of squires for a year or more i have been getting as restless as an old elephant who scents danger  i am always dreaming of kukuanaland and gagool and king solomons mines  i can assure you i have become the victim of an almost unaccountable craving  i am sick of shooting pheasants and partridges and want to have a go at some large game again  there you know the feeling  when one has once tasted brandy and water milk becomes insipid to the palate  that year we spent together up in kukuanaland seems to me worth all the other years of my life put together  i dare say that i am a fool for my pains but i cant help it i long to go and what is more i mean to go  he paused and then went on again  and after all why should i not go  i have no wife or parent no chick or child to keep me  if anything happens to me the baronetcy will go to my brother george and his boy as it would ultimately do in any case  i am of no importance to any one  ah i said i thought you would come to that sooner or later and now good what is your reason for wanting to trek have you got one  i have said good solemnly  i never do anything without a reason and it isnt a lady  at least if it is its several  i looked at him again  good is so overpoweringly frivolous what is it i said  well if you really want to know though id rather not speak of a delicate and strictly personal matter ill tell you im getting too fat  shut up good said sir henry  and now quatermain tell us where do you propose going to  i lit my pipe which had gone out before answering  have you people ever heard of mt kenia i asked  dont know the place said good  did you ever hear of the island of lamu i asked again  no  stop though  isnt it a place about 300 miles north of zanzibar  yes  now listen  what i have to propose is this  that we go to lamu and thence make our way about 250 miles inland to mt kenia from mt kenia on inland to mt lekakisera another 200 miles or thereabouts beyond which no white man has to the best of my belief ever been and then if we get so far right on into the unknown interior  what do you say to that my hearties  its a big order said sir henry reflectively  you are right i answered it is but i take it that we are all three of us in search of a big order  we want a change of scene and we are likely to get one  a thorough change  all my life i have longed to visit those parts and i mean to do it before i die  my poor boys death has broken the last link between me and civilization and im off to my native wilds and now ill tell you another thing and that is that for years and years i have heard rumours of a great white race which is supposed to have its home somewhere up in this direction and i have a mind to see if there is any truth in them  if you fellows like to come well and good if not ill go alone  im your man though i dont believe in your white race said sir henry curtis rising and placing his arm upon my shoulder  ditto remarked good  ill go into training at once  by all means lets go to mt kenia and the other place with an unpronounceable name and look for a white race that does not exist its all one to me  when do you propose to start asked sir henry  this day month i answered by the british india steamboat and dont you be so certain that things have no existence because you do not happen to have heard of them  remember king solomons mines   some fourteen weeks or so had passed since the date of this conversation and this history goes on its way in very different surroundings  after much deliberation and inquiry we came to the conclusion that our best startingpoint for mt kenia would be from the neighbourhood of the mouth of the tana river and not from mombassa a place over 100 miles nearer zanzibar  this conclusion we arrived at from information given to us by a german trader whom we met upon the steamer at aden  i think that he was the dirtiest german i ever knew but he was a good fellow and gave us a great deal of valuable information  lamu said he you goes to lamu  oh ze beautiful place and he turned up his fat face and beamed with mild rapture  one year and a half i live there and never change my shirt  never at all  and so it came to pass that on arriving at the island we disembarked with all our goods and chattels and not knowing where to go marched boldly up to the house of her majestys consul where we were most hospitably received  lamu is a very curious place but the things which stand out most clearly in my memory in connection with it are its exceeding dirtiness and its smells  these last are simply awful  just below the consulate is the beach or rather a mud bank that is called a beach  it is left quite bare at low tide and serves as a repository for all the filth offal and refuse of the town here it is too that the women come to bury coconuts in the mud leaving them there till the outer husk is quite rotten when they dig them up again and use the fibres to make mats with and for various other purposes  as this process has been going on for generations the condition of the shore can be better imagined than described  i have smelt many evil odours in the course of my life but the concentrated essence of stench which arose from that beach at lamu as we sat in the moonlit night  not under but on our friend the consuls hospitable roof  and sniffed it makes the remembrance of them very poor and faint  no wonder people get fever at lamu  and yet the place was not without a certain quaintness and charm of its own though possibly  indeed probably  it was one which would quickly pall  well where are you gentlemen steering for asked our friend the hospitable consul as we smoked our pipes after dinner  we propose to go to mt kenia and then on to mt lekakisera answered sir henry  quatermain has got hold of some yarn about there being a white race up in the unknown territories beyond  the consul looked interested and answered that he had heard something of that too  what have you heard i asked  oh not much  all i know about it is that a year or so ago i got a letter from mackenzie the scotch missionary whose station the highlands is placed at the highest navigable point of the tana river in which he said something about it  have you the letter i asked  no i destroyed it but i remember that he said that a man had arrived at his station who declared that two months journey beyond mt lekakisera which no white man has yet visited  at least so far as i know  he found a lake called laga and that then he went off to the northeast a months journey over desert and thorn veldt and great mountains till he came to a country where the people are white and live in stone houses  here he was hospitably entertained for a while till at last the priests of the country set it about that he was a devil and the people drove him away and he journeyed for eight months and reached mackenzies place as i heard dying  thats all i know and if you ask me i believe that it is a lie but if you want to find out more about it you had better go up the tana to mackenzies place and ask him for information  sir henry and i looked at each other  here was something tangible  i think that we will go to mr mackenzies i said  well answered the consul that is your best way but i warn you that you are likely to have a rough journey for i hear that the masai are about and as you know they are not pleasant customers  your best plan will be to choose a few picked men for personal servants and hunters and to hire bearers from village to village  it will give you an infinity of trouble but perhaps on the whole it will prove a cheaper and more advantageous course than engaging a caravan and you will be less liable to desertion  fortunately there were at lamu at this time a party of wakwafi askari soldiers  the wakwafi who are a cross between the masai and the wataveta are a fine manly race possessing many of the good qualities of the zulu and a great capacity for civilization they are also great hunters  as it happened these particular men had recently been on a long trip with an englishman named jutson who had started from mombasa a port about 150 miles below lamu and journeyed right round kilimanjaro one of the highest known mountains in africa  poor fellow he had died of fever when on his return journey and within a days march of mombasa  it does seem hard that he should have gone off thus when within a few hours of safety and after having survived so many perils but so it was  his hunters buried him and then came on to lamu in a dhow  our friend the consul suggested to us that we had better try and hire these men and accordingly on the following morning we started to interview the party accompanied by an interpreter  in due course we found them in a mud hut on the outskirts of the town  three of the men were sitting outside the hut and fine franklooking fellows they were having a more or less civilized appearance  to them we cautiously opened the object of our visit at first with very scant success  they declared that they could not entertain any such idea that they were worn and weary with long travelling and that their hearts were sore at the loss of their master  they meant to go back to their homes and rest awhile  this did not sound very promising so by way of effecting a diversion i asked where the remainder of them were  i was told there were six and i saw but three  one of the men said they slept in the hut and were yet resting after their labours  sleep weighed down their eyelids and sorrow made their hearts as lead it was best to sleep for with sleep came forgetfulness but the men should be awakened  presently they came out of the hut yawning  the first two men being evidently of the same race and style as those already before us but the appearance of the third and last nearly made me jump out of my skin  he was a very tall broad man quite six foot three i should say but gaunt with lean wirylooking limbs  my first glance at him told me that he was no wakwafi he was a pure bred zulu  he came out with his thin aristocraticlooking hand placed before his face to hide a yawn so i could only see that he was a keshla or ringed man endnote 1 and that he had a great threecornered hole in his forehead  in another second he removed his hand revealing a powerfullooking zulu face with a humorous mouth a short woolly beard tinged with grey and a pair of brown eyes keen as a hawks  i knew my man at once although i had not seen him for twelve years  how do you do umslopogaas i said quietly in zulu  the tall man who among his own people was commonly known as the woodpecker and also as the slaughterer started and almost let the longhandled battleaxe he held in his hand fall in his astonishment  next second he had recognized me and was saluting me in an outburst of sonorous language which made his companions the wakwafi stare  koos chief he began koosypagete  koosyumcool  chief from of old  mighty chief  koos  baba  father  macumazahn old hunter slayer of elephants eater up of lions clever one watchful one brave one quick one whose shot never misses who strikes straight home who grasps a hand and holds it to the death ie is a true friend koos  baba  wise is the voice of our people that says mountain never meets with mountain but at daybreak or at even man shall meet again with man  behold a messenger came up from natal macumazahn is dead cried he the land knows macumazahn no more  that is years ago  and now behold now in this strange place of stinks i find macumazahn my friend  there is no room for doubt  the brush of the old jackal has gone a little grey but is not his eye as keen and are not his teeth as sharp  ha ha macumazahn mindest thou how thou didst plant the ball in the eye of the charging buffalo  mindest thou   i had let him run on thus because i saw that his enthusiasm was producing a marked effect upon the minds of the five wakwafi who appeared to understand something of his talk but now i thought it time to put a stop to it for there is nothing that i hate so much as this zulu system of extravagant praising  bongering as they call it  silence i said  has all thy noisy talk been stopped up since last i saw thee that it breaks out thus and sweeps us away  what doest thou here with these men  thou whom i left a chief in zululand  how is it that thou art far from thine own place and gathered together with strangers  umslopogaas leant himself upon the head of his long battleaxe which was nothing else but a poleaxe with a beautiful handle of rhinoceros horn and his grim face grew sad  my father he answered i have a word to tell thee but i cannot speak it before these low people umfagozana and he glanced at the wakwafi askari it is for thine own ear  my father this will i say and here his face grew stern again a woman betrayed me to the death and covered my name with shame  ay my own wife a roundfaced girl betrayed me but i escaped from death ay i broke from the very hands of those who came to slay me  i struck but three blows with this mine axe inkosikaas  surely my father will remember it  one to the right one to the left and one in front and yet i left three men dead and then i fled and as my father knows even now that i am old my feet are as the feet of the sassaby endnote 2 and there breathes not the man who by running can touch me again when once i have bounded from his side  on i sped and after me came the messengers of death and their voice was as the voice of dogs that hunt  from my own kraal i flew and as i passed she who had betrayed me was drawing water from the spring  i fleeted by her like the shadow of death and as i went i smote with mine axe and lo her head fell it fell into the water pan  then i fled north  day after day i journeyed on for three moons i journeyed resting not stopping not but running on towards forgetfulness till i met the party of the white hunter who is now dead and am come hither with his servants  and nought have i brought with me  i who was highborn ay of the blood of chaka the great king  a chief and a captain of the regiment of the nkomabakosi  am a wanderer in strange places a man without a kraal  nought have i brought save this mine axe of all my belongings this remains alone  they have divided my cattle they have taken my wives and my children know my face no more yet with this axe  and he swung the formidable weapon round his head making the air hiss as he clove it  will i cut another path to fortune  i have spoken  i shook my head at him  umslopogaas i said i know thee from of old  ever ambitious ever plotting to be great i fear me that thou hast overreached thyself at last  years ago when thou wouldst have plotted against cetywayo son of panda i warned thee and thou didst listen  but now when i was not by thee to stay thy hand thou hast dug a pit for thine own feet to fall in  is it not so  but what is done is done  who can make the dead tree green or gaze again upon last years light  who can recall the spoken word or bring back the spirit of the fallen that which time swallows comes not up again  let it be forgotten  and now behold umslopogaas i know thee for a great warrior and a brave man faithful to the death  even in zululand where all the men are brave they called thee the slaughterer and at night told stories round the fire of thy strength and deeds hear me now  thou seest this great man my friend  and i pointed to sir henry he also is a warrior as great as thou and strong as thou art he could throw thee over his shoulder incubu is his name  and thou seest this one also him with the round stomach the shining eye and the pleasant face  bougwan glass eye is his name and a good man is he and a true being of a curious tribe who pass their life upon the water and live in floating kraals  now we three whom thou seest would travel inland past dongo egere the great white mountain mt kenia and far into the unknown beyond  we know not what we shall find there we go to hunt and seek adventures and new places being tired of sitting still with the same old things around us  wilt thou come with us  to thee shall be given command of all our servants but what shall befall thee that i know not  once before we three journeyed thus in search of adventure and we took with us a man such as thou  one umbopa and behold we left him the king of a great country with twenty impis regiments each of 3000 plumed warriors waiting on his word  how it shall go with thee i know not mayhap death awaits thee and us wilt thou throw thyself to fortune and come or fearest thou umslopogaas  the great man smiled  thou art not altogether right macumazahn he said i have plotted in my time but it was not ambition that led me to my fall but shame on me that i should have to say it a fair womans face  let it pass  so we are going to see something like the old times again macumazahn when we fought and hunted in zululand  ay i will come  come life come death what care i so that the blows fall fast and the blood runs red i grow old i grow old and i have not fought enough  and yet am i a warrior among warriors see my scars  and he pointed to countless cicatrices stabs and cuts that marked the skin of his chest and legs and arms  see the hole in my head the brains gushed out therefrom yet did i slay him who smote and live  knowest thou how many men i have slain in fair handtohand combat macumazahn  see here is the tale of them  and he pointed to long rows of notches cut in the rhinoceroshorn handle of his axe  number them macumazahn  one hundred and three  and i have never counted but those whom i have ripped open endnote 3 nor have i reckoned those whom another man had struck  be silent i said for i saw that he was getting the bloodfever on him be silent well art thou called the slaughterer we would not hear of thy deeds of blood  remember if thou comest with us we fight not save in selfdefence  listen we need servants  these men and i pointed to the wakwafi who had retired a little way during our indaba talk say they will not come  will not come shouted umslopogaas where is the dog who says he will not come when my father orders  here thou  and with a single bound he sprang upon the wakwafi with whom i had first spoken and seizing him by the arm dragged him towards us thou dog he said giving the terrified man a shake didst thou say that thou wouldst not go with my father  say it once more and i will choke thee  and his long fingers closed round his throat as he said it  thee and those with thee  hast thou forgotten how i served thy brother  nay we will come with the white man gasped the man  white man went on umslopogaas in simulated fury which a very little provocation would have made real enough of whom speakest thou insolent dog  nay we will go with the great chief  so said umslopogaas in a quiet voice as he suddenly released his hold so that the man fell backward  i thought you would  that man umslopogaas seems to have a curious moral ascendency over his companions good afterwards remarked thoughtfully     chapter ii the black hand    in due course we left lamu and ten days afterwards we found ourselves at a spot called charra on the tana river having gone through many adventures which need not be recorded here amongst other things we visited a ruined city of which there are many on this coast and which must once to judge from their extent and the numerous remains of mosques and stone houses have been very populous places  these ruined cities are immeasurably ancient having i believe been places of wealth and importance as far back as the old testament times when they were centres of trade with india and elsewhere  but their glory has departed now  the slave trade has finished them  and where wealthy merchants from all parts of the then civilized world stood and bargained in the crowded marketplaces the lion holds his court at night and instead of the chattering of slaves and the eager voices of the bidders his awful note goes echoing down the ruined corridors  at this particular place we discovered on a mound covered up with rank growth and rubbish two of the most beautiful stone doorways that it is possible to conceive  the carving on them was simply exquisite and i only regret that we had no means of getting them away  no doubt they had once been the entrances to a palace of which however no traces were now to be seen though probably its ruins lay under the rising mound  gone quite gone the way that everything must go  like the nobles and the ladies who lived within their gates these cities have had their day and now they are as babylon and nineveh and as london and paris will one day be  nothing may endure that is the inexorable law  men and women empires and cities thrones principalities and powers mountains rivers and unfathomed seas worlds spaces and universes all have their day and all must go  in this ruined and forgotten place the moralist may behold a symbol of the universal destiny  for this system of ours allows no room for standing still  nothing can loiter on the road and check the progress of things upwards towards life or the rush of things downwards towards death  the stern policeman fate moves us and them on on uphill and downhill and across the level there is no restingplace for the weary feet till at last the abyss swallows us and from the shores of the transitory we are hurled into the sea of the eternal  at charra we had a violent quarrel with the headman of the bearers we had hired to go as far as this and who now wished to extort large extra payment from us  in the result he threatened to set the masai  about whom more anon  on to us  that night he with all our hired bearers ran away stealing most of the goods which had been entrusted to them to carry  luckily however they had not happened to steal our rifles ammunition and personal effects not because of any delicacy of feeling on their part but owing to the fact that they chanced to be in the charge of the five wakwafis  after that it was clear to us that we had had enough of caravans and of bearers  indeed we had not much left for a caravan to carry  and yet how were we to get on  it was good who solved the question  here is water he said pointing to the tana river and yesterday i saw a party of natives hunting hippopotami in canoes  i understand that mr mackenzies mission station is on the tana river  why not get into canoes and paddle up to it  this brilliant suggestion was needless to say received with acclamation and i instantly set to work to buy suitable canoes from the surrounding natives  i succeeded after a delay of three days in obtaining two large ones each hollowed out of a single log of some light wood and capable of holding six people and baggage  for these two canoes we had to pay nearly all our remaining cloth and also many other articles  on the day following our purchase of the two canoes we effected a start  in the first canoe were good sir henry and three of our wakwafi followers in the second myself umslopogaas and the other two wakwafis  as our course lay upstream we had to keep four paddles at work in each canoe which meant that the whole lot of us except good had to row away like galleyslaves and very exhausting work it was  i say except good for of course the moment that good got into a boat his foot was on his native heath and he took command of the party  and certainly he worked us  on shore good is a gentle mildmannered man and given to jocosity but as we found to our cost good in a boat was a perfect demon  to begin with he knew all about it and we didnt  on all nautical subjects from the torpedo fittings of a manofwar down to the best way of handling the paddle of an african canoe he was a perfect mine of information which to say the least of it we were not  also his ideas of discipline were of the sternest and in short he came the royal naval officer over us pretty considerably and paid us out amply for all the chaff we were wont to treat him to on land but on the other hand i am bound to say that he managed the boats admirably  after the first day good succeeded with the help of some cloth and a couple of poles in rigging up a sail in each canoe which lightened our labours not a little  but the current ran very strong against us and at the best we were not able to make more than twenty miles a day  our plan was to start at dawn and paddle along till about halfpast ten by which time the sun got too hot to allow of further exertion  then we moored our canoes to the bank and ate our frugal meal after which we ate or otherwise amused ourselves till about three oclock when we again started and rowed till within an hour of sundown when we called a halt for the night  on landing in the evening good would at once set to work with the help of the askari to build a little scherm or small enclosure fenced with thorn bushes and to light a fire  i with sir henry and umslopogaas would go out to shoot something for the pot  generally this was an easy task for all sorts of game abounded on the banks of the tana  one night sir henry shot a young cowgiraffe of which the marrowbones were excellent on another i got a couple of waterbuck right and left and once to his own intense satisfaction umslopogaas who like most zulus was a vile shot with a rifle managed to kill a fine fat eland with a martini i had lent him sometimes we varied our food by shooting some guineafowl or bushbustard paau  both of which were numerous  with a shotgun or by catching a supply of beautiful yellow fish with which the waters of the tana swarmed and which form i believe one of the chief foodsupplies of the crocodiles  three days after our start an ominous incident occurred  we were just drawing in to the bank to make our camp as usual for the night when we caught sight of a figure standing on a little knoll not forty yards away and intensely watching our approach one glance was sufficient  although i was personally unacquainted with the tribe  to tell me that he was a masai elmoran or young warrior  indeed had i had any doubts they would have quickly been dispelled by the terrified ejaculation of masai that burst simultaneously from the lips of our wakwafi followers who are as i think i have said themselves bastard masai  and what a figure he presented as he stood there in his savage wargear  accustomed as i have been to savages all my life i do not think that i have ever before seen anything quite so ferocious or aweinspiring  to begin with the man was enormously tall quite as tall as umslopogaas i should say and beautifully though somewhat slightly shaped but with the face of a devil in his right hand he held a spear about five and a half feet long the blade being two and a half feet in length by nearly three inches in width and having an iron spike at the end of the handle that measured more than a foot  on his left arm was a large and wellmade elliptical shield of buffalo hide on which were painted strange heraldiclooking devices  on his shoulders was a huge cape of hawks feathers and round his neck was a naibere or strip of cotton about seventeen feet long by one and a half broad with a stripe of colour running down the middle of it  the tanned goatskin robe which formed his ordinary attire in times of peace was tied lightly round his waist so as to serve the purposes of a belt and through it were stuck on the right and left sides respectively his short pearshaped sime or sword which is made of a single piece of steel and carried in a wooden sheath and an enormous knobkerrie  but perhaps the most remarkable feature of his attire consisted of a headdress of ostrichfeathers which was fixed on the chin and passed in front of the ears to the forehead and being shaped like an ellipse completely framed the face so that the diabolical countenance appeared to project from a sort of feather firescreen round the ankles he wore black fringes of hair and projecting from the upper portion of the calves to which they were attached were long spurs like spikes from which flowed down tufts of the beautiful black and waving hair of the colobus monkey  such was the elaborate array of the masai elmoran who stood watching the approach of our two canoes but it is one which to be appreciated must be seen only those who see it do not often live to describe it  of course i could not make out all these details of his full dress on the occasion of this my first introduction being indeed amply taken up with the consideration of the general effect but i had plenty of subsequent opportunities of becoming acquainted with the items that went to make it up  whilst we were hesitating what to do the masai warrior drew himself up in a dignified fashion shook his huge spear at us and turning vanished on the further side of the slope  hulloa holloaed sir henry from the other boat our friend the caravan leader has been as good as his word and set the masai after us  do you think it will be safe to go ashore  i did not think it would be at all safe but on the other hand we had no means of cooking in the canoes and nothing that we could eat raw so it was difficult to know what to do  at last umslopogaas simplified matters by volunteering to go and reconnoitre which he did creeping off into the bush like a snake while we hung off in the stream waiting for him  in half an hour he returned and told us that there was not a masai to be seen anywhere about but that he had discovered a spot where they had recently been encamped and that from various indications he judged that they must have moved on an hour or so before the man we saw having no doubt been left to report upon our movements  thereupon we landed and having posted a sentry proceeded to cook and eat our evening meal  this done we took the situation into our serious consideration  of course it was possible that the apparition of the masai warrior had nothing to do with us that he was merely one of a band bent upon some marauding and murdering expedition against another tribe  but when we recalled the threat of the caravan leader and reflected on the ominous way in which the warrior had shaken his spear at us this did not appear very probable  on the contrary what did seem probable was that the party was after us and awaiting a favourable opportunity to attack us  this being so there were two things that we could do  one of which was to go on and the other to go back  the latter idea was however rejected at once it being obvious that we should encounter as many dangers in retreat as in advance and besides we had made up our minds to journey onwards at any price  under these circumstances however we did not consider it safe to sleep ashore so we got into our canoes and paddling out into the middle of the stream which was not very wide here managed to anchor them by means of big stones fastened to ropes made of coconutfibre of which there were several fathoms in each canoe  here the mosquitoes nearly ate us up alive and this combined with anxiety as to our position effectually prevented me from sleeping as the others were doing notwithstanding the attacks of the aforesaid tana mosquitoes  and so i lay awake smoking and reflecting on many things but being of a practical turn of mind chiefly on how we were to give those masai villains the slip  it was a beautiful moonlight night and notwithstanding the mosquitoes and the great risk we were running from fever from sleeping in such a spot and forgetting that i had the cramp very badly in my right leg from squatting in a constrained position in the canoe and that the wakwafi who was sleeping beside me smelt horribly i really began to enjoy myself  the moonbeams played upon the surface of the running water that speeded unceasingly past us towards the sea like mens lives towards the grave till it glittered like a wide sheet of silver that is in the open where the trees threw no shadows  near the banks however it was very dark and the night wind sighed sadly in the reeds to our left on the further side of the river was a little sandy bay which was clear of trees and here i could make out the forms of numerous antelopes advancing to the water till suddenly there came an ominous roar whereupon they all made off hurriedly  then after a pause i caught sight of the massive form of his majesty the lion coming down to drink his fill after meat  presently he moved on then came a crashing of the reeds about fifty yards above us and a few minutes later a huge black mass rose out of the water about twenty yards from me and snorted it was the head of a hippopotamus  down it went without a sound only to rise again within five yards of where i sat  this was decidedly too near to be comfortable more especially as the hippopotamus was evidently animated by intense curiosity to know what on earth our canoes were  he opened his great mouth to yawn i suppose and gave me an excellent view of his ivories and i could not help reflecting how easily he could crunch up our frail canoe with a single bite  indeed i had half a mind to give him a ball from my eightbore but on reflection determined to let him alone unless he actually charged the boat  presently he sank again as noiselessly as before and i saw no more of him  just then on looking towards the bank on our right i fancied that i caught sight of a dark figure flitting between the tree trunks  i have very keen sight and i was almost sure that i saw something but whether it was bird beast or man i could not say  at the moment however a dark cloud passed over the moon and i saw no more of it  just then too although all the other sounds of the forest had ceased a species of horned owl with which i was well acquainted began to hoot with great persistency  after that save for the rustling of trees and reeds when the wind caught them there was complete silence  but somehow in the most unaccountable way i had suddenly become nervous  there was no particular reason why i should be beyond the ordinary reasons which surround the central african traveller and yet i undoubtedly was  if there is one thing more than another of which i have the most complete and entire scorn and disbelief it is of presentiments and yet here i was all of a sudden filled with and possessed by a most undoubted presentiment of approaching evil  i would not give way to it however although i felt the cold perspiration stand out upon my forehead  i would not arouse the others  worse and worse i grew my pulse fluttered like a dying mans my nerves thrilled with the horrible sense of impotent terror which anybody who is subject to nightmare will be familiar with but still my will triumphed over my fears and i lay quiet for i was half sitting half lying in the bow of the canoe only turning my face so as to command a view of umslopogaas and the two wakwafi who were sleeping alongside of and beyond me  in the distance i heard a hippopotamus splash faintly then the owl hooted again in a kind of unnatural screaming note endnote 4 and the wind began to moan plaintively through the trees making a heartchilling music  above was the black bosom of the cloud and beneath me swept the black flood of the water and i felt as though i and death were utterly alone between them it was very desolate  suddenly my blood seemed to freeze in my veins and my heart to stand still  was it fancy or were we moving  i turned my eyes to look for the other canoe which should be alongside of us  i could not see it but instead i saw a lean and clutching black hand lifting itself above the gunwale of the little boat surely it was a nightmare  at the same instant a dim but devilishlooking face appeared to rise out of the water and then came a lurch of the canoe the quick flash of a knife and an awful yell from the wakwafi who was sleeping by my side the same poor fellow whose odour had been annoying me and something warm spurted into my face  in an instant the spell was broken i knew that it was no nightmare but that we were attacked by swimming masai  snatching at the first weapon that came to hand which happened to be umslopogaas battleaxe i struck with all my force in the direction in which i had seen the flash of the knife  the blow fell upon a mans arm and catching it against the thick wooden gunwale of the canoe completely severed it from the body just above the wrist  as for its owner he uttered no sound or cry  like a ghost he came and like a ghost he went leaving behind him a bloody hand still gripping a great knife or rather a short sword that was buried in the heart of our poor servant  instantly there arose a hubbub and confusion and i fancied rightly or wrongly that i made out several dark heads gliding away towards the righthand bank whither we were rapidly drifting for the rope by which we were moored had been severed with a knife  as soon as i had realized this fact i also realized that the scheme had been to cut the boat loose so that it should drift on to the right bank as it would have done with the natural swing of the current where no doubt a party of masai were waiting to dig their shovelheaded spears into us  seizing one paddle myself i told umslopogaas to take another for the remaining askari was too frightened and bewildered to be of any use and together we rowed vigorously out towards the middle of the stream and not an instant too soon for in another minute we should have been aground and then there would have been an end of us  as soon as we were well out we set to work to paddle the canoe upstream again to where the other was moored and very hard and dangerous work it was in the dark and with nothing but the notes of goods stentorian shouts which he kept firing off at intervals like a foghorn to guide us  but at last we fetched up and were thankful to find that they had not been molested at all no doubt the owner of the same hand that severed our rope should have severed theirs also but was led away from his purpose by an irresistible inclination to murder when he got the chance which while it cost us a man and him his hand undoubtedly saved all the rest of us from massacre  had it not been for that ghastly apparition over the side of the boat  an apparition that i shall never forget till my dying hour  the canoe would undoubtedly have drifted ashore before i realized what had happened and this history would never have been written by me     chapter iii the mission station    we made the remains of our rope fast to the other canoe and sat waiting for the dawn and congratulating ourselves upon our merciful escape which really seemed to result more from the special favour of providence than from our own care or prowess at last it came and i have not often been more grateful to see the light though so far as my canoe was concerned it revealed a ghastly sight  there in the bottom of the little boat lay the unfortunate askari the sime or sword in his bosom and the severed hand gripping the handle  i could not bear the sight so hauling up the stone which had served as an anchor to the other canoe we made it fast to the murdered man and dropped him overboard and down he went to the bottom leaving nothing but a train of bubbles behind him  alas when our time comes most of us like him leave nothing but bubbles behind to show that we have been and the bubbles soon burst  the hand of his murderer we threw into the stream where it slowly sank  the sword of which the handle was ivory inlaid with gold evidently arab work i kept and used as a huntingknife and very useful it proved  then a man having been transferred to my canoe we once more started on in very low spirits and not feeling at all comfortable as to the future but fondly hoping to arrive at the highlands station by night  to make matters worse within an hour of sunrise it came on to rain in torrents wetting us to the skin and even necessitating the occasional baling of the canoes and as the rain beat down the wind we could not use the sails and had to get along as best as we could with our paddles  at eleven oclock we halted on an open piece of ground on the left bank of the river and the rain abating a little managed to make a fire and catch and broil some fish  we did not dare to wander about to search for game  at two oclock we got off again taking a supply of broiled fish with us and shortly afterwards the rain came on harder than ever  also the river began to get exceedingly difficult to navigate on account of the numerous rocks reaches of shallow water and the increased force of the current so that it soon became clear to us that we should not reach the rev mackenzies hospitable roof that night  a prospect that did not tend to enliven us  toil as we would we could not make more than an average of a mile an hour and at five oclock in the afternoon by which time we were all utterly worn out we reckoned that we were still quite ten miles below the station  this being so we set to work to make the best arrangements we could for the night  after our recent experience we simply did not dare to land more especially as the banks of the tana were clothed with dense bush that would have given cover to five thousand masai and at first i thought that we were going to have another night of it in the canoes  fortunately however we espied a little rocky islet not more than fifteen miles or so square situated nearly in the middle of the river  for this we paddled and making fast the canoes landed and made ourselves as comfortable as circumstances would permit which was very uncomfortable indeed  as for the weather it continued to be simply vile the rain coming down in sheets till we were chilled to the marrow and utterly preventing us from lighting a fire there was however one consoling circumstance about this rain our askari declared that nothing would induce the masai to make an attack in it as they intensely disliked moving about in the wet perhaps as good suggested because they hate the idea of washing  we ate some insipid and sodden cold fish  that is with the exception of umslopogaas who like most zulus cannot bear fish  and took a pull of brandy of which we fortunately had a few bottles left and then began what with one exception  when we same three white men nearly perished of cold on the snow of shebas breast in the course of our journey to kukuanaland  was i think the most trying night i ever experienced  it seemed absolutely endless and once or twice i feared that two of the askari would have died of the wet cold and exposure indeed had it not been for timely doses of brandy i am sure that they would have died for no african people can stand much exposure which first paralyses and then kills them  i could see that even that iron old warrior umslopogaas felt it keenly though in strange contrast to the wakwafis who groaned and bemoaned their fate unceasingly he never uttered a single complaint to make matters worse about one in the morning we again heard the owls ominous hooting and had at once to prepare ourselves for another attack though if it had been attempted i do not think that we could have offered a very effective resistance but either the owl was a real one this time or else the masai were themselves too miserable to think of offensive operations which indeed they rarely if ever undertake in bush veldt at any rate we saw nothing of them  at last the dawn came gliding across the water wrapped in wreaths of ghostly mist and with the daylight the rain ceased and then out came the glorious sun sucking up the mists and warming the chill air  benumbed and utterly exhausted we dragged ourselves to our feet and went and stood in the bright rays and were thankful for them  i can quite understand how it is that primitive people become sun worshippers especially if their conditions of life render them liable to exposure  in half an hour more we were once again making fair progress with the help of a good wind  our spirits had returned with the sunshine and we were ready to laugh at difficulties and dangers that had been almost crushing on the previous day  and so we went on cheerily till about eleven oclock  just as we were thinking of halting as usual to rest and try to shoot something to eat a sudden bend in the river brought us in sight of a substantiallooking european house with a veranda round it splendidly situated upon a hill and surrounded by a high stone wall with a ditch on the outer side  right against and overshadowing the house was an enormous pine the tope of which we had seen through a glass for the last two days but of course without knowing that it marked the site of the mission station i was the first to see the house and could not restrain myself from giving a hearty cheer in which the others including the natives joined lustily  there was no thought of halting now on we laboured for unfortunately though the house seemed quite near it was still a long way off by river until at last by one oclock we found ourselves at the bottom of the slope on which the building stood  running the canoes to the bank we disembarked and were just hauling them up on to the shore when we perceived three figures dressed in ordinary englishlooking clothes hurrying down through a grove of trees to meet us  a gentleman a lady and a little girl ejaculated good after surveying the trio through his eyeglass walking in a civilized fashion through a civilized garden to meet us in this place hang me if this isnt the most curious thing we have seen yet  good was right it certainly did seem odd and out of place  more like a scene out of a dream or an italian opera than a real tangible fact and the sense of unreality was not lessened when we heard ourselves addressed in good broad scotch which however i cannot reproduce  how do you do sirs said mr mackenzie a greyhaired angular man with a kindly face and red cheeks i hope i see you very well  my natives told me an hour ago they spied two canoes with white men in them coming up the river so we have just come down to meet you  and it is very glad that we are to see a white face again let me tell you put in the lady  a charming and refinedlooking person  we took off our hats in acknowledgment and proceeded to introduce ourselves  and now said mr mackenzie you must all be hungry and weary so come on gentlemen come on and right glad we are to see you  the last white who visited us was alphonse  you will see alphonse presently  and that was a year ago  meanwhile we had been walking up the slope of the hill the lower portion of which was fenced off sometimes with quince fences and sometimes with rough stone walls into kaffir gardens just now full of crops of mealies pumpkins potatoes etc  in the corners of these gardens were groups of neat mushroomshaped huts occupied by mr mackenzies mission natives whose women and children came pouring out to meet us as we walked  through the centre of the gardens ran the roadway up which we were walking it was bordered on each side by a line of orange trees which although they had only been planted ten years had in the lovely climate of the uplands below mt kenia the base of which is about 5000 feet above the coastline level already grown to imposing proportions and were positively laden with golden fruit  after a stiffish climb of a quarter of a mile or so  for the hillside was steep  we came to a splendid quince fence also covered with fruit which enclosed mr mackenzie told us a space of about four acres of ground that contained his private garden house church and outbuildings and indeed the whole hilltop and what a garden it was  i have always loved a good garden and i could have thrown up my hands for joy when i saw mr mackenzies first there were rows upon rows of standard european fruittrees all grafted for on top of this hill the climate was so temperate that nearly all the english vegetables trees and flowers flourished luxuriantly even including several varieties of the apple which generally runs to wood in a warm climate and obstinately refuses to fruit  then there were strawberries and tomatoes such tomatoes and melons and cucumbers and indeed every sort of vegetable and fruit  well you have something like a garden i said overpowered with admiration not untouched by envy  yes answered the missionary it is a very good garden and has well repaid my labour but it is the climate that i have to thank  if you stick a peachstone into the ground it will bear fruit the fourth year and a rosecutting will bloom in a year  it is a lovely clime  just then we came to a ditch about ten feet wide and full of water on the other side of which was a loopholed stone wall eight feet high and with sharp flints plentifully set in mortar on the coping  there said mr mackenzie pointing to the ditch and wall this is my magnum opus at least this and the church which is the other side of the house  it took me and twenty natives two years to dig the ditch and build the wall but i never felt safe till it was done and now i can defy all the savages in africa for the spring that fills the ditch is inside the wall and bubbles out at the top of the hill winter and summer alike and i always keep a store of four months provision in the house  crossing over a plank and through a very narrow opening in the wall we entered into what mrs mackenzie called her domain  namely the flower garden the beauty of which is really beyond my power to describe  i do not think i ever saw such roses gardenias or camellias all reared from seeds or cuttings sent from england and there was also a patch given up to a collection of bulbous roots mostly collected by miss flossie mr mackenzies little daughter from the surrounding country some of which were surpassingly beautiful  in the middle of this garden and exactly opposite the veranda a beautiful fountain of clear water bubbled up from the ground and fell into a stonework basin which had been carefully built to receive it whence the overflow found its way by means of a drain to the moat round the outer wall this moat in its turn serving as a reservoir whence an unfailing supply of water was available to irrigate all the gardens below  the house itself a massively built singlestoried building was roofed with slabs of stone and had a handsome veranda in front  it was built on three sides of a square the fourth side being taken up by the kitchens which stood separate from the house  a very good plan in a hot country  in the centre of this square thus formed was perhaps the most remarkable object that we had yet seen in this charming place and that was a single tree of the conifer tribe varieties of which grow freely on the highlands of this part of africa  this splendid tree which mr mackenzie informed us was a landmark for fifty miles round and which we had ourselves seen for the last forty miles of our journey must have been nearly three hundred feet in height the trunk measuring about sixteen feet in diameter at a yard from the ground  for some seventy feet it rose a beautiful tapering brown pillar without a single branch but at that height splendid dark green boughs which looked at from below had the appearance of gigantic fernleaves sprang out horizontally from the trunk projecting right over the house and flowergarden to both of which they furnished a grateful proportion of shade without  being so high up  offering any impediment to the passage of light and air  what a beautiful tree exclaimed sir henry  yes you are right it is a beautiful tree  there is not another like it in all the country round that i know of answered mr mackenzie  i call it my watch tower  as you see i have a rope ladder fixed to the lowest bough and if i want to see anything that is going on within fifteen miles or so all i have to do is to run up it with a spyglass  but you must be hungry and i am sure the dinner is cooked  come in my friends it is but a rough place but well enough for these savage parts and i can tell you what we have got  a french cook  and he led the way on to the veranda  as i was following him and wondering what on earth he could mean by this there suddenly appeared through the door that opened on to the veranda from the house a dapper little man dressed in a neat blue cotton suit with shoes made of tanned hide and remarkable for a bustling air and most enormous black mustachios shaped into an upward curve and coming to a point for all the world like a pair of buffalohorns  madame bids me for to say that dinnar is sarved  messieurs my compliments then suddenly perceiving umslopogaas who was loitering along after us and playing with his battleaxe he threw up his hands in astonishment  ah mais quel homme he ejaculated in french quel sauvage affreux  take but note of his huge choppare and the great pit in his head  ay said mr mackenzie what are you talking about alphonse  talking about replied the little frenchman his eyes still fixed upon umslopogaas whose general appearance seemed to fascinate him why i talk of him  and he rudely pointed  of ce monsieur noir  at this everybody began to laugh and umslopogaas perceiving that he was the object of remark frowned ferociously for he had a most lordly dislike of anything like a personal liberty  parbleu said alphonse he is angered  he makes the grimace i like not his air  i vanish  and he did with considerable rapidity  mr mackenzie joined heartily in the shout of laughter which we indulged in  he is a queer character  alphonse he said by and by i will tell you his history in the meanwhile let us try his cooking  might i ask said sir henry after we had eaten a most excellent dinner how you came to have a french cook in these wilds  oh answered mrs mackenzie he arrived here of his own accord about a year ago and asked to be taken into our service he had got into some trouble in france and fled to zanzibar where he found an application had been made by the french government for his extradition  whereupon he rushed off upcountry and fell in when nearly starved with our caravan of men who were bringing us our annual supply of goods and was brought on here you should get him to tell you the story  when dinner was over we lit our pipes and sir henry proceeded to give our host a description of our journey up here over which he looked very grave  it is evident to me he said that those rascally masai are following you and i am very thankful that you have reached this house in safety  i do not think that they will dare to attack you here  it is unfortunate though that nearly all my men have gone down to the coast with ivory and goods  there are two hundred of them in the caravan and the consequence is that i have not more than twenty men available for defensive purposes in case they should attack us  but still i will just give a few orders and calling a black man who was loitering about outside in the garden he went to the window and addressed him in a swahili dialect  the man listened and then saluted and departed  i am sure i devoutly hope that we shall bring no such calamity upon you said i anxiously when he had taken his seat again rather than bring those bloodthirsty villains about your ears we will move on and take our chance  you will do nothing of the sort  if the masai come they come and there is an end on it and i think we can give them a pretty warm greeting  i would not show any man the door for all the masai in the world  that reminds me i said the consul at lamu told me that he had had a letter from you in which you said that a man had arrived here who reported that he had come across a white people in the interior  do you think that there was any truth in his story i ask because i have once or twice in my life heard rumours from natives who have come down from the far north of the existence of such a race  mr mackenzie by way of answer went out of the room and returned bringing with him a most curious sword  it was long and all the blade which was very thick and heavy was to within a quarter of an inch of the cutting edge worked into an ornamental pattern exactly as we work soft wood with a fretsaw the steel however being invariably pierced in such a way as not to interfere with the strength of the sword  this in itself was sufficiently curious but what was still more so was that all the edges of the hollow spaces cut through the substance of the blade were most beautifully inlaid with gold which was in some way that i cannot understand welded on to the steel endnote 5  there said mr mackenzie did you ever see a sword like that  we all examined it and shook our heads  well i have got it to show you because this is what the man who said he had seen the white people brought with him and because it does more or less give an air of truth to what i should otherwise have set down as a lie  look here i will tell you all that i know about the matter which is not much  one afternoon just before sunset i was sitting on the veranda when a poor miserable starvedlooking man came limping up and squatted down before me  i asked him where he came from and what he wanted and thereon he plunged into a long rambling narrative about how he belonged to a tribe far in the north and how his tribe was destroyed by another tribe and he with a few other survivors driven still further north past a lake named laga  thence it appears he made his way to another lake that lay up in the mountains a lake without a bottom he called it and here his wife and brother died of an infectious sickness  probably smallpox  whereon the people drove him out of their villages into the wilderness where he wandered miserably over mountains for ten days after which he got into dense thorn forest and was one day found there by some white men who were hunting and who took him to a place where all the people were white and lived in stone houses  here he remained a week shut up in a house till one night a man with a white beard whom he understood to be a medicineman came and inspected him after which he was led off and taken through the thorn forest to the confines of the wilderness and given food and this sword at least so he said and turned loose  well said sir henry who had been listening with breathless interest and what did he do then  oh he seems according to his account to have gone through sufferings and hardships innumerable and to have lived for weeks on roots and berries and such things as he could catch and kill but somehow he did live and at last by slow degrees made his way south and reached this place  what the details of his journey were i never learnt for i told him to return on the morrow bidding one of my headmen look after him for the night  the headman took him away but the poor man had the itch so badly that the headmans wife would not have him in the hut for fear of catching it so he was given a blanket and told to sleep outside as it happened we had a lion hanging about here just then and most unhappily he winded this unfortunate wanderer and springing on him bit his head almost off without the people in the hut knowing anything about it and there was an end of him and his story about the white people and whether or no there is any truth in it is more than i can tell you  what do you think mr quatermain  i shook my head and answered i dont know  there are so many queer things hidden away in the heart of this great continent that i should be sorry to assert that there was no truth in it anyhow we mean to try and find out  we intend to journey to lekakisera and thence if we live to get so far to this lake laga and if there are any white people beyond we will do our best to find them  you are very venturesome people said mr mackenzie with a smile and the subject dropped     chapter iv alphonse and his annette    after dinner we thoroughly inspected all the outbuildings and grounds of the station which i consider the most successful as well as the most beautiful place of the sort that i have seen in africa  we then returned to the veranda where we found umslopogaas taking advantage of this favourable opportunity to clean all the rifles thoroughly  this was the only work that he ever did or was asked to do for as a zulu chief it was beneath his dignity to work with his hands but such as it was he did it very well it was a curious sight to see the great zulu sitting there upon the floor his battleaxe resting against the wall behind him whilst his long aristocraticlooking hands were busily employed delicately and with the utmost care cleaning the mechanism of the breechloaders  he had a name for each gun  one  a double fourbore belonging to sir henry  was the thunderer another my 500 express which had a peculiarly sharp report was the little one who spoke like a whip the winchester repeaters were the women who talked so fast that you could not tell one word from another the six martinis were the common people and so on with them all  it was very curious to hear him addressing each gun as he cleaned it as though it were an individual and in a vein of the quaintest humour  he did the same with his battleaxe which he seemed to look upon as an intimate friend and to which he would at times talk by the hour going over all his old adventures with it  and dreadful enough some of them were  by a piece of grim humour he had named this axe inkosikaas which is the zulu word for chieftainess  for a long while i could not make out why he gave it such a name and at last i asked him when he informed me that the axe was very evidently feminine because of her womanly habit of prying very deep into things and that she was clearly a chieftainess because all men fell down before her struck dumb at the sight of her beauty and power  in the same way he would consult inkosikaas if in any dilemma and when i asked him why he did so he informed me it was because she must needs be wise having looked into so many peoples brains  i took up the axe and closely examined this formidable weapon it was as i have said of the nature of a poleaxe  the haft made out of an enormous rhinoceros horn was three feet three inches long about an inch and a quarter thick and with a knob at the end as large as a maltese orange left there to prevent the hand from slipping  this horn haft though so massive was as flexible as cane and practically unbreakable but to make assurance doubly sure it was whipped round at intervals of a few inches with copper wire  all the parts where the hands grip being thus treated  just above where the haft entered the head were scored a number of little nicks each nick representing a man killed in battle with the weapon  the axe itself was made of the most beautiful steel and apparently of european manufacture though umslopogaas did not know where it came from having taken it from the hand of a chief he had killed in battle many years before  it was not very heavy the head weighing two and a half pounds as nearly as i could judge  the cutting part was slightly concave in shape  not convex as it generally the case with savage battleaxes  and sharp as a razor measuring five and threequarter inches across the widest part  from the back of the axe sprang a stout spike four inches long for the last two of which it was hollow and shaped like a leather punch with an opening for anything forced into the hollow at the punch end to be pushed out above  in fact in this respect it exactly resembled a butchers poleaxe  it was with this punch end as we afterwards discovered that umslopogaas usually struck when fighting driving a neat round hole in his adversarys skull and only using the broad cutting edge for a circular sweep or sometimes in a melee  i think he considered the punch a neater and more sportsmanlike tool and it was from his habit of pecking at his enemy with it that he got his name of woodpecker  certainly in his hands it was a terribly efficient one  such was umslopogaas axe inkosikaas the most remarkable and fatal handtohand weapon that i ever saw and one which he cherished as much as his own life  it scarcely ever left his hand except when he was eating and then he always sat with it under his leg  just as i returned his axe to umslopogaas miss flossie came up and took me off to see her collection of flowers african liliums and blooming shrubs some of which are very beautiful many of the varieties being quite unknown to me and also i believe to botanical science  i asked her if she had ever seen or heard of the goya lily which central african explorers have told me they have occasionally met with and whose wonderful loveliness has filled them with astonishment  this lily which the natives say blooms only once in ten years flourishes in the most arid soil  compared to the size of the bloom the bulb is small generally weighing about four pounds  as for the flower itself which i afterwards saw under circumstances likely to impress its appearance fixedly in my mind i know not how to describe its beauty and splendour or the indescribable sweetness of its perfume  the flower  for it has only one bloom  rises from the crown of the bulb on a thick fleshy and flatsided stem the specimen that i saw measured fourteen inches in diameter and is somewhat trumpetshaped like the bloom of an ordinary longiflorum set vertically  first there is the green sheath which in its early stage is not unlike that of a waterlily but which as the bloom opens splits into four portions and curls back gracefully towards the stem  then comes the bloom itself a single dazzling arch of white enclosing another cup of richest velvety crimson from the heart of which rises a goldencoloured pistil  i have never seen anything to equal this bloom in beauty or fragrance and as i believe it is but little known i take the liberty to describe it at length  looking at it for the first time i well remember that i realized how even in a flower there dwells something of the majesty of its maker  to my great delight miss flossie told me that she knew the flower well and had tried to grow it in her garden but without success adding however that as it should be in bloom at this time of the year she thought that she could procure me a specimen  after that i fell to asking her if she was not lonely up here among all these savage people and without any companions of her own age  lonely she said  oh indeed no  i am as happy as the day is long and besides i have my own companions  why i should hate to be buried in a crowd of white girls all just like myself so that nobody could tell the difference  here she said giving her head a little toss i am i and every native for miles around knows the waterlily  for that is what they call me  and is ready to do what i want but in the books that i have read about little girls in england it is not like that  everybody thinks them a trouble and they have to do what their schoolmistress likes  oh it would break my heart to be put in a cage like that and not to be free  free as the air  would you not like to learn i asked  so i do learn  father teaches me latin and french and arithmetic  and are you never afraid among all these wild men  afraid  oh no they never interfere with me  i think they believe that i am ngai of the divinity because i am so white and have fair hair  and look here and diving her little hand into the bodice of her dress she produced a doublebarrelled nickelplated derringer i always carry that loaded and if anybody tried to touch me i should shoot him  once i shot a leopard that jumped upon my donkey as i was riding along  it frightened me very much but i shot it in the ear and it fell dead and i have its skin upon my bed  look there she went on in an altered voice touching me on the arm and pointing to some faraway object i said just now that i had companions there is one of them  i looked and for the first time there burst upon my sight the glory of mount kenia  hitherto the mountain had always been hidden in mist but now its radiant beauty was unveiled for many thousand feet although the base was still wrapped in vapour so that the lofty peak or pillar towering nearly twenty thousand feet into the sky appeared to be a fairy vision hanging between earth and heaven and based upon the clouds  the solemn majesty and beauty of this white peak are together beyond the power of my poor pen to describe  there it rose straight and sheer  a glittering white glory its crest piercing the very blue of heaven  as i gazed at it with that little girl i felt my whole heart lifted up with an indescribable emotion and for a moment great and wonderful thoughts seemed to break upon my mind even as the arrows of the setting sun were breaking upon kenias snows mr mackenzies natives call the mountain the finger of god and to me it did seem eloquent of immortal peace and of the pure high calm that surely lies above this fevered world  somewhere i had heard a line of poetry   a thing of beauty is a joy for ever   and now it came into my mind and for the first time i thoroughly understood what it meant  base indeed would be the man who could look upon that mighty snowwreathed pile  that white old tombstone of the years  and not feel his own utter insignificance and by whatever name he calls him worship god in his heart such sights are like visions of the spirit they throw wide the windows of the chamber of our small selfishness and let in a breath of that air that rushes round the rolling spheres and for a while illumine our darkness with a faroff gleam of the white light which beats upon the throne  yes such things of beauty are indeed a joy for ever and i can well understand what little flossie meant when she talked of kenia as her companion  as umslopogaas savage old zulu that he was said when i pointed out to him the peak hanging in the glittering air a man might look thereon for a thousand years and yet be hungry to see  but he gave rather another colour to his poetical idea when he added in a sort of chant and with a touch of that weird imagination for which the man was remarkable that when he was dead he should like his spirit to sit upon that snowclad peak for ever and to rush down the steep white sides in the breath of the whirlwind or on the flash of the lightning and slay and slay and slay  slay what you old bloodhound i asked  this rather puzzled him but at length he answered   the other shadows  so thou wouldst continue thy murdering even after death i said  i murder not he answered hotly i kill in fair fight  man is born to kill  he who kills not when his blood is hot is a woman and no man  the people who kill not are slaves  i say i kill in fair fight and when i am in the shadow as you white men say i hope to go on killing in fair fight  may my shadow be accursed and chilled to the bone for ever if it should fall to murdering like a bushman with his poisoned arrows  and he stalked away with much dignity and left me laughing  just then the spies whom our host had sent out in the morning to find out if there were any traces of our masai friends about returned and reported that the country had been scoured for fifteen miles round without a single elmoran being seen and that they believed that those gentry had given up the pursuit and returned whence they came  mr mackenzie gave a sigh of relief when he heard this and so indeed did we for we had had quite enough of the masai to last us for some time  indeed the general opinion was that finding we had reached the mission station in safety they had knowing its strength given up the pursuit of us as a bad job  how illjudged that view was the sequel will show  after the spies had gone and mrs mackenzie and flossie had retired for the night alphonse the little frenchman came out and sir henry who is a very good french scholar got him to tell us how he came to visit central africa which he did in a most extraordinary lingo that for the most part i shall not attempt to reproduce  my grandfather he began was a soldier of the guard and served under napoleon  he was in the retreat from moscow and lived for ten days on his own leggings and a pair he stole from a comrade  he used to get drunk  he died drunk and i remember playing at drums on his coffin  my father   here we suggested that he might skip his ancestry and come to the point  bien messieurs replied this comical little man with a polite bow  i did only wish to demonstrate that the military principle is not hereditary  my grandfather was a splendid man six feet two high broad in proportion a swallower of fire and gaiters also he was remarkable for his moustache  to me there remains the moustache and  nothing more  i am messieurs a cook and i was born at marseilles  in that dear town i spent my happy youth  for years and years i washed the dishes at the hotel continental  ah those were golden days and he sighed  i am a frenchman  need i say messieurs that i admire beauty  nay i adore the fair  messieurs we admire all the roses in a garden but we pluck one  i plucked one and alas messieurs it pricked my finger  she was a chambermaid her name annette her figure ravishing her face an angels her heart  alas messieurs that i should have to own it  black and slippery as a patent leather boot  i loved to desperation i adored her to despair  she transported me  in every sense she inspired me  never have i cooked as i cooked for i had been promoted at the hotel when annette my adored annette smiled on me  never  and here his manly voice broke into a sob  never shall i cook so well again  here he melted into tears  come cheer up said sir henry in french smacking him smartly on the back  theres no knowing what may happen you know to judge from your dinner today i should say you were in a fair way to recovery  alphonse stopped weeping and began to rub his back  monsieur he said doubtless means to console but his hand is heavy to continue we loved and were happy in each others love the birds in their little nest could not be happier than alphonse and his annette  then came the blow  sapristi  when i think of it  messieurs will forgive me if i wipe away a tear mine was an evil number i was drawn for the conscription  fortune would be avenged on me for having won the heart of annette  the evil moment came i had to go  i tried to run away but i was caught by brutal soldiers and they banged me with the buttend of muskets till my mustachios curled with pain  i had a cousin a linendraper welltodo but very ugly  he had drawn a good number and sympathized when they thumped me  to thee my cousin i said to thee in whose veins flows the blue blood of our heroic grandparent to thee i consign annette  watch over her whilst i hunt for glory in the bloody field  make your mind easy said he i will  as the sequel shows he did  i went  i lived in barracks on black soup  i am a refined man and a poet by nature and i suffered tortures from the coarse horror of my surroundings  there was a drill sergeant and he had a cane  ah that cane how it curled  alas never can i forget it  one morning came the news my battalion was ordered to tonquin the drill sergeant and the other coarse monsters rejoiced i  i made enquiries about tonquin  they were not satisfactory in tonquin are savage chinese who rip you open  my artistic tastes  for i am also an artist  recoiled from the idea of being ripped open  the great man makes up his mind quickly i made up my mind  i determined not to be ripped open  i deserted  i reached marseilles disguised as an old man  i went to the house of my cousin  he in whom runs my grandfathers heroic blood  and there sat annette  it was the season of cherries they took a double stalk  at each end was a cherry  my cousin put one into his mouth annette put the other in hers  then they drew the stalks in till their eyes met  and alas alas that i should have to say it  they kissed  the game was a pretty one but it filled me with fury  the heroic blood of my grandfather boiled up in me  i rushed into the kitchen i struck my cousin with the old mans crutch  he fell  i had slain him  alas i believe that i did slay him  annette screamed the gendarmes came  i fled  i reached the harbour  i hid aboard a vessel  the vessel put to sea  the captain found me and beat me  he took an opportunity  he posted a letter from a foreign port to the police  he did not put me ashore because i cooked so well  i cooked for him all the way to zanzibar when i asked for payment he kicked me  the blood of my heroic grandfather boiled within me and i shook my fist in his face and vowed to have my revenge  he kicked me again  at zanzibar there was a telegram  i cursed the man who invented telegraphs now i curse him again  i was to be arrested for desertion for murder and que saisje  i escaped from the prison  i fled i starved  i met the men of monsieur le cure  they brought me here  i am full of woe  but i return not to france  better to risk my life in these horrible places than to know the bagne  he paused and we nearly choked with laughter having to turn our faces away  ah you weep messieurs he said  no wonder  it is a sad story  perhaps said sir henry the heroic blood of your grandparent will triumph after all perhaps you will still be great  at any rate we shall see  and now i vote we go to bed i am dead tired and we had not much sleep on that confounded rock last night  and so we did and very strange the tidy rooms and clean white sheets seemed to us after our recent experiences     chapter v umslopogaas makes a promise    next morning at breakfast i missed flossie and asked where she was  well said her mother when i got up this morning i found a note put outside my door in which   but here it is you can read it for yourself and she gave me the slip of paper on which the following was written    dearest m  it is just dawn and i am off to the hills to get mr q a bloom of the lily he wants so dont expect me till you see me  i have taken the white donkey and nurse and a couple of boys are coming with me  also something to eat as i may be away all day for i am determined to get the lily if i have to go twenty miles for it   flossie   i hope she will be all right i said a little anxiously i never meant her to trouble after the flower  ah flossie can look after herself said her mother she often goes off in this way like a true child of the wilderness  but mr mackenzie who came in just then and saw the note for the first time looked rather grave though he said nothing  after breakfast was over i took him aside and asked him whether it would not be possible to send after the girl and get her back having in view the possibility of there still being some masai hanging about at whose hands she might come to harm  i fear it would be of no use he answered  she may be fifteen miles off by now and it is impossible to say what path she has taken  there are the hills and he pointed to a long range of rising ground stretching almost parallel with the course followed by the river tana but gradually sloping down to a dense bushclad plain about five miles short of the house  here i suggested that we might get up the great tree over the house and search the country round with a spyglass and this after mr mackenzie had given some orders to his people to try and follow flossies spoor we did  the ascent of the mighty tree was rather an alarming performance even with a sound ropeladder fixed at both ends to climb up at least to a landsman but good came up like a lamplighter  on reaching the height at which the first fernshaped boughs sprang from the bole we stepped without any difficulty upon a platform made of boards nailed from one bough to another and large enough to accommodate a dozen people  as for the view it was simply glorious  in every direction the bush rolled away in great billows for miles and miles as far as the glass would show only here and there broken by the brighter green of patches of cultivation or by the glittering surface of lakes  to the northwest kenia reared his mighty head and we could trace the tana river curling like a silver snake almost from his feet and far away beyond us towards the ocean  it is a glorious country and only wants the hand of civilized man to make it a most productive one  but look as we would we could see no signs of flossie and her donkey so at last we had to come down disappointed  on reaching the veranda i found umslopogaas sitting there slowly and lightly sharpening his axe with a small whetstone he always carried with him  what doest thou umslopogaas i asked  i smell blood was the answer and i could get no more out of him  after dinner we again went up the tree and searched the surrounding country with a spyglass but without result  when we came down umslopogaas was still sharpening inkosikaas although she already had an edge like a razor  standing in front of him and regarding him with a mixture of fear and fascination was alphonse  and certainly he did seem an alarming object  sitting there zulu fashion on his haunches a wild look upon his intensely savage and yet intellectual face sharpening sharpening sharpening at the murderouslooking axe  oh the monster the horrible man said the little french cook lifting his hands in amazement  see but the hole in his head the skin beats on it up and down like a babys  who would nurse such a baby and he burst out laughing at the idea  for a moment umslopogaas looked up from his sharpening and a sort of evil light played in his dark eyes  what does the little buffaloheifer so named by umslopogaas on account of his mustachios and feminine characteristics say let him be careful or i will cut his horns  beware little man monkey beware  unfortunately alphonse who was getting over his fear of him went on laughing at ce drole dun monsieur noir  i was about to warn him to desist when suddenly the huge zulu bounded off the veranda on to the open space where alphonse was standing his features alive with a sort of malicious enthusiasm and began swinging the axe round and round over the frenchmans head  stand still i shouted do not move as you value your life  he will not hurt you but i doubt if alphonse heard me being fortunately for himself almost petrified with horror  then followed the most extraordinary display of sword or rather of axemanship that i ever saw  first of all the axe went flying round and round over the top of alphonses head with an angry whirl and such extraordinary swiftness that it looked like a continuous band of steel ever getting nearer and yet nearer to that unhappy individuals skull till at last it grazed it as it flew  then suddenly the motion was changed and it seemed to literally flow up and down his body and limbs never more than an eighth of an inch from them and yet never striking them it was a wonderful sight to see the little man fixed there having apparently realized that to move would be to run the risk of sudden death while his black tormentor towered over him and wrapped him round with the quick flashes of the axe  for a minute or more this went on till suddenly i saw the moving brightness travel down the side of alphonses face and then outwards and stop  as it did so a tuft of something black fell to the ground it was the tip of one of the little frenchmans curling mustachios  umslopogaas leant upon the handle of inkosikaas and broke into a long low laugh and alphonse overcome with fear sank into a sitting posture on the ground while we stood astonished at this exhibition of almost superhuman skill and mastery of a weapon inkosikaas is sharp enough he shouted the blow that clipped the buffaloheifers horn would have split a man from the crown to the chin  few could have struck it but i none could have struck it and not taken off the shoulder too  look thou little heifer  am i a good man to laugh at thinkest thou  for a space hast thou stood within a hairsbreadth of death  laugh not again lest the hairsbreadth be wanting  i have spoken  what meanest thou by such mad tricks i asked of umslopogaas indignantly  surely thou art mad  twenty times didst thou go near to slaying the man  and yet macumazahn i slew not  thrice as inkosikaas flew the spirit entered into me to end him and send her crashing through his skull but i did not  nay it was but a jest but tell the heifer that it is not well to mock at such as i now i go to make a shield for i smell blood macumazahn  of a truth i smell blood  before the battle hast thou not seen the vulture grow of a sudden in the sky  they smell the blood macumazahn and my scent is more keen than theirs  there is a dry oxhide down yonder i go to make a shield  that is an uncomfortable retainer of yours said mr mackenzie who had witnessed this extraordinary scene  he has frightened alphonse out of his wits look and he pointed to the frenchman who with a scared white face and trembling limbs was making his way into the house  i dont think that he will ever laugh at le monsieur noir again  yes answered i it is ill jesting with such as he  when he is roused he is like a fiend and yet he has a kind heart in his own fierce way  i remember years ago seeing him nurse a sick child for a week  he is a strange character but true as steel and a strong stick to rest on in danger  he says he smells blood said mr mackenzie  i only trust he is not right  i am getting very fearful about my little girl she must have gone far or she would be home by now  it is halfpast three oclock  i pointed out that she had taken food with her and very likely would not in the ordinary course of events return till nightfall but i myself felt very anxious and fear that my anxiety betrayed itself  shortly after this the people whom mr mackenzie had sent out to search for flossie returned stating that they had followed the spoor of the donkey for a couple of miles and had then lost it on some stony ground nor could they discover it again  they had however scoured the country far and wide but without success  after this the afternoon wore drearily on and towards evening there still being no signs of flossie our anxiety grew very keen  as for the poor mother she was quite prostrated by her fears and no wonder but the father kept his head wonderfully well  everything that could be done was done people were sent out in all directions shots were fired and a continuous outlook kept from the great tree but without avail  and then it grew dark and still no sign of fairhaired little flossie  at eight oclock we had supper  it was but a sorrowful meal and mrs mackenzie did not appear at it  we three also were very silent for in addition to our natural anxiety as to the fate of the child we were weighed down by the sense that we had brought this trouble on the head of our kind host  when supper was nearly at an end i made an excuse to leave the table  i wanted to get outside and think the situation over  i went on to the veranda and having lit my pipe sat down on a seat about a dozen feet from the righthand end of the structure which was as the reader may remember exactly opposite one of the narrow doors of the protecting wall that enclosed the house and flower garden  i had been sitting there perhaps six or seven minutes when i thought i heard the door move  i looked in that direction and i listened but being unable to make out anything concluded that i must have been mistaken  it was a darkish night the moon not having yet risen  another minute passed when suddenly something round fell with a soft but heavy thud upon the stone flooring of the veranda and came bounding and rolling along past me  for a moment i did not rise but sat wondering what it could be  finally i concluded it must have been an animal  just then however another idea struck me and i got up quick enough  the thing lay quite still a few feet beyond me  i put down my hand towards it and it did not move clearly it was not an animal  my hand touched it  it was soft and warm and heavy  hurriedly i lifted it and held it up against the faint starlight  it was a newly severed human head  i am an old hand and not easily upset but i own that that ghastly sight made me feel sick  how had the thing come there  whose was it  i put it down and ran to the little doorway  i could see nothing hear nobody  i was about to go out into the darkness beyond but remembering that to do so was to expose myself to the risk of being stabbed i drew back shut the door and bolted it then i returned to the veranda and in as careless a voice as i could command called curtis  i fear however that my tones must have betrayed me for not only sir henry but also good and mackenzie rose from the table and came hurrying out  what is it said the clergyman anxiously  then i had to tell them  mr mackenzie turned pale as death under his red skin  we were standing opposite the hall door and there was a light in it so that i could see  he snatched the head up by the hair and held it against the light  it is the head of one of the men who accompanied flossie he said with a gasp  thank god it is not hers  we all stood and stared at each other aghast  what was to be done  just then there was a knocking at the door that i had bolted and a voice cried open my father open  the door was unlocked and in sped a terrified man  he was one of the spies who had been sent out  my father he cried the masai are on us  a great body of them have passed round the hill and are moving towards the old stone kraal down by the little stream  my father make strong thy heart  in the midst of them i saw the white ass and on it sat the waterlily flossie  an elmoran young warrior led the ass and by its side walked the nurse weeping  the men who went with her in the morning i saw not  was the child alive asked mr mackenzie hoarsely  she was white as the snow but well my father  they passed quite close to me and looking up from where i lay hid i saw her face against the sky  god help her and us groaned the clergyman  how many are there of them i asked  more than two hundred  two hundred and half a hundred  once more we looked one on the other  what was to be done just then there rose a loud insistent cry outside the wall  open the door white man open the door  a herald  a herald to speak with thee  thus cried the voice  umslopogaas ran to the wall and reaching with his long arms to the coping lifted his head above it and gazed over  i see but one man he said  he is armed and carries a basket in his hand  open the door i said  umslopogaas take thine axe and stand thereby  let one man pass  if another follows slay  the door was unbarred  in the shadow of the wall stood umslopogaas his axe raised above his head to strike  just then the moon came out  there was a moments pause and then in stalked a masai elmoran clad in the full war panoply that i have already described but bearing a large basket in his hand  the moonlight shone bright upon his great spear as he walked  he was physically a splendid man apparently about thirtyfive years of age  indeed none of the masai that i saw were under six feet high though mostly quite young  when he got opposite to us he halted put down the basket and stuck the spike of his spear into the ground so that it stood upright  let us talk he said  the first messenger we sent to you could not talk and he pointed to the head which lay upon the paving of the stoep  a ghastly sight in the moonlight but i have words to speak if ye have ears to hear  also i bring presents and he pointed to the basket and laughed with an air of swaggering insolence that is perfectly indescribable and yet which one could not but admire seeing that he was surrounded by enemies  say on said mr mackenzie  i am the lygonani war captain of a party of the masai of the guasa amboni  i and my men followed these three white men and he pointed to sir henry good and myself but they were too clever for us and escaped hither  we have a quarrel with them and are going to kill them  are you my friend said i to myself  in following these men we this morning caught two black men one black woman a white donkey and a white girl  one of the black men we killed  there is his head upon the pavement the other ran away  the black woman the little white girl and the white ass we took and brought with us  in proof thereof have i brought this basket that she carried  is it not thy daughters basket  mr mackenzie nodded and the warrior went on  good  with thee and thy daughter we have no quarrel nor do we wish to harm thee save as to thy cattle which we have already gathered two hundred and forty head  a beast for every mans father endnote 6  here mr mackenzie gave a groan as he greatly valued this herd of cattle which he bred with much care and trouble  so save for the cattle thou mayst go free more especially he added frankly glancing at the wall as this place would be a difficult one to take  but as to these men it is otherwise we have followed them for nights and days and must kill them were we to return to our kraal without having done so all the girls would make a mock of us  so however troublesome it may be they must die  now i have a proposition for thee  we would not harm the little girl she is too fair to harm and has besides a brave spirit give us one of these three men  a life for a life  and we will let her go and throw in the black woman with her also this is a fair offer white man  we ask but for one not for the three we must take another opportunity to kill the other two  i do not even pick my man though i should prefer the big one pointing to sir henry he looks strong and would die more slowly  and if i say i will not yield the man said mr mackenzie  nay say not so white man answered the masai for then thy daughter dies at dawn and the woman with her says thou hast no other child  were she older i would take her for a servant but as she is so young i will slay her with my own hand  ay with this very spear  thou canst come and see an thou wilt i give thee a safe conduct and the fiend laughed aloud as his brutal jest  meanwhile i had been thinking rapidly as one does in emergencies and had come to the conclusion that i would exchange myself against flossie  i scarcely like to mention the matter for fear it should be misunderstood  pray do not let any one be misled into thinking that there was anything heroic about this or any such nonsense it was merely a matter of common sense and common justice my life was an old and worthless one hers was young and valuable her death would pretty well kill her father and mother also whilst nobody would be much the worse for mine indeed several charitable institutions would have cause to rejoice thereat it was indirectly through me that the dear little girl was in her present position  lastly a man was better fitted to meet death in such a peculiarly awful form than a sweet young girl not however that i meant to let these gentry torture me to death  i am far too much of a coward to allow that being naturally a timid man my plan was to see the girl safely exchanged and then to shoot myself trusting that the almighty would take the peculiar circumstances of the case into consideration and pardon the act  all this and more went through my mind in very few seconds  all right mackenzie i said you can tell the man that i will exchange myself against flossie only i stipulate that she shall be safely in this house before they kill me  eh said sir henry and good simultaneously  that you dont  no no said mr mackenzie  i will have no mans blood upon my hands  if it please god that my daughter should die this awful death his will be done  you are a brave man which i am not by any means and a noble man quatermain but you shall not go  if nothing else turns up i shall go i said decidedly  this is an important matter said mackenzie addressing the lygonani and we must think it over  you shall have our answer at dawn  very well white man answered the savage indifferently only remember if thy answer is late thy little white bud will never grow into a flower that is all for i shall cut it with this and he touched the spear  i should have thought that thou wouldst play a trick and attack us at night but i know from the woman with the girl that your men are down at the coast and that thou hast but twenty men here  it is not wise white man he added with a laugh to keep so small a garrison for your boma kraal well good night and good night to you also other white men whose eyelids i shall soon close once and for all  at dawn thou wilt bring me word  if not remember it shall be as i have said then turning to umslopogaas who had all the while been standing behind him and shepherding him as it were open the door for me fellow quick now  this was too much for the old chiefs patience  for the last ten minutes his lips had been figuratively speaking positively watering over the masai lygonani and this he could not stand placing his long hand on the elmorans shoulder he gripped it and gave him such a twist as brought him face to face with himself then thrusting his fierce countenance to within a few inches of the masais evil featherframed features he said in a low growling voice   seest thou me  ay fellow i see thee  and seest thou this and he held inkosikaas before his eyes  ay fellow i see the toy what of it  thou masai dog thou boasting windbag thou capturer of little girls with this toy will i hew thee limb from limb  well for thee that thou art a herald or even now would i strew thy members about the grass  the masai shook his great spear and laughed loud and long as he answered i would that thou stoodst against me man to man and we would see and again he turned to go still laughing  thou shalt stand against me man to man be not afraid replied umslopogaas still in the same ominous voice  thou shalt stand face to face with umslopogaas of the blood of chaka of the people of the amazulu a captain in the regiment of the nkomabakosi as many have done before and bow thyself to inkosikaas as many have done before  ay laugh on laugh on tomorrow night shall the jackals laugh as they crunch thy ribs  when the lygonani had gone one of us thought of opening the basket he had brought as a proof that flossie was really their prisoner  on lifting the lid it was found to contain a most lovely specimen of both bulb and flower of the goya lily which i have already described in full bloom and quite uninjured and what was more a note in flossies childish hand written in pencil upon a greasy piece of paper that had been used to wrap up some food in    dearest father and mother ran the note the masai caught us when we were coming home with the lily  i tried to escape but could not  they killed tom the other man ran away  they have not hurt nurse and me but say that they mean to exchange us against one of mr quatermains party  i will have nothing of the sort  do not let anybody give his life for me  try and attack them at night they are going to feast on three bullocks they have stolen and killed  i have my pistol and if no help comes by dawn i will shoot myself  they shall not kill me if so remember me always dearest father and mother  i am very frightened but i trust in god  i dare not write any more as they are beginning to notice  goodbye   flossie   scrawled across the outside of this was love to mr quatermain they are going to take the basket so he will get the lily  when i read those words written by that brave little girl in an hour of danger sufficiently near and horrible to have turned the brain of a strong man i own i wept and once more in my heart i vowed that she should not die while my life could be given to save her  then eagerly quickly almost fiercely we fell to discussing the situation  again i said that i would go and again mackenzie negatived it and curtis and good like the true men that they are vowed that if i did they would go with me and die back to back with me  it is i said at last absolutely necessary that an effort of some sort should be made before the morning  then let us attack them with what force we can muster and take our chance said sir henry  ay ay growled umslopogaas in zulu spoken like a man incubu what is there to be afraid of  two hundred and fifty masai forsooth  how many are we  the chief there mr mackenzie has twenty men and thou macumazahn hast five men and there are also five white men  that is thirty men in all  enough enough  listen now macumazahn thou who art very clever and old in war  what says the maid  these men eat and make merry let it be their funeral feast  what said the dog whom i hope to hew down at daybreak  that he feared no attack because we were so few  knowest thou the old kraal where the men have camped i saw it this morning it is thus and he drew an oval on the floor here is the big entrance filled up with thorn bushes and opening on to a steep rise  why incubu thou and i with axes will hold it against an hundred men striving to break out look now thus shall the battle go  just as the light begins to glint upon the oxens horns  not before or it will be too dark and not later or they will be awakening and perceive us  let bougwan creep round with ten men to the top end of the kraal where the narrow entrance is  let them silently slay the sentry there so that he makes no sound and stand ready then incubu let thee and me and one of the askari  the one with the broad chest  he is a brave man  creep to the wide entrance that is filled with thorn bushes and there also slay the sentry and armed with battleaxes take our stand also one on each side of the pathway and one a few paces beyond to deal with such as pass the twain at the gate  it is there that the rush will come  that will leave sixteen men  let these men be divided into two parties with one of which shalt thou go macumazahn and with one the praying man mr mackenzie and all armed with rifles let them make their way one to the right side of the kraal and one to the left and when thou macumazahn lowest like an ox all shall open fire with the guns upon the sleeping men being very careful not to hit the little maid then shall bougwan at the far end and his ten men raise the warcry and springing over the wall put the masai there to the sword  and it shall happen that being yet heavy with food and sleep and bewildered by the firing of the guns the falling of men and the spears of bougwan the soldiers shall rise and rush like wild game towards the thornstopped entrance and there the bullets from either side shall plough through them and there shall incubu and the askari and i wait for those who break across such is my plan macumazahn if thou hast a better name it  when he had done i explained to the others such portions of his scheme as they had failed to understand and they all joined with me in expressing the greatest admiration of the acute and skilful programme devised by the old zulu who was indeed in his own savage fashion the finest general i ever knew  after some discussion we determined to accept the scheme as it stood it being the only one possible under the circumstances and giving the best chance of success that such a forlorn hope would admit of  which however considering the enormous odds and the character of our foe was not very great  ah old lion i said to umslopogaas thou knowest how to lie in wait as well as how to bite where to seize as well as where to hang on  ay ay macumazahn he answered  for thirty years have i been a warrior and have seen many things  it will be a good fight i smell blood  i tell thee i smell blood     chapter vi the night wears on    as may be imagined at the very first sign of a masai the entire population of the mission station had sought refuge inside the stout stone wall and were now to be seen  men women and countless children  huddled up together in little groups and all talking at once in awed tones of the awfulness of masai manners and customs and of the fate that they had to expect if those bloodthirsty savages succeeded in getting over the stone wall  immediately after we had settled upon the outline of our plan of action as suggested by umslopogaas mr mackenzie sent for four sharp boys of from twelve to fifteen years of age and despatched them to various points where they could keep an outlook upon the masai camp with others to report from time to time what was going on  other lads and even women were stationed at intervals along the wall in order to guard against the possibility of surprise  after this the twenty men who formed his whole available fighting force were summoned by our host into the square formed by the house and there standing by the bole of the great conifer he earnestly addressed them and our four askari  indeed it formed a very impressive scene  one not likely to be forgotten by anybody who witnessed it  immediately by the tree stood the angular form of mr mackenzie one arm outstretched as he talked and the other resting against the giant bole his hat off and his plain but kindly face clearly betraying the anguish of his mind  next to him was his poor wife who seated on a chair had her face hidden in her hand  on the other side of her was alphonse looking exceedingly uncomfortable and behind him stood the three of us with umslopogaas grim and towering form in the background resting as usual on his axe  in front stood and squatted the group of armed men  some with rifles in their hands and others with spears and shields  following with eager attention every word that fell from the speakers lips  the white light of the moon peering in beneath the lofty boughs threw a strange wild glamour over the scene whilst the melancholy soughing of the night wind passing through the millions of pine needles overhead added a sadness of its own to what was already a sufficiently tragic occasion  men said mr mackenzie after he had put all the circumstances of the case fully and clearly before them and explained to them the proposed plan of our forlorn hope  men for years i have been a good friend to you protecting you teaching you guarding you and yours from harm and ye have prospered with me  ye have seen my child  the waterlily as ye call her  grow year by year from tenderest infancy to tender childhood and from childhood on towards maidenhood  she has been your childrens playmate she has helped to tend you when sick and ye have loved her  we have said a deep voice and we will die to save her  i thank you from my heart  i thank you  sure am i that now in this hour of darkest trouble now that her young life is like to be cut off by cruel and savage men  who of a truth know not what they do  ye will strive your best to save her and to save me and her mother from broken hearts  think too of your own wives and children  if she dies her death will be followed by an attack upon us here and at the best even if we hold our own your houses and gardens will be destroyed and your goods and cattle swept away  i am as ye well know a man of peace  never in all these years have i lifted my hand to shed mans blood but now i say strike strike in the name of god who bade us protect our lives and homes  swear to me he went on with added fervour  swear to me that whilst a man of you remains alive ye will strive your uttermost with me and with these brave white men to save the child from a bloody and cruel death  say no more my father said the same deep voice that belonged to a stalwart elder of the mission we swear it  may we and ours die the death of dogs and our bones be thrown to the jackals and the kites if we break the oath  it is a fearful thing to do my father so few to strike at so many yet will we do it or die in the doing  we swear  ay thus say we all chimed in the others  thus say we all said i  it is well went on mr mackenzie  ye are true men and not broken reeds to lean on  and now friends  white and black together  let us kneel and offer up our humble supplication to the throne of power praying that he in the hollow of whose hand lie all our lives who giveth life and giveth death may be pleased to make strong our arms that we may prevail in what awaits us at the mornings light  and he knelt down an example that we all followed except umslopogaas who still stood in the background grimly leaning on inkosikaas the fierce old zulu had no gods and worshipped nought unless it were his battleaxe  oh god of gods began the clergyman his deep voice tremulous with emotion echoing up in the silence even to the leafy roof protector of the oppressed refuge of those in danger guardian of the helpless hear thou our prayer  almighty father to thee we come in supplication  hear thou our prayer  behold one child hast thou given us  an innocent child nurtured in thy knowledge  and now she lies beneath the shadow of the sword in danger of a fearful death at the hands of savage men  be with her now oh god and comfort her  save her oh heavenly father  oh god of battle who teacheth our hands to war and our fingers to fight in whose strength are hid the destinies of men be thou with us in the hour of strife  when we go forth into the shadow of death make thou us strong to conquer  breathe thou upon our foes and scatter them turn thou their strength to water and bring their highblown pride to nought compass us about with thy protection throw over us the shield of thy power forget us not now in the hour of our sore distress help us now that the cruel man would dash our little ones against the stones  hear thou our prayer  and for those of us who kneeling now on earth in health before thee shall at the sunrise adore thy presence on the throne hear our prayer  make them clean oh god wash away their offences in the blood of the lamb and when their spirits pass oh receive thou them into the haven of the just  go forth oh father go forth with us into the battle as with the israelites of old  oh god of battle hear thou our prayer  he ceased and after a moments silence we all rose and then began our preparations in good earnest  as umslopogaas said it was time to stop talking and get to business  the men who were to form each little party were carefully selected and still more carefully and minutely instructed as to what was to be done after much consideration it was agreed that the ten men led by good whose duty it was to stampede the camp were not to carry firearms that is with the exception of good himself who had a revolver as well as a short sword  the masai sime which i had taken from the body of our poor servant who was murdered in the canoe  we feared that if they had firearms the result of three crossfires carried on at once would be that some of our own people would be shot besides it appeared to all of us that the work they had to do would best be carried out with cold steel  especially to umslopogaas who was indeed a great advocate of cold steel  we had with us four winchester repeating rifles besides half a dozen martinis  i armed myself with one of the repeaters  my own an excellent weapon for this kind of work where great rapidity of fire is desirable and fitted with ordinary flapsights instead of the cumbersome sliding mechanism which they generally have  mr mackenzie took another and the two remaining ones were given to two of his men who understood the use of them and were noted shots  the martinis and some rifles of mr mackenzies were served out together with a plentiful supply of ammunition to the other natives who were to form the two parties whose duty it was to be to open fire from separate sides of the kraal on the sleeping masai and who were fortunately all more or less accustomed to the use of a gun  as for umslopogaas we know how he was armed  with an axe it may be remembered that he sir henry and the strongest of the askari were to hold the thornstopped entrance to the kraal against the anticipated rush of men striving to escape  of course for such a purpose as this guns were useless  therefore sir henry and the askari proceeded to arm themselves in like fashion it so happened that mr mackenzie had in his little store a selection of the very best and englishmade hammerbacked axeheads  sir henry selected one of these weighing about two and a half pounds and very broad in the blade and the askari took another a size smaller  after umslopogaas had put an extra edge on these two axeheads we fixed them to three feet six helves of which mr mackenzie fortunately had some in stock made of a light but exceedingly tough native wood something like english ash only more springy  when two suitable helves had been selected with great care and the ends of the hafts notched to prevent the hand from slipping the axeheads were fixed on them as firmly as possible and the weapons immersed in a bucket of water for half an hour  the result of this was to swell the wood in the socket in such a fashion that nothing short of burning would get it out again  when this important matter had been attended to by umslopogaas i went into my room and proceeded to open a little tinlined deal case which contained  what do you think  nothing more or less than four mail shirts  it had happened to us three on a previous journey that we had made in another part of africa to owe our lives to iron shirts of native make and remembering this i had suggested before we started on our present hazardous expedition that we should have some made to fit us  there was a little difficulty about this as armourmaking is pretty well an extinct art but they can do most things in the way of steel work in birmingham if they are put to it and you will pay the price and the end of it was that they turned us out the loveliest steel shirts it is possible to see  the workmanship was exceedingly fine the web being composed of thousands upon thousands of stout but tiny rings of the best steel made  these shirts or rather steelsleeved and highnecked jerseys were lined with ventilated wash leather were not bright but browned like the barrel of a gun and mine weighed exactly seven pounds and fitted me so well that i found i could wear it for days next to my skin without being chafed sir henry had two one of the ordinary make viz a jersey with little dependent flaps meant to afford some protection to the upper part of the thighs and another of his own design fashioned on the pattern of the garments advertised as combinations and weighing twelve pounds  this combination shirt of which the seat was made of washleather protected the whole body down to the knees but was rather more cumbersome inasmuch as it had to be laced up at the back and of course involved some extra weight  with these shirts were what looked like four brown cloth travelling caps with ear pieces  each of these caps was however quilted with steel links so as to afford a most valuable protection for the head  it seems almost laughable to talk of steel shirts in these days of bullets against which they are of course quite useless but where one has to do with savages armed with cutting weapons such as assegais or battleaxes they afford the most valuable protection being if well made quite invulnerable to them i have often thought that if only the english government had in our savage wars and more especially in the zulu war thought fit to serve out light steel shirts there would be many a man alive today who as it is is dead and forgotten  to return on the present occasion we blessed our foresight in bringing these shirts and also our good luck in that they had not been stolen by our rascally bearers when they ran away with our goods  as curtis had two and after considerable deliberation had made up his mind to wear his combination one himself  the extra three or four pounds weight being a matter of no account to so strong a man and the protection afforded to the thighs being a very important matter to a fighting man not armed with a shield of any kind  i suggested that he should lend the other to umslopogaas who was to share the danger and the glory of his post  he readily consented and called the zulu who came bearing sir henrys axe which he had now fixed up to his satisfaction with him  when we showed him the steel shirt and explained to him that we wanted him to wear it he at first declined saying that he had fought in his own skin for thirty years and that he was not going to begin now to fight in an iron one  thereupon i took a heavy spear and spreading the shirt upon the floor drove the spear down upon it with all my strength the weapon rebounding without leaving a mark upon the tempered steel  this exhibition half converted him and when i pointed out to him how necessary it was that he should not let any oldfashioned prejudices he might possess stand in the way of a precaution which might preserve a valuable life at a time when men were scarce and also that if he wore this shirt he might dispense with a shield and so have both hands free he yielded at once and proceeded to invest his frame with the iron skin  and indeed although made for sir henry it fitted the great zulu like a skin  the two men were almost of a height and though curtis looked the bigger man i am inclined to think that the difference was more imaginary than real the fact being that although he was plumper and rounder he was not really bigger except in the arm  umslopogaas had comparatively speaking thin arms but they were as strong as wire ropes  at any rate when they both stood axe in hand invested in the brown mail which clung to their mighty forms like a web garment showing the swell of every muscle and the curve of every line they formed a pair that any ten men might shrink from meeting  it was now nearly one oclock in the morning and the spies reported that after having drunk the blood of the oxen and eaten enormous quantities of meat the masai were going to sleep round their watchfires but that sentries had been posted at each opening of the kraal  flossie they added was sitting not far from the wall in the centre of the western side of the kraal and by her were the nurse and the white donkey which was tethered to a peg  her feet were bound with a rope and warriors were lying about all round her  as there was absolutely nothing further that could be done then we all took some supper and went to lie down for a couple of hours  i could not help admiring the way in which old umslopogaas flung himself upon the floor and unmindful of what was hanging over him instantly sank into a deep sleep  i do not know how it was with the others but i could not do as much  indeed as is usual with me on these occasions i am sorry to say that i felt rather frightened and now that some of the enthusiasm had gone out of me and i began to calmly contemplate what we had undertaken to do truth compels me to add that i did not like it  we were but thirty men all told a good many of whom were no doubt quite unused to fighting and we were going to engage two hundred and fifty of the fiercest bravest and most formidable savages in africa who to make matters worse were protected by a stone wall  it was indeed a mad undertaking and what made it even madder was the exceeding improbability of our being able to take up our positions without attracting the notice of the sentries  of course if we once did that  and any slight accident such as the chance discharge of a gun might do it  we were done for for the whole camp would be up in a second and our only hope lay in surprise  the bed whereon i lay indulging in these uncomfortable reflections was near an open window that looked on to the veranda through which came an extraordinary sound of groaning and weeping  for a time i could not make out what it was but at last i got up and putting my head out of the window stared about  presently i saw a dim figure kneeling on the end of the veranda and beating his breast  in which i recognized alphonse  not being able to understand his french talk or what on earth he was at i called to him and asked him what he was doing  ah monsieur he sighed i do make prayer for the souls of those whom i shall slay tonight  indeed i said then i wish that you would do it a little more quietly  alphonse retreated and i heard no more of his groans  and so the time passed till at length mr mackenzie called me in a whisper through the window for of course everything had now to be done in the most absolute silence  three oclock he said we must begin to move at halfpast  i told him to come in and presently he entered and i am bound to say that if it had not been that just then i had not got a laugh anywhere about me i should have exploded at the sight he presented armed for battle  to begin with he had on a clergymans black swallowtail and a kind of broadrimmed black felt hat both of which he had donned on account he said of their dark colour  in his hand was the winchester repeating rifle we had lent him and stuck in an elastic cricketing belt like those worn by english boys were first a huge buckhornhandled carving knife with a guard to it and next a longbarrelled colts revolver  ah my friend he said seeing me staring at his belt you are looking at my carver  i thought it might come in handy if we came to close quarters it is excellent steel and many is the pig i have killed with it  by this time everybody was up and dressing  i put on a light norfolk jacket over my mail shirt in order to have a pocket handy to hold my cartridges and buckled on my revolver  good did the same but sir henry put on nothing except his mail shirt steellined cap and a pair of veldtschoons or soft hide shoes his legs being bare from the knees down  his revolver he strapped on round his middle outside the armoured shirt  meanwhile umslopogaas was mustering the men in the square under the big tree and going the rounds to see that each was properly armed etc  at the last moment we made one change  finding that two of the men who were to have gone with the firing parties knew little or nothing of guns but were good spearsmen we took away their rifles supplied them with shields and long spears of the masai pattern and took them off to join curtis umslopogaas and the askari in holding the wide opening it having become clear to us that three men however brave and strong were too few for the work     chapter vii a slaughter grim and great    then there was a pause and we stood there in the chilly silent darkness waiting till the moment came to start  it was perhaps the most trying time of all  that slow slow quarter of an hour  the minutes seemed to drag along with leaden feet and the quiet the solemn hush that brooded over all  big as it were with a coming fate was most oppressive to the spirits i once remember having to get up before dawn to see a man hanged and i then went through a very similar set of sensations only in the present instance my feelings were animated by that more vivid and personal element which naturally appertains rather to the person to be operated on than to the most sympathetic spectator  the solemn faces of the men well aware that the short passage of an hour would mean for some and perhaps all of them the last great passage to the unknown or oblivion the bated whispers in which they spoke even sir henrys continuous and thoughtful examination of his woodcutters axe and the fidgety way in which good kept polishing his eyeglass all told the same tale of nerves stretched pretty nigh to breakingpoint  only umslopogaas leaning as usual upon inkosikaas and taking an occasional pinch of snuff was to all appearance perfectly and completely unmoved  nothing could touch his iron nerves  the moon went down  for a long while she had been getting nearer and nearer to the horizon  now she finally sank and left the world in darkness save for a faint grey tinge in the eastern sky that palely heralded the dawn  mr mackenzie stood watch in hand his wife clinging to his arm and striving to stifle her sobs  twenty minutes to four he said it ought to be light enough to attack at twenty minutes past four  captain good had better be moving he will want three or four minutes start  good gave one final polish to his eyeglass nodded to us in a jocular sort of way  which i could not help feeling it must have cost him something to muster up  and ever polite took off his steellined cap to mrs mackenzie and started for his position at the head of the kraal to reach which he had to make a detour by some paths known to the natives  just then one of the boys came in and reported that everybody in the masai camp with the exception of the two sentries who were walking up and down in front of the respective entrances appeared to be fast asleep  then the rest of us took the road first came the guide then sir henry umslopogaas the wakwafi askari and mr mackenzies two mission natives armed with long spears and shields  i followed immediately after with alphonse and five natives all armed with guns and mr mackenzie brought up the rear with the six remaining natives  the cattle kraal where the masai were camped lay at the foot of the hill on which the house stood or roughly speaking about eight hundred yards from the mission buildings  the first five hundred yards of this distance we traversed quietly indeed but at a good pace after that we crept forward as silently as a leopard on his prey gliding like ghosts from bush to bush and stone to stone  when i had gone a little way i chanced to look behind me and saw the redoubtable alphonse staggering along with white face and trembling knees and his rifle which was at full cock pointed directly at the small of my back  having halted and carefully put the rifle at safety we started again and all went well till we were within one hundred yards or so of the kraal when his teeth began to chatter in the most aggressive way  if you dont stop that i will kill you i whispered savagely for the idea of having all our lives sacrificed to a toothchattering cook was too much for me  i began to fear that he would betray us and heartily wished we had left him behind  but monsieur i cannot help it he answered it is the cold  here was a dilemma but fortunately i devised a plan  in the pocket of the coat i had on was a small piece of dirty rag that i had used some time before to clean a gun with  put this in your mouth i whispered again giving him the rag and if i hear another sound you are a dead man  i knew that that would stifle the clatter of his teeth  i must have looked as if i meant what i said for he instantly obeyed me and continued his journey in silence  then we crept on again  at last we were within fifty yards of the kraal  between us and it was an open space of sloping grass with only one mimosa bush and a couple of tussocks of a sort of thistle for cover we were still hidden in fairly thick bush  it was beginning to grow light  the stars had paled and a sickly gleam played about the east and was reflected on the earth  we could see the outline of the kraal clearly enough and could also make out the faint glimmer of the dying embers of the masai campfires we halted and watched for the sentry we knew was posted at the opening  presently he appeared a fine tall fellow walking idly up and down within five paces of the thornstopped entrance we had hoped to catch him napping but it was not to be  he seemed particularly wide awake  if we could not kill that man and kill him silently we were lost  there we crouched and watched him  presently umslopogaas who was a few paces ahead of me turned and made a sign and next second i saw him go down on his stomach like a snake and taking an opportunity when the sentrys head was turned begin to work his way through the grass without a sound  the unconscious sentry commenced to hum a little tune and umslopogaas crept on  he reached the shelter of the mimosa bush unperceived and there waited  still the sentry walked up and down  presently he turned and looked over the wall into the camp  instantly the human snake who was stalking him glided on ten yards and got behind one of the tussocks of the thistlelike plant reaching it as the elmoran turned again  as he did so his eye fell upon this patch of thistles and it seemed to strike him that it did not look quite right  he advanced a pace towards it  halted yawned stooped down picked up a little pebble and threw it at it  it hit umslopogaas upon the head luckily not upon the armour shirt  had it done so the clink would have betrayed us luckily too the shirt was browned and not bright steel which would certainly have been detected  apparently satisfied that there was nothing wrong he then gave over his investigations and contented himself with leaning on his spear and standing gazing idly at the tuft  for at least three minutes did he stand thus plunged apparently in a gentle reverie and there we lay in the last extremity of anxiety expecting every moment that we should be discovered or that some untoward accident would happen  i could hear alphonses teeth going like anything on the oiled rag and turning my head round made an awful face at him  but i am bound to state that my own heart was at much the same game as the frenchmans castanets while the perspiration was pouring from my body causing the washleatherlined shirt to stick to me unpleasantly and altogether i was in the pitiable state known by schoolboys as a blue fright  at last the ordeal came to an end  the sentry glanced at the east and appeared to note with satisfaction that his period of duty was coming to an end  as indeed it was once and for all  for he rubbed his hands and began to walk again briskly to warm himself  the moment his back was turned the long black snake glided on again and reached the other thistle tuft which was within a couple of paces of his return beat  back came the sentry and strolled right past the tuft utterly unconscious of the presence that was crouching behind it  had he looked down he could scarcely have failed to see but he did not do so  he passed and then his hidden enemy erected himself and with outstretched hand followed in his tracks  a moment more and just as the elmoran was about to turn the great zulu made a spring and in the growing light we could see his long lean hands close round the masais throat  then followed a convulsive twining of the two dark bodies and in another second i saw the masais head bent back and heard a sharp crack something like that of a dry twig snapping and he fell down upon the ground his limbs moving spasmodically  umslopogaas had put out all his iron strength and broken the warriors neck  for a moment he knelt upon his victim still gripping his throat till he was sure that there was nothing more to fear from him and then he rose and beckoned to us to advance which we did on all fours like a colony of huge apes  on reaching the kraal we saw that the masai had still further choked this entrance which was about ten feet wide  no doubt in order to guard against attack  by dragging four or five tops of mimosa trees up to it  so much the better for us i reflected the more obstruction there was the slower would they be able to come through  here we separated mackenzie and his party creeping up under the shadow of the wall to the left while sir henry and umslopogaas took their stations one on each side of the thorn fence the two spearmen and the askari lying down in front of it  i and my men crept on up the right side of the kraal which was about fifty paces long  when i was twothirds up i halted and placed my men at distances of four paces from one another keeping alphonse close to me however  then i peeped for the first time over the wall  it was getting fairly light now and the first thing i saw was the white donkey exactly opposite to me and close by it i could make out the pale face of little flossie who was sitting as the lad had described some ten paces from the wall  round her lay many warriors sleeping  at distances all over the surface of the kraal were the remains of fires round each of which slept some fiveandtwenty masai for the most part gorged with food now and then a man would raise himself yawn and look at the east which was turning primrose but none got up  i determined to wait another five minutes both to allow the light to increase so that we could make better shooting and to give good and his party  of whom we could see or hear nothing  every opportunity to make ready  the quiet dawn began to throw her everwidening mantle over plain and forest and river  mighty kenia wrapped in the silence of eternal snows looked out across the earth  till presently a beam from the unrisen sun lit upon his heavenkissing crest and purpled it with blood the sky above grew blue and tender as a mothers smile a bird began to pipe his morning song and a little breeze passing through the bush shook down the dewdrops in millions to refresh the waking world  everywhere was peace and the happiness of arising strength everywhere save in the heart of cruel man  suddenly just as i was nerving myself for the signal having already selected my man on whom i meant to open fire  a great fellow sprawling on the ground within three feet of little flossie  alphonses teeth began to chatter again like the hoofs of a galloping giraffe making a great noise in the silence  the rag had dropped out in the agitation of his mind  instantly a masai within three paces of us woke and sitting up gazed about him looking for the cause of the sound  moved beyond myself i brought the buttend of my rifle down on to the pit of the frenchmans stomach  this stopped his chattering but as he doubled up he managed to let off his gun in such a manner that the bullet passed within an inch of my head  there was no need for a signal now  from both sides of the kraal broke out a waving line of fire in which i myself joined managing with a snap shot to knock over my masai by flossie just as he was jumping up  then from the top end of the kraal there rang an awful yell in which i rejoiced to recognize goods piercing notes rising clear and shrill above the din and in another second followed such a scene as i have never seen before nor shall again with an universal howl of terror and fury the brawny crowd of savages within the kraal sprang to their feet many of them to fall again beneath our welldirected hail of lead before they had moved a yard  for a moment they stood undecided and then hearing the cries and curses that rose unceasingly from the top end of the kraal and bewildered by the storm of bullets they as by one impulse rushed down towards the thornstopped entrance as they went we kept pouring our fire with terrible effect into the thickening mob as fast as we could load  i had emptied my repeater of the ten shots it contained and was just beginning to slip in some more when i bethought me of little flossie looking up i saw that the white donkey was lying kicking having been knocked over either by one of our bullets or a masai spearthrust there were no living masai near but the black nurse was on her feet and with a spear cutting the rope that bound flossies feet  next second she ran to the wall of the kraal and began to climb over it an example which the little girl followed but flossie was evidently very stiff and cramped and could only go slowly and as she went two masai flying down the kraal caught sight of her and rushed towards her to kill her  the first fellow came up just as the poor little girl after a desperate effort to climb the wall fell back into the kraal  up flashed the great spear and as it did so a bullet from my rifle found its home in the holders ribs and over he went like a shot rabbit but behind him was the other man and alas i had only that one cartridge in the magazine  flossie had scrambled to her feet and was facing the second man who was advancing with raised spear  i turned my head aside and felt sick as death  i could not bear to see him stab her  glancing up again to my surprise i saw the masais spear lying on the ground while the man himself was staggering about with both hands to his head  suddenly i saw a puff of smoke proceeding apparently from flossie and the man fell down headlong  then i remembered the derringer pistol she carried and saw that she had fired both barrels of it at him thereby saving her life  in another instant she had made an effort and assisted by the nurse who was lying on the top had scrambled over the wall and i knew that she was comparatively speaking safe  all this takes time to tell but i do not suppose that it took more than fifteen seconds to enact  i soon got the magazine of the repeater filled again with cartridges and once more opened fire not on the seething black mass which was gathering at the end of the kraal but on fugitives who bethought them to climb the wall  i picked off several of these men moving down towards the end of the kraal as i did so and arriving at the corner or rather the bend of the oval in time to see and by means of my rifle to assist in the mighty struggle that took place there  by this time some two hundred masai  allowing that we had up to the present accounted for fifty  had gathered together in front of the thornstopped entrance driven thither by the spears of goods men whom they doubtless supposed were a large force instead of being but ten strong  for some reason it never occurred to them to try and rush the wall which they could have scrambled over with comparative ease they all made for the fence which was really a strongly interwoven fortification  with a bound the first warrior went at it and even before he touched the ground on the other side i saw sir henrys great axe swing up and fall with awful force upon his feather headpiece and he sank into the middle of the thorns  then with a yell and a crash they began to break through as they might and ever as they came the great axe swung and inkosikaas flashed and they fell dead one by one each man thus helping to build up a barrier against his fellows  those who escaped the axes of the pair fell at the hands of the askari and the two mission kaffirs and those who passed scatheless from them were brought low by my own and mackenzies fire  faster and more furious grew the fighting  single masai would spring upon the dead bodies of their comrades and engage one or other of the axemen with their long spears but thanks chiefly to the mail shirts the result was always the same  presently there was a great swing of the axe a crashing sound and another dead masai  that is if the man was engaged with sir henry if it was umslopogaas that he fought with the result indeed would be the same but it would be differently attained  it was but rarely that the zulu used the crashing doublehanded stroke on the contrary he did little more than tap continually at his adversarys head pecking at it with the poleaxe end of the axe as a woodpecker endnote 7 pecks at rotten wood presently a peck would go home and his enemy would drop down with a neat little circular hole in his forehead or skull exactly similar to that which a cheesescoop makes in a cheese  he never used the broad blade of the axe except when hard pressed or when striking at a shield  he told me afterwards that he did not consider it sportsmanlike  good and his men were quite close by now and our people had to cease firing into the mass for fear of killing some of them as it was one of them was slain in this way  mad and desperate with fear the masai by a frantic effort burst through the thorn fence and piledup dead and sweeping curtis umslopogaas and the other three before them into the open  and now it was that we began to lose men fast  down went our poor askari who was armed with the axe a great spear standing out a foot behind his back and before long the two spearsmen who had stood with him went down too dying fighting like tigers and others of our party shared their fate  for a moment i feared the fight was lost  certainly it trembled in the balance  i shouted to my men to cast down their rifles and to take spears and throw themselves into the melee  they obeyed their blood being now thoroughly up and mr mackenzies people followed their example  this move had a momentary good result but still the fight hung in the balance  our people fought magnificently hurling themselves upon the dark mass of elmoran hewing thrusting slaying and being slain and ever above the din rose goods awful yell of encouragement as he plunged to wherever the fight was thickest and ever with an almost machinelike regularity the two axes rose and fell carrying death and disablement at every stroke  but i could see that the strain was beginning to tell upon sir henry who was bleeding from several flesh wounds his breath was coming in gasps and the veins stood out on his forehead like blue and knotted cords  even umslopogaas man of iron that he was was hard pressed  i noticed that he had given up woodpecking and was now using the broad blade of inkosikaas browning his enemy wherever he could hit him instead of drilling scientific holes in his head  i myself did not go into the melee but hovered outside like the swift back in a football scrimmage putting a bullet through a masai whenever i got a chance  i was more use so  i fired fortynine cartridges that morning and i did not miss many shots  presently do as we would the beam of the balance began to rise against us  we had not more than fifteen or sixteen effectives left now and the masai had at least fifty  of course if they had kept their heads and shaken themselves together they could soon have made an end of the matter but that is just what they did not do not having yet recovered from their start and some of them having actually fled from their sleepingplaces without their weapons  still by now many individuals were fighting with their normal courage and discretion and this alone was sufficient to defeat us  to make matters worse just then when mackenzies rifle was empty a brawny savage armed with a sime or sword made a rush for him  the clergyman flung down his gun and drawing his huge carver from his elastic belt his revolver had dropped out in the fight they closed in desperate struggle  presently locked in a close embrace missionary and masai rolled on the ground behind the wall and for some time i being amply occupied with my own affairs and in keeping my skin from being pricked remained in ignorance of his fate or how the duel had ended  to and fro surged the fight slowly turning round like the vortex of a human whirlpool and the matter began to look very bad for us  just then however a fortunate thing happened  umslopogaas either by accident or design broke out of the ring and engaged a warrior at some few paces from it  as he did so another man ran up and struck him with all his force between his shoulders with his great spear which falling on the tough steel shirt failed to pierce it and rebounded  for a moment the man stared aghast  protective armour being unknown among these tribes  and then he yelled out at the top of his voice   they are devils  bewitched bewitched  and seized by a sudden panic he threw down his spear and began to fly  i cut short his career with a bullet and umslopogaas brained his man and then the panic spread to the others  bewitched bewitched they cried and tried to escape in every direction utterly demoralized and brokenspirited for the most part even throwing down their shields and spears  on the last scene of that dreadful fight i need not dwell  it was a slaughter great and grim in which no quarter was asked or given  one incident however is worth detailing  just as i was hoping that it was all done with suddenly from under a heap of slain where he had been hiding an unwounded warrior sprang up and clearing the piles of dying dead like an antelope sped like the wind up the kraal towards the spot where i was standing at the moment  but he was not alone for umslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallowlike motion for which he was noted and as they neared me i recognized in the masai the herald of the previous night  finding that run as he would his pursuer was gaining on him the man halted and turned round to give battle  umslopogaas also pulled up  ah ah he cried in mockery to the elmoran it is thou whom i talked with last night  the lygonani the herald the capturer of little girls  he who would kill a little girl  and thou didst hope to stand man to man and face to face with umslopogaas an induna of the tribe of the maquilisini of the people of the amazulu  behold thy prayer is granted  and i didst swear to hew thee limb from limb thou insolent dog  behold i will do it even now  the masai ground his teeth with fury and charged at the zulu with his spear  as he came umslopogaas deftly stepped aside and swinging inkosikaas high above his head with both hands brought the broad blade down with such fearful force from behind upon the masais shoulder just where the neck is set into the frame that its razor edge shore right through bone and flesh and muscle almost severing the head and one arm from the body  ou ejaculated umslopogaas contemplating the corpse of his foe i have kept my word  it was a good stroke     chapter viii  alphonse explains   and so the fight was ended  on returning from the shocking scene it suddenly struck me that i had seen nothing of alphonse since the moment some twenty minutes before  for though this fight has taken a long while to describe it did not take long in reality  when i had been forced to hit him in the wind with the result of nearly getting myself shot  fearing that the poor little man had perished in the battle i began to hunt among the dead for his body but not being able either to see or hear anything of it i concluded that he must have survived and walked down the side of the kraal where we had first taken our stand calling him by name  now some fifteen paces back from the kraal wall stood a very ancient tree of the banyan species  so ancient was it that all the inside had in the course of ages decayed away leaving nothing but a shell of bark  alphonse i called as i walked down the wall  alphonse  oui monsieur answered a voice  here am i  i looked round but could see nobody  where i cried  here am i monsieur in the tree  i looked and there peering out of a hole in the trunk of the banyan about five feet from the ground i saw a pale face and a pair of large mustachios one clipped short and the other as lamentably out of curl as the tail of a newly whipped pug  then for the first time i realized what i had suspected before  namely that alphonse was an arrant coward  i walked up to him come out of that hole i said  is it finished monsieur he asked anxiously quite finished ah the horrors i have undergone and the prayers i have uttered  come out you little wretch i said for i did not feel amiable it is all over  so monsieur then my prayers have prevailed  i emerge and he did  as we were walking down together to join the others who were gathered in a group by the wide entrance to the kraal which now resembled a veritable charnelhouse a masai who had escaped so far and been hiding under a bush suddenly sprang up and charged furiously at us  off went alphonse with a howl of terror and after him flew the masai bent upon doing some execution before he died  he soon overtook the poor little frenchman and would have finished him then and there had i not just as alphonse made a last agonized double in the vain hope of avoiding the yard of steel that was flashing in his immediate rear managed to plant a bullet between the elmorans broad shoulders which brought matters to a satisfactory conclusion so far as the frenchman was concerned  but just then he tripped and fell flat and the body of the masai fell right on the top of him moving convulsively in the death struggle  thereupon there arose such a series of piercing howls that i concluded that before he died the savage must have managed to stab poor alphonse  i ran up in a hurry and pulled the masai off and there beneath him lay alphonse covered with blood and jerking himself about like a galvanized frog  poor fellow thought i he is done for and kneeling down by him i began to search for his wound as well as his struggles would allow  oh the hole in my back he yelled  i am murdered  i am dead  oh annette  i searched again but could see no wound  then the truth dawned on me  the man was frightened not hurt  get up i shouted get up  arent you ashamed of yourself you are not touched  thereupon he rose not a penny the worse  but monsieur i thought i was he said apologetically i did not know that i had conquered  then giving the body of the masai a kick he ejaculated triumphantly ah dog of a black savage thou art dead what victory  thoroughly disgusted i left alphonse to look after himself which he did by following me like a shadow and proceeded to join the others by the large entrance  the first thing that i saw was mackenzie seated on a stone with a handkerchief twisted round his thigh from which he was bleeding freely having indeed received a spearthrust that passed right through it and still holding in his hand his favourite carving knife now bent nearly double from which i gathered that he had been successful in his rough and tumble with the elmoran  ah quatermain he sang out in a trembling excited voice so we have conquered but it is a sorry sight a sorry sight and then breaking into broad scotch and glancing at the bent knife in his hand it fashes me sair to have bent my best carver on the breastbone of a savage and he laughed hysterically poor fellow what between his wound and the killing excitement he had undergone his nerves were much shaken and no wonder it is hard upon a man of peace and kindly heart to be called upon to join in such a gruesome business  but there fate puts us sometimes into very comical positions  at the kraal entrance the scene was a strange one  the slaughter was over by now and the wounded men had been put out of their pain for no quarter had been given  the bushclosed entrance was trampled flat and in place of bushes it was filled with the bodies of dead men  dead men everywhere dead men  they lay about in knots they were flung by ones and twos in every position upon the open spaces for all the world like the people on the grass in one of the london parks on a particularly hot sunday in august  in front of this entrance on a space which had been cleared of dead and of the shields and spears which were scattered in all directions as they had fallen or been thrown from the hands of their owners stood and lay the survivors of the awful struggle and at their feet were four wounded men we had gone into the fight thirty strong and of the thirty but fifteen remained alive and five of them including mr mackenzie were wounded two mortally  of those who held the entrance curtis and the zulu alone remained  good had lost five men killed i had lost two killed and mackenzie no less than five out of the six with him  as for the survivors they were with the exception of myself who had never come to close quarters red from head to foot  sir henrys armour might have been painted that colour  and utterly exhausted except umslopogaas who as he grimly stood on a little mound above a heap of dead leaning as usual upon his axe did not seem particularly distressed although the skin over the hole in his head palpitated violently  ah macumazahn he said to me as i limped up feeling very sick i told thee that it would be a good fight and it has never have i seen a better or one more bravely fought  as for this iron shirt surely it is tagati bewitched nothing could pierce it  had it not been for the garment i should have been there and he nodded towards the great pile of dead men beneath him  i give it thee thou art a brave man said sir henry briefly  koos answered the zulu deeply pleased both at the gift and the compliment  thou too incubu didst bear thyself as a man but i must give thee some lessons with the axe thou dost waste thy strength  just then mackenzie asked about flossie and we were all greatly relieved when one of the men said he had seen her flying towards the house with the nurse  then bearing such of the wounded as could be moved at the moment with us we slowly made our way towards the missionhouse spent with toil and bloodshed but with the glorious sense of victory against overwhelming odds glowing in our hearts  we had saved the life of the little maid and taught the masai of those parts a lesson that they will not forget for ten years  but at what a cost  painfully we made our way up the hill which just a little more than an hour before we had descended under such different circumstances at the gate of the wall stood mrs mackenzie waiting for us when her eyes fell upon us however she shrieked out and covered her face with her hands crying horrible horrible  nor were her fears allayed when she discovered her worthy husband being borne upon an improvized stretcher but her doubts as to the nature of his injury were soon set at rest  then when in a few brief words i had told her the upshot of the struggle of which flossie who had arrived in safety had been able to explain something she came up to me and solemnly kissed me on the forehead  god bless you all mr quatermain you have saved my childs life she said simply  then we went in and got our clothes off and doctored our wounds i am glad to say i had none and sir henrys and goods were thanks to those invaluable chain shirts of a comparatively harmless nature and to be dealt with by means of a few stitches and sticking plaster mackenzies however were serious though fortunately the spear had not severed any large artery  after that we had a bath and what a luxury it was  and having clad ourselves in ordinary clothes proceeded to the diningroom where breakfast was set as usual  it was curious sitting down there drinking tea and eating toast in an ordinary nineteenthcentury sort of way just as though we had not employed the early hours in a regular primitive handtohand middleages kind of struggle  as good said the whole thing seemed more as though one had had a bad nightmare just before being called than as a deed done  when we were finishing our breakfast the door opened and in came little flossie very pale and tottery but quite unhurt  she kissed us all and thanked us  i congratulated her on the presence of mind she had shown in shooting the masai with her derringer pistol and thereby saving her own life  oh dont talk of it she said beginning to cry hysterically i shall never forget his face as he went turning round and round never  i can see it now  i advised her to go to bed and get some sleep which she did and awoke in the evening quite recovered so far as her strength was concerned  it struck me as an odd thing that a girl who could find the nerve to shoot a huge black ruffian rushing to kill her with a spear should have been so affected at the thought of it afterwards but it is after all characteristic of the sex  poor flossie  i fear that her nerves will not get over that night in the masai camp for many a long year  she told me afterwards that it was the suspense that was so awful having to sit there hour after hour through the livelong night utterly ignorant as to whether or not any attempt was to be made to rescue her  she said that on the whole she did not expect it knowing how few of us and how many of the masai  who by the way came continually to stare at her most of them never having seen a white person before and handled her arms and hair with their filthy paws  she said also that she had made up her mind that if she saw no signs of succour by the time the first rays of the rising sun reached the kraal she would kill herself with the pistol for the nurse had heard the lygonani say that they were to be tortured to death as soon as the sun was up if one of the white men did not come in their place  it was an awful resolution to have to take but she meant to act on it and i have little doubt but what she would have done so  although she was at an age when in england girls are in the schoolroom and come down to dessert this child of the wilderness had more courage discretion and power of mind than many a woman of mature age nurtured in idleness and luxury with minds carefully drilled and educated out of any originality or selfresource that nature may have endowed them with  when breakfast was over we all turned in and had a good sleep only getting up in time for dinner after which meal we once more adjourned together with all the available population  men women youths and girls  to the scene of the mornings slaughter our object being to bury our own dead and get rid of the masai by flinging them into the tana river which ran within fifty yards of the kraal  on reaching the spot we disturbed thousands upon thousands of vultures and a sort of brown bush eagle which had been flocking to the feast from miles and miles away  often have i watched these great and repulsive birds and marvelled at the extraordinary speed with which they arrive on a scene of slaughter  a buck falls to your rifle and within a minute high in the blue ether appears a speck that gradually grows into a vulture then another and another  i have heard many theories advanced to account for the wonderful power of perception nature has given these birds  my own founded on a good deal of observation is that the vultures gifted as they are with powers of sight greater than those given by the most powerful glass quarter out the heavens among themselves and hanging in midair at a vast height  probably from two to three miles above the earth  keep watch each of them over an enormous stretch of country  presently one of them spies food and instantly begins to sink towards it  thereon his next neighbour in the airy heights sailing leisurely through the blue gulf at a distance perhaps of some miles follows his example knowing that food has been sighted  down he goes and all the vultures within sight of him follow after and so do all those in sight of them in this way the vultures for twenty miles round can be summoned to the feast in a few minutes  we buried our dead in solemn silence good being selected to read the burial service over them in the absence of mr mackenzie confined to bed as he was generally allowed to possess the best voice and most impressive manner  it was melancholy in the extreme but as good said it might have been worse for we might have had to bury ourselves  i pointed out that this would have been a difficult feat but i knew what he meant  next we set to work to load an oxwagon which had been brought round from the mission with the dead bodies of the masai having first collected the spears shields and other arms  we loaded the wagon five times about fifty bodies to the load and emptied it into the tana  from this it was evident that very few of the masai could have escaped  the crocodiles must have been well fed that night  one of the last bodies we picked up was that of the sentry at the upper end  i asked good how he managed to kill him and he told me that he had crept up much as umslopogaas had done and stabbed him with his sword  he groaned a good deal but fortunately nobody heard him  as good said it was a horrible thing to have to do and most unpleasantly like coldblooded murder  and so with the last body that floated away down the current of the tana ended the incident of our attack on the masai camp the spears and shields and other arms we took up to the mission where they filled an outhouse  one incident however i must not forget to mention  as we were returning from performing the obsequies of our masai friends we passed the hollow tree where alphonse had secreted himself in the morning  it so happened that the little man himself was with us assisting in our unpleasant task with a far better will than he had shown where live masai were concerned  indeed for each body that he handled he found an appropriate sarcasm  alphonse throwing masai into the tana was a very different creature from alphonse flying for dear life from the spear of a live masai  he was quite merry and gay he clapped his hands and warbled snatches of french songs as the grim dead warriors went splash into the running waters to carry a message of death and defiance to their kindred a hundred miles below  in short thinking that he wanted taking down a peg i suggested holding a courtmartial on him for his conduct in the morning  accordingly we brought him to the tree where he had hidden and proceeded to sit in judgment on him sir henry explaining to him in the very best french the unheardof cowardice and enormity of his conduct more especially in letting the oiled rag out of his mouth whereby he nearly aroused the masai camp with teethchattering and brought about the failure of our plans ending up with a request for an explanation  but if we expected to find alphonse at a loss and put him to open shame we were destined to be disappointed  he bowed and scraped and smiled and acknowledged that his conduct might at first blush appear strange but really it was not inasmuch as his teeth were not chattering from fear  oh dear no oh certainly not he marvelled how the messieurs could think of such a thing  but from the chill air of the morning  as for the rag if monsieur could have but tasted its evil flavour being compounded indeed of a mixture of stale paraffin oil grease and gunpowder monsieur himself would have spat it out  but he did nothing of the sort he determined to keep it there till alas his stomach revolted and the rag was ejected in an access of involuntary sickness  and what have you to say about getting into the hollow tree asked sir henry keeping his countenance with difficulty  but monsieur the explanation is easy oh most easy it was thus i stood there by the kraal wall and the little grey monsieur hit me in the stomach so that my rifle exploded and the battle began  i watched whilst recovering myself from monsieurs cruel blow then messieurs i felt the heroic blood of my grandfather boil up in my veins  the sight made me mad  i ground my teeth fire flashed from my eyes  i shouted en avant and longed to slay  before my eyes there rose a vision of my heroic grandfather in short i was mad  i was a warrior indeed  but then in my heart i heard a small voice alphonse said the voice restrain thyself alphonse  give not way to this evil passion  these men though black are brothers  and thou wouldst slay them cruel alphonse  the voice was right  i knew it i was about to perpetrate the most horrible cruelties to wound to massacre to tear limb from limb  and how restrain myself  i looked round i saw the tree i perceived the hole  entomb thyself said the voice and hold on tight  thou wilt thus overcome temptation by main force  it was bitter just when the blood of my heroic grandfather boiled most fiercely but i obeyed  i dragged my unwilling feet along i entombed myself  through the hole i watched the battle  i shouted curses and defiance on the foe i noted them fall with satisfaction  why not  i had not robbed them of their lives  their gore was not upon my head  the blood of my heroic   oh get along with you you little cur broke out sir henry with a shout of laughter and giving alphonse a good kick which sent him flying off with a rueful face  in the evening i had an interview with mr mackenzie who was suffering a good deal from his wounds which good who was a skilful though unqualified doctor was treating him for  he told me that this occurrence had taught him a lesson and that if he recovered safely he meant to hand over the mission to a younger man who was already on his road to join him in his work and return to england  you see quatermain he said i made up my mind to it this very morning when we were creeping down those benighted savages if we live through this and rescue flossie alive i said to myself i will go home to england i have had enough of savages well i did not think that we should live through it at the time but thanks be to god and you four we have lived through it and i mean to stick to my resolution lest a worse thing befall us  another such time would kill my poor wife  and besides quatermain between you and me i am well off it is thirty thousand pounds i am worth today and every farthing of it made by honest trade and savings in the bank at zanzibar for living here costs me next to nothing  so though it will be hard to leave this place which i have made to blossom like a rose in the wilderness and harder still to leave the people i have taught i shall go  i congratulate you on your decision answered i for two reasons the first is that you owe a duty to your wife and daughter and more especially to the latter who should receive some education and mix with girls of her own race otherwise she will grow up wild shunning her kind  the other is that as sure as i am standing here sooner or later the masai will try to avenge the slaughter inflicted on them today  two or three men are sure to have escaped the confusion who will carry the story back to their people and the result will be that a great expedition will one day be sent against you  it might be delayed for a year but sooner or later it will come  therefore if only for that reason i should go  when once they have learnt that you are no longer here they may perhaps leave the place alone endnote 8  you are quite right answered the clergyman  i will turn my back upon this place in a month  but it will be a wrench it will be a wrench     chapter ix into the unknown    a week had passed and we all sat at supper one night in the mission diningroom feeling very much depressed in spirits for the reason that we were going to say goodbye to our kind friends the mackenzies and depart upon our way at dawn on the morrow  nothing more had been seen or heard of the masai and save for a spear or two which had been overlooked and was rusting in the grass and a few empty cartridges where we had stood outside the wall it would have been difficult to tell that the old cattle kraal at the foot of the slope had been the scene of so desperate a struggle  mackenzie was thanks chiefly to his being so temperate a man rapidly recovering from his wound and could get about on a pair of crutches and as for the other wounded men one had died of gangrene and the rest were in a fair way to recovery mr mackenzies caravan of men had also returned from the coast so that the station was now amply garrisoned  under these circumstances we concluded warm and pressing as were the invitations for us to stay that it was time to move on first to mount kenia and thence into the unknown in search of the mysterious white race which we had set our hearts on discovering this time we were going to progress by means of the humble but useful donkey of which we had collected no less than a dozen to carry our goods and chattels and if necessary ourselves we had now but two wakwafis left for servants and found it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into the unknown parts we proposed to explore  and small blame to them  after all as mr mackenzie said it was odd that three men each of whom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth living  health sufficient means and position etc  should from their own pleasure start out upon a wildgoose chase from which the chances were they never would return but then that is what englishmen are adventurers to the backbone and all our magnificent musterroll of colonies each of which will in time become a great nation testify to the extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight looks like a mild form of lunacy  adventurer  he that goes out to meet whatever may come  well that is what we all do in the world one way or another and speaking for myself i am proud of the title because it implies a brave heart and a trust in providence besides when many and many a noted croesus at whose feet the people worship and many and many a timeserving and wordcoining politician are forgotten the names of those grandhearted old adventurers who have made england what she is will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be  not that we three can expect to be numbered with such as these yet have we done something  enough perhaps to throw a garment over the nakedness of our folly  that evening whilst we were sitting on the veranda smoking a pipe before turning in who should come up to us but alphonse and with a magnificent bow announce his wish for an interview being requested to fire away he explained at some length that he was anxious to attach himself to our party  a statement that astonished me not a little knowing what a coward the little man was  the reason however soon appeared  mr mackenzie was going down to the coast and thence on to england  now if he went down country alphonse was persuaded that he would be seized extradited sent to france and to penal servitude  this was the idea that haunted him as king charless head haunted mr dick and he brooded over it till his imagination exaggerated the danger ten times  as a matter of fact the probability is that his offence against the laws of his country had long ago been forgotten and that he would have been allowed to pass unmolested anywhere except in france but he could not be got to see this constitutional coward as the little man was he infinitely preferred to face the certain hardships and great risks and dangers of such an expedition as ours than to expose himself notwithstanding his intense longing for his native land to the possible scrutiny of a police officer  which is after all only another exemplification of the truth that to the majority of men a faroff foreseen danger however shadowy is much more terrible than the most serious present emergency  after listening to what he had to say we consulted among ourselves and finally agreed with mr mackenzies knowledge and consent to accept his offer  to begin with we were very shorthanded and alphonse was a quick active fellow who could turn his hand to anything and cook  ah he could cook  i believe that he would have made a palatable dish of those gaiters of his heroic grandfather which he was so fond of talking about  then he was a goodtempered little man and merry as a monkey whilst his pompous vainglorious talk was a source of infinite amusement to us and what is more he never bore malice  of course his being so pronounced a coward was a great drawback to him but now that we knew his weakness we could more or less guard against it  so after warning him of the undoubted risks he was exposing himself to we told him that we would accept his offer on condition that he would promise implicit obedience to our orders  we also promised to give him wages at the rate of ten pounds a month should he ever return to a civilized country to receive them  to all of this he agreed with alacrity and retired to write a letter to his annette which mr mackenzie promised to post when he got down country he read it to us afterwards sir henry translating and a wonderful composition it was  i am sure the depth of his devotion and the narration of his sufferings in a barbarous country far far from thee annette for whose adored sake i endure such sorrow ought to have touched the feelings of the stoniesthearted chambermaid  well the morrow came and by seven oclock the donkeys were all loaded and the time of parting was at hand  it was a melancholy business especially saying goodbye to dear little flossie she and i were great friends and often used to have talks together  but her nerves had never got over the shock of that awful night when she lay in the power of those bloodthirsty masai oh mr quatermain she cried throwing her arms round my neck and bursting into tears i cant bear to say goodbye to you i wonder when we shall meet again  i dont know my dear little girl i said i am at one end of life and you are at the other  i have but a short time before me at best and most things lie in the past but i hope that for you there are many long and happy years and everything lies in the future  byandby you will grow into a beautiful woman flossie and all this wild life will be like a faroff dream to you but i hope even if we never do meet again that you will think of your old friend and remember what i say to you now  always try to be good my dear and to do what is right rather than what happens to be pleasant for in the end whatever sneering people may say what is good and what is happy are the same  be unselfish and whenever you can give a helping hand to others  for the world is full of suffering my dear and to alleviate it is the noblest end that we can set before us if you do that you will become a sweet and godfearing woman and make many peoples lives a little brighter and then you will not have lived as so many of your sex do in vain  and now i have given you a lot of oldfashioned advice and so i am going to give you something to sweeten it with  you see this little piece of paper  it is what is called a cheque  when we are gone give it to your father with this note  not before mind  you will marry one day my dear little flossie and it is to buy you a wedding present which you are to wear and your daughter after you if you have one in remembrance of hunter quatermain  poor little flossie cried very much and gave me a lock of her bright hair in return which i still have  the cheque i gave her was for a thousand pounds which being now well off and having no calls upon me except those of charity i could well afford and in the note i directed her father to invest it for her in government security and when she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace he could get for the money and accumulated interest  i chose diamonds because i think that now that king solomons mines are lost to the world their price will never be much lower than it is at present so that if in afterlife she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties she will be able to turn them into money  well at last we got off after much handshaking hatwaving and also farewell saluting from the natives alphonse weeping copiously for he has a warm heart at parting with his master and mistress and i was not sorry for it at all for i hate those goodbyes  perhaps the most affecting thing of all was to witness umslopogaas distress at parting with flossie for whom the grim old warrior had conceived a strong affection  he used to say that she was as sweet to see as the only star on a dark night and was never tired of loudly congratulating himself on having killed the lygonani who had threatened to murder her  and that was the last we saw of the pleasant missionhouse  a true oasis in the desert  and of european civilization  but i often think of the mackenzies and wonder how they got down country and if they are now safe and well in england and will ever see these words  dear little flossie  i wonder how she fares there where there are no black folk to do her imperious bidding and no skypiercing snowclad kenia for her to look at when she gets up in the morning and so goodbye to flossie  after leaving the missionhouse we made our way comparatively unmolested past the base of mount kenia which the masai call donyo egere or the speckled mountain on account of the black patches of rock that appear upon its mighty spire where the sides are too precipitous to allow of the snow lying on them then on past the lonely lake baringo where one of our two remaining askari having unfortunately trodden on a puffadder died of snakebite in spite of all our efforts to save him  thence we proceeded a distance of about a hundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snowclad mountain called lekakisera which has never to the best of my belief been visited before by a european but which i cannot now stop to describe  there we rested a fortnight and then started out into the trackless and uninhabited forest of a vast district called elgumi  in this forest alone there are more elephants than i ever met with or heard of before  the mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man and only kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing beyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them  needless to say however we did not shoot many of them first because we could not afford to waste ammunition of which our stock was getting perilously low a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in fording a flooded river and secondly because we could not carry away the ivory and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter  so we let the great beasts be only shooting one or two in selfprotection  in this district the elephants being unacquainted with the hunter and his tender mercies would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of them in the open while they stood with their great ears cocked for all the world like puzzled and gigantic puppydogs and stared at that new and extraordinary phenomenon  man  occasionally when the inspection did not prove satisfactory the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge but this did not often happen  when it did we had to use our rifles  nor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great elgumi forest  all sorts of large game abounded including lions  confound them  i have always hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for life  as a consequence another thing that abounded was the dreadful tsetse fly whose bite is death to domestic animals  donkeys have together with men hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity from its attacks but all i have to say whether it was on account of their poor condition or because the tsetse in those parts is more poisonous than usual i do not know but ours succumbed to its onslaught  fortunately however that was not till two months or so after the bites had been inflicted when suddenly after a two days cold rain they all died and on removing the skins of several of them i found the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of death from bites from the tsetse marking the spot where the insect had inserted his proboscis on emerging from the great elgumi forest we still steering northwards in accordance with the information mr mackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him only to die so tragically struck the base in due course of the large lake called laga by the natives which is about fifty miles long by twenty broad and of which it may be remembered he made mention  thence we pushed on nearly a months journey over great rolling uplands something like those in the transvaal but diversified by patches of bush country  all this time we were continually ascending at the rate of about one hundred feet every ten miles  indeed the country was on a slope which appeared to terminate at a mass of snowtipped mountains for which we were steering and where we learnt the second lake of which the wanderer had spoken as the lake without a bottom was situated  at length we arrived there and having ascertained that there was a large lake on top of the mountains ascended three thousand feet more till we came to a precipitous cliff or edge to find a great sheet of water some twenty miles square lying fifteen hundred feet below us and evidently occupying an extinct volcanic crater or craters of vast extent  perceiving villages on the border of this lake we descended with great difficulty through forests of pine trees which now clothed the precipitous sides of the crater and were well received by the people a simple unwarlike folk who had never seen or even heard of a white man before and treated us with great reverence and kindness supplying us with as much food and milk as we could eat and drink  this wonderful and beautiful lake lay according to our aneroid at a height of no less than 11450 feet above sealevel and its climate was quite cold and not at all unlike that of england  indeed for the first three days of our stay there we saw little or nothing of the scenery on account of an unmistakable scotch mist which prevailed  it was this rain that set the tsetse poison working in our remaining donkeys so that they all died  this disaster left us in a very awkward position as we had now no means of transport whatever though on the other hand we had not much to carry  ammunition too was very short amounting to but one hundred and fifty rounds of rifle cartridges and some fifty shotgun cartridges  how to get on we did not know indeed it seemed to us that we had about reached the end of our tether even if we had been inclined to abandon the object of our search which shadow as it was was by no means the case it was ridiculous to think of forcing our way back some seven hundred miles to the coast in our present plight so we came to the conclusion that the only thing to be done was to stop where we were  the natives being so well disposed and food plentiful  for the present and abide events and try to collect information as to the countries beyond  accordingly having purchased a capital log canoe large enough to hold us all and our baggage from the headman of the village we were staying in presenting him with three empty colddrawn brass cartridges by way of payment with which he was perfectly delighted we set out to make a tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a camp  as we did not know if we should return to this village we put all our gear into the canoe and also a quarter of cooked waterbuck which when young is delicious eating and off we set natives having already gone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other villages of our approach  as we were puddling leisurely along good remarked upon the extraordinary deep blue colour of the water and said that he understood from the natives who were great fishermen  fish indeed being their principal food  that the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep and to have a hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some great fire that was raging below  i pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend arising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time when one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity  we saw several round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working at a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater which now formed the bed of the lake itself  when it finally became extinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run down and put out the big fire below more especially as though it was constantly fed by streams running from the snowtipped peaks about there was no visible exit to it  the farther shore of the lake we found on approaching it to consist of a vast perpendicular wall of rock which held the water without any intermediate sloping bank as elsewhere  accordingly we paddled parallel with this precipice at a distance of about a hundred paces from it shaping our course for the end of the lake where we knew that there was a large village  as we went we began to pass a considerable accumulation of floating rushes weed boughs of trees and other rubbish brought good supposed to this spot by some current which he was much puzzled to account for  whilst we were speculating about this sir henry pointed out a flock of large white swans which were feeding on the drift some little way ahead of us  now i had already noticed swans flying about this lake and having never come across them before in africa was exceedingly anxious to obtain a specimen  i had questioned the natives about them and learnt that they came from over the mountain always arriving at certain periods of the year in the early morning when it was very easy to catch them on account of their exhausted condition  i also asked them what country they came from when they shrugged their shoulders and said that on the top of the great black precipice was stony inhospitable land and beyond that were mountains with snow and full of wild beasts where no people lived and beyond the mountains were hundreds of miles of dense thorn forest so thick that even the elephants could not get through it much less men  next i asked them if they had ever heard of white people like ourselves living on the farther side of the mountains and the thorn forest whereat they laughed  but afterwards a very old woman came and told me that when she was a little girl her grandfather had told her that in his youth his grandfather had crossed the desert and the mountains and pierced the thorn forest and seen a white people who lived in stone kraals beyond of course as this took the tale back some two hundred and fifty years the information was very indefinite but still there it was again and on thinking it over i grew firmly convinced that there was some truth in all these rumours and equally firmly determined to solve the mystery  little did i guess in what an almost miraculous way my desire was to be gratified  well we set to work to stalk the swans which kept drawing as they fed nearer and nearer to the precipice and at last we pushed the canoe under shelter of a patch of drift within forty yards of them  sir henry had the shotgun loaded with no 1 and waiting for a chance got two in a line and firing at their necks killed them both  up rose the rest thirty or more of them with a mighty splashing and as they did so he gave them the other barrel  down came one fellow with a broken wing and i saw the leg of another drop and a few feathers start out of his back but he went on quite strong  up went the swans circling ever higher till at last they were mere specks level with the top of the frowning precipice when i saw them form into a triangle and head off for the unknown northeast  meanwhile we had picked up our two dead ones and beautiful birds they were weighing not less than about thirty pounds each and were chasing the winged one which had scrambled over a mass of driftweed into a pool of clear water beyond  finding a difficulty in forcing the canoe through the rubbish i told our only remaining wakwafi servant whom i knew to be an excellent swimmer to jump over dive under the drift and catch him knowing that as there were no crocodiles in this lake he could come to no harm  entering into the fun of the thing the man obeyed and soon was dodging about after the winged swan in fine style getting gradually nearer to the rock wall against which the water washed as he did so  presently he gave up swimming after the swan and began to cry out that he was being carried away and indeed we saw that though he was swimming with all his strength towards us he was being drawn slowly to the precipice  with a few desperate strokes of our paddles we pushed the canoe through the crust of drift and rowed towards the man as hard as we could but fast as we went he was drawn faster to the rock  suddenly i saw that before us just rising eighteen inches or so above the surface of the lake was what looked like the top of the arch of a submerged cave or railway tunnel  evidently from the watermark on the rock several feet above it it was generally entirely submerged but there had been a dry season and the cold had prevented the snow from melting as freely as usual so the lake was low and the arch showed  towards this arch our poor servant was being sucked with frightful rapidity  he was not more than ten fathoms from it and we were about twenty when i saw it and with little help from us the canoe flew along after him  he struggled bravely and i thought that we should have saved him when suddenly i perceived an expression of despair come upon his face and there before our eyes he was sucked down into the cruel swirling blue depths and vanished  at the same moment i felt our canoe seized as with a mighty hand and propelled with resistless force towards the rock  we realized our danger now and rowed or rather paddled furiously in our attempt to get out of the vortex  in vain in another second we were flying straight for the arch like an arrow and i thought that we were lost  luckily i retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out instantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the canoe down on your faces  down and the others had the sense to take the hint  in another instant there was a grinding noise and the boat was pushed down till the water began to trickle over the sides and i thought that we were gone  but no suddenly the grinding ceased and we could again feel the canoe flying along  i turned my head a little  i dared not lift it  and looked up  by the feeble light that yet reached the canoe i could make out that a dense arch of rock hung just over our heads and that was all  in another minute i could not even see as much as that for the faint light had merged into shadow and the shadows had been swallowed up in darkness utter and complete  for an hour or so we lay there not daring to lift our heads for fear lest the brains should be dashed out of them and scarcely able to speak even on account of the noise of the rushing water which drowned our voices  not indeed that we had much inclination to speak seeing that we were overwhelmed by the awfulness of our position and the imminent fear of instant death either by being dashed against the sides of the cavern or on a rock or being sucked down in the raging waters or perhaps asphyxiated by want of air  all of these and many other modes of death presented themselves to my imagination as i lay at the bottom of the canoe listening to the swirl of the hurrying waters which ran whither we knew not  one only other sound could i hear and that was alphonses intermittent howl of terror coming from the centre of the canoe and even that seemed faint and unnatural  indeed the whole thing overpowered my brain and i began to believe that i was the victim of some ghastly spiritshaking nightmare     chapter x the rose of fire    on we flew drawn by the mighty current till at last i noticed that the sound of the water was not half so deafening as it had been and concluded that this must be because there was more room for the echoes to disperse in  i could now hear alphonses howls much more distinctly they were made up of the oddest mixture of invocations to the supreme power and the name of his beloved annette that it is possible to conceive and in short though their evident earnestness saved them from profanity were to say the least very remarkable  taking up a paddle i managed to drive it into his ribs whereon he thinking that the end had come howled louder than ever  then i slowly and cautiously raised myself on my knees and stretched my hand upwards but could touch no roof  next i took the paddle and lifted it above my head as high as i could but with the same result  i also thrust it out laterally to the right and left but could touch nothing except water  then i bethought me that there was in the boat amongst our other remaining possessions a bullseye lantern and a tin of oil  i groped about and found it and having a match on me carefully lit it and as soon as the flame had got a hold of the wick i turned it on down the boat  as it happened the first thing the light lit on was the white and scared face of alphonse who thinking that it was all over at last and that he was witnessing a preliminary celestial phenomenon gave a terrific yell and was with difficulty reassured with the paddle as for the other three good was lying on the flat of his back his eyeglass still fixed in his eye and gazing blankly into the upper darkness  sir henry had his head resting on the thwarts of the canoe and with his hand was trying to test the speed of the water  but when the beam of light fell upon old umslopogaas i could really have laughed  i think i have said that we had put a roast quarter of waterbuck into the canoe  well it so happened that when we all prostrated ourselves to avoid being swept out of the boat and into the water by the rock roof umslopogaass head had come down uncommonly near this roast buck and so soon as he had recovered a little from the first shock of our position it occurred to him that he was hungry  thereupon he coolly cut off a chop with inkosikaas and was now employed in eating it with every appearance of satisfaction  as he afterwards explained he thought that he was going on a long journey and preferred to start on a full stomach  it reminded me of the people who are going to be hanged and who are generally reported in the english daily papers to have made an excellent breakfast  as soon as the others saw that i had managed to light the lamp we bundled alphonse into the farther end of the canoe with a threat which calmed him down wonderfully that if he would insist upon making the darkness hideous with his cries we would put him out of suspense by sending him to join the wakwafi and wait for annette in another sphere and began to discuss the situation as well as we could  first however at goods suggestion we bound two paddles mastfashion in the bows so that they might give us warning against any sudden lowering of the roof of the cave or waterway  it was clear to us that we were in an underground river or as alphonse defined it main drain which carried off the superfluous waters of the lake  such rivers are well known to exist in many parts of the world but it has not often been the evil fortune of explorers to travel by them  that the river was wide we could clearly see for the light from the bullseye lantern failed to reach from shore to shore although occasionally when the current swept us either to one side or the other we could distinguish the rock wall of the tunnel which as far as we could make out appeared to arch about twentyfive feet above our heads  as for the current itself it ran good estimated at least eight knots and fortunately for us was as is usual fiercest in the middle of the stream  still our first act was to arrange that one of us with the lantern and a pole there was in the canoe should always be in the bows ready if possible to prevent us from being stove in against the side of the cave or any projecting rock  umslopogaas having already dined took the first turn  this was absolutely with one exception all that we could do towards preserving our safety  the exception was that another of us took up a position in the stern with a paddle by means of which it was possible to steer the canoe more or less and to keep her from the sides of the cave  these matters attended to we made a somewhat sparing meal off the cold bucks meat for we did not know how long it might have to last us and then feeling in rather better spirits i gave my opinion that serious as it undoubtedly was i did not consider our position altogether without hope unless indeed the natives were right and the river plunged straight down into the bowels of the earth if not it was clear that it must emerge somewhere probably on the other side of the mountains and in that case all we had to think of was to keep ourselves alive till we got there wherever there might be  but of course as good lugubriously pointed out on the other hand we might fall victims to a hundred unsuspected horrors  or the river might go on winding away inside the earth till it dried up in which case our fate would indeed be an awful one  well let us hope for the best and prepare ourselves for the worst said sir henry who is always cheerful and even spirited  a very tower of strength in the time of trouble  we have come out of so many queer scrapes together that somehow i almost fancy we shall come out of this he added  this was excellent advice and we proceeded to take it each in our separate way  that is except alphonse who had by now sunk into a sort of terrified stupor  good was at the helm and umslopogaas in the bows so there was nothing left for sir henry and myself to do except to lie down in the canoe and think it certainly was a curious and indeed almost a weird position to be placed in  rushing along as we were through the bowels of the earth borne on the bosom of a stygian river something after the fashion of souls being ferried by charon as curtis said  and how dark it was  the feeble ray from our little lamp did but serve to show the darkness  there in the bows sat old umslopogaas like pleasure in the poem endnote 9 watchful and untiring the pole ready to his hand and behind in the shadow i could just make out the form of good peering forward at the ray of light in order to make out how to steer with the paddle that he held and now and again dipped into the water  well well thought i you have come in search of adventures allan my boy and you have certainly got them  at your time of life too  you ought to be ashamed of yourself but somehow you are not and awful as it all is perhaps you will pull through after all and if you dont why you cannot help it you see and when alls said and done an underground river will make a very appropriate buryingplace  at first however i am bound to say that the strain upon the nerves was very great  it is trying to the coolest and most experienced person not to know from one hour to another if he has five minutes more to live but there is nothing in this world that one cannot get accustomed to and in time we began to get accustomed even to that  and after all our anxiety though no doubt natural was strictly speaking illogical seeing that we never know what is going to happen to us the next minute even when we sit in a welldrained house with two policemen patrolling under the window  nor how long we have to live  it is all arranged for us my sons so what is the use of bothering  it was nearly midday when we made our dive into darkness and we had set our watch good and umslopogaas at two having agreed that it should be of a duration of five hours  at seven oclock accordingly sir henry and i went on sir henry at the bow and i at the stern and the other two lay down and went to sleep for three hours all went well sir henry only finding it necessary once to push us off from the side and i that but little steering was required to keep us straight as the violent current did all that was needed though occasionally the canoe showed a tendency which had to be guarded against to veer and travel broadside on  what struck me as the most curious thing about this wonderful river was how did the air keep fresh  it was muggy and thick no doubt but still not sufficiently so to render it bad or even remarkably unpleasant  the only explanation that i can suggest is that the water of the lake had sufficient air in it to keep the atmosphere of the tunnel from absolute stagnation this air being given out as it proceeded on its headlong way  of course i only give the solution of the mystery for what it is worth which perhaps is not much  when i had been for three hours or so at the helm i began to notice a decided change in the temperature which was getting warmer  at first i took no notice of it but when at the expiration of another halfhour i found that it was getting hotter and hotter i called to sir henry and asked him if he noticed it or if it was only my imagination  noticed it he answered i should think so  i am in a sort of turkish bath  just about then the others woke up gasping and were obliged to begin to discard their clothes  here umslopogaas had the advantage for he did not wear any to speak of except a moocha  hotter it grew and hotter yet till at last we could scarcely breathe and the perspiration poured out of us  half an hour more and though we were all now stark naked we could hardly bear it  the place was like an antechamber of the infernal regions proper  i dipped my hand into the water and drew it out almost with a cry it was nearly boiling  we consulted a little thermometer we had  the mercury stood at 123 degrees  from the surface of the water rose a dense cloud of steam  alphonse groaned out that we were already in purgatory which indeed we were though not in the sense that he meant it  sir henry suggested that we must be passing near the seat of some underground volcanic fire and i am inclined to think especially in the light of what subsequently occurred that he was right  our sufferings for some time after this really pass my powers of description we no longer perspired for all the perspiration had been sweated out of us  we simply lay in the bottom of the boat which we were now physically incapable of directing feeling like hot embers and i fancy undergoing very much the same sensations that the poor fish do when they are dying on land  namely that of slow suffocation  our skins began to crack and the blood to throb in our heads like the beating of a steamengine  this had been going on for some time when suddenly the river turned a little and i heard sir henry call out from the bows in a hoarse startled voice and looking up saw a most wonderful and awful thing  about half a mile ahead of us and a little to the left of the centre of the stream  which we could now see was about ninety feet broad  a huge pillarlike jet of almost white flame rose from the surface of the water and sprang fifty feet into the air when it struck the roof and spread out some forty feet in diameter falling back in curved sheets of fire shaped like the petals of a fullblown rose  indeed this awful gas jet resembled nothing so much as a great flaming flower rising out of the black water  below was the straight stalk a foot or more thick and above the dreadful bloom  and as for the fearfulness of it and its fierce and awesome beauty who can describe it  certainly i cannot  although we were now some five hundred yards away it notwithstanding the steam lit up the whole cavern as clear as day and we could see that the roof was here about forty feet above us and washed perfectly smooth with water  the rock was black and here and there i could make out long shining lines of ore running through it like great veins but of what metal they were i know not  on we rushed towards this pillar of fire which gleamed fiercer than any furnace ever lit by man  keep the boat to the right quatermain  to the right shouted sir henry and a minute afterwards i saw him fall forward senseless alphonse had already gone  good was the next to go  there they lay as though dead only umslopogaas and i kept our senses we were within fifty yards of it now and i saw the zulus head fall forward on his hands  he had gone too and i was alone i could not breathe the fierce heat dried me up  for yards and yards round the great rose of fire the rockroof was redhot the wood of the boat was almost burning  i saw the feathers on one of the dead swans begin to twist and shrivel up but i would not give in  i knew that if i did we should pass within three or four yards of the gas jet and perish miserably  i set the paddle so as to turn the canoe as far from it as possible and held on grimly  my eyes seemed to be bursting from my head and through my closed lids i could see the fierce light  we were nearly opposite now it roared like all the fires of hell and the water boiled furiously around it  five seconds more  we were past i heard the roar behind me  then i too fell senseless  the next thing that i recollect is feeling a breath of air upon my face  my eyes opened with great difficulty  i looked up  far far above me there was light though around me was great gloom  then i remembered and looked the canoe still floated down the river and in the bottom of it lay the naked forms of my companions  were they dead i wondered  was i left alone in this awful place  i knew not next i became conscious of a burning thirst  i put my hand over the edge of the boat into the water and drew it up again with a cry  no wonder nearly all the skin was burnt off the back of it  the water however was cold or nearly so and i drank pints and splashed myself all over  my body seemed to suck up the fluid as one may see a brick wall suck up rain after a drought but where i was burnt the touch of it caused intense pain  then i bethought myself of the others and dragging myself towards them with difficulty i sprinkled them with water and to my joy they began to recover  umslopogaas first then the others  next they drank absorbing water like so many sponges then feeling chilly  a queer contrast to our recent sensations  we began as best we could to get into our clothes  as we did so good pointed to the port side of the canoe it was all blistered with heat and in places actually charred  had it been built like our civilized boats good said that the planks would certainly have warped and let in enough water to sink us but fortunately it was dug out of the soft willowy wood of a single great tree and had sides nearly three inches and a bottom four inches thick  what that awful flame was we never discovered but i suppose that there was at this spot a crack or hole in the bed of the river through which a vast volume of gas forced its way from its volcanic home in the bowels of the earth towards the upper air  how it first became ignited is of course impossible to say  probably i should think from some spontaneous explosion of mephitic gases  as soon as we had got some things together and shaken ourselves together a little we set to work to make out where we were now i have said that there was light above and on examination we found that it came from the sky  our river that was sir henry said a literal realization of the wild vision of the poet endnote 10 was no longer underground but was running on its darksome way not now through caverns measureless to man but between two frightful cliffs which cannot have been less than two thousand feet high  so high were they indeed that though the sky was above us where we were was dense gloom  not darkness indeed but the gloom of a room closely shuttered in the daytime up on either side rose the great straight cliffs grim and forbidding till the eye grew dizzy with trying to measure their sheer height the little space of sky that marked where they ended lay like a thread of blue upon their soaring blackness which was unrelieved by any tree or creeper  here and there however grew ghostly patches of a long grey lichen hanging motionless to the rock as the white beard to the chin of a dead man  it seemed as though only the dregs or heavier part of the light had sunk to the bottom of this awful place  no brightwinged sunbeam could fall so low they died far far above our heads  by the rivers edge was a little shore formed of round fragments of rock washed into this shape by the constant action of water and giving the place the appearance of being strewn with thousands of fossil cannon balls  evidently when the water of the underground river is high there is no beach at all or very little between the border of the stream and the precipitous cliffs but now there was a space of seven or eight yards  and here on this beach we determined to land in order to rest ourselves a little after all that we had gone through and to stretch our limbs it was a dreadful place but it would give an hours respite from the terrors of the river and also allow of our repacking and arranging the canoe  accordingly we selected what looked like a favourable spot and with some little difficulty managed to beach the canoe and scramble out on to the round inhospitable pebbles  my word called out good who was on shore the first what an awful place  its enough to give one a fit  and he laughed  instantly a thundering voice took up his words magnifying them a hundred times  give one a fit  ho ho ho  a fit ho ho ho answered another voice in wild accents from far up the cliff  a fit a fit a fit chimed in voice after voice  each flinging the words to and fro with shouts of awful laughter to the invisible lips of the other till the whole place echoed with the words and with shrieks of fiendish merriment which at last ceased as suddenly as they had begun  oh mon dieu yelled alphonse startled quite out of such selfcommand as he possessed  mon dieu  mon dieu  mon dieu the titanic echoes thundered shrieked and wailed in every conceivable tone  ah said umslopogaas calmly i clearly perceive that devils live here  well the place looks like it  i tried to explain to him that the cause of all the hubbub was a very remarkable and interesting echo but he would not believe it  ah he said i know an echo when i hear one  there was one lived opposite my kraal in zululand and the intombis maidens used to talk with it  but if what we hear is a fullgrown echo mine at home can only have been a baby  no no  they are devils up there  but i dont think much of them though he added taking a pinch of snuff  they can copy what one says but they dont seem to be able to talk on their own account and they dare not show their faces and he relapsed into silence and apparently paid no further attention to such contemptible fiends  after this we found it necessary to keep our conversation down to a whisper  for it was really unbearable to have every word one uttered tossed to and fro like a tennisball as precipice called to precipice  but even our whispers ran up the rocks in mysterious murmurs till at last they died away in longdrawn sighs of sound  echoes are delightful and romantic things but we had more than enough of them in that dreadful gulf  as soon as we had settled ourselves a little on the round stones we went on to wash and dress our burns as well as we could as we had but a little oil for the lantern we could not spare any for this purpose so we skinned one of the swans and used the fat off its breast which proved an excellent substitute then we repacked the canoe and finally began to take some food of which i need scarcely say we were in need for our insensibility had endured for many hours and it was as our watches showed midday  accordingly we seated ourselves in a circle and were soon engaged in discussing our cold meat with such appetite as we could muster which in my case at any rate was not much as i felt sick and faint after my sufferings of the previous night and had besides a racking headache  it was a curious meal  the gloom was so intense that we could scarcely see the way to cut our food and convey it to our mouths  still we got on pretty well till i happened to look behind me  my attention being attracted by a noise of something crawling over the stones and perceived sitting upon a rock in my immediate rear a huge species of black freshwater crab only it was five times the size of any crab i ever saw  this hideous and loathsomelooking animal had projecting eyes that seemed to glare at one very long and flexible antennae or feelers and gigantic claws nor was i especially favoured with its company  from every quarter dozens of these horrid brutes were creeping up drawn i suppose by the smell of the food from between the round stones and out of holes in the precipice  some were already quite close to us  i stared quite fascinated by the unusual sight and as i did so i saw one of the beasts stretch out its huge claw and give the unsuspecting good such a nip behind that he jumped up with a howl and set the wild echoes flying in sober earnest just then too another a very large one got hold of alphonses leg and declined to part with it and as may be imagined a considerable scene ensued  umslopogaas took his axe and cracked the shell of one with the flat of it whereon it set up a horrid screaming which the echoes multiplied a thousandfold and began to foam at the mouth a proceeding that drew hundreds more of its friends out of unsuspected holes and corners  those on the spot perceiving that the animal was hurt fell upon it like creditors on a bankrupt and literally rent it limb from limb with their huge pincers and devoured it using their claws to convey the fragments to their mouths  seizing whatever weapons were handy such as stones or paddles we commenced a war upon the monsters  whose numbers were increasing by leaps and bounds and whose stench was overpowering  so fast as we cracked their armour others seized the injured ones and devoured them foaming at the mouth and screaming as they did so  nor did the brutes stop at that  when they could they nipped hold of us  and awful nips they were  or tried to steal the meat  one enormous fellow got hold of the swan we had skinned and began to drag it off  instantly a score of others flung themselves upon the prey and then began a ghastly and disgusting scene  how the monsters foamed and screamed and rent the flesh and each other it was a sickening and unnatural sight and one that will haunt all who saw it till their dying day  enacted as it was in the deep oppressive gloom and set to the unceasing music of the manytoned nerveshaking echoes  strange as it may seem to say so there was something so shockingly human about these fiendish creatures  it was as though all the most evil passions and desires of man had got into the shell of a magnified crab and gone mad  they were so dreadfully courageous and intelligent and they looked as if they understood  the whole scene might have furnished material for another canto of dantes inferno as curtis said   i say you fellows lets get out of this or we shall all go off our heads sung out good and we were not slow to take the hint  pushing the canoe around which the animals were now crawling by hundreds and making vain attempts to climb off the rocks we bundled into it and got out into midstream leaving behind us the fragments of our meal and the screaming foaming stinking mass of monsters in full possession of the ground  those are the devils of the place said umslopogaas with the air of one who has solved a problem and upon my word i felt almost inclined to agree with him  umslopogaas remarks were like his axe  very much to the point  whats to be done next said sir henry blankly  drift i suppose i answered and we drifted accordingly all the afternoon and well into the evening we floated on in the gloom beneath the faroff line of blue sky scarcely knowing when day ended and night began for down in that vast gulf the difference was not marked till at length good pointed out a star hanging right above us which having nothing better to do we observed with great interest  suddenly it vanished the darkness became intense and a familiar murmuring sound filled the air  underground again i said with a groan holding up the lamp  yes there was no doubt about it  i could just make out the roof  the chasm had come to an end and the tunnel had recommenced  and then there began another long long night of danger and horror  to describe all its incidents would be too wearisome so i will simply say that about midnight we struck on a flat projecting rock in midstream and were as nearly as possible overturned and drowned  however at last we got off and went upon the uneven tenor of our way  and so the hours passed till it was nearly three oclock  sir henry good and alphonse were asleep utterly worn out umslopogaas was at the bow with the pole and i was steering when i perceived that the rate at which we were travelling had perceptibly increased then suddenly i heard umslopogaas make an exclamation and next second came a sound as of parting branches and i became aware that the canoe was being forced through hanging bushes or creepers  another minute and the breath of sweet open air fanned my face and i felt that we had emerged from the tunnel and were floating upon clear water  i say felt for i could see nothing the darkness being absolutely pitchy as it often is just before the dawn  but even this could scarcely damp my joy  we were out of that dreadful river and wherever we might have got to this at least was something to be thankful for and so i sat down and inhaled the sweet night air and waited for the dawn with such patience as i could command     chapter xi the frowning city    for an hour or more i sat waiting umslopogaas having meanwhile gone to sleep also till at length the east turned grey and huge misty shapes moved over the surface of the water like ghosts of longforgotten dawns  they were the vapours rising from their watery bed to greet the sun  then the grey turned to primrose and the primrose grew to red  next glorious bars of light sprang up across the eastern sky and through them the radiant messengers of the dawn came speeding upon their arrowy way scattering the ghostly vapours and awaking the mountains with a kiss as they flew from range to range and longitude to longitude  another moment and the golden gates were open and the sun himself came forth as a bridegroom from his chamber with pomp and glory and a flashing as of ten million spears and embraced the night and covered her with brightness and it was day  but as yet i could see nothing save the beautiful blue sky above for over the water was a thick layer of mist exactly as though the whole surface had been covered with billows of cotton wool by degrees however the sun sucked up the mists and then i saw that we were afloat upon a glorious sheet of blue water of which i could not make out the shore  some eight or ten miles behind us however there stretched as far as the eye could reach a range of precipitous hills that formed a retaining wall of the lake and i have no doubt but that it was through some entrance in these hills that the subterranean river found its way into the open water  indeed i afterwards ascertained this to be the fact and it will be some indication of the extraordinary strength and directness of the current of the mysterious river that the canoe even at this distance was still answering to it  presently too i or rather umslopogaas who woke up just then discovered another indication and a very unpleasant one it was  perceiving some whitish object upon the water umslopogaas called my attention to it and with a few strokes of the paddle brought the canoe to the spot whereupon we discovered that the object was the body of a man floating face downwards  this was bad enough but imagine my horror when umslopogaas having turned him on to his back with the paddle we recognized in the sunken features the lineaments of  whom do you suppose  none other than our poor servant who had been sucked down two days before in the waters of the subterranean river  it quite frightened me  i thought that we had left him behind for ever and behold borne by the current he had made the awful journey with us and with us had reached the end  his appearance also was dreadful for he bore traces of having touched the pillar of fire  one arm being completely shrivelled up and all his hair being burnt off  the features were as i have said sunken and yet they preserved upon them that awful look of despair that i had seen upon his living face as the poor fellow was sucked down  really the sight unnerved me weary and shaken as i felt with all that we had gone through and i was heartily glad when suddenly and without any warning the body began to sink just as though it had had a mission which having been accomplished it retired the real reason no doubt being that turning it on its back allowed a free passage to the gas  down it went to the transparent depths  fathom after fathom we could trace its course till at last a long line of bright airbubbles swiftly chasing each other to the surface alone remained where it had passed  at length these too were gone and that was an end of our poor servant umslopogaas thoughtfully watched the body vanish  what did he follow us for he asked  tis an ill omen for thee and me macumazahn  and he laughed  i turned on him angrily for i dislike these unpleasant suggestions if people have such ideas they ought in common decency to keep them to themselves  i detest individuals who make on the subject of their disagreeable presentiments or who when they dream that they saw one hanged as a common felon or some such horror will insist upon telling one all about it at breakfast even if they have to get up early to do it  just then however the others woke up and began to rejoice exceedingly at finding that we were out of that dreadful river and once more beneath the blue sky  then followed a babel of talk and suggestions as to what we were to do next the upshot of all of which was that as we were excessively hungry and had nothing whatsoever left to eat except a few scraps of biltong dried gameflesh having abandoned all that remained of our provisions to those horrible freshwater crabs we determined to make for the shore but a new difficulty arose  we did not know where the shore was and with the exception of the cliffs through which the subterranean river made its entry could see nothing but a wide expanse of sparkling blue water  observing however that the long flights of aquatic birds kept flying from our left we concluded that they were advancing from their feedinggrounds on shore to pass the day in the lake and accordingly headed the boat towards the quarter whence they came and began to paddle  before long however a stiffish breeze sprang up blowing directly in the direction we wanted so we improvized a sail with a blanket and the pole which took us along merrily  this done we devoured the remnants of our biltong washed down with the sweet lake water and then lit our pipes and awaited whatever might turn up  when we had been sailing for an hour good who was searching the horizon with the spyglass suddenly announced joyfully that he saw land and pointed out that from the change in the colour of the water he thought we must be approaching the mouth of a river  in another minute we perceived a great golden dome not unlike that of st pauls piercing the morning mists and while we were wondering what in the world it could be good reported another and still more important discovery namely that a small sailingboat was advancing towards us  this bit of news which we were very shortly able to verify with our own eyes threw us into a considerable flutter  that the natives of this unknown lake should understand the art of sailing seemed to suggest that they possessed some degree of civilization  in a few more minutes it became evident that the occupant or occupants of the advancing boat had made us out  for a moment or two she hung in the wind as though in doubt and then came tacking towards us with great swiftness  in ten more minutes she was within a hundred yards and we saw that she was a neat little boat  not a canoe dug out but built more or less in the european fashion with planks and carrying a singularly large sail for her size  but our attention was soon diverted from the boat to her crew which consisted of a man and a woman nearly as white as ourselves  we stared at each other in amazement thinking that we must be mistaken but no there was no doubt about it  they were not fair but the two people in the boat were decidedly of a white as distinguished from a black race as white for instance as spaniards or italians  it was a patent fact  so it was true after all and mysteriously led by a power beyond our own we had discovered this wonderful people  i could have shouted for joy when i thought of the glory and the wonder of the thing and as it was we all shook hands and congratulated each other on the unexpected success of our wild search  all my life had i heard rumours of a white race that existed in the highlands of this vast continent and longed to put them to the proof and now here i saw it with my own eyes and was dumbfounded truly as sir henry said the old roman was right when he wrote ex africa semper aliquid novi which he tells me means that out of africa there always comes some new thing  the man in the boat was of a good but not particularly fine physique and possessed straight black hair regular aquiline features and an intelligent face  he was dressed in a brown cloth garment something like a flannel shirt without the sleeves and in an unmistakable kilt of the same material  the legs and feet were bare  round the right arm and left leg he wore thick rings of yellow metal that i judged to be gold  the woman had a sweet face wild and shy with large eyes and curling brown hair her dress was made of the same material as the mans and consisted as we afterwards discovered first of a linen undergarment that hung down to her knee and then of a single long strip of cloth about four feet wide by fifteen long which was wound round the body in graceful folds and finally flung over the left shoulder so that the end which was dyed blue or purple or some other colour according to the social standing of the wearer hung down in front the right arm and breast being however left quite bare  a more becoming dress especially when as in the present case the wearer was young and pretty it is quite impossible to conceive  good who has an eye for such things was greatly struck with it and so indeed was i  it was so simple and yet so effective  meanwhile if we had been astonished at the appearance of the man and woman it was clear that they were far more astonished at us  as for the man he appeared to be overcome with fear and wonder and for a while hovered round our canoe but would not approach  at last however he came within hailing distance and called to us in a language that sounded soft and pleasing enough but of which we could not understand one word  so we hailed back in english french latin greek german zulu dutch sisutu kukuana and a few other native dialects that i am acquainted with but our visitor did not understand any of these tongues indeed they appeared to bewilder him  as for the lady she was busily employed in taking stock of us and good was returning the compliment by staring at her hard through his eyeglass a proceeding that she seemed rather to enjoy than otherwise at length the man being unable to make anything of us suddenly turned his boat round and began to head off for the shore his little boat skimming away before the wind like a swallow as she passed across our bows the man turned to attend to the large sail and good promptly took the opportunity to kiss his hand to the young lady  i was horrified at this proceeding both on general grounds and because i feared that she might take offence but to my delight she did not for first glancing round and seeing that her husband or brother or whoever he was was engaged she promptly kissed hers back  ah said i  it seems that we have at last found a language that the people of this country understand  in which case said sir henry good will prove an invaluable interpreter  i frowned for i do not approve of goods frivolities and he knows it and i turned the conversation to more serious subjects it is very clear to me i said that the man will be back before long with a host of his fellows so we had best make up our minds as to how we are going to receive them  the question is how will they receive us said sir henry  as for good he made no remark but began to extract a small square tin case that had accompanied us in all our wanderings from under a pile of baggage  now we had often remonstrated with good about this tin case inasmuch as it had been an awkward thing to carry and he had never given any very explicit account as to its contents but he had insisted on keeping it saying mysteriously that it might come in very useful one day  what on earth are you going to do good asked sir henry  do  why dress of course  you dont expect me to appear in a new country in these things do you and he pointed to his soiled and worn garments which were however like all goods things very tidy and with every tear neatly mended  we said no more but watched his proceedings with breathless interest  his first step was to get alphonse who was thoroughly competent in such matters to trim his hair and beard in the most approved fashion  i think that if he had had some hot water and a cake of soap at hand he would have shaved off the latter but he had not  this done he suggested that we should lower the sail of the canoe and all take a bath which we did greatly to the horror and astonishment of alphonse who lifted his hands and ejaculated that these english were indeed a wonderful people umslopogaas who though he was like most highbred zulus scrupulously cleanly in his person did not see the fun of swimming about in a lake also regarded the proceeding with mild amusement we got back into the canoe much refreshed by the cold water and sat to dry in the sun whilst good undid his tin box and produced first a beautiful clean white shirt just as it had left a london steam laundry and then some garments wrapped first in brown then in white and finally in silver paper  we watched this undoing with the tenderest interest and much speculation one by one good removed the dull husks that hid their splendours carefully folding and replacing each piece of paper as he did so and there at last lay in all the majesty of its golden epaulettes lace and buttons a commander of the royal navys fulldress uniform  dress sword cocked hat shiny patent leather boots and all  we literally gasped  what we said what  are you going to put those things on  certainly he answered composedly you see so much depends upon a first impression especially he added as i observe that there are ladies about  one at least of us ought to be decently dressed  we said no more we were simply dumbfounded especially when we considered the artful way in which good had concealed the contents of that box for all these months  only one suggestion did we make  namely that he should wear his mail shirt next his skin  he replied that he feared it would spoil the set of his coat now carefully spread in the sun to take the creases out but finally consented to this precautionary measure  the most amusing part of the affair however was to see old umslopogaass astonishment and alphonses delight at goods transformation when at last he stood up in all his glory even down to the medals on his breast and contemplated himself in the still waters of the lake after the fashion of the young gentleman in ancient history whose name i cannot remember but who fell in love with his own shadow the old zulu could no longer restrain his feelings  oh bougwan he said  oh bougwan  i always thought thee an ugly little man and fat  fat as the cows at calving time and now thou art like a blue jay when he spreads his tail out surely bougwan it hurts my eyes to look at thee  good did not much like this allusion to his fat which to tell the truth was not very well deserved for hard exercise had brought him down three inches but on the whole he was pleased at umslopogaass admiration  as for alphonse he was quite delighted  ah but monsieur has the beautiful air  the air of the warrior it is the ladies who will say so when we come to get ashore monsieur is complete he puts me in mind of my heroic grand   here we stopped alphonse  as we gazed upon the beauties thus revealed by good a spirit of emulation filled our breasts and we set to work to get ourselves up as well as we could  the most however that we were able to do was to array ourselves in our spare suits of shooting clothes of which we each had several all the fine clothes in the world could never make it otherwise than scrubby and insignificant but sir henry looked what he is a magnificent man in his nearly new tweed suit gaiters and boots  alphonse also got himself up to kill giving an extra turn to his enormous moustaches even old umslopogaas who was not in a general way given to the vain adorning of his body took some oil out of the lantern and a bit of tow and polished up his headring with it till it shone like goods patent leather boots  then he put on the mail shirt sir henry had given him and his moocha and having cleaned up inkosikaas a little stood forth complete  all this while having hoisted the sail again as soon as we had finished bathing we had been progressing steadily for the land or rather for the mouth of a great river  presently  in all about an hour and a half after the little boat had left us  we saw emerging from the river or harbour a large number of boats ranging up to ten or twelve tons burden  one of these was propelled by twentyfour oars and most of the rest sailed looking through the glass we soon made out that the rowboat was an official vessel her crew being all dressed in a sort of uniform whilst on the halfdeck forward stood an old man of venerable appearance and with a flowing white beard and a sword strapped to his side who was evidently the commander of the craft  the other boats were apparently occupied by people brought out by curiosity and were rowing or sailing towards us as quickly as they could  now for it said i  what is the betting  are they going to be friendly or to put an end to us  nobody could answer this question and not liking the warlike appearance of the old gentleman and his sword we felt a little anxious  just then good spied a school of hippopotami on the water about two hundred yards off us and suggested that it would not be a bad plan to impress the natives with a sense of our power by shooting some of them if possible  this unluckily enough struck us as a good idea and accordingly we at once got out our eightbore rifles for which we still had a few cartridges left and prepared for action  there were four of the animals a big bull a cow and two young ones one three parts grown  we got up to them without difficulty the great animals contenting themselves with sinking down into the water and rising again a few yards farther on indeed their excessive tameness struck me as being peculiar when the advancing boats were about five hundred yards away sir henry opened the ball by firing at the three parts grown young one  the heavy bullet struck it fair between the eyes and crashing through the skull killed it and it sank leaving a long train of blood behind it  at the same moment i fired at the cow and good at the old bull  my shot took effect but not fatally and down went the hippopotamus with a prodigious splashing only to rise again presently blowing and grunting furiously dyeing all the water round her crimson when i killed her with the left barrel  good who is an execrable shot missed the head of the bull altogether the bullet merely cutting the side of his face as it passed  on glancing up after i had fired my second shot i perceived that the people we had fallen among were evidently ignorant of the nature of firearms for the consternation caused by our shots and their effect upon the animals was prodigious some of the parties in the boats began to cry out in fear others turned and made off as hard as they could and even the old gentleman with the sword looked greatly puzzled and alarmed and halted his big rowboat  we had however but little time for observation for just then the old bull rendered furious by the wound he had received rose fair within forty yards of us glaring savagely we all fired and hit him in various places and down he went badly wounded  curiosity now began to overcome the fear of the onlookers and some of them sailed on up close to us amongst these being the man and woman whom we had first seen a couple of hours or so before who drew up almost alongside  just then the great brute rose again within ten yards of their base and instantly with a roar of fury made at it openmouthed  the woman shrieked and the man tried to give the boat way but without success  in another second i saw the huge red jaws and gleaming ivories close with a crunch on the frail craft taking an enormous mouthful out of its side and capsizing it  down went the boat leaving its occupants struggling in the water  next moment before we could do anything towards saving them the huge and furious creature was up again and making openmouthed at the poor girl who was struggling in the water  lifting my rifle just as the grinding jaws were about to close on her i fired over her head right down the hippopotamuss throat  over he went and commenced turning round and round snorting and blowing red streams of blood through his nostrils  before he could recover himself however i let him have the other barrel in the side of the throat and that finished him  he never moved or struggled again but instantly sank  our next effort was directed towards saving the girl the man having swum off towards another boat and in this we were fortunately successful pulling her into the canoe amidst the shouts of the spectators considerably exhausted and frightened but otherwise unhurt  meanwhile the boats had gathered together at a distance and we could see that the occupants who were evidently much frightened were consulting what to do  without giving them time for further consideration which we thought might result unfavourably to ourselves we instantly took our paddles and advanced towards them good standing in the bow and taking off his cocked hat politely in every direction his amiable features suffused by a bland but intelligent smile  most of the craft retreated as we advanced but a few held their ground while the big rowboat came on to meet us  presently we were alongside and i could see that our appearance  and especially goods and umslopogaass  filled the venerablelooking commander with astonishment not unmixed with awe  he was dressed after the same fashion as the man we first met except that his shirt was not made of brown cloth but of pure white linen hemmed with purple  the kilt however was identical and so were the thick rings of gold around the arm and beneath the left knee  the rowers wore only a kilt their bodies being naked to the waist  good took off his hat to the old gentleman with an extra flourish and inquired after his health in the purest english to which he replied by laying the first two fingers of his right hand horizontally across his lips and holding them there for a moment which we took as his method of salutation  then he also addressed some remarks to us in the same soft accents that had distinguished our first interviewer which we were forced to indicate we did not understand by shaking our heads and shrugging our shoulders this last alphonse being to the manner born did to perfection and in so polite a way that nobody could take any offence  then we came a standstill till i being exceedingly hungry thought i might as well call attention to the fact and did so first by opening my mouth and pointing down it and then rubbing my stomach  these signals the old gentleman clearly understood for he nodded his head vigorously and pointed towards the harbour and at the same time one of the men on his boat threw us a line and motioned to us to make it fast which we did  the rowboat then took us in tow and went with great rapidity towards the mouth of the river accompanied by all the other boats  in about twenty minutes more we reached the entrance to the harbour which was crowded with boats full of people who had come out to see us  we observed that all the occupants were more or less of the same type though some were fairer than others  indeed we noticed certain ladies whose skin was of a most dazzling whiteness and the darkest shade of colour which we saw was about that of a rather swarthy spaniard  presently the wide river gave a sweep and when it did so an exclamation of astonishment and delight burst from our lips as we caught our first view of the place that we afterwards knew as milosis or the frowning city from mi which means city and losis a frown  at a distance of some five hundred yards from the rivers bank rose a sheer precipice of granite two hundred feet or so in height which had no doubt once formed the bank itself  the intermediate space of land now utilized as docks and roadways having been gained by draining and deepening and embanking the stream  on the brow of this precipice stood a great building of the same granite that formed the cliff built on three sides of a square the fourth side being open save for a kind of battlement pierced at its base by a little door  this imposing place we afterwards discovered was the palace of the queen or rather of the queens at the back of the palace the town sloped gently upwards to a flashing building of white marble crowned by the golden dome which we had already observed  the city was with the exception of this one building entirely built of red granite and laid out in regular blocks with splendid roadways between  so far as we could see also the houses were all onestoried and detached with gardens round them which gave some relief to the eye wearied with the vista of red granite  at the back of the palace a road of extraordinary width stretched away up the hill for a distance of a mile and a half or so and appeared to terminate at an open space surrounding the gleaming building that crowned the hill but right in front of us was the wonder and glory of milosis  the great staircase of the palace the magnificence of which took our breath away  let the reader imagine if he can a splendid stairway sixtyfive feet from balustrade to balustrade consisting of two vast flights each of one hundred and twentyfive steps of eight inches in height by three feet broad connected by a flat restingplace sixty feet in length and running from the palace wall on the edge of the precipice down to meet a waterway or canal cut to its foot from the river  this marvellous staircase was supported upon a single enormous granite arch of which the restingplace between the two flights formed the crown that is the connecting open space lay upon it  from this archway sprang a subsidiary flying arch or rather something that resembled a flying arch in shape such as none of us had seen in any other country and of which the beauty and wonder surpassed all that we had ever imagined  three hundred feet from point to point and no less than five hundred and fifty round the curve that halfarc soared touching the bridge it supported for a space of fifty feet only one end resting on and built into the parent archway and the other embedded in the solid granite of the side of the precipice  this staircase with its supports was indeed a work of which any living man might have been proud both on account of its magnitude and its surpassing beauty  four times as we afterwards learnt did the work which was commenced in remote antiquity fail and was then abandoned for three centuries when halffinished till at last there rose a youthful engineer named rademas who said that he would complete it successfully and staked his life upon it  if he failed he was to be hurled from the precipice he had undertaken to scale if he succeeded he was to be rewarded by the hand of the kings daughter  five years was given to him to complete the work and an unlimited supply of labour and material  three times did his arch fall till at last seeing failure to be inevitable he determined to commit suicide on the morrow of the third collapse  that night however a beautiful woman came to him in a dream and touched his forehead and of a sudden he saw a vision of the completed work and saw too through the masonry and how the difficulties connected with the flying arch that had hitherto baffled his genius were to be overcome then he awoke and once more commenced the work but on a different plan and behold he achieved it and on the last day of the five years he led the princess his bride up the stair and into the palace  and in due course he became king by right of his wife and founded the present zuvendi dynasty which is to this day called the house of the stairway thus proving once more how energy and talent are the natural steppingstones to grandeur and to commemorate his triumph he fashioned a statue of himself dreaming and of the fair woman who touched him on the forehead and placed it in the great hall of the palace and there it stands to this day  such was the great stair of milosis and such the city beyond no wonder they named it the frowning city for certainly those mighty works in solid granite did seem to frown down upon our littleness in their sombre splendour  this was so even in the sunshine but when the stormclouds gathered on her imperial brow milosis looked more like a supernatural dwellingplace or some imagining of a poets brain than what she is  a mortal city carven by the patient genius of generations out of the red silence of the mountain side     chapter xii the sister queens    the big rowingboat glided on up the cutting that ran almost to the foot of the vast stairway and then halted at a flight of steps leading to the landingplace  here the old gentleman disembarked and invited us to do so likewise which having no alternative and being nearly starved we did without hesitation  taking our rifles with us however  as each of us landed our guide again laid his fingers on his lips and bowed deeply at the same time ordering back the crowds which had assembled to gaze on us  the last to leave the canoe was the girl we had picked out of the water for whom her companion was waiting before she went away she kissed my hand i suppose as a token of gratitude for having saved her from the fury of the hippopotamus and it seemed to me that she had by this time quite got over any fear she might have had of us and was by no means anxious to return in such a hurry to her lawful owners  at any rate she was going to kiss goods hand as well as mine when the young man interfered and led her off  as soon as we were on shore a number of the men who had rowed the big boat took possession of our few goods and chattels and started with them up the splendid staircase our guide indicating to us by means of motions that the things were perfectly safe  this done he turned to the right and led the way to a small house which was as i afterwards discovered an inn  entering into a goodsized room we saw that a wooden table was already furnished with food presumably in preparation for us  here our guide motioned us to be seated on a bench that ran the length of the table  we did not require a second invitation but at once fell to ravenously on the viands before us which were served on wooden platters and consisted of cold goatsflesh wrapped up in some kind of leaf that gave it a delicious flavour green vegetables resembling lettuces brown bread and red wine poured from a skin into horn mugs this wine was peculiarly soft and good having something of the flavour of burgundy  twenty minutes after we sat down at that hospitable board we rose from it feeling like new men after all that we had gone through we needed two things food and rest and the food of itself was a great blessing to us two girls of the same charming cast of face as the first whom we had seen waited on us while we ate and very nicely they did it  they were also dressed in the same fashion namely in a white linen petticoat coming to the knee and with the togalike garment of brown cloth leaving bare the right arm and breast i afterwards found out that this was the national dress and regulated by an iron custom though of course subject to variations thus if the petticoat was pure white it signified that the wearer was unmarried if white with a straight purple stripe round the edge that she was married and a first or legal wife if with a black stripe that she was a widow  in the same way the toga or kaf as they call it was of different shades of colour from pure white to the deepest brown according to the rank of the wearer and embroidered at the end in various ways  this also applies to the shirts or tunics worn by the men which varied in material and colour but the kilts were always the same except as regards quality  one thing however every man and woman in the country wore as the national insignia and that was the thick band of gold round the right arm above the elbow and the left leg beneath the knee  people of high rank also wore a torque of gold round the neck and i observed that our guide had one on  so soon as we had finished our meal our venerable conductor who had been standing all the while regarding us with inquiring eyes and our guns with something as like fear as his pride would allow him to show bowed towards good whom he evidently took for the leader of the party on account of the splendour of his apparel and once more led the way through the door and to the foot of the great staircase  here we paused for a moment to admire two colossal lions each hewn from a single block of pure black marble and standing rampant on the terminations of the wide balustrades of the staircase  these lions are magnificently executed and it is said were sculptured by rademas the great prince who designed the staircase and who was without doubt to judge from the many beautiful examples of his art that we saw afterwards one of the finest sculptors who ever lived either in this or any other country  then we climbed almost with a feeling of awe up that splendid stair a work executed for all time and that will i do not doubt be admired thousands of years hence by generations unborn unless an earthquake should throw it down  even umslopogaas who as a general rule made it a point of honour not to show astonishment which he considered undignified was fairly startled out of himself and asked if the bridge had been built by men or devils which was his vague way of alluding to any supernatural power  but alphonse did not care about it  its solid grandeur jarred upon the frivolous little frenchman who said that it was all tres magnifique mais triste  ah triste and went on to suggest that it would be improved if the balustrades were gilt  on we went up the first flight of one hundred and twenty steps across the broad platform joining it to the second flight where we paused to admire the glorious view of one of the most beautiful stretches of country that the world can show edged by the blue waters of the lake  then we passed on up the stair till at last we reached the top where we found a large standing space to which there were three entrances all of small size  two of these opened on to rather narrow galleries or roadways cut in the face of the precipice that ran round the palace walls and led to the principal thoroughfares of the city and were used by the inhabitants passing up and down from the docks  these were defended by gates of bronze and also as we afterwards learnt it was possible to let down a portion of the roadways themselves by withdrawing certain bolts and thus render it quite impracticable for an enemy to pass  the third entrance consisted of a flight of ten curved black marble steps leading to a doorway cut in the palace wall  this wall was in itself a work of art being built of huge blocks of granite to the height of forty feet and so fashioned that its face was concave whereby it was rendered practically impossible for it to be scaled  to this doorway our guide led us  the door which was massive and made of wood protected by an outer gate of bronze was closed but on our approach it was thrown wide and we were met by the challenge of a sentry who was armed with a heavy triangularbladed spear not unlike a bayonet in shape and a cutting sword and protected by breast and back plates of skilfully prepared hippopotamus hide and a small round shield fashioned of the same tough material the sword instantly attracted our attention it was practically identical with the one in the possession of mr mackenzie which he had obtained from the illstarred wanderer  there was no mistaking the goldlined fretwork cut in the thickness of the blade  so the man had told the truth after all  our guide instantly gave a password which the soldier acknowledged by letting the iron shaft of his spear fall with a ringing sound upon the pavement and we passed on through the massive wall into the courtyard of the palace  this was about forty yards square and laid out in flowerbeds full of lovely shrubs and plants many of which were quite new to me  through the centre of this garden ran a broad walk formed of powdered shells brought from the lake in the place of gravel  following this we came to another doorway with a round heavy arch which is hung with thick curtains for there are no doors in the palace itself  then came another short passage and we were in the great hall of the palace and once more stood astonished at the simple and yet overpowering grandeur of the place  the hall is as we afterwards learnt one hundred and fifty feet long by eighty wide and has a magnificent arched roof of carved wood  down the entire length of the building there are on either side and at a distance of twenty feet from the wall slender shafts of black marble springing sheer to the roof beautifully fluted and with carved capitals  at one end of this great place which these pillars support is the group of which i have already spoken as executed by the king rademas to commemorate his building of the staircase and really when we had time to admire it its loveliness almost struck us dumb  the group of which the figures are in white and the rest is black marble is about half as large again as life and represents a young man of noble countenance and form sleeping heavily upon a couch  one arm is carelessly thrown over the side of this couch and his head reposes upon the other its curling locks partially hiding it bending over him her hand resting on his forehead is a draped female form of such white loveliness as to make the beholders breath stand still  and as for the calm glory that shines upon her perfect face  well i can never hope to describe it  but there it rests like the shadow of an angels smile and power love and divinity all have their part in it  her eyes are fixed upon the sleeping youth and perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this beautiful work is the success with which the artist has succeeded in depicting on the sleepers worn and weary face the sudden rising of a new and spiritual thought as the spell begins to work within his mind  you can see that an inspiration is breaking in upon the darkness of the mans soul as the dawn breaks in upon the darkness of night  it is a glorious piece of statuary and none but a genius could have conceived it between each of the black marble columns is some such group of figures some allegorical and some representing the persons and wives of deceased monarchs or great men but none of them in our opinion comes up the one i have described although several are from the hand of the sculptor and engineer king rademas  in the exact centre of the hall was a solid mass of black marble about the size of a babys armchair which it rather resembled in appearance  this as we afterwards learnt was the sacred stone of this remarkable people and on it their monarchs laid their hand after the ceremony of coronation and swore by the sun to safeguard the interests of the empire and to maintain its customs traditions and laws  this stone was evidently exceedingly ancient as indeed all stones are and was scored down its sides with long marks or lines which sir henry said proved it to have been a fragment that at some remote period in its history had been ground in the iron jaws of glaciers there was a curious prophecy about this block of marble which was reported among the people to have fallen from the sun to the effect that when it was shattered into fragments a king of alien race should rule over the land  as the stone however looked remarkably solid the native princes seemed to have a fair chance of keeping their own for many a long year  at the end of the hall is a dais spread with rich carpets on which two thrones are set side by side  these thrones are shaped like great chairs and made of solid gold  the seats are richly cushioned but the backs are left bare and on each is carved the emblem of the sun shooting out his fiery rays in all directions the footstools are golden lions couchant with yellow topazes set in them for eyes  there are no other gems about them  the place is lighted by numerous but narrow windows placed high up cut on the principle of the loopholes to be seen in ancient castles but innocent of glass which was evidently unknown here  such is a brief description of this splendid hall in which we now found ourselves compiled of course from our subsequent knowledge of it  on this occasion we had but little time for observation for when we entered we perceived that a large number of men were gathered together in front of the two thrones which were unoccupied the principal among them were seated on carved wooden chairs ranged to the right and the left of the thrones but not in front of them and were dressed in white tunics with various embroideries and different coloured edgings and armed with the usual pierced and goldinlaid swords  to judge from the dignity of their appearance they seemed one and all to be individuals of very great importance behind each of these great men stood a small knot of followers and attendants  seated by themselves in a little group to the left of the throne were six men of a different stamp  instead of wearing the ordinary kilt they were clothed in long robes of pure white linen with the same symbol of the sun that is to be seen on the back of the chairs emblazoned in gold thread upon the breast  this garment was girt up at the waist with a simple golden curblike chain from which hung long elliptic plates of the same metal fashioned in shiny scales like those of a fish that as their wearers moved jingled and reflected the light  they were all men of mature age and of a severe and impressive cast of features which was rendered still more imposing by the long beards they wore  the personality of one individual among them however impressed us at once  he seemed to stand out among his fellows and refuse to be overlooked  he was very old  eighty at least  and extremely tall with a long snowwhite beard that hung nearly to his waist  his features were aquiline and deeply cut and his eyes were grey and coldlooking  the heads of the others were bare but this man wore a round cap entirely covered with gold embroidery from which we judged that he was a person of great importance and indeed we afterwards discovered that he was agon the high priest of the country  as we approached all these men including the priests rose and bowed to us with the greatest courtesy at the same time placing the two fingers across the lips in salutation  then softfooted attendants advanced from between the pillars bearing seats which were placed in a line in front of the thrones  we three sat down alphonse and umslopogaas standing behind us  scarcely had we done so when there came a blare of trumpets from some passage to the right and a similar blare from the left  next a man with a long white wand of ivory appeared just in front of the righthand throne and cried out something in a loud voice ending with the word nyleptha repeated three times and another man similarly attired called out a similar sentence before the other throne but ending with the word sorais also repeated thrice  then came the tramp of armed men from each side entrance and in filed about a score of picked and magnificently accoutred guards who formed up on each side of the thrones and let their heavy ironhandled spears fall simultaneously with a clash upon the black marble flooring  another double blare of trumpets and in from either side each attended by six maidens swept the two queens of zuvendis everybody in the hall rising to greet them as they came  i have seen beautiful women in my day and am no longer thrown into transports at the sight of a pretty face but language fails me when i try to give some idea of the blaze of loveliness that then broke upon us in the persons of these sister queens  both were young  perhaps fiveandtwenty years of age  both were tall and exquisitely formed but there the likeness stopped one nyleptha was a woman of dazzling fairness her right arm and breast bare after the custom of her people showed like snow even against her white and goldembroidered kaf or toga and as for her sweet face all i can say is that it was one that few men could look on and forget  her hair a veritable crown of gold clustered in short ringlets over her shapely head half hiding the ivory brow beneath which eyes of deep and glorious grey flashed out in tender majesty  i cannot attempt to describe her other features only the mouth was most sweet and curved like cupids bow and over the whole countenance there shone an indescribable look of lovingkindness lit up by a shadow of delicate humour that lay upon her face like a touch of silver on a rosy cloud  she wore no jewels but on her neck arm and knee were the usual torques of gold in this instance fashioned like a snake and her dress was of pure white linen of excessive fineness plentifully embroidered with gold and with the familiar symbols of the sun  her twin sister sorais was of a different and darker type of beauty  her hair was wavy like nylepthas but coalblack and fell in masses on her shoulders her complexion was olive her eyes large dark and lustrous the lips were full and i thought rather cruel  somehow her face quiet and even cold as it is gave an idea of passion in repose and caused one to wonder involuntarily what its aspect would be if anything occurred to break the calm it reminded me of the deep sea that even on the bluest days never loses its visible stamp of power and in its murmuring sleep is yet instinct with the spirit of the storm  her figure like her sisters was almost perfect in its curves and outlines but a trifle more rounded and her dress was absolutely the same  as this lovely pair swept onwards to their respective thrones amid the deep attentive silence of the court i was bound to confess to myself that they did indeed fulfil my idea of royalty royal they were in every way  in form in grace and queenly dignity and in the barbaric splendour of their attendant pomp but methought that they needed no guards or gold to proclaim their power and bind the loyalty of wayward men  a glance from those bright eyes or a smile from those sweet lips and while the red blood runs in the veins of youth women such as these will never lack subjects ready to do their biddings to the death  but after all they were women first and queens afterwards and therefore not devoid of curiosity  as they passed to their seats i saw both of them glance swiftly in our direction  i saw too that their eyes passed by me seeing nothing to charm them in the person of an insignificant and grizzled old man  then they looked with evident astonishment on the grim form of old umslopogaas who raised his axe in salutation  attracted next by the splendour of goods apparel for a second their glance rested on him like a humming moth upon a flower then off it darted to where sir henry curtis stood the sunlight from a window playing upon his yellow hair and peaked beard and marking the outlines of his massive frame against the twilight of the somewhat gloomy hall he raised his eyes and they met the fair nylepthas full and thus for the first time the goodliest man and woman that it has ever been my lot to see looked one upon another  and why it was i know not but i saw the swift blood run up nylepthas skin as the pink lights run up the morning sky  red grew her fair bosom and shapely arm red the swanlike neck the rounded cheeks blushed red as the petals of a rose and then the crimson flood sank back to whence it came and left her pale and trembling  i glanced at sir henry  he too had coloured up to the eyes  oh my word thought i to myself the ladies have come on the stage and now we may look to the plot to develop itself and i sighed and shook my head knowing that the beauty of a woman is like the beauty of the lightning  a destructive thing and a cause of desolation  by the time that i had finished my reflections both the queens were on the thrones for all this had happened in about six seconds  once more the unseen trumpets blared out and then the court seated itself and queen sorais motioned to us to do likewise  next from among the crowd whither he had withdrawn stepped forward our guide the old gentleman who had towed us ashore holding by the hand the girl whom we had seen first and afterwards rescued from the hippopotamus  having made obeisance he proceeded to address the queens evidently describing to them the way and place where we had been found  it was most amusing to watch the astonishment not unmixed with fear reflected upon their faces as they listened to his tale  clearly they could not understand how we had reached the lake and been found floating on it and were inclined to attribute our presence to supernatural causes then the narrative proceeded as i judged from the frequent appeals that our guide made to the girl to the point where we had shot the hippopotami and we at once perceived that there was something very wrong about those hippopotami for the history was frequently interrupted by indignant exclamations from the little group of whiterobed priests and even from the courtiers while the two queens listened with an amazed expression especially when our guide pointed to the rifles in our hands as being the means of destruction  and here to make matters clear i may as well explain at once that the inhabitants of zuvendis are sunworshippers and that for some reason or another the hippopotamus is sacred among them  not that they do not kill it because at a certain season of the year they slaughter thousands  which are specially preserved in large lakes up the country  and use their hides for armour for soldiers but this does not prevent them from considering these animals as sacred to the sun endnote 11 now as ill luck would have it the particular hippopotami we had shot were a family of tame animals that were kept in the mouth of the port and daily fed by priests whose special duty it was to attend to them  when we shot them i thought that the brutes were suspiciously tame and this was as we afterwards ascertained the cause of it  thus it came about that in attempting to show off we had committed sacrilege of a most aggravated nature  when our guide had finished his tale the old man with the long beard and round cap whose appearance i have already described and who was as i have said the high priest of the country and known by the name of agon rose and commenced an impassioned harangue  i did not like the look of his cold grey eye as he fixed it on us  i should have liked it still less had i known that in the name of the outraged majesty of his god he was demanding that the whole lot of us should be offered up as a sacrifice by means of being burnt alive  after he had finished speaking the queen sorais addressed him in a soft and musical voice and appeared to judge from his gestures of dissent to be putting the other side of the question before him  then nyleptha spoke in liquid accents  little did we know that she was pleading for our lives  finally she turned and addressed a tall soldierlike man of middle age with a black beard and a long plain sword whose name as we afterwards learnt was nasta and who was the greatest lord in the country apparently appealing to him for support  now when sir henry had caught her eye and she had blushed so rosy red i had seen that the incident had not escaped this mans notice and what is more that it was eminently disagreeable to him for he bit his lip and his hand tightened on his swordhilt  afterwards we learnt that he was an aspirant for the hand of this queen in marriage which accounted for it  this being so nyleptha could not have appealed to a worse person for speaking in slow heavy tones he appeared to confirm all that the high priest agon had said as he spoke sorais put her elbow on her knee and resting her chin on her hand looked at him with a suppressed smile upon her lips as though she saw through the man and was determined to be his match but nyleptha grew very angry her cheek flushed her eyes flashed and she did indeed look lovely  finally she turned to agon and seemed to give some sort of qualified assent for he bowed at her words and as she spoke she moved her hands as though to emphasize what she said while all the time sorais kept her chin on her hand and smiled  then suddenly nyleptha made a sign the trumpets blew again and everybody rose to leave the hall save ourselves and the guards whom she motioned to stay  when they were all gone she bent forward and smiling sweetly partially by signs and partially by exclamations made it clear to us that she was very anxious to know where we came from the difficulty was how to explain but at last an idea struck me  i had my large pocketbook in my pocket and a pencil  taking it out i made a little sketch of a lake and then as best i could i drew the underground river and the lake at the other end  when i had done this i advanced to the steps of the throne and gave it to her  she understood it at once and clapped her hands with delight and then descending from the throne took it to her sister sorais who also evidently understood  next she took the pencil from me and after examining it with curiosity proceeded to make a series of delightful little sketches the first representing herself holding out both hands in welcome and a man uncommonly like sir henry taking them  next she drew a lovely little picture of a hippopotamus rolling about dying in the water and of an individual in whom we had no difficulty in recognizing agon the high priest holding up his hands in horror on the bank  then followed a most alarming picture of a dreadful fiery furnace and of the same figure agon poking us into it with a forked stick  this picture perfectly horrified me but i was a little reassured when she nodded sweetly and proceeded to make a fourth drawing  a man again uncommonly like sir henry and of two women in whom i recognized sorais and herself each with one arm around him and holding a sword in protection over him  to all of these sorais who i saw was employed in carefully taking us all in  especially curtis  signified her approval by nodding  at last nyleptha drew a final sketch of a rising sun indicating that she must go and that we should meet on the following morning whereat sir henry looked so disappointed that she saw it and i suppose by way of consolation extended her hand to him to kiss which he did with pious fervour  at the same time sorais off whom good had never taken his eyeglass during the whole indaba interview rewarded him by giving him her hand to kiss though while she did so her eyes were fixed upon sir henry  i am glad to say that i was not implicated in these proceedings neither of them gave me her hand to kiss  then nyleptha turned and addressed the man who appeared to be in command of the bodyguard apparently from her manner and his frequent obeisances giving him very stringent and careful orders after which with a somewhat coquettish nod and smile she left the hall followed by sorais and most of the guards  when the queens had gone the officer whom nyleptha had addressed came forward and with many tokens of deep respect led us from the hall through various passages to a sumptuous set of apartments opening out of a large central room lighted with brazen swinging lamps for it was now dusk and richly carpeted and strewn with couches  on a table in the centre of the room was set a profusion of food and fruit and what is more flowers  there was a delicious wine also in ancientlooking sealed earthenware flagons and beautifully chased golden and ivory cups to drink it from  servants male and female also were there to minister to us and whilst we ate from some recess outside the apartment      the silver lute did speak between     the trumpets lordly blowing   and altogether we found ourselves in a sort of earthly paradise which was only disturbed by the vision of that disgusting high priest who intended to commit us to the flames  but so very weary were we with our labours that we could scarcely keep ourselves awake through the sumptuous meal and as soon as it was over we indicated that we desired to sleep  as a further precaution against surprise we left umslopogaas with his axe to sleep in the main chamber near the curtained doorways leading to the apartments which we occupied respectively good and i in the one and sir henry and alphonse in the other  then throwing off our clothes with the exception of the mail shirts which we considered it safer to keep on we flung ourselves down upon the low and luxurious couches and drew the silkembroidered coverlids over us  in two minutes i was just dropping off when i was aroused by goods voice  i say quatermain he said did you ever see such eyes  eyes i said crossly what eyes  why the queens of course  sorais i mean  at least i think that is her name  oh i dont know i yawned i didnt notice them much i suppose they are good eyes and again i dropped off  five minutes or so elapsed and i was once more awakened  i say quatermain said the voice  well i answered testily what is it now  did you notice her ankle  the shape   this was more than i could stand  by my bed stood the veldtschoons i had been wearing  moved quite beyond myself i took them up and threw them straight at goods head  and hit it  afterwards i slept the sleep of the just and a very heavy sleep it must be  as for good i dont know if he went to sleep or if he continued to pass sorais beauties in mental review and what is more i dont care     chapter xiii about the zuvendi people    and now the curtain is down for a few hours and the actors in this novel drama are plunged in dewy sleep  perhaps we should except nyleptha whom the reader may if poetically inclined imagine lying in her bed of state encompassed by her maidens tiring women guards and all the other people and appurtenances that surround a throne and yet not able to slumber for thinking of the strangers who had visited a country where no such strangers had ever come before and wondering as she lay awake who they were and what their past has been and if she was ugly compared to the women of their native place  i however not being poetically inclined will take advantage of the lull to give some account of the people among whom we found ourselves compiled needless to state from information which we subsequently collected  the name of this country to begin at the beginning is zuvendis from zu yellow and vendis place or country  why it is called the yellow country i have never been able to ascertain accurately nor do the inhabitants themselves know  three reasons are however given each of which would suffice to account for it  the first is that the name owes its origin to the great quantity of gold that is found in the land  indeed in this respect zuvendis is a veritable eldorado the precious metal being extraordinarily plentiful  at present it is collected from purely alluvial diggings which we subsequently inspected and which are situated within a days journey from milosis being mostly found in pockets and in nuggets weighing from an ounce up to six or seven pounds in weight  but other diggings of a similar nature are known to exist and i have besides seen great veins of goldbearing quartz  in zuvendis gold is a much commoner metal than silver and thus it has curiously enough come to pass that silver is the legal tender of the country  the second reason given is that at certain times of the year the native grasses of the country which are very sweet and good turn as yellow as ripe corn and the third arises from a tradition that the people were originally yellow skinned but grew white after living for many generations upon these high lands  zuvendis is a country about the size of france is roughly speaking oval in shape and on every side cut off from the surrounding territory by illimitable forests of impenetrable thorn beyond which are said to be hundreds of miles of morasses deserts and great mountains  it is in short a huge high tableland rising up in the centre of the dark continent much as in southern africa flattopped mountains rise from the level of the surrounding veldt  milosis itself lies according to my aneroid at a level of about nine thousand feet above the sea but most of the land is even higher the greatest elevation of the open country being i believe about eleven thousand feet  as a consequence the climate is comparatively speaking a cold one being very similar to that of southern england only brighter and not so rainy the land is however exceedingly fertile and grows all cereals and temperate fruits and timber to perfection and in the lowerlying parts even produces a hardy variety of sugarcane  coal is found in great abundance and in many places crops out from the surface and so is pure marble both black and white  the same may be said of almost every metal except silver which is scarce and only to be obtained from a range of mountains in the north  zuvendis comprises in her boundaries a great variety of scenery including two ranges of snowclad mountains one on the western boundary beyond the impenetrable belt of thorn forest and the other piercing the country from north to south and passing at a distance of about eighty miles from milosis from which town its higher peaks are distinctly visible  this range forms the chief watershed of the land  there are also three large lakes  the biggest namely that whereon we emerged and which is named milosis after the city covering some two hundred square miles of country  and numerous small ones some of them salt  the population of this favoured land is comparatively speaking dense numbering at a rough estimate from ten to twelve millions it is almost purely agricultural in its habits and divided into great classes as in civilized countries  there is a territorial nobility a considerable middle class formed principally of merchants officers of the army etc but the great bulk of the people are welltodo peasants who live upon the lands of the lords from whom they hold under a species of feudal tenure the best bred people in the country are as i think i have said pure whites with a somewhat southern cast of countenance but the common herd are much darker though they do not show any negro or other african characteristics  as to their descent i can give no certain information  their written records which extend back for about a thousand years give no hint of it one very ancient chronicler does indeed in alluding to some old tradition that existed in his day talk of it as having probably originally come down with the people from the coast but that may mean little or nothing  in short the origin of the zuvendi is lost in the mists of time  whence they came or of what race they are no man knows  their architecture and some of their sculptures suggest an egyptian or possibly an assyrian origin but it is well known that their present remarkable style of building has only sprung up within the last eight hundred years and they certainly retain no traces of egyptian theology or customs again their appearance and some of their habits are rather jewish but here again it seems hardly conceivable that they should have utterly lost all traces of the jewish religion  still for aught i know they may be one of the lost ten tribes whom people are so fond of discovering all over the world or they may not i do not know and so can only describe them as i find them and leave wiser heads than mine to make what they can out of it if indeed this account should ever be read at all which is exceedingly doubtful  and now after i have said all this i am after all going to hazard a theory of my own though it is only a very little one as the young lady said in mitigation of her baby  this theory is founded on a legend which i have heard among the arabs on the east coast which is to the effect that more than two thousand years ago there were troubles in the country which was known as babylonia and that thereon a vast horde of persians came down to bushire where they took ship and were driven by the northeast monsoon to the east coast of africa where according to the legend the sun and fire worshippers fell into conflict with the belt of arab settlers who even then were settled on the east coast and finally broke their way through them and vanishing into the interior were no more seen  now i ask is it not at least possible that the zuvendi people are the descendants of these sun and fire worshippers who broke through the arabs and vanished  as a matter of fact there is a good deal in their characters and customs that tallies with the somewhat vague ideas that i have of persians  of course we have no books of reference here but sir henry says that if his memory does not fail him there was a tremendous revolt in babylon about 500 bc whereon a vast multitude were expelled from the city anyhow it is a wellestablished fact that there have been many separate emigrations of persians from the persian gulf to the east coast of africa up to as lately as seven hundred years ago there are persian tombs at kilwa on the east coast still in good repair which bear dates showing them to be just seven hundred years old endnote 12  in addition to being an agricultural people the zuvendi are oddly enough excessively warlike and as they cannot from the exigencies of their position make war upon other nations they fight among each other like the famed kilkenny cats with the happy result that the population never outgrows the power of the country to support it  this habit of theirs is largely fostered by the political condition of the country  the monarchy is nominally an absolute one save in so far as it is tempered by the power of the priests and the informal council of the great lords but as in many other institutions the kings writ does not run unquestioned throughout the length and breadth of the land  in short the whole system is a purely feudal one though absolute serfdom or slavery is unknown all the great lords holding nominally from the throne but a number of them being practically independent having the power of life and death waging war against and making peace with their neighbours as the whim or their interests lead them and even on occasion rising in open rebellion against their royal master or mistress and safely shut up in their castles and fenced cities as far from the seat of government successfully defying them for years  zuvendis has had its kingmakers as well as england a fact that will be well appreciated when i state that eight different dynasties have sat upon the throne in the last one thousand years every one of which took its rise from some noble family that succeeded in grasping the purple after a sanguinary struggle at the date of our arrival in the country things were a little better than they had been for some centuries the last king the father of nyleptha and sorais having been an exceptionally able and vigorous ruler and as a consequence he kept down the power of the priests and nobles  on his death two years before we reached zuvendis the twin sisters his children were following an ancient precedent called to the throne since an attempt to exclude either would instantly have provoked a sanguinary civil war but it was generally felt in the country that this measure was a most unsatisfactory one and could hardly be expected to be permanent  indeed as it was the various intrigues that were set on foot by ambitious nobles to obtain the hand of one or other of the queens in marriage had disquieted the country and the general opinion was that there would be bloodshed before long  i will now pass on to the question of the zuvendi religion which is nothing more or less than sunworship of a pronounced and highly developed character  around this sunworship is grouped the entire social system of the zuvendi  it sends its roots through every institution and custom of the land  from the cradle to the grave the zuvendi follows the sun in every sense of the saying  as an infant he is solemnly held up in its light and dedicated to the symbol of good the expression of power and the hope of eternity the ceremony answering to our baptism whilst still a tiny child his parents point out the glorious orb as the presence of a visible and beneficent god and he worships it at its uprising and downsetting  then when still quite small he goes holding fast to the pendent end of his mothers kaf toga up to the temple of the sun of the nearest city and there when at midday the bright beams strike down upon the golden central altar and beat back the fire that burns thereon he hears the whiterobed priests raise their solemn chant of praise and sees the people fall down to adore and then amidst the blowing of the golden trumpets watches the sacrifice thrown into the fiery furnace beneath the altar  here he comes again to be declared a man by the priests and consecrated to war and to good works here before the solemn altar he leads his bride and here too if differences shall unhappily arise he divorces her  and so on down lifes long pathway till the last mile is travelled and he comes again armed indeed and with dignity but no longer a man  here they bear him dead and lay his bier upon the falling brazen doors before the eastern altar and when the last ray from the setting sun falls upon his white face the bolts are drawn and he vanishes into the raging furnace beneath and is ended  the priests of the sun do not marry but are recruited as young men specially devoted to the work by their parents and supported by the state  the nomination to the higher offices of the priesthood lies with the crown but once appointed the nominees cannot be dispossessed and it is scarcely too much to say that they really rule the land  to begin with they are a united body sworn to obedience and secrecy so that an order issued by the high priest at milosis will be instantly and unhesitatingly acted upon by the resident priest of a little country town three or four hundred miles off  they are the judges of the land criminal and civil an appeal lying only to the lord paramount of the district and from him to the king and they have of course practically unlimited jurisdiction over religious and moral offences together with a right of excommunication which as in the faiths of more highly civilized lands is a very effective weapon  indeed their rights and powers are almost unlimited but i may as well state here that the priests of the sun are wise in their generation and do not push things too far  it is but very seldom that they go to extremes against anybody being more inclined to exercise the prerogative of mercy than run the risk of exasperating the powerful and vigorousminded people on whose neck they have set their yoke lest it should rise and break it off altogether  another source of the power of the priests is their practical monopoly of learning and their very considerable astronomical knowledge which enables them to keep a hold on the popular mind by predicting eclipses and even comets  in zuvendis only a few of the upper classes can read and write but nearly all the priests have this knowledge and are therefore looked upon as learned men  the law of the country is on the whole mild and just but differs in several respects from our civilized law  for instance the law of england is much more severe upon offences against property than against the person as becomes a people whose ruling passion is money  a man may half kick his wife to death or inflict horrible sufferings upon his children at a much cheaper rate of punishment than he can compound for the theft of a pair of old boots in zuvendis this is not so for there they rightly or wrongly look upon the person as of more consequence than goods and chattels and not as in england as a sort of necessary appendage to the latter  for murder the punishment is death for treason death for defrauding the orphan and the widow for sacrilege and for attempting to quit the country which is looked on as a sacrilege death  in each case the method of execution is the same and a rather awful one  the culprit is thrown alive into the fiery furnace beneath one of the altars to the sun  for all other offences including the offence of idleness the punishment is forced labour upon the vast national buildings which are always going on in some part of the country with or without periodical floggings according to the crime  the social system of the zuvendi allows considerable liberty to the individual provided he does not offend against the laws and customs of the country  they are polygamous in theory though most of them have only one wife on account of the expense  by law a man is bound to provide a separate establishment for each wife  the first wife also is the legal wife and her children are said to be of the house of the father  the children of the other wives are of the houses of their respective mothers this does not however imply any slur upon either mother or children  again a first wife can on entering into the married state make a bargain that her husband shall marry no other wife this however is very rarely done as the women are the great upholders of polygamy which not only provides for their surplus numbers but gives greater importance to the first wife who is thus practically the head of several households  marriage is looked upon as primarily a civil contract and subject to certain conditions and to a proper provision for children is dissoluble at the will of both contracting parties the divorce or unloosing being formally and ceremoniously accomplished by going through certain portions of the marriage ceremony backwards  the zuvendi are on the whole a very kindly pleasant and lighthearted people  they are not great traders and care little about money only working to earn enough to support themselves in that class of life in which they were born  they are exceedingly conservative and look with disfavour upon changes  their legal tender is silver cut into little squares of different weights gold is the baser coin and is about of the same value as our silver it is however much prized for its beauty and largely used for ornaments and decorative purposes  most of the trade however is carried on by means of sale and barter payment being made in kind  agriculture is the great business of the country and is really well understood and carried out most of the available acreage being under cultivation  great attention is also given to the breeding of cattle and horses the latter being unsurpassed by any i have ever seen either in europe or africa  the land belongs theoretically to the crown and under the crown to the great lords who again divide it among smaller lords and so on down to the little peasant farmer who works his forty reestu acres on a system of halfprofits with his immediate lord  in fact the whole system is as i have said distinctly feudal and it interested us much to meet with such an old friend far in the unknown heart of africa  the taxes are very heavy  the state takes a third of a mans total earnings and the priesthood about five per cent on the remainder  but on the other hand if a man through any cause falls into bona fide misfortune the state supports him in the position of life to which he belongs  if he is idle however he is sent to work on the government undertakings and the state looks after his wives and children  the state also makes all the roads and builds all town houses about which great care is shown letting them out to families at a small rent  it also keeps up a standing army of about twenty thousand men and provides watchmen etc  in return for their five per cent the priests attend to the service of the temples carry out all religious ceremonies and keep schools where they teach whatever they think desirable which is not very much  some of the temples also possess private property but priests as individuals cannot hold property  and now comes a question which i find some difficulty in answering are the zuvendi a civilized or barbarous people  sometimes i think the one sometimes the other  in some branches of art they have attained the very highest proficiency  take for instance their buildings and their statuary  i do not think that the latter can be equalled either in beauty or imaginative power anywhere in the world and as for the former it may have been rivalled in ancient egypt but i am sure that it has never been since  but on the other hand they are totally ignorant of many other arts  till sir henry who happened to know something about it showed them how to do it by mixing silica and lime they could not make a piece of glass and their crockery is rather primitive  a waterclock is their nearest approach to a watch indeed ours delighted them exceedingly  they know nothing about steam electricity or gunpowder and mercifully for themselves nothing about printing or the penny post  thus they are spared many evils for of a truth our age has learnt the wisdom of the oldworld saying he who increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow  as regards their religion it is a natural one for imaginative people who know no better and might therefore be expected to turn to the sun and worship him as the allfather but it cannot justly be called elevating or spiritual  it is true that they do sometimes speak of the sun as the garment of the spirit but it is a vague term and what they really adore is the fiery orb himself  they also call him the hope of eternity but here again the meaning is vague and i doubt if the phrase conveys any very clear impression to their minds  some of them do indeed believe in a future life for the good  i know nyleptha does firmly  but it is a private faith arising from the promptings of the spirit not an essential of their creed  so on the whole i cannot say that i consider this sunworship as a religion indicative of a civilized people however magnificent and imposing its ritual or however moral and highsounding the maxims of its priests many of whom i am sure have their own opinions on the whole subject though of course they have nothing but praise for a system which provides them with so many of the good things of this world  there are now only two more matters to which i need allude  namely the language and the system of calligraphy  as for the former it is softsounding and very rich and flexible sir henry says that it sounds something like modern greek but of course it has no connection with it  it is easy to acquire being simple in its construction and a peculiar quality about it is its euphony and the way in which the sound of the words adapts itself to the meaning to be expressed  long before we mastered the language we could frequently make out what was meant by the ring of the sentence  it is on this account that the language lends itself so well to poetical declamation of which these remarkable people are very fond  the zuvendi alphabet seems sir henry says to be derived like every other known system of letters from a phoenician source and therefore more remotely still from the ancient egyptian hieratic writing whether this is a fact i cannot say not being learned in such matters  all i know about it is that their alphabet consists of twentytwo characters of which a few notably b e and o are not very unlike our own  the whole affair is however clumsy and puzzling endnote 13  but as the people of zuvendi are not given to the writing of novels or of anything except business documents and records of the briefest character it answers their purpose well enough     chapter xiv the flower temple    it was halfpast eight by my watch when i woke on the morning following our arrival at milosis having slept almost exactly twelve hours and i must say that i did indeed feel better ah what a blessed thing is sleep and what a difference twelve hours of it or so makes to us after days and nights of toil and danger  it is like going to bed one man and getting up another  i sat up upon my silken couch  never had i slept upon such a bed before  and the first thing that i saw was goods eyeglass fixed on me from the recesses of his silken couch  there was nothing else of him to be seen except his eyeglass but i knew from the look of it that he was awake and waiting till i woke up to begin  i say quatermain he commenced sure enough did you observe her skin  it is as smooth as the back of an ivory hairbrush  now look here good i remonstrated when there came a sound at the curtain which on being drawn admitted a functionary who signified by signs that he was there to lead us to the bath we gladly consented and were conducted to a delightful marble chamber with a pool of running crystal water in the centre of it into which we gaily plunged  when we had bathed we returned to our apartment and dressed and then went into the central room where we had supped on the previous evening to find a morning meal already prepared for us and a capital meal it was though i should be puzzled to describe the dishes  after breakfast we lounged round and admired the tapestries and carpets and some pieces of statuary that were placed about wondering the while what was going to happen next  indeed by this time our minds were in such a state of complete bewilderment that we were as a matter of fact ready for anything that might arrive  as for our sense of astonishment it was pretty well obliterated  whilst we were still thus engaged our friend the captain of the guard presented himself and with many obeisances signified that we were to follow him which we did not without doubts and heartsearchings  for we guessed that the time had come when we should have to settle the bill for those confounded hippopotami with our coldeyed friend agon the high priest  however there was no help for it and personally i took great comfort in the promise of the protection of the sister queens knowing that if ladies have a will they can generally find a way so off we started as though we liked it  a minutes walk through a passage and an outer court brought us to the great double gates of the palace that open on to the wide highway which runs uphill through the heart of milosis to the temple of the sun a mile away and thence down the slope on the farther side of the temple to the outer wall of the city  these gates are very large and massive and an extraordinarily beautiful work in metal  between them  for one set is placed at the entrance to an interior and one at that of the exterior wall  is a fosse fortyfive feet in width  this fosse is filled with water and spanned by a drawbridge which when lifted makes the palace nearly impregnable to anything except siege guns  as we came one half of the wide gates were flung open and we passed over the drawbridge and presently stood gazing up one of the most imposing if not the most imposing roadways in the world  it is a hundred feet from curb to curb and on either side not cramped and crowded together as is our european fashion but each standing in its own grounds and built equidistant from and in similar style to the rest are a series of splendid singlestoried mansions all of red granite  these are the town houses of the nobles of the court and stretch away in unbroken lines for a mile or more till the eye is arrested by the glorious vision of the temple of the sun that crowns the hill and heads the roadway  as we stood gazing at this splendid sight of which more anon there suddenly dashed up to the gateway four chariots each drawn by two white horses  these chariots are twowheeled and made of wood  they are fitted with a stout pole the weight of which is supported by leathern girths that form a portion of the harness the wheels are made with four spokes only are tired with iron and quite innocent of springs  in the front of the chariot and immediately over the pole is a small seat for the driver railed round to prevent him from being jolted off  inside the machine itself are three low seats one at each side and one with the back to the horses opposite to which is the door the whole vehicle is lightly and yet strongly made and owing to the grace of the curves though primitive not half so ugly as might be expected  but if the chariots left something to be desired the horses did not  they were simply splendid not very large but strongly built and well ribbed up with small heads remarkably large and round hoofs and a great look of speed and blood  i have often wondered whence this breed which presents many distinct characteristics came but like that of its owners it history is obscure  like the people the horses have always been there  the first and last of these chariots were occupied by guards but the centre two were empty except for the driver and to these we were conducted  alphonse and i got into the first and sir henry good and umslopogaas into the one behind and then suddenly off we went  and we did go  among the zuvendi it is not usual to trot horses either riding or driving especially when the journey to be made is a short one  they go at full gallop  as soon as we were seated the driver called out the horses sprang forward and we were whirled away at a speed sufficient to take ones breath and which till i got accustomed to it kept me in momentary fear of an upset  as for the wretched alphonse he clung with a despairing face to the side of what he called this devil of a fiacre thinking that every moment was his last  presently it occurred to him to ask where we were going and i told him that as far as i could ascertain we were going to be sacrificed by burning  you should have seen his face as he grasped the side of the vehicle and cried out in his terror  but the wildlooking charioteer only leant forward over his flying steeds and shouted and the air as it went singing past bore away the sound of alphonses lamentations  and now before us in all its marvellous splendour and dazzling loveliness shone out the temple of the sun  the peculiar pride of the zuvendi to whom it was what solomons or rather herods temple was to the jews  the wealth and skill and labour of generations had been given to the building of this wonderful place which had been only finally completed within the last fifty years  nothing was spared that the country could produce and the result was indeed worthy of the effort not so much on account of its size  for there are larger fanes in the world  as because of its perfect proportions the richness and beauty of its materials and the wonderful workmanship  the building that stands by itself on a space of some eight acres of garden ground on the hilltop around which are the dwellingplaces of the priests is built in the shape of a sunflower with a domecovered central hall from which radiate twelve petalshaped courts each dedicated to one of the twelve months and serving as the repositories of statues reared in memory of the illustrious dead the width of the circle beneath the dome is three hundred feet the height of the dome is four hundred feet and the length of the rays is one hundred and fifty feet and the height of their roofs three hundred feet so that they run into the central dome exactly as the petals of the sunflower run into the great raised heart  thus the exact measurement from the centre of the central altar to the extreme point of any one of the rounded rays would be three hundred feet the width of the circle itself or a total of six hundred feet from the rounded extremity of one ray or petal to the extremity of the opposite one endnote 14  the building itself is of pure and polished white marble which shows out in marvellous contrast to the red granite of the frowning city on whose brow it glistens indeed like an imperial diadem upon the forehead of a dusky queen  the outer surface of the dome and of the twelve petal courts is covered entirely with thin sheets of beaten gold and from the extreme point of the roof of each of these petals a glorious golden form with a trumpet in its hand and widespread wings is figured in the very act of soaring into space  i really must leave whoever reads this to imagine the surpassing beauty of these golden roofs flashing when the sun strikes  flashing like a thousand fires aflame on a mountain of polished marble  so fiercely that the reflection can be clearly seen from the great peaks of the range a hundred miles away  it is a marvellous sight  this golden flower upborne upon the cool white marble walls and i doubt if the world can show such another  what makes the whole effect even more gorgeous is that a belt of a hundred and fifty feet around the marble wall of the temple is planted with an indigenous species of sunflower which were at the time when we first saw them a sheet of golden bloom  the main entrance to this wonderful place is between the two northernmost of the rays or petal courts and is protected first by the usual bronze gates and then by doors made of solid marble beautifully carved with allegorical subjects and overlaid with gold  when these are passed there is only the thickness of the wall which is however twentyfive feet for the zuvendi build for all time and another slight wall also of white marble introduced in order to avoid causing a visible gap in the inner skin of the wall and you stand in the circular hall under the great dome  advancing to the central altar you look upon as beautiful a sight as the imagination of man can conceive  you are in the middle of the holy place and above you the great white marble dome for the inner skin like the outer is of polished marble throughout arches away in graceful curves something like that of st pauls in london only at a slighter angle and from the funnellike opening at the exact apex a bright beam of light pours down upon the golden altar  at the east and the west are other altars and other beams of light stab the sacred twilight to the heart  in every direction white mystic wonderful open out the raylike courts each pierced through by a single arrow of light that serves to illumine its lofty silence and dimly to reveal the monuments of the dead endnote 15  overcome at so aweinspiring a sight the vast loveliness of which thrills the nerves like a glance from beautys eyes you turn to the central golden altar in the midst of which though you cannot see it now there burns a pale but steady flame crowned with curls of faint blue smoke  it is of marble overlaid with pure gold in shape round like the sun four feet in height and thirtysix in circumference  here also hinged to the foundations of the altar are twelve petals of beaten gold  all night and except at one hour all day also these petals are closed over the altar itself exactly as the petals of a waterlily close over the yellow crown in stormy weather but when the sun at midday pierces through the funnel in the dome and lights upon the golden flower the petals open and reveal the hidden mystery only to close again when the ray has passed  nor is this all  standing in semicircles at equal distances from each other on the north and south of the sacred place are ten golden angels or female winged forms exquisitely shaped and draped  these figures which are slightly larger than lifesize stand with bent heads in an attitude of adoration their faces shadowed by their wings and are most imposing and of exceeding beauty  there is but one thing further which calls for description in this altar which is that to the east the flooring in front of it is not of pure white marble as elsewhere throughout the building but of solid brass and this is also the case in front of the other two altars  the eastern and western altars which are semicircular in shape and placed against the wall of the building are much less imposing and are not enfolded in golden petals  they are however also of gold the sacred fire burns on each and a goldenwinged figure stands on either side of them  two great golden rays run up the wall behind them but where the third or middle one should be is an opening in the wall wide on the outside but narrow within like a loophole turned inwards  through the eastern loophole stream the first beams of the rising sun and strike right across the circle touching the folded petals of the great gold flower as they pass till they impinge upon the western altar in the same way at night the last rays of the sinking sun rest for a while on the eastern altar before they die away into darkness it is the promise of the dawn to the evening and the evening to the dawn  with the exception of those three altars and the winged figures about them the whole space beneath the vast white dome is utterly empty and devoid of ornamentation  a circumstance that to my fancy adds greatly to its splendour  such is a brief description of this wonderful and lovely building to the glories of which to my mind so much enhanced by their complete simplicity i only wish i had the power to do justice but i cannot so it is useless talking more about it  but when i compare this great work of genius to some of the tawdry buildings and tinsel ornamentation produced in these latter days by european ecclesiastical architects i feel that even highly civilized art might learn something from the zuvendi masterpieces  i can only say that the exclamation which sprang to my lips as soon as my eyes first became accustomed to the dim light of that glorious building and its white and curving beauties perfect and thrilling as those of a naked goddess grew upon me one by one was well a dog would feel religious here  it is vulgarly put but perhaps it conveys my meaning more clearly than any polished utterance  at the temple gates our party was received by a guard of soldiers who appeared to be under the orders of a priest and by them we were conducted into one of the ray or petal courts as the priests call them and there left for at least halfanhour here we conferred together and realizing that we stood in great danger of our lives determined if any attempt should be made upon us to sell them as dearly as we could  umslopogaas announcing his fixed intention of committing sacrilege on the person of agon the high priest by splitting his head with inkosikaas from where we stood we could perceive that an immense multitude were pouring into the temple evidently in expectation of some unusual event and i could not help fearing that we had to do with it  and here i may explain that every day when the sunlight falls upon the central altar and the trumpets sound a burnt sacrifice is offered to the sun consisting generally of the carcase of a sheep or ox or sometimes of fruit or corn  this event comes off about midday of course not always exactly at that hour but as zuvendis is situated not far from the line although  being so high above the sea it is very temperate  midday and the falling of the sunlight on the altar were generally simultaneous  today the sacrifice was to take place at about eight minutes past twelve  just at twelve oclock a priest appeared and made a sign and the officer of the guard signified to us that we were expected to advance which we did with the best grace that we could muster all except alphonse whose irrepressible teeth instantly began to chatter  in a few seconds we were out of the court and looking at a vast sea of human faces stretching away to the farthest limits of the great circle all straining to catch a glimpse of the mysterious strangers who had committed sacrilege the first strangers mind you who to the knowledge of the multitude had ever set foot in zuvendis since such time that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary  as we appeared there was a murmur through the vast crowd that went echoing away up the great dome and we saw a visible blush of excitement grow on the thousands of faces like a pink light on a stretch of pale cloud and a very curious effect it was on we passed down a lane cut through the heart of the human mass till presently we stood upon the brazen patch of flooring to the east of the central altar and immediately facing it for some thirty feet around the goldenwinged figures the space was roped off and the multitudes stood outside the ropes  within were a circle of whiterobed goldcinctured priests holding long golden trumpets in their hands and immediately in front of us was our friend agon the high priest with his curious cap upon his head  his was the only covered head in that vast assemblage we took our stand upon the brazen space little knowing what was prepared for us beneath but i noticed a curious hissing sound proceeding apparently from the floor for which i could not account  then came a pause and i looked around to see if there was any sign of the two queens nyleptha and sorais but they were not there  to the right of us however was a bare space that i guessed was reserved for them  we waited and presently a faroff trumpet blew apparently high up in the dome  then came another murmur from the multitude and up a long lane leading to the open space to our right we saw the two queens walking side by side  behind them were some nobles of the court among whom i recognized the great lord nasta and behind them again a body of about fifty guards  these last i was very glad to see  presently they had all arrived and taken their stand the two queens in the front the nobles to the right and left and the guards in a double semicircle behind them  then came another silence and nyleptha looked up and caught my eye it seemed to me that there was meaning in her glance and i watched it narrowly  from my eye it travelled down to the brazen flooring on the outer edge of which we stood  then followed a slight and almost imperceptible sidelong movement of the head  i did not understand it and it was repeated then i guessed that she meant us to move back off the brazen floor  one more glance and i was sure of it  there was danger in standing on the floor  sir henry was placed on one side of me umslopogaas on the other  keeping my eyes fixed straight before me i whispered to them first in zulu and then in english to draw slowly back inch by inch till half their feet were resting on the marble flooring where the brass ceased  sir henry whispered on to good and alphonse and slowly very very slowly we shifted backwards so slowly that nobody except nyleptha and sorais who saw everything seemed to notice the movement  then i glanced again at nyleptha and saw that by an almost imperceptible nod she indicated approval  all the while agons eyes were fixed upon the altar before him apparently in an ecstasy of contemplation and mine were fixed upon the small of his back in another sort of ecstasy  suddenly he flung up his long arm and in a solemn and resounding voice commenced a chant of which for convenience sake i append a rough a very rough translation here though of course i did not then comprehend its meaning  it was an invocation to the sun and ran somewhat as follows      there is silence upon the face of the earth and the waters thereof   yea the silence doth brood on the waters like a nesting bird   the silence sleepeth also upon the bosom of the profound darkness   only high up in the great spaces star doth speak unto star   the earth is faint with longing and wet with the tears of her desire   the stargirdled night doth embrace her but she is not comforted   she lies enshrouded in mists like a corpse in the graveclothes   and stretches her pale hands to the east    lo away in the farthest east there is the shadow of a light   the earth seeth and lifts herself  she looks out from beneath   the hollow of her hand   then thy great angels fly forth from the holy place oh sun   they shoot their fiery swords into the darkness and shrivel it up   they climb the heavens and cast down the pale stars from their thrones   yea they hurl the changeful stars back into the womb of the night   they cause the moon to become wan as the face of a dying man   and behold  thy glory comes oh sun    oh thou beautiful one thou drapest thyself in fire   the wide heavens are thy pathway thou rollest oer them as a chariot   the earth is thy bride  thou dost embrace her and   she brings forth children   yea thou favourest her and she yields her increase   thou art the all father and the giver of life oh sun   the young children stretch out their hands and grow in thy brightness   the old men creep forth and seeing remember their strength   only the dead forget thee oh sun    when thou art wroth then thou dost hide thy face   thou drawest around thee a thick curtain of shadows   then the earth grows cold and the heavens are dismayed   they tremble and the sound thereof is the sound of thunder   they weep and their tears are outpoured in the rain   they sigh and the wild winds are the voice of their sighing   the flowers die the fruitful fields languish and turn pale   the old men and the little children go unto their appointed place   when thou withdrawest thy light oh sun    say what art thou oh thou matchless splendour    who set thee on high oh thou flaming terror   when didst thou begin and when is the day of thy ending   thou art the raiment of the living spirit endnote 16   none did place thee on high for thou was the beginning   thou shalt not be ended when thy children are forgotten   nay thou shalt never end for thy hours are eternal   thou sittest on high within thy golden house and   measurest out the centuries   oh father of life oh darkdispelling sun   he ceased this solemn chant which though it seems a poor enough thing after going through my mill is really beautiful and impressive in the original and then after a moments pause he glanced up towards the funnelsloped opening in the dome and added    oh sun descend upon thine altar   as he spoke a wonderful and a beautiful thing happened  down from on high flashed a splendid living ray of light cleaving the twilight like a sword of fire  full upon the closed petals it fell and ran shimmering down their golden sides and then the glorious flower opened as though beneath the bright influence slowly it opened and as the great petals fell wide and revealed the golden altar on which the fire ever burns the priests blew a blast upon the trumpets and from all the people there rose a shout of praise that beat against the domed roof and came echoing down the marble walls  and now the flower altar was open and the sunlight fell full upon the tongue of sacred flame and beat it down so that it wavered sank and vanished into the hollow recesses whence it rose  as it vanished the mellow notes of the trumpets rolled out once more  again the old priest flung up his hands and called aloud    we sacrifice to thee oh sun   once more i caught nylepthas eye it was fixed upon the brazen flooring  look out i said aloud and as i said it i saw agon bend forward and touch something on the altar  as he did so the great white sea of faces around us turned red and then white again and a deep breath went up like a universal sigh nyleptha leant forward and with an involuntary movement covered her eyes with her hand  sorais turned and whispered to the officer of the royal bodyguard and then with a rending sound the whole of the brazen flooring slid from before our feet and there in its place was suddenly revealed a smooth marble shaft terminating in a most awful raging furnace beneath the altar big enough and hot enough to heat the iron sternpost of a manofwar  with a cry of terror we sprang backwards all except the wretched alphonse who was paralysed with fear and would have fallen into the fiery furnace which had been prepared for us had not sir henry caught him in his strong hand as he was vanishing and dragged him back  instantly there arose the most fearful hubbub and we four got back to back alphonse dodging frantically round our little circle in his attempts to take shelter under our legs  we all had our revolvers on  for though we had been politely disarmed of our guns on leaving the palace of course these people did not know what a revolver was  umslopogaas too had his axe of which no effort had been made to deprive him and now he whirled it round his head and sent his piercing zulu warshout echoing up the marble walls in fine defiant fashion  next second the priests baffled of their prey had drawn swords from beneath their white robes and were leaping on us like hounds upon a stag at bay i saw that dangerous as action might be we must act or be lost so as the first man came bounding along  and a great tall fellow he was  i sent a heavy revolver ball through him and down he fell at the mouth of the shaft and slid shrieking frantically into the fiery gulf that had been prepared for us  whether it was his cries or the to them awful sound and effect of the pistol shot or what i know not but the other priests halted paralysed and dismayed and before they could come on again sorais had called out something and we together with the two queens and most of the courtiers were being surrounded with a wall of armed men  in a moment it was done and still the priests hesitated and the people hung in the balance like a herd of startled buck as it were making no sign one way or the other  the last yell of the burning priest had died away the fire had finished him and a great silence fell upon the place  then the high priest agon turned and his face was as the face of a devil  let the sacrifice be sacrificed he cried to the queens  has not sacrilege enough been done by these strangers and would ye as queens throw the cloak of your majesty over evildoers  are not the creatures sacred to the sun dead  and is not a priest of the sun also dead but now slain by the magic of these strangers who come as the winds out of heaven whence we know not and who are what we know not  beware oh queens how ye tamper with the great majesty of the god even before his high altar  there is a power that is more than your power there is a justice that is higher than your justice  beware how ye lift an impious hand against it  let the sacrifice be sacrificed oh queens  then sorais made answer in her deep quiet tones that always seemed to me to have a suspicion of mockery about them however serious the theme oh agon thou hast spoken according to thy desire and thou hast spoken truth  but it is thou who wouldst lift an impious hand against the justice of thy god  bethink thee the midday sacrifice is accomplished the sun hath claimed his priest as a sacrifice  this was a novel idea and the people applauded it  bethink thee what are these men  they are strangers found floating on the bosom of a lake  who brought them here  how came they here  how know you that they also are not servants of the sun is this the hospitality that ye would have our nation show to those whom chance brings to them to throw them to the flames shame on you  shame on you  what is hospitality  to receive the stranger and show him favour  to bind up his wounds and find a pillow for his head and food for him to eat  but thy pillow is the fiery furnace and thy food the hot savour of the flame  shame on thee i say  she paused a little to watch the effect of her speech upon the multitude and seeing that it was favourable changed her tone from one of remonstrance to one of command  ho place there she cried place i say make way for the queens and those whom the queens cover with their kaf mantle  and if i refuse oh queen said agon between his teeth  then will i cut a path with my guards was the proud answer ay even in the presence of thy sanctuary and through the bodies of thy priests  agon turned livid with baffled fury  he glanced at the people as though meditating an appeal to them but saw clearly that their sympathies were all the other way  the zuvendi are a very curious and sociable people and great as was their sense of the enormity that we had committed in shooting the sacred hippopotami they did not like the idea of the only real live strangers they had seen or heard of being consigned to a fiery furnace thereby putting an end for ever to their chance of extracting knowledge and information from and gossiping about us  agon saw this and hesitated and then for the first time nyleptha spoke in her soft sweet voice  bethink thee agon she said as my sister queen has said these men may also be servants of the sun  for themselves they cannot speak for their tongues are tied  let the matter be adjourned till such time as they have learnt our language  who can be condemned without a hearing  when these men can plead for themselves then it will be time to put them to the proof  here was a clever loophole of escape and the vindictive old priest took it little as he liked it  so be it oh queens he said  let the men go in peace and when they have learnt our tongue then let them speak  and i even i will make humble supplication at the altar lest pestilence fall on the land by cause of the sacrilege  these words were received with a murmur of applause and in another minute we were marching out of the temple surrounded by the royal guards  but it was not till long afterwards that we learnt the exact substance of what had passed and how hardly our lives had been wrung out of the cruel grip of the zuvendi priesthood in the face of which even the queens were practically powerless  had it not been for their strenuous efforts to protect us we should have been slain even before we set foot in the temple of the sun  the attempt to drop us bodily into the fiery pit as an offering was a last artifice to attain this end when several others quite unsuspected by us had already failed     chapter xv sorais song    after our escape from agon and his pious crew we returned to our quarters in the palace and had a very good time  the two queens the nobles and the people vied with each other in doing us honour and showering gifts upon us  as for that painful little incident of the hippopotami it sank into oblivion where we were quite content to leave it  every day deputations and individuals waited on us to examine our guns and clothing our chain shirts and our instruments especially our watches with which they were much delighted  in short we became quite the rage so much so that some of the fashionable young swells among the zuvendi began to copy the cut of some of our clothes notably sir henrys shooting jacket  one day indeed a deputation waited on us and as usual good donned his fulldress uniform for the occasion this deputation seemed somehow to be a different class to those who generally came to visit us  they were little insignificant men of an excessively polite not to say servile demeanour and their attention appeared to be chiefly taken up with observing the details of goods fulldress uniform of which they took copious notes and measurements  good was much flattered at the time not suspecting that he had to deal with the six leading tailors of milosis  a fortnight afterwards however when on attending court as usual he had the pleasure of seeing some seven or eight zuvendi mashers arrayed in all the glory of a very fair imitation of his fulldress uniform he changed his mind i shall never forget his face of astonishment and disgust it was after this chiefly to avoid remark and also because our clothes were wearing out and had to be saved up that we resolved to adopt the native dress and a very comfortable one we found it though i am bound to say that i looked sufficiently ridiculous in it and as for alphonse  only umslopogaas would have none of these things when his moocha was worn out the fierce old zulu made him a new one and went about unconcerned as grim and naked as his own battleaxe  meanwhile we pursued our study of the language steadily and made very good progress  on the morning following our adventure in the temple three grave and reverend signiors presented themselves armed with manuscript books inkhorns and feather pens and indicated that they had been sent to teach us  so with the exception of umslopogaas we all buckled to with a will doing four hours a day  as for umslopogaas he would have none of that either  he did not wish to learn that womans talk not he and when one of the teachers advanced on him with a book and an inkhorn and waved them before him in a mild persuasive way much as a churchwarden invitingly shakes the offertory bag under the nose of a rich but niggardly parishioner he sprang up with a fierce oath and flashed inkosikaas before the eyes of our learned friend and there was an end of the attempt to teach him zuvendi  thus we spent our mornings in useful occupation which grew more and more interesting as we proceeded and the afternoons were given up to recreation  sometimes we made trips notably one to the gold mines and another to the marble quarries both of which i wish i had space and time to describe and sometimes we went out hunting buck with dogs trained for that purpose and a very exciting sport it is as the country is full of agricultural enclosures and our horses were magnificent  this is not to be wondered at seeing that the royal stables were at our command in addition to which we had four splendid saddle horses given to us by nyleptha  sometimes again we went hawking a pastime that is in great favour among the zuvendi who generally fly their birds at a species of partridge which is remarkable for the swiftness and strength of its flight  when attacked by the hawk this bird appears to lose its head and instead of seeking cover flies high into the sky thus offering wonderful sport  i have seen one of these partridges soar up almost out of sight when followed by the hawk  still better sport is offered by a variety of solitary snipe as big as a small woodcock which is plentiful in this country and which is flown at with a very small agile and highlytrained hawk with an almost red tail  the zigzagging of the great snipe and the lightning rapidity of the flight and movements of the redtailed hawk make the pastime a delightful one  another variety of the same amusement is the hunting of a very small species of antelope with trained eagles and it certainly is a marvellous sight to see the great bird soar and soar till he is nothing but a black speck in the sunlight and then suddenly come dashing down like a cannonball upon some cowering buck that is hidden in a patch of grass from everything but that piercing eye  still finer is the spectacle when the eagle takes the buck running  on other days we would pay visits to the country seats at some of the great lords beautiful fortified places and the villages clustering beneath their walls  here we saw vineyards and cornfields and wellkept parklike grounds with such timber in them as filled me with delight for i do love a good tree  there it stands so strong and sturdy and yet so beautiful a very type of the best sort of man  how proudly it lifts its bare head to the winter storms and with what a full heart it rejoices when the spring has come again  how grand its voice is too when it talks with the wind a thousand aeolian harps cannot equal the beauty of the sighing of a great tree in leaf  all day it points to the sunshine and all night to the stars and thus passionless and yet full of life it endures through the centuries come storm come shine drawing its sustenance from the cool bosom of its mother earth and as the slow years roll by learning the great mysteries of growth and of decay  and so on and on through generations outliving individuals customs dynasties  all save the landscape it adorns and human nature  till the appointed day when the wind wins the long battle and rejoices over a reclaimed space or decay puts the last stroke to his fungusfingered work  ah one should always think twice before one cuts down a tree  in the evenings it was customary for sir henry good and myself to dine or rather sup with their majesties  not every night indeed but about three or four times a week whenever they had not much company or the affairs of state would allow of it and i am bound to say that those little suppers were quite the most charming things of their sort that i ever had to do with how true is the saying that the very highest in rank are always the most simple and kindly  it is from your halfandhalf sort of people that you get pomposity and vulgarity the difference between the two being very much what one sees every day in england between the old outatelbows brokendown county family and the overbearing purseproud people who come and take the place  i really think that nylepthas greatest charm is her sweet simplicity and her kindly genuine interest even in little things  she is the simplest woman i ever knew and where her passions are not involved one of the sweetest but she can look queenly enough when she likes and be as fierce as any savage too  for instance never shall i forget that scene when i for the first time was sure that she was really in love with curtis it came about in this way  all through goods weakness for ladies society  when we had been employed for some three months in learning zuvendi it struck master good that he was getting rather tired of the old gentlemen who did us the honour to lead us in the way that we should go so he proceeded without saying a word to anybody else to inform them that it was a peculiar fact but that we could not make any real progress in the deeper intricacies of a foreign language unless we were taught by ladies  young ladies he was careful to explain  in his own country he pointed out it was habitual to choose the very bestlooking and most charming girls who could be found to instruct any strangers who happened to come that way etc  all of this the old gentlemen swallowed openmouthed  there was they admitted reason in what he said since the contemplation of the beautiful as their philosophy taught induced a certain porosity of mind similar to that produced upon the physical body by the healthful influences of sun and air  consequently it was probable that we might absorb the zuvendi tongue a little faster if suitable teachers could be found  another thing was that as the female sex was naturally loquacious good practice would be gained in the viva voce department of our studies  to all of this good gravely assented and the learned gentlemen departed assuring him that their orders were to fall in with our wishes in every way and that if possible our views should be met  imagine therefore the surprise and disgust of myself and i trust and believe sir henry when on entering the room where we were accustomed to carry on our studies the following morning we found instead of our usual venerable tutors three of the bestlooking young women whom milosis could produce  and that is saying a good deal  who blushed and smiled and curtseyed and gave us to understand that they were there to carry on our instruction  then good as we gazed at one another in bewilderment thought fit to explain saying that it had slipped his memory before  but the old gentlemen had told him on the previous evening that it was absolutely necessary that our further education should be carried on by the other sex  i was overwhelmed and appealed to sir henry for advice in such a crisis  well he said you see the ladies are here aint they  if we sent them away dont you think it might hurt their feelings eh  one doesnt like to be rough you see and they look regular blues dont they eh  by this time good had already begun his lessons with the handsomest of the three and so with a sigh i yielded  that day everything went very well the young ladies were certainly very clever and they only smiled when we blundered  i never saw good so attentive to his books before and even sir henry appeared to tackle zuvendi with a renewed zest  ah thought i will it always be thus  next day we were much more lively our work was pleasingly interspersed with questions about our native country what the ladies were like there etc all of which we answered as best as we could in zuvendi and i heard good assuring his teacher that her loveliness was to the beauties of europe as the sun to the moon to which she replied with a little toss of the head that she was a plain teaching woman and nothing else and that it was not kind to deceive a poor girl so  then we had a little singing that was really charming so natural and unaffected  the zuvendi lovesongs are most touching  on the third day we were all quite intimate good narrated some of his previous love affairs to his fair teacher and so moved was she that her sighs mingled with his own  i discoursed with mine a merry blueeyed girl upon zuvendian art and never saw that she was waiting for an opportunity to drop a specimen of the cockroach tribe down my back whilst in the corner sir henry and his governess appeared so far as i could judge to be going through a lesson framed on the great educational principles laid down by wackford squeers esq though in a very modified or rather spiritualized form  the lady softly repeated the zuvendi word for hand and he took hers eyes and he gazed deep into her brown orbs lips and  but just at that moment my young lady dropped the cockroach down my back and ran away laughing  now if there is one thing i loathe more than another it is cockroaches and moved quite beyond myself and yet laughing at her impudence i took up the cushion she had been sitting on and threw it after her  imagine then my shame  my horror and my distress  when the door opened and attended by two guards only in walked nyleptha  the cushion could not be recalled it missed the girl and hit one of the guards on the head but i instantly and ineffectually tried to look as though i had not thrown it  good ceased his sighing and began to murder zuvendi at the top of his voice and sir henry whistled and looked silly  as for the poor girls they were utterly dumbfounded  and nyleptha she drew herself up till her frame seemed to tower even above that of the tall guards and her face went first red and then pale as death  guards she said in a quiet choked voice and pointing at the fair but unconscious disciple of wackford squeers slay me that woman  the men hesitated as well they might  will ye do my bidding she said again in the same voice or will ye not  then they advanced upon the girl with uplifted spears by this time sir henry had recovered himself and saw that the comedy was likely to turn into a tragedy  stand back he said in a voice of thunder at the same time getting in front of the terrified girl  shame on thee nyleptha  shame  thou shalt not kill her  doubtless thou hast good reason to try to protect her thou couldst hardly do less in honour answered the infuriated queen but she shall die  she shall die and she stamped her little foot  it is well he answered then will i die with her  i am thy servant oh queen do with me even as thou wilt  and he bowed towards her and fixed his clear eyes contemptuously on her face  i could wish to slay thee too she answered for thou dost make a mock of me and then feeling that she was mastered and i suppose not knowing what else to do she burst into such a storm of tears and looked so royally lovely in her passionate distress that old as i am i must say i envied curtis his task of supporting her  it was rather odd to see him holding her in his arms considering what had just passed  a thought that seemed to occur to herself for presently she wrenched herself free and went leaving us all much disturbed  presently however one of the guards returned with a message to the girls that they were on pain of death to leave the city and return to their homes in the country and that no further harm would come to them and accordingly they went one of them remarking philosophically that it could not be helped and that it was a satisfaction to know that they had taught us a little serviceable zuvendi  mine was an exceedingly nice girl and overlooking the cockroach i made her a present of my favourite lucky sixpence with a hole in it when she went away  after that our former masters resumed their course of instruction needless to say to my great relief  that night when in fear and trembling we attended the royal supper table we found that nyleptha was laid up with a bad headache that headache lasted for three whole days but on the fourth she was present at supper as usual and with the most gracious and sweet smile gave sir henry her hand to lead her to the table no allusion was made to the little affair described above beyond her saying with a charming air of innocence that when she came to see us at our studies the other day she had been seized with a giddiness from which she had only now recovered  she supposed she added with a touch of the humour that was common to her that it was the sight of people working so hard which had affected her  in reply sir henry said dryly that he had thought she did not look quite herself on that day whereat she flashed one of those quick glances of hers at him which if he had the feelings of a man must have gone through him like a knife and the subject dropped entirely  indeed after supper was over nyleptha condescended to put us through an examination to see what we had learnt and to express herself well satisfied with the results  indeed she proceeded to give us especially sir henry a lesson on her own account and very interesting we found it  and all the while that we talked or rather tried to talk and laughed sorais would sit there in her carven ivory chair and look at us and read us all like a book only from time to time saying a few words and smiling that quick ominous smile of hers which was more like a flash of summer lightning on a dark cloud than anything else  and as near to her as he dared would sit good worshipping through his eyeglass for he really was getting seriously devoted to this sombre beauty of whom speaking personally i felt terribly afraid  i watched her keenly and soon i found out that for all her apparent impassibility she was at heart bitterly jealous of nyleptha  another thing i found out and the discovery filled me with dismay and that was that she also was growing devoted to sir henry curtis  of course i could not be sure it is not easy to read so cold and haughty a woman but i noticed one or two little things and as elephant hunters know dried grass shows which way the wind has set  and so another three months passed over us by which time we had all attained to a very considerable mastery of the zuvendi language which is an easy one to learn  and as the time went on we became great favourites with the people and even with the courtiers gaining an enormous reputation for cleverness because as i think i have said sir henry was able to show them how to make glass which was a national want and also by the help of a twentyyear almanac that we had with us to predict various heavenly combinations which were quite unsuspected by the native astronomers  we even succeeded in demonstrating the principle of the steamengine to a gathering of the learned men who were filled with amazement and several other things of the same sort we did  and so it came about that the people made up their minds that we must on no account be allowed to go out of the country which indeed was an apparent impossibility even if we had wished it and we were advanced to great honour and made officers to the bodyguards of the sister queens while permanent quarters were assigned to us in the palace and our opinion was asked upon questions of national policy  but blue as the sky seemed there was a cloud and a big one on the horizon  we had indeed heard no more of those confounded hippopotami but it is not on that account to be supposed that our sacrilege was forgotten or the enmity of the great and powerful priesthood headed by agon appeased  on the contrary it was burning the more fiercely because it was necessarily suppressed and what had perhaps begun in bigotry was ending in downright direct hatred born of jealousy  hitherto the priests had been the wise men of the land and were on this account as well as from superstitious causes looked on with peculiar veneration but our arrival with our outlandish wisdom and our strange inventions and hints of unimagined things dealt a serious blow to this state of affairs and among the educated zuvendi went far towards destroying the priestly prestige  a still worse affront to them however was the favour with which we were regarded and the trust that was reposed in us  all these things tended to make us excessively obnoxious to the great sacerdotal clan the most powerful because the most united faction in the kingdom  another source of imminent danger to us was the rising envy of some of the great lords headed by nasta whose antagonism to us had at best been but thinly veiled and which now threatened to break out into open flame  nasta had for some years been a candidate for nylepthas hand in marriage and when we appeared on the scene i fancy from all i could gather that though there were still many obstacles in his path success was by no means out of his reach  but now all this had changed the coy nyleptha smiled no more in his direction and he was not slow to guess the cause  infuriated and alarmed he turned his attention to sorais only to find that he might as well try to woo a mountain side  with a bitter jest or two about his fickleness that door was closed on him for ever  so nasta bethought himself of the thirty thousand wild swordsmen who would pour down at his bidding through the northern mountain passes and no doubt vowed to adorn the gates of milosis with our heads  but first he determined as i learned to make one more attempt and to demand the hand of nyleptha in the open court after the formal annual ceremony of the signing of the laws that had been proclaimed by the queens during the year  of this astounding fact nyleptha heard with simulated nonchalance and with a little trembling of the voice herself informed us of it as we sat at supper on the night preceding the great ceremony of the lawgiving  sir henry bit his lip and do what he could to prevent it plainly showed his agitation  and what answer will the queen be pleased to give to the great lord asked i in a jesting manner  answer macumazahn for we had elected to pass by our zulu names in zuvendis she said with a pretty shrug of her ivory shoulder  nay i know not what is a poor woman to do when the wooer has thirty thousand swords wherewith to urge his love and from under her long lashes she glanced at curtis  just then we rose from the table to adjourn into another room quatermain a word quick said sir henry to me  listen i have never spoken about it but surely you have guessed i love nyleptha  what am i to do  fortunately i had more or less already taken the question into consideration and was therefore able to give such answer as seemed the wisest to me  you must speak to nyleptha tonight i said  now is your time now or never  listen  in the sittingchamber get near to her and whisper to her to meet you at midnight by the rademas statue at the end of the great hall  i will keep watch for you there now or never curtis  we passed on into the other room  nyleptha was sitting her hands before her and a sad anxious look upon her lovely face a little way off was sorais talking to good in her slow measured tones  the time went on in another quarter of an hour i knew that according to their habit the queens would retire  as yet sir henry had had no chance of saying a word in private indeed though we saw much of the royal sisters it was by no means easy to see them alone  i racked my brains and at last an idea came to me  will the queen be pleased i said bowing low before sorais to sing to her servants  our hearts are heavy this night sing to us oh lady of the night sorais favourite name among the people  my songs macumazahn are not such as to lighten the heavy heart yet will i sing if it pleases thee she answered and she rose and went a few paces to a table whereon lay an instrument not unlike a zither and struck a few wandering chords  then suddenly like the notes of some deepthroated bird her rounded voice rang out in song so wildly sweet and yet with so eerie and sad a refrain that it made the very blood stand still  up up soared the golden notes that seemed to melt far away and then to grow again and travel on laden with all the sorrow of the world and all the despair of the lost  it was a marvellous song but i had not time to listen to it properly however i got the words of it afterwards and here is a translation of its burden so far as it admits of being translated at all     sorais song    as a desolate bird that through darkness its lost way is winging   as a hand that is helplessly raised when deaths sickle is swinging   so is life ay the life that lends passion and breath to my singing    as the nightingales song that is full of a sweetness unspoken   as a spirit unbarring the gates of the skies for a token   so is love ay the love that shall fall when his pinion is broken    as the tramp of the legions when trumpets their challenge are sending   as the shout of the stormgod when lightnings the black sky are rending   so is power ay the power that shall lie in the dust at its ending    so short is our life yet with space for all things to forsake us   a bitter delusion a dream from which nought can awake us   till deaths dogging footsteps at morn or at eve shall oertake us   refrain  oh the world is fair at the dawning  dawning  dawning but the red sun sinks in blood  the red sun sinks in blood   i only wish that i could write down the music too  now curtis now i whispered when she began the second verse and turned my back  nyleptha he said  for my nerves were so much on the stretch that i could hear every word low as it was spoken even through sorais divine notes  nyleptha i must speak with thee this night upon my life i must  say me not nay oh say me not nay  how can i speak with thee she answered looking fixedly before her queens are not like other people  i am surrounded and watched  listen nyleptha thus  i will be before the statue of rademas in the great hall at midnight  i have the countersign and can pass in  macumazahn will be there to keep guard and with him the zulu  oh come my queen deny me not  it is not seemly she murmured and tomorrow   just then the music began to die in the last wail of the refrain and sorais slowly turned her round  i will be there said nyleptha hurriedly on thy life see that thou fail me not     chapter xvi before the statue    it was night  dead night  and the silence lay on the frowning city like a cloud  secretly as evildoers sir henry curtis umslopogaas and myself threaded our way through the passages towards a byentrance to the great throne chamber  once we were met by the fierce rattling challenge of the sentry  i gave the countersign and the man grounded his spear and let us pass  also we were officers of the queens bodyguard and in that capacity had a right to come and go unquestioned  we gained the hall in safety  so empty and so still was it that even when we had passed the sound of our footsteps yet echoed up the lofty walls vibrating faintly and still more faintly against the carven roof like ghosts of the footsteps of dead men haunting the place that once they trod  it was an eerie spot and it oppressed me  the moon was full and threw great pencils and patches of light through the high windowless openings in the walls that lay pure and beautiful upon the blackness of the marble floor like white flowers on a coffin  one of these silver arrows fell upon the statue of the sleeping rademas and of the angel form bent over him illumining it and a small circle round it with a soft clear light reminding me of that with which catholics illumine the altars of their cathedrals  here by the statue we took our stand and waited  sir henry and i close together umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness so that i could only just make out his towering outline leaning on the outline of an axe  so long did we wait that i almost fell asleep resting against the cold marble but was suddenly aroused by hearing curtis give a quick catching breath  then from far away there came a little sound as though the statues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message of the ages  it was the faint sweep of a ladys dress  nearer it grew and nearer yet  we could see a figure steal from patch to patch of moonlight and even hear the soft fall of sandalled feet another second and i saw the black silhouette of the old zulu raise its arm in mute salute and nyleptha was before us  oh how beautiful she looked as she paused a moment just within the circle of the moonlight  her hand was pressed upon her heart and her white bosom heaved beneath it  round her head a broidered scarf was loosely thrown partially shadowing the perfect face and thus rendering it even more lovely for beauty dependent as it is to a certain extent upon the imagination is never so beautiful as when it is half hid  there she stood radiant but half doubting stately and yet so sweet  it was but a moment but i then and there fell in love with her myself and have remained so to this hour for indeed she looked more like an angel out of heaven than a loving passionate mortal woman  low we bowed before her and then she spoke  i have come she whispered but it was at great risk  ye know not how i am watched  the priests watch me  sorais watches me with those great eyes of hers  my very guards are spies upon me  nasta watches me too  oh let him be careful and she stamped her foot  let him be careful i am a woman and therefore hard to drive  ay and i am a queen too and can still avenge let him be careful i say lest in place of giving him my hand i take his head and she ended the outburst with a little sob and then smiled up at us bewitchingly and laughed  thou didst bid me come hither my lord incubu curtis had taught her to call him so  doubtless it is about business of the state for i know that thou art ever full of great ideas and plans for my welfare and my peoples  so even as a queen should i have come though i greatly fear the dark alone and again she laughed and gave him a glance from her grey eyes  at this point i thought it wise to move a little since secrets of the state should not be made public property but she would not let me go far peremptorily stopping me within five yards or so saying that she feared surprise  so it came to pass that however unwillingly i heard all that passed  thou knowest nyleptha said sir henry that it was for none of these things that i asked thee to meet me at this lonely place nyleptha waste not the time in pleasantry but listen to me for  i love thee  as he said the words i saw her face break up as it were and change  the coquetry went out of it and in its place there shone a great light of love which seemed to glorify it and make it like that of the marble angel overhead  i could not help thinking that it must have been a touch of prophetic instinct which made the long dead rademas limn in the features of the angel of his inspiring vision so strange a likeness of his own descendant  sir henry also must have observed and been struck by the likeness for catching the look upon nylepthas face he glanced quickly from it to the moonlit statue and then back again at his beloved  thou sayest thou dost love me she said in a low voice and thy voice rings true but how am i to know that thou dost speak the truth  though she went on with proud humility and in the stately third person which is so largely used by the zuvendi i be as nothing in the eyes of my lord and she curtseyed towards him who comes from among a wonderful people to whom my people are but children yet here am i a queen and a leader of men and if i would go to battle a hundred thousand spears shall sparkle in my train like stars glimmering down the path of the bent moon and although my beauty be a little thing in the eyes of my lord and she lifted her broidered skirt and curtseyed again yet here among my own people am i held right fair and ever since i was a woman the great lords of my kingdom have made quarrel concerning me as though forsooth she added with a flash of passion i were a deer to be pulled down by the hungriest wolf or a horse to be sold to the highest bidder  let my lord pardon me if i weary my lord but it hath pleased my lord to say that he loves me nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi and therefore would i say that though my love and my hand be not much to my lord yet to me are they all  oh she cried with a sudden and thrilling change of voice and modifying her dignified mode of address  oh how can i know that thou lovest but me  how can i know that thou wilt not weary of me and seek thine own place again leaving me desolate who is there to tell me but that thou lovest some other woman some fair woman unknown to me but who yet draws breath beneath this same moon that shines on me tonight  tell me how am i to know  and she clasped her hands and stretched them out towards him and looked appealingly into his face  nyleptha answered sir henry adopting the zuvendi way of speech i have told thee that i love thee how am i to tell thee how much i love thee  is there then a measure for love yet will i try  i say not that i have never looked upon another woman with favour but this i say that i love thee with all my life and with all my strength that i love thee now and shall love thee till i grow cold in death ay and as i believe beyond my death and on and on for ever i say that thy voice is music to my ear and thy touch as water to a thirsty land that when thou art there the world is beautiful and when i see thee not it is as though the light was dead  oh nyleptha i will never leave thee here and now for thy dear sake i will forget my people and my fathers house yea i renounce them all  by thy side will i live nyleptha and at thy side will i die  he paused and gazed at her earnestly but she hung her head like a lily and said never a word  look he went on pointing to the statue on which the moonlight played so brightly  thou seest that angel woman who rests her hand upon the forehead of the sleeping man and thou seest how at her touch his soul flames up and shines out through his flesh even as a lamp at the touch of the fire so is it with me and thee nyleptha  thou hast awakened my soul and called it forth and now nyleptha it is not mine not mine but thine and thine only  there is no more for me to say in thy hands is my life and he leaned back against the pedestal of the statue looking very pale and his eyes shining but proud and handsome as a god  slowly slowly she raised her head and fixed her wonderful eyes all alight with the greatness of her passion full upon his face as though to read his very soul  then at last she spoke low indeed but clearly as a silver bell  of a truth weak woman that i am i do believe thee  ill will be the day for thee and for me also if it be my fate to learn that i have believed a lie  and now hearken to me oh man who hath wandered here from far to steal my heart and make me all thine own  i put my hand upon thy hand thus and thus i whose lips have never kissed before do kiss thee on the brow and now by my hand and by that first and holy kiss ay by my peoples weal and by my throne that like enough i shall lose for thee  by the name of my high house by the sacred stone and by the eternal majesty of the sun i swear that for thee will i live and die  and i swear that i will love thee and thee only till death ay and beyond if as thou sayest there be a beyond and that thy will shall be my will and thy ways my ways  oh see see my lord thou knowest not how humble is she who loves i who am a queen i kneel before thee even at thy feet i do my homage and the lovely impassioned creature flung herself down on her knees on the cold marble before him  and after that i really do not know for i could stand it no longer and cleared off to refresh myself with a little of old umslopogaas society leaving them to settle it their own way and a very long time they were about it  i found the old warrior leaning on inkosikaas as usual and surveying the scene in the patch of moonlight with a grim smile of amusement  ah macumazahn he said i suppose it is because i am getting old but i dont think that i shall ever learn to understand the ways of you white people  look there now i pray thee they are a pretty pair of doves but what is all the fuss about macumazahn he wants a wife and she wants a husband then why does he not pay his cows down endnote 17 like a man and have done with it  it would save a deal of trouble and we should have had our nights sleep  but there they go talk talk talk and kiss kiss kiss like mad things  eugh  some threequarters of an hour afterwards the pair of doves came strolling towards us curtis looking slightly silly and nyleptha remarking calmly that the moonlight made very pretty effects on the marble  then for she was in a most gracious mood she took my hand and said that i was her lords dear friend and therefore most dear to her  not a word for my own sake you see  next she lifted umslopogaas axe and examined it curiously saying significantly as she did so that he might soon have cause to use it in defence of her  after that she nodded prettily to us all and casting a tender glance at her lover glided off into the darkness like a beautiful vision  when we got back to our quarters which we did without accident curtis asked me jocularly what i was thinking about  i am wondering i answered on what principle it is arranged that some people should find beautiful queens to fall in love with them while others find nobody at all or worse than nobody and i am also wondering how many brave mens lives this nights work will cost  it was rather nasty of me perhaps but somehow all the feelings do not evaporate with age and i could not help being a little jealous of my old friends luck  vanity my sons vanity of vanities  on the following morning good was informed of the happy occurrence and positively rippled with smiles that originating somewhere about the mouth slowly travelled up his face like the rings in a duckpond till they flowed over the brim of his eyeglass and went where sweet smiles go  the fact of the matter however was that not only was good rejoiced about the thing on its own merits but also for personal reasons  he adored sorais quite as earnestly as sir henry adored nyleptha and his adoration had not altogether prospered  indeed it had seemed to him and to me also that the dark cleopatralike queen favoured curtis in her own curious inscrutable way much more than good  therefore it was a relief to him to learn that his unconscious rival was permanently and satisfactorily attached in another direction his face fell a little however when he was told that the whole thing was to be kept as secret as the dead above all from sorais for the present inasmuch as the political convulsion which would follow such an announcement at the moment would be altogether too great to face and would very possibly if prematurely made shake nyleptha from her throne  that morning we again attended in the throne hall and i could not help smiling to myself when i compared the visit to our last and reflecting that if walls could speak they would have strange tales to tell  what actresses women are  there high upon her golden throne draped in her blazoned kaf or robe of state sat the fair nyleptha and when sir henry came in a little late dressed in the full uniform of an officer of her guard and humbly bent himself before her she merely acknowledged his salute with a careless nod and turned her head coldly aside  it was a very large court for not only did the signing of the laws attract many outside of those whose duty it was to attend but also the rumour that nasta was going to publicly ask the hand of nyleptha in marriage had gone abroad with the result that the great hall was crowded to its utmost capacity  there were our friends the priests in force headed by agon who regarded us with a vindictive eye and a most imposing band they were with their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden chain from which hung the fishlike scales  there too were a number of the lords each with a band of brilliantly attired attendants and prominent among them was nasta stroking his black beard meditatively and looking unusually pleasant  it was a splendid and impressive sight especially when the officer after having read out each law handed them to the queens to sign whereon the trumpets blared out and the queens guard grounded their spears with a crash in salute this reading and signing of the laws took a long time but at length it came to an end the last one reciting that whereas distinguished strangers etc and proceeding to confer on the three of us the rank of lords together with certain military commands and large estates bestowed by the queen  when it was read the trumpets blared and the spears clashed down as usual but i saw some of the lords turn and whisper to each other while nasta ground his teeth  they did not like the favour that was shown to us which under all the circumstances was not perhaps unnatural  then there came a pause and nasta stepped forward and bowing humbly though with no humility in his eye craved a boon at the hands of the queen nyleptha  nyleptha turned a little pale but bowed graciously and prayed the wellbeloved lord to speak on whereon in a few straightforward soldierlike words he asked her hand in marriage  then before she could find words to answer the high priest agon took up the tale and in a speech of real eloquence and power pointed out the many advantages of the proposed alliance how it would consolidate the kingdom for nastas dominions of which he was virtually king were to zuvendis much what scotland used to be to england how it would gratify the wild mountaineers and be popular among the soldiery for nasta was a famous general how it would set her dynasty firmly on the throne and would gain the blessing and approval of the sun ie of the office of the high priest and so on  many of his arguments were undoubtedly valid and there was looking at it from a political point of view everything to be said for the marriage  but unfortunately it is difficult to play the game of politics with the persons of young and lovely queens as though they were ivory effigies of themselves on a chessboard  nylepthas face while agon spouted away was a perfect study she smiled indeed but beneath the smile it set like a stone and her eyes began to flash ominously  at last he stopped and she prepared herself to answer  before she did so however sorais leant towards her and said in a voice sufficiently loud for me to catch what she said bethink thee well my sister ere thou dost speak for methinks that our thrones may hang upon thy words  nyleptha made no answer and with a shrug and a smile sorais leant back again and listened  of a truth a great honour has been done to me she said that my poor hand should not only have been asked in marriage but that agon here should be so swift to pronounce the blessing of the sun upon my union  methinks that in another minute he would have wed us fast ere the bride had said her say  nasta i thank thee and i will bethink me of thy words but now as yet i have no mind for marriage that is a cup of which none know the taste until they begin to drink it  again i thank thee nasta and she made as though she would rise  the great lords face turned almost as black as his beard with fury for he knew that the words amounted to a final refusal of his suit  thanks be to the queen for her gracious words he said restraining himself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful my heart shall surely treasure them  and now i crave another boon namely the royal leave to withdraw myself to my own poor cities in the north till such time as the queen shall say my suit nay or yea  mayhap he added with a sneer the queen will be pleased to visit me there and to bring with her these stranger lords and he scowled darkly towards us  it is but a poor country and a rough but we are a hardy race of mountaineers and there shall be gathered thirty thousand swordsmen to shout a welcome to her  this speech which was almost a declaration of rebellion was received in complete silence but nyleptha flushed up and answered it with spirit  oh surely nasta i will come and the strange lords in my train and for every man of thy mountaineers who calls thee prince will i bring two from the lowlands who call me queen and we will see which is the staunchest breed  till then farewell  the trumpets blared out the queens rose and the great assembly broke up in murmuring confusion and for myself i went home with a heavy heart foreseeing civil war  after this there was quiet for a few weeks  curtis and the queen did not often meet and exercised the utmost caution not to allow the true relation in which they stood to each other to leak out but do what they would rumours as hard to trace as a buzzing fly in a dark room and yet quite as audible began to hum round and round and at last to settle on her throne     chapter xvii the storm breaks    and now it was that the trouble which at first had been but a cloud as large as a mans hand began to loom very black and big upon our horizon namely sorais preference for sir henry i saw the storm drawing nearer and nearer and so poor fellow did he  the affection of so lovely and highlyplaced a woman was not a thing that could in a general way be considered a calamity by any man but situated as curtis was it was a grievous burden to bear  to begin with nyleptha though altogether charming was it must be admitted of a rather jealous disposition and was sometimes apt to visit on her lovers head her indignation at the marks of what alphonse would have called the distinguished consideration with which her royal sister favoured him  then the enforced secrecy of his relation to nyleptha prevented curtis from taking some opportunity of putting a stop or trying to put a stop to this false condition of affairs by telling sorais in a casual but confidential way that he was going to marry her sister a third sting in sir henrys honey was that he knew that good was honestly and sincerely attached to the ominouslooking but most attractive lady of the night  indeed poor bougwan was wasting himself to a shadow of his fat and jolly self about her his face getting so thin that his eyeglass would scarcely stick in it while she with a sort of careless coquetry just gave him encouragement enough to keep him going thinking no doubt that he might be useful as a stalkinghorse  i tried to give him a hint in as delicate a way as i could but he flew into a huff and would not listen to me so i was determined to let ill along for fear of making it worse  poor good he really was very ludicrous in his distress and went in for all sorts of absurdities under the belief that he was advancing his suit one of them was the writing  with the assistance of one of the grave and revered signiors who instructed us and who whatever may have been the measure of his erudition did not understand how to scan a line  of a most interminable zuvendi lovesong of which the continually recurring refrain was something about i will kiss thee oh yes i will kiss thee  now among the zuvendi it is a common and most harmless thing for young men to serenade ladies at night as i believe they do in the southern countries of europe and sing all sorts of nonsensical songs to them  the young men may or may not be serious but no offence is meant and none is taken even by ladies of the highest rank who accept the whole thing as an english girl would a gracefullyturned compliment  availing himself of this custom good bethought him that would serenade sorais whose private apartments together with those of her maidens were exactly opposite our own on the further side of a narrow courtyard which divided one section of the great palace from another  accordingly having armed himself with a native zither on which being an adept with the light guitar he had easily learned to strum he proceeded at midnight  the fashionable hour for this sort of caterwauling  to make night hideous with his amorous yells  i was fast asleep when they began but they soon woke me up  for good possesses a tremendous voice and has no notion of time  and i ran to my windowplace to see what was the matter  and there standing in the full moonlight in the courtyard i perceived good adorned with an enormous ostrich feather headdress and a flowing silken cloak which it is the right thing to wear upon these occasions and shouting out the abominable song which he and the old gentleman had evolved to a jerky jingling accompaniment  from the direction of the quarters of the maids of honour came a succession of faint sniggerings but the apartments of sorais herself  whom i devoutly pitied if she happened to be there  were silent as the grave there was absolutely no end to that awful song with its eternal i will kiss thee and at last neither i nor sir henry whom i had summoned to enjoy the sight could stand it any longer so remembering the dear old story i put my head to the window opening and shouted for heavens sake good dont go on talking about it but kiss her and lets all go to sleep  that choked him off and we had no more serenading  the whole thing formed a laughable incident in a tragic business how deeply thankful we ought to be that even the most serious matters have generally a silver lining about them in the shape of a joke if only people could see it  the sense of humour is a very valuable possession in life and ought to be cultivated in the board schools  especially in scotland  well the more sir henry held off the more sorais came on as is not uncommon in such cases till at last things got very queer indeed  evidently she was by some strange perversity of mind quite blinded to the true state of the case and i for one greatly dreaded the moment of her awakening  sorais was a dangerous woman to be mixed up with either with or without ones consent at last the evil moment came as i saw it must come  one fine day good having gone out hawking sir henry and i were sitting quietly talking over the situation especially with reference to sorais when a court messenger arrived with a written note which we with some difficulty deciphered and which was to the effect that the queen sorais commanded the attendance of the lord incubu in her private apartments whither he would be conducted by the bearer  oh my word groaned sir henry  cant you go instead old fellow  not if i know it i said with vigour  i had rather face a wounded elephant with a shotgun  take care of your own business my boy  if you will be so fascinating you must take the consequences i would not be in your place for an empire  you remind me of when i was going to be flogged at school and the other boys came to console me he said gloomily  what right has this queen to command my attendance i should like to know  i wont go  but you must you are one of her officers and bound to obey her and she knows it  and after all it will soon be over  thats just what they used to say he said again  i only hope she wont put a knife into me  i believe that she is quite capable of it  and off he started very faintheartedly and no wonder  i sat and waited and at the end of about fortyfive minutes he returned looking a good deal worse than when he went  give me something to drink he said hoarsely  i got him a cup of wine and asked what was the matter  what is the matter  why if ever there was trouble theres trouble now  you know when i left you  well i was shown straight into sorais private chamber and a wonderful place it is and there she sat quite alone upon a silken couch at the end of the room playing gently upon that zither of hers  i stood before her and for a while she took no notice of me but kept on playing and singing a little and very sweet music it was  at last she looked up and smiled  so thou art come she said  i thought perchance thou hadst gone about the queen nylepthas business  thou art ever on her business and i doubt not a good servant and a true  to this i merely bowed and said i was there to receive the queens word  ah yes i would talk with thee but be thou seated  it wearies me to look so high and she made room for me beside her on the couch placing herself with her back against the end so as to have a view of my face  it is not meet i said that i should make myself equal with the queen  i said be seated was her answer so i sat down and she began to look at me with those dark eyes of hers  there she sat like an incarnate spirit of beauty hardly talking at all and when she did very low but all the while looking at me  there was a white flower in her black hair and i tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals but it was of no use  at last whether it was her gaze or the perfume in her hair or what i do not know but i almost felt as though i was being mesmerized  at last she roused herself  incubu she said lovest thou power  i replied that i supposed all men loved power of one sort or another  thou shalt have it she said  lovest thou wealth  i said i liked wealth for what it brought  thou shalt have it she said  and lovest thou beauty  to this i replied that i was very fond of statuary and architecture or something silly of that sort at which she frowned and there was a pause  by this time my nerves were on such a stretch that i was shaking like a leaf  i knew that something awful was going to happen but she held me under a kind of spell and i could not help myself  incubu she said at length wouldst thou be a king  listen wouldst thou be a king  behold stranger i am minded to make thee king of all zuvendis ay and husband of sorais of the night nay peace and hear me  to no man among my people had i thus opened out my secret heart but thou art an outlander and therefore i speak without shame knowing all i have to offer and how hard it had been thee to ask  see a crown lies at thy feet my lord incubu and with that fortune a woman whom some have wished to woo  now mayst thou answer oh my chosen and soft shall thy words fall upon mine ears  oh sorais i said i pray thee speak not thus  you see i had not time to pick and choose my words  for this thing cannot be  i am betrothed to thy sister nyleptha oh sorais and i love her and her alone  next moment it struck me that i had said an awful thing and i looked up to see the results  when i spoke sorais face was hidden in her hands and as my words reached her she slowly raised it and i shrank back dismayed  it was ashy white and her eyes were flaming  she rose to her feet and seemed to be choking but the awful thing was that she was so quiet about it all once she looked at a side table on which lay a dagger and from it to me as though she thought of killing me but she did not take it up  at last she spoke one word and one only   go  and i went and glad enough i was to get out of it and here i am  give me another cup of wine theres a good fellow and tell me what is to be done  i shook my head for the affair was indeed serious  as one of the poets says   hell hath no fury like a woman scorned   more especially if the woman is a queen and a sorais and indeed i feared the very worst including imminent danger to ourselves  nyleptha had better be told of this at once i said and perhaps i had better tell her she might receive your account with suspicion  who is captain of her guard tonight i went on  good  very well then there will be no chance of her being got at dont look surprised  i dont think that her sister would stick at that  i suppose one must tell good of what has happened  oh i dont know said sir henry  it would hurt his feelings poor fellow  you see he takes a lively personal interest in sorais  thats true and after all perhaps there is no need to tell him he will find out the truth soon enough  now you mark my words sorais will throw in her lot with nasta who is sulking up in the north there and there will be such a war as has not been known in zuvendis for centuries  look there and i pointed to two court messengers who were speeding away from the door of sorais private apartments  now follow me and i ran up a stairway into an outlook tower that rose from the roof of our quarters taking the spyglass with me and looked out over the palace wall  the first thing we saw was one of the messengers speeding towards the temple bearing without any doubt the queens word to the high priest agon but for the other i searched in vain  presently however i spied a horseman riding furiously through the northern gate of the city and in him i recognized the other messenger  ah i said sorais is a woman of spirit  she is acting at once and will strike quick and hard  you have insulted her my boy and the blood will flow in rivers before the stain is washed away and yours with it if she can get hold of you well im off to nyleptha  just you stop where you are old fellow and try to get your nerves straight again  youll need them all i can tell you unless i have observed human nature in the rough for fifty years for nothing  and off i went accordingly  i gained audience of the queen without trouble  she was expecting curtis and was not best pleased to see my mahoganycoloured face instead  is there aught wrong with my lord macumazahn that he waits not upon me  say is he sick  i said that he was well enough and then without further ado i plunged into my story and told it from beginning to end  oh what a rage she flew into  it was a sight to see her she looked so lovely  how darest thou come to me with such a tale she cried  it is a lie to say that my lord was making love to sorais my sister  pardon me oh queen i answered i said that sorais was making love to thy lord  spin me no spiders webs of words  is not the thing the same thing  the one giveth the other taketh but the gift passes and what matters it which is the most guilty  sorais oh i hate her  sorais is a queen and my sister  she had not stooped so low had he not shown the way  oh truly hath the poet said that man is like a snake whom to touch is poison and whom none can hold  the remark oh queen is excellent but methinks thou hast misread the poet  nyleptha i went on thou knowest well that thy words are empty foolishness and that this is no time for folly  how darest thou she broke in stamping her foot  hast my false lord sent thee to me to insult me also  who art thou stranger that thou shouldst speak to me the queen after this sort  how darest thou  yea i dare  listen  the moments which thou dost waste in idle anger may well cost thee thy crown and all of us our lives already sorais horsemen go forth and call to arms  in three days time nasta will rouse himself in his fastnesses like a lion in the evening and his growling will be heard throughout the north  the lady of the night sorais hath a sweet voice and she will not sing in vain  her banner will be borne from range to range and valley to valley and warriors will spring up in its track like dust beneath a whirlwind half the army will echo her warcry and in every town and hamlet of this wide land the priests will call out against the foreigner and will preach her cause as holy  i have spoken oh queen  nyleptha was quite calm now her jealous anger had passed and putting off the character of a lovely headstrong lady with a rapidity and completeness that distinguished her she put on that of a queen and a woman of business  the transformation was sudden but entire  thy words are very wise macumazahn  forgive me my folly ah what a queen i should be if only i had no heart  to be heartless  that is to conquer all  passion is like the lightning it is beautiful and it links the earth to heaven but alas it blinds  and thou thinkest that my sister sorais would levy war upon me  so be it  she shall not prevail against me  i too have my friends and my retainers  there are many i say who will shout nyleptha when my pennon runs up on peak and pinnacle and the light of my beacon fires leaps tonight from crag to crag bearing the message of my war  i will break her strength and scatter her armies  eternal night shall be the portion of sorais of the night  give me that parchment and the ink  so now summon the officer in the anteroom  he is a trusty man  i did as i was bid and the man a veteran and quietlooking gentleman of the guard named kara entered bowing low  take this parchment said nyleptha it is thy warrant and guard every place of in and outgoing in the apartments of my sister sorais the lady of the night and a queen of the zuvendi let none come in and none go out or thy life shall pay the cost  the man looked startled but he merely said the queens word be done and departed  then nyleptha sent a messenger to sir henry and presently he arrived looking uncommonly uncomfortable i thought that another outburst was about to follow but wonderful are the ways of woman she said not a word about sorais and his supposed inconstancy greeting him with a friendly nod and stating simply that she required his advice upon high matters  all the same there was a look in her eye and a sort of suppressed energy in her manner towards him that makes me think that she had not forgotten the affair but was keeping it for a private occasion  just after curtis arrived the officer returned and reported that sorais was gone  the bird had flown to the temple stating that she was going as was sometimes the custom among zuvendi ladies of rank to spend the night in meditation before the altar we looked at each other significantly  the blow had fallen very soon  then we set to work  generals who could be trusted were summoned from their quarters and as much of the state affairs as was thought desirable was told to each strict injunctions being given to them to get all their available force together  the same was done with such of the more powerful lords as nyleptha knew she could rely on several of whom left that very day for distant parts of the country to gather up their tribesmen and retainers  sealed orders were dispatched to the rulers of faroff cities and some twenty messengers were sent off before nightfall with instructions to ride early and late till they reached the distant chiefs to whom their letters were addressed also many spies were set to work  all the afternoon and evening we laboured assisted by some confidential scribes nyleptha showing an energy and resource of mind that astonished me and it was eight oclock before we got back to our quarters here we heard from alphonse who was deeply aggrieved because our nonreturn had spoilt his dinner for he had turned cook again now that good had come back from his hawking and gone on duty  as instructions had already been given to the officer of the outer guard to double the sentries at the gate and as we had no reason to fear any immediate danger we did not think it worth while to hunt him up and tell him anything of what had passed which at best was under the peculiar circumstances of the case one of those tasks that one prefers to postpone so after swallowing our food we turned in to get some muchneeded rest  before we did so however it occurred to curtis to tell old umslopogaas to keep a lookout in the neighbourhood of nylepthas private apartments  umslopogaas was now well known about the place and by the queens order allowed to pass whither he would by the guards a permission of which he often availed himself by roaming about the palace during the still hours in a nocturnal fashion that he favoured and which is by no means uncommon amongst black men generally  his presence in the corridors would not therefore be likely to excite remark  without any comment the zulu took up his axe and departed and we also departed to bed  i seemed to have been asleep but a few minutes when i was awakened by a peculiar sensation of uneasiness  i felt that somebody was in the room and looking at me and instantly sat up to see to my surprise that it was already dawn and that there standing at the foot of my couch and looking peculiarly grim and gaunt in the grey light was umslopogaas himself  how long hast thou been there i asked testily for it is not pleasant to be aroused in such a fashion  mayhap the half of an hour macumazahn  i have a word for thee  speak on i said now wide enough awake  as i was bid i went last night to the place of the white queen and hid myself behind a pillar in the second anteroom beyond which is the sleepingplace of the queen  bougwan good was in the first anteroom alone and outside the curtain of that room was a sentry but i had a mind to see if i could pass in unseen and i did gliding behind them both  there i waited for many hours when suddenly i perceived a dark figure coming secretly towards me  it was the figure of a woman and in her hand she held a dagger  behind that figure crept another unseen by the woman  it was bougwan following in her tracks  his shoes were off and for so fat a man he followed very well  the woman passed me and the starlight shone upon her face  who was it i asked impatiently  the face was the face of the lady of the night and of a truth she is well named  i waited and bougwan passed me also  then i followed so we went slowly and without a sound up the long chamber first the woman then bougwan and then i and the woman saw not bougwan and bougwan saw not me  at last the lady of the night came to the curtains that shut off the sleeping place of the white queen and put out her left hand to part them she passed through and so did bougwan and so did i  at the far end of the room is the bed of the queen and on it she lay very fast asleep  i could hear her breathe and see one white arm lying on the coverlid like a streak of snow on the dry grass the lady of the night doubled herself thus and with the long knife lifted crept towards the bed  so straight did she gaze thereat that she never thought to look behind her  when she was quite close bougwan touched her on the arm and she caught her breath and turned and i saw the knife flash and heard it strike  well was it for bougwan that he had the skin of iron on him or he had been pierced  then for the first time he saw who the woman was and without a word he fell back astonished and unable to speak  she too was astonished and spoke not but suddenly she laid her finger on her lip thus and walked towards and through the curtain and with her went bougwan so close did she pass to me that her dress touched me and i was nigh to slaying her as she went  in the first outer room she spoke to bougwan in a whisper and clasping her hands thus she pleaded with him but what she said i know not  and so they passed on to the second outer room she pleading and he shaking his head and saying nay nay nay  and it seemed to me that he was about to call the guard when she stopped talking and looked at him with great eyes and i saw that he was bewitched by her beauty  then she stretched out her hand and he kissed it whereon i gathered myself together to advance and take her seeing that now had bougwan become a woman and no longer knew the good from the evil when behold she was gone  gone i ejaculated  ay gone and there stood bougwan staring at the wall like one asleep and presently he went too and i waited a while and came away also  art thou sure umslopogaas said i that thou hast not been a dreamer this night  in reply he opened his left hand and produced about three inches of a blade of a dagger of the finest steel  if i be macumazahn behold what the dream left with me  the knife broke upon bougwans bosom and as i passed i picked this up in the sleepingplace of the white queen     chapter xviii war  red war    telling umslopogaas to wait i tumbled into my clothes and went off with him to sir henrys room where the zulu repeated his story word for word  it was a sight to watch curtis face as he heard it  great heavens he said here have i been sleeping away while nyleptha was nearly murdered  and all through me too  what a fiend that sorais must be  it would have served her well if umslopogaas had cut her down in the act  ay said the zulu  fear not i should have slain her ere she struck  i was but waiting the moment  i said nothing but i could not help thinking that many a thousand doomed lives would have been saved if he had meted out to sorais the fate she meant for her sister  and as the issue proved i was right  after he had told his tale umslopogaas went off unconcernedly to get his morning meal and sir henry and i fell to talking  at first he was very bitter against good who he said was no longer to be trusted having designedly allowed sorais to escape by some secret stair when it was his duty to have handed her over to justice  indeed he spoke in the most unmeasured terms on the matter  i let him run on awhile reflecting to myself how easy we find it to be hard on the weaknesses of others and how tender we are to our own  really my dear fellow i said at length one would never think to hear you talk that you were the man who had an interview with this same lady yesterday and found it rather difficult to resist her fascinations notwithstanding your ties to one of the loveliest and most loving women in the world  now suppose it was nyleptha who had tried to murder sorais and you had caught her and she had pleaded with you would you have been so very eager to hand her over to an open shame and to death by fire  just look at the matter through goods eyeglass for a minute before you denounce an old friend as a scoundrel  he listened to this jobation submissively and then frankly acknowledged that he had spoken hardly  it is one of the best points in sir henrys character that he is always ready to admit it when he is in the wrong  but though i spoke up thus for good i was not blind to the fact that however natural his behaviour might be it was obvious that he was being involved in a very awkward and disgraceful complication  a foul and wicked murder had been attempted and he had let the murderess escape and thereby among other things allowed her to gain a complete ascendency over himself  in fact he was in a fair way to become her tool  and no more dreadful fate can befall a man than to become the tool of an unscrupulous woman or indeed of any woman  there is but one end to it when he is broken or has served her purpose he is thrown away  turned out on the world to hunt for his lost selfrespect  whilst i was pondering thus and wondering what was to be done  for the whole subject was a thorny one  i suddenly heard a great clamour in the courtyard outside and distinguished the voice of umslopogaas and alphonse the former cursing furiously and the latter yelling in terror  hurrying out to see what was the matter i was met by a ludicrous sight  the little frenchman was running up the courtyard at an extraordinary speed and after him sped umslopogaas like a great greyhound  just as i came out he caught him and lifting him right off his legs carried him some paces to a beautiful but very dense flowering shrub which bore a flower not unlike the gardenia but was covered with short thorns  next despite his howls and struggles he with one mighty thrust plunged poor alphonse head first into the bush so that nothing but the calves of his legs and heels remained in evidence  then satisfied with what he had done the zulu folded his arms and stood grimly contemplating the frenchmans kicks and listening to his yells which were awful  what art thou doing i said running up  wouldst thou kill the man  pull him out of the bush  with a savage grunt he obeyed seizing the wretched alphonse by the ankle and with a jerk that must have nearly dislocated it tearing him out of the heart of the shrub  never did i see such a sight as he presented his clothes half torn off his back and bleeding as he was in every direction from the sharp thorns there he lay and yelled and rolled and there was no getting anything out of him  at last however he got up and ensconcing himself behind me cursed old umslopogaas by every saint in the calendar vowing by the blood of his heroic grandfather that he would poison him and have his revenge  at last i got to the truth of the matter  it appeared that alphonse habitually cooked umslopogaass porridge which the latter ate for breakfast in the corner of the courtyard just as he would have done at home in zululand from a gourd and with a wooden spoon  now umslopogaas had like many zulus a great horror of fish which he considered a species of watersnake so alphonse who was as fond of playing tricks as a monkey and who was also a consummate cook determined to make him eat some  accordingly he grated up a quantity of white fish very finely and mixed it with the zulus porridge who swallowed it nearly all down in ignorance of what he was eating  but unfortunately for alphonse he could not restrain his joy at this sight and came capering and peering round till at last umslopogaas who was very clever in his way suspected something and after a careful examination of the remains of his porridge discovered the buffalo heifers trick and in revenge served him as i have said  indeed the little man was fortunate not to get a broken neck for his pains for as one would have thought he might have learnt from the episode of his display of axemanship that le monsieur noir was an ill person to play practical jokes upon  this incident was unimportant enough in itself but i narrate it because it led to serious consequences  as soon as he had stanched the bleeding from his scratches and washed himself alphonse went off still cursing to recover his temper a process which i knew from experience would take a very long time  when he had gone i gave umslopogaas a jobation and told him that i was ashamed of his behaviour  ah well macumazahn he said you must be gentle with me for here is not my place  i am weary of it weary to death of eating and drinking of sleeping and giving in marriage  i love not this soft life in stone houses that takes the heart out of a man and turns his strength to water and his flesh to fat i love not the white robes and the delicate women the blowing of trumpets and the flying of hawks  when we fought the masai at the kraal yonder ah then life was worth the living but here is never a blow struck in anger and i begin to think i shall go the way of my fathers and lift inkosikaas no more and he held up the axe and gazed at it in sorrow  ah i said that is thy complaint is it  thou hast the bloodsickness hast thou  and the woodpecker wants a tree and at thy age too  shame on thee umslopogaas  ay macumazahn mine is a red trade yet is it better and more honest than some  better is it to slay a man in fair fight than to suck out his hearts blood in buying and selling and usury after your white fashion  many a man have i slain yet is there never a one that i should fear to look in the face again ay many are there who once were friends and whom i should be right glad to snuff with  but there there thou hast thy ways and i mine each to his own people and his own place  the highveldt ox will die in the fat bush country and so is it with me macumazahn i am rough i know it and when my blood is warm i know not what to do but yet wilt thou be sorry when the night swallows me and i am utterly lost in blackness for in thy heart thou lovest me my father macumazahn the fox though i be nought but a brokendown zulu wardog  a chief for whom there is no room in his own kraal an outcast and a wanderer in strange places ay i love thee macumazahn for we have grown grey together and there is that between us that cannot be seen and yet is too strong for breaking and he took his snuffbox which was made of an old brass cartridge from the slit in his ear where he always carried it and handed it to me for me to help myself  i took the pinch of snuff with some emotion  it was quite true i was much attached to the bloodthirsty old ruffian  i do not know what was the charm of his character but it had a charm perhaps it was its fierce honesty and directness perhaps one admired his almost superhuman skill and strength or it may have been simply that he was so absolutely unique  frankly with all my experience of savages i never knew a man quite like him he was so wise and yet such a child with it all and though it seems laughable to say so like the hero of the yankee parody he had a tender heart  anyway i was very fond of him though i should never have thought of telling him so  ay old wolf i said thine is a strange love  thou wouldst split me to the chin if i stood in thy path tomorrow  thou speakest truth macumazahn that would i if it came in the way of duty but i should love thee all the same when the blow had gone fairly home  is there any chance of some fighting here macumazahn he went on in an insinuating voice  methought that what i saw last night did show that the two great queens were vexed one with another  else had the lady of the night not brought that dagger with her  i agreed with him that it showed that more or less pique and irritation existed between the ladies and told him how things stood and that they were quarrelling over incubu  ah is it so he exclaimed springing up in delight then will there be war as surely as the rivers rise in the rains  war to the end  women love the last blow as well as the last word and when they fight for love they are pitiless as a wounded buffalo  see thou macumazahn a woman will swim through blood to her desire and think nought of it  with these eyes have i seen it once and twice also  ah macumazahn we shall see this fine place of houses burning yet and hear the battle cries come ringing up the street  after all i have not wandered for nothing  can this folk fight think ye  just then sir henry joined us and good arrived too from another direction looking very pale and holloweyed  the moment umslopogaas saw the latter he stopped his bloodthirsty talk and greeted him  ah bougwan he cried greeting to thee inkoos  thou art surely weary  didst thou hunt too much yesterday  then without waiting for an answer he went on   listen bougwan and i will tell thee a story it is about a woman therefore wilt thou hear it is it not so  there was a man and he had a brother and there was a woman who loved the mans brother and was beloved of the man  but the mans brother had a favourite wife and loved not the woman and he made a mock of her  then the woman being very cunning and fiercehearted for revenge took counsel with herself and said to the man i love thee and if thou wilt make war upon thy brother i will marry thee  and he knew it was a lie yet because of his great love of the woman who was very fair did he listen to her words and made war  and when many people had been killed his brother sent to him saying why slayest thou me  what hurt have i done unto thee  from my youth up have i not loved thee  when thou wast little did i not nurture thee and have we not gone down to war together and divided the cattle girl by girl ox by ox and cow by cow  why slayest thou me my brother son of my own mother  then the mans heart was heavy and he knew that his path was evil and he put aside the tempting of the woman and ceased to make war on his brother and lived at peace in the same kraal with him  and after a time the woman came to him and said i have lost the past i will be thy wife  and in his heart he knew that it was a lie and that she thought the evil thing yet because of his love did he take her to wife  and the very night that they were wed when the man was plunged into a deep sleep did the woman arise and take his axe from his hand and creep into the hut of his brother and slay him in his rest  then did she slink back like a gorged lioness and place the thong of the red axe back upon his wrist and go her ways  and at the dawning the people came shouting lousta is slain in the night and they came unto the hut of the man and there he lay asleep and by him was the red axe  then did they remember the war and say lo he hath of a surety slain his brother and they would have taken and killed him but he rose and fled swiftly and as he fleeted by he slew the woman  but death could not wipe out the evil she had done and on him rested the weight of all her sin  therefore is he an outcast and his name a scorn among his own people for on him and him only resteth the burden of her who betrayed  and therefore does he wander afar without a kraal and without an ox or a wife and therefore will he die afar like a stricken buck and his name be accursed from generation to generation in that the people say that he slew his brother lousta by treachery in the nighttime  the old zulu paused and i saw that he was deeply agitated by his own story  presently he lifted his head which he had bowed to his breast and went on  i was the man bougwan  ou  i was that man and now hark thou  even as i am so wilt thou be  a tool a plaything an ox of burden to carry the evil deeds of another  listen  when thou didst creep after the lady of the night i was hard upon thy track  when she struck thee with the knife in the sleeping place of the white queen i was there also when thou didst let her slip away like a snake in the stones i saw thee and i knew that she had bewitched thee and that a true man had abandoned the truth and he who aforetime loved a straight path had taken a crooked way  forgive me my father if my words are sharp but out of a full heart are they spoken  see her no more so shalt thou go down with honour to the grave  else because of the beauty of a woman that weareth as a garment of fur shalt thou be even as i am and perchance with more cause  i have said  throughout this long and eloquent address good had been perfectly silent but when the tale began to shape itself so aptly to his own case he coloured up and when he learnt that what had passed between him and sorais had been overseen he was evidently much distressed  and now when at last he spoke it was in a tone of humility quite foreign to him  i must say he said with a bitter little laugh that i scarcely thought that i should live to be taught my duty by a zulu but it just shows what we can come to  i wonder if you fellows can understand how humiliated i feel and the bitterest part of it is that i deserve it all  of course i should have handed sorais over to the guard but i could not and that is a fact  i let her go and i promised to say nothing more is the shame to me she told me that if i would side with her she would marry me and make me king of this country but thank goodness i did find the heart to say that even to marry her i could not desert my friends  and now you can do what you like i deserve it all all i have to say is that i hope that you may never love a woman with all your heart and then be so sorely tempted of her and he turned to go  look here old fellow said sir henry just stop a minute i have a little tale to tell you too  and he went on to narrate what had taken place on the previous day between sorais and himself  this was a finishing stroke to poor good  it is not pleasant to any man to learn that he has been made a tool of but when the circumstances are as peculiarly atrocious as in the present case it is about as bitter a pill as anybody can be called on to swallow  do you know he said i think that between you you fellows have about worked a cure and he turned and walked away and i for one felt very sorry for him  ah if the moths would always carefully avoid the candle how few burnt wings there would be  that day was a court day when the queens sat in the great hall and received petitions discussed laws money grants and so forth and thither we adjourned shortly afterwards  on our way we were joined by good who was looking exceedingly depressed  when we got into the hall nyleptha was already on her throne and proceeding with business as usual surrounded by councillors courtiers lawyers priests and an unusually strong guard it was however easy to see from the air of excitement and expectation on the faces of everybody present that nobody was paying much attention to ordinary affairs the fact being that the knowledge that civil war was imminent had now got abroad  we saluted nyleptha and took our accustomed places and for a little while things went on as usual when suddenly the trumpets began to call outside the palace and from the great crowd that was gathered there in anticipation of some unusual event there rose a roar of sorais  sorais  then came the roll of many chariot wheels and presently the great curtains at the end of the hall were drawn wide and through them entered the lady of the night herself  nor did she come alone  preceding her was agon the high priest arrayed in his most gorgeous vestments and on either side were other priests the reason for their presence was obvious  coming with them it would have been sacrilege to attempt to detain her  behind her were a number of the great lords and behind them a small body of picked guards  a glance at sorais herself was enough to show that her mission was of no peaceful kind for in place of her gold embroidered kaf she wore a shining tunic formed of golden scales and on her head a little golden helmet  in her hand too she bore a toy spear beautifully made and fashioned of solid silver  up the hall she came looking like a lioness in her conscious pride and beauty and as she came the spectators fell back bowing and made a path for her  by the sacred stone she halted and laying her hand on it she cried out with a loud voice to nyleptha on the throne hail oh queen  all hail my royal sister answered nyleptha  draw thou near fear not i give thee safe conduct  sorais answered with a haughty look and swept on up the hall till she stood right before the thrones  a boon oh queen she cried again  speak on my sister what is there that i can give thee who hath half our kingdom  thou canst tell me a true word  me and the people of zuvendis art thou or art thou not about to take this foreign wolf and she pointed to sir henry with her toy spear to be a husband to thee and share thy bed and throne  curtis winced at this and turning towards sorais said to her in a low voice methinks that yesterday thou hadst other names than wolf to call me by oh queen and i saw her bite her lips as like a danger flag the blood flamed red upon her face as for nyleptha who is nothing if not original she seeing that the thing was out and that there was nothing further to be gained by concealment answered the question in a novel and effectual manner inspired thereto as i firmly believe by coquetry and a desire to triumph over her rival  up she rose and descending from the throne swept in all the glory of her royal grace on to where her lover stood  there she stopped and untwined the golden snake that was wound around her arm  then she bade him kneel and he dropped on one knee on the marble before her and next taking the golden snake with both her hands she bent the pure soft metal round his neck and when it was fast deliberately kissed him on the brow and called him her dear lord  thou seest she said when the excited murmur of the spectators had died away addressing her sister as sir henry rose to his feet i have put my collar round the wolfs neck and behold he shall be my watchdog and that is my answer to thee queen sorais my sister and to those with thee  fear not she went on smiling sweetly on her lover and pointing to the golden snake she had twined round his massive throat if my yoke be heavy yet is it of pure gold and it shall not gall thee  then turning to the audience she continued in a clear proud tone ay lady of the night lords priests and people here gathered together by this sign do i take the foreigner to husband even here in the face of you all  what am i a queen and yet not free to choose the man whom i will love  then should i be lower than the meanest girl in all my provinces  nay he hath won my heart and with it goes my hand and throne and all i have  ay had he been a beggar instead of a great lord fairer and stronger than any here and having more wisdom and knowledge of strange things i had given him all how much more so being what he is  and she took his hand and gazed proudly on him and holding it stood there boldly facing the people  and such was her sweetness and the power and dignity of her person and so beautiful she looked standing hand in hand there at her lovers side so sure of him and of herself and so ready to risk all things and endure all things for him that most of those who saw the sight which i am sure no one of them will ever forget caught the fire from her eyes and the happy colour from her blushing face and cheered her like wild things  it was a bold stroke for her to make and it appealed to the imagination but human nature in zuvendis as elsewhere loves that which is bold and not afraid to break a rule and is moreover peculiarly susceptible to appeals to its poetical side  and so the people cheered till the roof rang but sorais of the night stood there with downcast eyes for she could not bear to see her sisters triumph which robbed her of the man whom she had hoped to win and in the awfulness of her jealous anger she trembled and turned white like an aspen in the wind  i think i have said somewhere of her that she reminded me of the sea on a calm day having the same aspect of sleeping power about her  well it was all awake now and like the face of the furious ocean it awed and yet fascinated me  a really handsome woman in a royal rage is always a beautiful sight but such beauty and such a rage i never saw combined before and i can only say that the effect produced was well worthy of the two  she lifted her white face the teeth set and there were purple rings beneath her glowing eyes  thrice she tried to speak and thrice she failed but at last her voice came  raising her silver spear she shook it and the light gleamed from it and from the golden scales of her cuirass  and thinkest thou nyleptha she said in notes which pealed through the great hall like a clarion thinkest thou that i sorais a queen of the zuvendi will brook that this base outlander shall sit upon my fathers throne and rear up halfbreeds to fill the place of the great house of the stairway  never never while there is life in my bosom and a man to follow me and a spear to strike with  who is on my side  who  now hand thou over this foreign wolf and those who came hither to prey with him to the doom of fire for have they not committed the deadly sin against the sun or nyleptha i give thee war  red war  ay i say to thee that the path of thy passion shall be marked out by the blazing of thy towns and watered with the blood of those who cleave to thee  on thy head rest the burden of the deed and in thy ears ring the groans of the dying and the cries of the widows and those who are left fatherless for ever and for ever  i tell thee i will tear thee nyleptha the white queen from thy throne and that thou shalt be hurled  ay hurled even from the topmost stair of the great way to the foot thereof in that thou hast covered the name of the house of him who built it with black shame  and i tell ye strangers  all save bougwan whom because thou didst do me a service i will save alive if thou wilt leave these men and follow me here poor good shook his head vigorously and ejaculated cant be done in english  that i will wrap you in sheets of gold and hang you yet alive in chains from the four golden trumpets of the four angels that fly east and west and north and south from the giddiest pinnacles of the temple so that ye may be a token and a warning to the land  and as for thee incubu thou shalt die in yet another fashion that i will not tell thee now  she ceased panting for breath for her passion shook her like a storm and a murmur partly of horror and partly of admiration ran through the hall  then nyleptha answered calmly and with dignity  ill would it become my place and dignity oh sister so to speak as thou hast spoken and so to threat as thou hast threatened yet if thou wilt make war then will i strive to bear up against thee for if my hand seem soft yet shalt thou find it of iron when it grips thine armies by the throat  sorais i fear thee not  i weep for that which thou wilt bring upon our people and on thyself but for myself i say  i fear thee not  yet thou who but yesterday didst strive to win my lover and my lord from me whom today thou dost call a foreign wolf to be thy lover and thy lord here there was an immense sensation in the hall thou who but last night as i have learnt but since thou didst enter here didst creep like a snake into my sleepingplace  ay even by a secret way and wouldst have foully murdered me thy sister as i lay asleep   it is false it is false rang out agons and a score of other voices  it is not false said i producing the broken point of the dagger and holding it up  where is the haft from which this flew oh sorais  it is not false cried good determined at last to act like a loyal man  i took the lady of the night by the white queens bed and on my breast the dagger broke  who is on my side cried sorais shaking her silver spear for she saw that public sympathy was turning against her  what bougwan thou comest not she said addressing good who was standing close to her in a low concentrated voice  thou palesouled fool for a reward thou shalt eat out thy heart with love of me and not be satisfied and thou mightest have been my husband and a king  at least i hold thee in chains that cannot be broken  war  war  war she cried  here with my hand upon the sacred stone that shall endure so runs the prophecy till the zuvendi set their necks beneath an alien yoke i declare war to the end  who follows sorais of the night to victory and honour  instantly the whole concourse began to break up in indescribable confusion  many present hastened to throw in their lot with the lady of the night but some came from her following to us  amongst the former was an under officer of nylepthas own guard who suddenly turned and made a run for the doorway through which sorais people were already passing  umslopogaas who was present and had taken the whole scene in seeing with admirable presence of mind that if this soldier got away others would follow his example seized the man who drew his sword and struck at him  thereon the zulu sprang back with a wild shout and avoiding the sword cuts began to peck at his foe with his terrible axe till in a few seconds the mans fate overtook him and he fell with a clash heavily and quite dead upon the marble floor  this was the first blood spilt in the war  shut the gates i shouted thinking that we might perhaps catch sorais so and not being troubled with the idea of committing sacrilege  but the order came too late her guards were already passing through them and in another minute the streets echoed with the furious galloping of horses and the rolling of her chariots  so drawing half the people after her sorais was soon passing like a whirlwind through the frowning city on her road to her headquarters at marstuna a fortress situated a hundred and thirty miles to the north of milosis  and after that the city was alive with the endless tramp of regiments and preparations for the gathering war and old umslopogaas once more began to sit in the sunshine and go through a show of sharpening inkosikaass razor edge     chapter xix a strange wedding    one person however did not succeed in getting out in time before the gates were shut and that was the high priest agon who as we had every reason to believe was sorais great ally and the heart and soul of her party  this cunning and ferocious old man had not forgiven us for those hippopotami or rather that was what he said  what he meant was that he would never brook the introduction of our wider ways of thought and foreign learning and influence while there was a possibility of stamping us out  also he knew that we possessed a different system of religion and no doubt was in daily terror of our attempting to introduce it into zuvendis  one day he asked me if we had any religion in our country and i told him that so far as i could remember we had ninetyfive different ones  you might have knocked him down with a feather and really it is difficult not to pity a high priest of a wellestablished cult who is haunted by the possible approach of one or all of ninetyfive new religions  when we knew that agon was caught nyleptha sir henry and i discussed what was to be done with him  i was for closely incarcerating him but nyleptha shook her head saying that it would produce a disastrous effect throughout the country  ah she added with a stamp of her foot if i win and am once really queen i will break the power of those priests with their rites and revels and dark secret ways  i only wished that old agon could have heard her it would have frightened him  well said sir henry if we are not to imprison him i suppose that we may as well let him go  he is of no use here  nyleptha looked at him in a curious sort of way and said in a dry little voice thinkest thou so my lord  eh said curtis  no i do not see what is the use of keeping him  she said nothing but continued looking at him in a way that was as shy as it was sweet  then at last he understood  forgive me nyleptha he said rather tremulously  dost thou mean that thou wilt marry me even now  nay i know not let my lord say was her rapid answer but if my lord wills the priest is there and the altar is there  pointing to the entrance to a private chapel  and am i not ready to do the will of my lord  listen oh my lord  in eight days or less thou must leave me and go down to war for thou shalt lead my armies and in war  men sometimes fall and so i would for a little space have had thee all my own if only for memorys sake and the tears overflowed her lovely eyes and rolled down her face like heavy drops of dew down the red heart of a rose  mayhap too she went on i shall lose my crown and with my crown my life and thine also  sorais is very strong and very bitter and if she prevails she will not spare  who can read the future  happiness is the worlds white bird that alights seldom and flies fast and far till one day he is lost in the clouds  therefore should we hold him fast if by any chance he rests for a little space upon our hand  it is not wise to neglect the present for the future for who knows what the future will be incubu  let us pluck our flowers while the dew is on them for when the sun is up they wither and on the morrow will others bloom that we shall never see  and she lifted her sweet face to him and smiled into his eyes and once more i felt a curious pang of jealousy and turned and went away  they never took much notice of whether i was there or not thinking i suppose that i was an old fool and that it did not matter one way or the other and really i believe that they were right  so i went back to our quarters and ruminated over things in general and watched old umslopogaas whetting his axe outside the window as a vulture whets his beak beside a dying ox  and in about an hours time sir henry came tearing over looking very radiant and wildly excited and found good and myself and even umslopogaas and asked us if we should like to assist at a real wedding  of course we said yes and off we went to the chapel where we found agon looking as sulky as any high priest possibly could and no wonder  it appeared that he and nyleptha had a slight difference of opinion about the coming ceremony he had flatly refused to celebrate it or to allow any of his priests to do so whereupon nyleptha became very angry and told him that she as queen was head of the church and meant to be obeyed  indeed she played the part of a zuvendi henry the eighth to perfection and insisted that if she wanted to be married she would be married and that he should marry her endnote 18  he still refused to go through the ceremony so she clinched her argument thus   well i cannot execute a high priest because there is an absurd prejudice against it and i cannot imprison him because all his subordinates would raise a crying that would bring the stars down on zuvendis and crush it but i can leave him to contemplate the altar of the sun without anything to eat because that is his natural vocation and if thou wilt not marry me o agon thou shalt be placed before the altar yonder with nought but a little water till such time as thou hast reconsidered the matter  now as it happened agon had been hurried away that morning without his breakfast and was already exceedingly hungry so he presently modified his views and consented to marry them saying at the same time that he washed his hands of all responsibility in the matter  so it chanced that presently attended only by two of her favourite maidens came the queen nyleptha with happy blushing face and downcast eyes dressed in pure white without embroidery of any sort as seems to be the fashion on these occasions in most countries of the world  she did not wear a single ornament even her gold circlets were removed and i thought that if possible she looked more lovely than ever without them as really superbly beautiful women do  she came curtseyed low to sir henry and then took his hand and led him up before the altar and after a little pause in a slow clear voice uttered the following words which are customary in zuvendis if the bride desires and the man consents   thou dost swear by the sun that thou wilt take no other woman to wife unless i lay my hand upon her and bid her come  i swear it answered sir henry adding in english one is quite enough for me  then agon who had been sulking in a corner near the altar came forward and gabbled off something into his beard at such a rate that i could not follow it but it appeared to be an invocation to the sun to bless the union and make it fruitful  i observed that nyleptha listened very closely to every word and afterwards discovered that she was afraid lest agon should play her a trick and by going through the invocations backwards divorce them instead of marry them  at the end of the invocations they were asked as in our service if they took each other for husband and wife and on their assenting they kissed each other before the altar and the service was over so far as their rites were concerned but it seemed to me that there was yet something wanting and so i produced a prayerbook which has together which the ingoldsby legends that i often read when i lie awake at night accompanied me in all my later wanderings  i gave it to my poor boy harry years ago and after his death i found it among his things and took it back again  curtis i said i am not a clergyman and i do not know if what i am going to propose is allowable  i know it is not legal  but if you and the queen have no objection i should like to read the english marriage service over you  it is a solemn step which you are taking and i think that you ought so far as circumstances will allow to give it the sanction of your own religion  i have thought of that he said and i wish you would i do not feel half married yet  nyleptha raised no objection fully understanding that her husband wished to celebrate the marriage according to the rites prevailing in his own country and so i set to work and read the service from dearly beloved to amazement as well as i could and when i came to i henry take thee nyleptha i translated and also i nyleptha take thee henry which she repeated after me very well  then sir henry took a plain gold ring from his little finger and placed it on hers and so on to the end the ring had been curtis mothers weddingring and i could not help thinking how astonished the dear old yorkshire lady would have been if she could have foreseen that her weddingring was to serve a similar purpose for nyleptha a queen of the zuvendi  as for agon he was with difficulty kept calm while this second ceremony was going on for he at once understood that it was religious in its nature and doubtless bethought him of the ninetyfive new faiths which loomed so ominously in his eyes  indeed he at once set me down as a rival high priest and hated me accordingly however in the end off he went positively bristling with indignation and i knew that we might look out for danger from his direction  and off went good and i and old umslopogaas also leaving the happy pair to themselves and very low we all felt  marriages are supposed to be cheerful things but my experience is that they are very much the reverse to everybody except perhaps the two people chiefly interested  they mean the breakingup of so many old ties as well as the undertaking of so many new ones and there is always something sad about the passing away of the old order  now to take this case for instance sir henry curtis is the best and kindest fellow and friend in the world but he has never been quite the same since that little scene in the chapel  it is always nyleptha this and nyleptha that  nyleptha in short from morning till night in one way or another either expressed or understood  and as for the old friends  well of course they have taken the place that old friends ought to take and which ladies are as a rule very careful to see they do take when a man marries and that is the second place  yes he would be angry if anybody said so but it is a fact for all that  he is not quite the same and nyleptha is very sweet and very charming but i think that she likes him to understand that she has married him and not quatermain good and co  but there what is the use of grumbling  it is all very right and proper as any married lady would have no difficulty in explaining and i am a selfish jealous old man though i hope i never show it  so good and i went and ate in silence and then indulged in an extra fine flagon of old zuvendian to keep our spirits up and presently one of our attendants came and told a story that gave us something to think about  it may perhaps be remembered that after his quarrel with umslopogaas alphonse had gone off in an exceedingly ill temper to sulk over his scratches  well it appears that he walked right past the temple to the sun down the wide road on the further side of the slope it crowns and thence on into the beautiful park or pleasure gardens which are laid out just beyond the outer wall  after wandering about there for a little he started to return but was met near the outer gate by sorais train of chariots which were galloping furiously along the great northern road  when she caught sight of alphonse sorais halted her train and called to him  on approaching he was instantly seized and dragged into one of the chariots and carried off crying out loudly as our informant said and as from my general knowledge of him i can well believe  at first i was much puzzled to know what object sorais could have had in carrying off the poor little frenchman  she could hardly stoop so low as to try to wreak her fury on one whom she knew was only a servant  at last however an idea occurred to me  we three were as i think i have said much revered by the people of zuvendis at large both because we were the first strangers they had ever seen and because we were supposed to be the possessors of almost supernatural wisdom  indeed though sorais cry against the foreign wolves  or to translate it more accurately foreign hyenas  was sure to go down very well with the nobles and the priests it was not as we learnt likely to be particularly effectual amongst the bulk of the population the zuvendi people like the athenians of old are ever seeking for some new thing and just because we were so new our presence was on the whole acceptable to them  again sir henrys magnificent personal appearance made a deep impression upon a race who possess a greater love of beauty than any other i have ever been acquainted with  beauty may be prized in other countries but in zuvendis it is almost worshipped as indeed the national love of statuary shows  the people said openly in the marketplaces that there was not a man in the country to touch curtis in personal appearance as with the exception of sorais there was no woman who could compete with nyleptha and that therefore it was meet that they should marry and that he had been sent by the sun as a husband for their queen  now from all this it will be seen that the outcry against us was to a considerable extent fictitious and nobody knew it better than sorais herself  consequently it struck me that it might have occurred to her that down in the country and among the country people it would be better to place the reason of her conflict with her sister upon other and more general grounds than nylepthas marriage with the stranger  it would be easy in a land where there had been so many civil wars to rake out some old cry that would stir up the recollection of buried feuds and indeed she soon found an effectual one this being so it was of great importance to her to have one of the strangers with her whom she could show to the common people as a great outlander who had been so struck by the justice of her cause that he had elected to leave his companions and follow her standard  this no doubt was the cause of her anxiety to get a hold of good whom she would have used till he ceased to be of service and then cast off  but good having drawn back she grasped at the opportunity of securing alphonse who was not unlike him in personal appearance though smaller no doubt with the object of showing him off in the cities and country as the great bougwan himself  i told good that i thought that that was her plan and his face was a sight to see  he was so horrified at the idea  what he said dress up that little wretch to represent me why i shall have to get out of the country  my reputation will be ruined for ever  i consoled him as well as i could but it is not pleasant to be personated all over a strange country by an arrant little coward and i can quite sympathize with his vexation  well that night good and i messed as i have said in solitary grandeur feeling very much as though we had just returned from burying a friend instead of marrying one and next morning the work began in good earnest  the messages and orders which had been despatched by nyleptha two days before now began to take effect and multitudes of armed men came pouring into the city we saw as may be imagined but very little of nyleptha and not too much of curtis during those next few days but good and i sat daily with the council of generals and loyal lords drawing up plans of action arranging commissariat matters the distribution of commands and a hundred and one other things  men came in freely and all the day long the great roads leading to milosis were spotted with the banners of lords arriving from their distant places to rally round nyleptha  after the first few days it became clear that we should be able to take the field with about forty thousand infantry and twenty thousand cavalry a very respectable force considering how short was the time we had to collect it and that about half the regular army had elected to follow sorais  but if our force was large sorais was according to the reports brought in day by day by our spies much larger  she had taken up her headquarters at a very strong town called marstuna situated as i have said to the north of milosis and all the countryside was flocking to her standard  nasta had poured down from his highlands and was on his way to join her with no less than twentyfive thousand of his mountaineers the most terrible soldiers to face in all zuvendis  another mighty lord named belusha who lived in the great horsebreeding district had come in with twelve thousand cavalry and so on  indeed what between one thing and another it seemed certain that she would gather a fully armed host of nearly one hundred thousand men  and then came news that sorais was proposing to break up her camp and march on the frowning city itself desolating the country as she came  thereon arose the question whether it would be best to meet her at milosis or to go out and give her battle when our opinion was asked upon the subject good and i unhesitatingly gave it in favour of an advance  if we were to shut ourselves up in the city and wait to be attacked it seemed to us that our inaction would be set down to fear  it is so important especially on an occasion of this sort when a very little will suffice to turn mens opinions one way or the other to be up and doing something  ardour for a cause will soon evaporate if the cause does not move but sits down to conquer  therefore we cast our vote for moving out and giving battle in the open instead of waiting till we were drawn from our walls like a badger from a hole  sir henrys opinion coincided with ours and so needless to say did that of nyleptha who like a flint was always ready to flash out fire  a great map of the country was brought and spread out before her  about thirty miles this side of marstuna where sorais lay and ninety odd miles from milosis the road ran over a neck of land some two and a half miles in width and flanked on either side by forestclad hills which without being lofty would if the road were blocked be quite impracticable for a great baggageladen army to cross  she looked earnestly at the map and then with a quickness of perception that in some women amounts almost to an instinct she laid her finger upon this neck of rising ground and turning to her husband said with a proud air of confidence and a toss of the golden head   here shalt thou meet sorais armies  i know the spot here shalt thou meet them and drive them before thee like dust before the storm  but curtis looked grave and said nothing     chapter xx the battle of the pass    it was on the third morning after this incident of the map that sir henry and i started  with the exception of a small guard all the great host had moved on the night before leaving the frowning city very silent and empty  indeed it was found impossible to leave any garrison with the exception of a personal guard for nyleptha and about a thousand men who from sickness or one cause or another were unable to proceed with the army but as milosis was practically impregnable and as our enemy was in front of and not behind us this did not so much matter  good and umslopogaas had gone on with the army but nyleptha accompanied sir henry and myself to the city gates riding a magnificent white horse called daylight which was supposed to be the fleetest and most enduring animal in zuvendis  her face bore traces of recent weeping but there were no tears in her eyes now indeed she was bearing up bravely against what must have been a bitter trial to her  at the gate she reined in her horse and bade us farewell  on the previous day she had reviewed and addressed the officers of the great army speaking to them such high eloquent words and expressing so complete a confidence in their valour and in their ultimate victory that she quite carried their hearts away and as she rode from rank to rank they cheered her till the ground shook  and now today the same mood seemed to be on her  fare thee well macumazahn she said  remember i trust to thy wits which are as a needle to a spearhandle compared to those of my people to save us from sorais  i know that thou wilt do thy duty  i bowed and explained to her my horror of fighting and my fear lest i should lose my head at which she laughed gently and turned to curtis  fare thee well my lord she said  come back with victory and as a king or on thy soldiers spears endnote 19  sir henry said nothing but turned his horse to go perhaps he had a bit of a lump in his throat  one gets over it afterwards but these sort of partings are trying when one has only been married a week  here added nyleptha will i greet thee when ye return in triumph  and now my lords once more farewell  then we rode on but when we had gone a hundred and fifty yards or so we turned and perceived her still sitting on her horse at the same spot and looking out after us beneath her hand and that was the last we saw of her  about a mile farther on however we heard galloping behind us and looking round saw a mounted soldier coming towards us leading nylepthas matchless steed  daylight  the queen sends the white stallion as a farewell gift to her lord incubu and bids me tell my lord that he is the fleetest and most enduring horse in all the land said the soldier bending to his saddlebow before us  at first sir henry did not want to take the horse saying that he was too good for such rough work but i persuaded him to do so thinking that nyleptha would be hurt if he did not  little did i guess at the time what service that noble horse would render in our sorest need  it is curious to look back and realize upon what trivial and apparently coincidental circumstances great events frequently turn as easily and naturally as a door on its hinges  well we took the horse and a beauty he was it was a perfect pleasure to see him move and curtis having sent back his greetings and thanks we proceeded on our journey  by midday we overtook the rearguard of the great army of which sir henry then formally took over the command  it was a heavy responsibility and it oppressed him very much but the queens injunctions on the point were such as did not admit of being trifled with  he was beginning to find out that greatness has its responsibilities as well as its glories  then we marched on without meeting with any opposition almost indeed without seeing anybody for the populations of the towns and villages along our route had for the most part fled fearing lest they should be caught between the two rival armies and ground to powder like grain between the upper and the nether stones  on the evening of the fourth day for the progress of so great a multitude was necessarily slow we camped two miles this side of the neck or ridge i have spoken of and our outposts brought us word that sorais with all her power was rolling down upon us and had pitched her camp that night ten miles the farther side of the neck  accordingly before dawn we sent forward fifteen hundred cavalry to seize the position  scarcely had they occupied it however before they were attacked by about as many of sorais horsemen and a very smart little cavalry fight ensued with a loss to us of about thirty men killed  on the advance of our supports however sorais force drew off carrying their dead and wounded with them  the main body of the army reached the neck about dinnertime and i must say that nylepthas judgment had not failed her it was an admirable place to give battle in especially to a superior force  the road ran down a mile or more through ground too broken to admit of the handling of any considerable force till it reached the crest of a great green wave of land that rolled down a gentle slope to the banks of a little stream and then rolled away again up a still gentler slope to the plain beyond the distance from the crest of the landwave down to the stream being a little over half a mile and from the stream up to the plain beyond a trifle less  the length of this wave of land at its highest point which corresponded exactly with the width of the neck of the land between the wooded hills was about two miles and a quarter and it was protected on either side by dense rocky bushclad ground that afforded a most valuable cover to the flanks of the army and rendered it almost impossible for them to be turned  it was on the hither slope of this neck of land that curtis encamped his army in the same formation that he had after consultation with the various generals good and myself determined that they should occupy in the great pitched battle which now appeared to be imminent  our force of sixty thousand men was roughly speaking divided as follows  in the centre was a dense body of twenty thousand footsoldiers armed with spears swords and hippopotamushide shields breast and back plates endnote 20  these formed the chest of the army and were supported by five thousand foot and three thousand horse in reserve  on either side of this chest were stationed seven thousand horse arranged in deep majestic squadrons and beyond and on either side but slightly in front of them again were two bodies each numbering about seven thousand five hundred spearmen forming the right and left wings of the army and each supported by a contingent of some fifteen hundred cavalry  this makes in all sixty thousand men  curtis commanded in chief i was in command of the seven thousand horse between the chest and right wing which was commanded by good and the other battalions and squadrons were entrusted to zuvendis generals  scarcely had we taken up our positions before sorais vast army began to swarm on the opposite slope about a mile in front of us till the whole place seemed alive with the multitude of her spearpoints and the ground shook with the tramp of her battalions it was evident that the spies had not exaggerated we were outnumbered by at least a third  at first we expected that sorais was going to attack us at once as the clouds of cavalry which hung upon her flanks executed some threatening demonstrations but she thought better of it and there was no fight that day  as for the formation of her great forces i cannot now describe it with accuracy and it would only serve to bewilder if i did but i may say generally that in its leading features it resembled our own only her reserve was much greater  opposite our right wing and forming sorais left wing was a great army of dark wildlooking men armed with sword and shield only which i was informed was composed of nastas twentyfive thousand savage hillsmen  my word good said i when i saw them you will catch it tomorrow when those gentlemen charge whereat good not unnaturally looked rather anxious  all day we watched and waited but nothing happened and at last night fell and a thousand watchfires twinkled brightly on the slopes to wane and die one by one like the stars they resembled as the hours wore on the silence gradually gathered more deeply over the opposing hosts  it was a very wearying night for in addition to the endless things that had to be attended to there was our gnawing suspense to reckon with  the fray which tomorrow would witness would be so vast and the slaughter so awful that stout indeed must the heart have been that was not overwhelmed at the prospect and when i thought of all that hung upon it i own i felt ill and it made me very sad to reflect that these mighty forces were gathered for destruction simply to gratify the jealous anger of a woman  this was the hidden power which was to send those dense masses of cavalry flashing like human thunderbolts across the plain and to roll together the fierce battalions as clouds when hurricane meets hurricane  it was a dreadful thought and set one wondering about the responsibilities of the great ones of the earth  deep into the night we sat with pale faces and heavy hearts and took counsel whilst the sentries tramped up and down down and up and the armed and plumed generals came and went grim and shadowlike  and so the time wore away till everything was ready for the coming slaughter and i lay down and thought and tried to get a little rest but could not sleep for fear of the morrow  for who could say what the morrow would bring forth  misery and death this was certain beyond that we knew not and i confess i was very much afraid  but as i realized then it is useless to question that eternal sphinx the future  from day to day she reads aloud the riddles of the yesterday of which the puzzled wordlings of all ages have not answered one nor ever will guess they never so wildly or cry they never so loud  and so at length i gave up wondering being forced humbly to leave the issue in the balancing hands of providence and the morrow  and at last up came the red sun and the huge camps awoke with a clash and a roar and gathered themselves together for battle it was a beautiful and aweinspiring scene and old umslopogaas leaning on his axe contemplated it with grim delight  never have i seen the like macumazahn never he said  the battles of my people are as the play of children to what this will be  thinkest thou that they will fight it out  ay i answered sadly to the death  content thyself woodpecker for once shalt thou peck thy fill  time went on and still there was no sign of an attack  a force of cavalry crossed the brook indeed and rode slowly along our front evidently taking stock of our position and numbers  with this we did not attempt to interfere as our decision was to stand strictly on the defensive and not to waste a single man the men breakfasted and stood to their arms and the hours wore on  about midday when the men were eating their dinner for we thought they would fight better on full stomachs a shout of sorais sorais arose like thunder from the enemys extreme right and taking the glass i was able to clearly distinguish the lady of the night herself surrounded by a glittering staff and riding slowly down the lines of her battalions  and as she went that mighty thundering shout rolled along before her like the rolling of ten thousand chariots or the roaring of the ocean when the gale turns suddenly and carries the noise of it to the listeners ears till the earth shook and the air was full of the majesty of sound  guessing that this was a prelude to the beginning of the battle we remained still and made ready  we had not long to wait  suddenly like flame from a cannons mouth out shot two great tonguelike forces of cavalry and came charging down the slope towards the little stream slowly at first but gathering speed as they came  before they got to the stream orders reached me from sir henry who evidently feared that the shock of such a charge if allowed to fall unbroken upon our infantry would be too much for them to send five thousand sabres to meet the force opposite to me at the moment when it began to mount the stiffest of the rise about four hundred yards from our lines  this i did remaining behind myself with the rest of my men  off went the five thousand horsemen drawn up in a wedgelike form and i must say that the general in command handled them very ably  starting at a hand gallop for the first three hundred yards he rode straight at the tip of the tongueshaped mass of cavalry which numbering so far as i could judge about eight thousand sabres was advancing to charge us  then he suddenly swerved to the right and put on the pace and i saw the great wedge curl round and before the foe could check himself and turn to meet it strike him about halfway down his length with a crashing rending sound like that of the breakingup of vast sheets of ice  in sank the great wedge into his heart and as it cut its way hundreds of horsemen were thrown up on either side of it just as the earth is thrown up by a ploughshare or more like still as the foaming water curls over beneath the bows of a rushing ship  in yet in vainly does the tongue twist its ends round in agony like an injured snake and strive to protect its centre still farther in by heaven right through and so amid cheer after cheer from our watching thousands back again upon the severed ends beating them down driving them as a gale drives spray till at last amidst the rushing of hundreds of riderless horses the flashing of swords and the victorious clamour of their pursuers the great force crumples up like an empty glove then turns and gallops pellmell for safety back to its own lines  i do not think it reached them more than twothirds as strong as it went out ten minutes before  the lines which were now advancing to the attack opened and swallowed them up and my force returned having only suffered a loss of about five hundred men  not much i thought considering the fierceness of the struggle  i could also see that the opposing bodies of cavalry on our left wing were drawing back but how the fight went with them i do not quite know  it is as much as i can do to describe what took place immediately around me  by this time the dense masses of the enemys left composed almost entirely of nastas swordsmen were across the little stream and with alternate yells of nasta and sorais with dancing banners and gleaming swords were swarming up towards us like ants  again i received orders to try and check this movement and also the main advance against the chest of our army by means of cavalry charges and this i did to the best of my ability by continually sending squadrons of about a thousand sabres out against them these squadrons did the enemy much damage and it was a glorious sight to see them flash down the hillside and bury themselves like a living knife in the heart of the foe  but also we lost many men for after the experience of a couple of these charges which had drawn a sort of bloody st andrews cross of dead and dying through the centre of nastas host our foes no longer attempted to offer an unyielding front to their irresistible weight but opened out to let the rush go through throwing themselves on the ground and hamstringing hundreds of horses as they passed  and so notwithstanding all that we could do the enemy drew nearer till at last he hurled himself upon goods force of seven thousand five hundred regulars who were drawn up to receive them in three strong squares  about the same time too an awful and heartshaking roar told me that the main battle had closed in on the centre and extreme left  i raised myself in my stirrups and looked down to my left so far as the eye could see there was a long dazzling shimmer of steel as the sun glanced upon falling sword and thrusting spear  to and fro swung the contending lines in that dread struggle now giving way now gaining a little in the mad yet ordered confusion of attack and defence  but it was as much as i could do to keep count of what was happening to our own wing and as for the moment the cavalry had fallen back under cover of goods three squares i had a fair view of this  nastas wild swordsmen were now breaking in red waves against the sullen rocklike squares  time after time did they yell out their warcries and hurl themselves furiously against the long triple ridges of spear points only to be rolled back as billows are when they meet the cliff  and so for four long hours the battle raged almost without a pause and at the end of that time if we had gained nothing we had lost nothing  two attempts to turn our left flank by forcing a way through the wood by which it was protected had been defeated and as yet nastas swordsmen had notwithstanding their desperate efforts entirely failed to break goods three squares though they had thinned their numbers by quite a third  as for the chest of the army where sir henry was with his staff and umslopogaas it had suffered dreadfully but it had held its own with honour and the same may be said of our left battle  at last the attacks slackened and sorais army drew back having i began to think had enough of it  on this point however i was soon undeceived for splitting up her cavalry into comparatively small squadrons she charged us furiously with them all along the line and then once more sullenly rolled her tens of thousands of sword and spearmen down upon our weakened squares and squadrons sorais herself directing the movement as fearless as a lioness heading the main attack  on they came like an avalanche  i saw her golden helm gleaming in the van  our counter charges of cavalry entirely failing to check their forward sweep  now they had struck us and our centre bent in like a bow beneath the weight of their rush  it parted and had not the ten thousand men in reserve charged down to its support it must have been utterly destroyed  as for goods three squares they were swept backwards like boats upon an incoming tide and the foremost one was burst into and lost half its remaining men  but the effort was too fierce and terrible to last  suddenly the battle came as it were to a turningpoint and for a minute or two stood still  then it began to move towards sorais camp  just then too nastas fierce and almost invincible highlanders either because they were disheartened by their losses or by way of a ruse fell back and the remains of goods gallant squares leaving the positions they had held for so many hours cheered wildly and rashly followed them down the slope whereon the swarms of swordsmen turned to envelop them and once more flung themselves upon them with a yell  taken thus on every side what remained of the first square was quickly destroyed and i perceived that the second in which i could see good himself mounted on a large horse was on the point of annihilation  a few more minutes and it was broken its streaming colours sank and i lost sight of good in the confused and hideous slaughter that ensued  presently however a creamcoloured horse with a snowwhite mane and tail burst from the ruins of the square and came rushing past me riderless and with wide streaming reins and in it i recognized the charger that good had been riding  then i hesitated no longer but taking with me half my effective cavalry force which now amounted to between four and five thousand men i commended myself to god and without waiting for orders i charged straight down upon nastas swordsmen  seeing me coming and being warned by the thunder of my horses hoofs the majority of them faced round and gave us a right warm welcome  not an inch would they yield in vain did we hack and trample them down as we ploughed a broad red furrow through their thousands they seemed to rearise by hundreds driving their terrible sharp swords into our horses or severing their hamstrings and then hacking the troopers who came to the ground with them almost into pieces  my horse was speedily killed under me but luckily i had a fresh one my own favourite a coalblack mare nyleptha had given me being held in reserve behind and on this i afterwards mounted  meanwhile i had to get along as best i could for i was pretty well lost sight of by my men in the mad confusion of the moment  my voice of course could not be heard in the midst of the clanging of steel and the shrieks of rage and agony  presently i found myself mixed up with the remnants of the square which had formed round its leader good and was fighting desperately for existence i stumbled against somebody and glancing down caught sight of goods eyeglass  he had been beaten to his knee  over him was a great fellow swinging a heavy sword  somehow i managed to run the man through with the sime i had taken from the masai whose hand i had cut off but as i did so he dealt me a frightful blow on the left side and breast with the sword and though my chain shirt saved my life i felt that i was badly hurt  for a minute i fell on to my hands and knees among the dead and dying and turned sick and faint  when i came to again i saw that nastas spearmen or rather those of them who remained were retreating back across the stream and that good was there by me smiling sweetly  near go that he shouted but alls well that ends well  i assented but i could not help feeling that it had not ended well for me  i was sorely hurt  just then we saw the smaller bodies of cavalry stationed on our extreme right and left and which were now reinforced by the three thousand sabres which we had held in reserve flash out like arrows from their posts and fall upon the disordered flanks of sorais forces and that charge decided the issue of the battle in another minute or two the enemy was in slow and sullen retreat across the little stream where they once more reformed  then came another lull during which i managed to get a second horse and received my orders to advance from sir henry and then with one fierce deepthroated roar with a waving of banners and a wide flashing of steel the remains of our army took the offensive and began to sweep down slowly indeed but irresistibly from the positions they had so gallantly held all day  at last it was our turn to attack  on we moved over the piledup masses of dead and dying and were approaching the stream when suddenly i perceived an extraordinary sight  galloping wildly towards us his arms tightly clasped around his horses neck against which his blanched cheek was tightly pressed was a man arrayed in the full costume of a zuvendi general but in whom as he came nearer i recognized none other than our lost alphonse  it was impossible even then to mistake those curling mustachios  in a minute he was tearing through our ranks and narrowly escaped being cut down till at last somebody caught his horses bridle and he was brought to me just as a momentary halt occurred in our advance to allow what remained of our shattered squares to form into line  ah monsieur he gasped out in a voice that was nearly inarticulate with fright grace to the sky it is you  ah what i have endured but you win monsieur you win they fly the laches  but listen monsieur  i forget it is no good the queen is to be murdered tomorrow at the first light in the palace of milosis her guards will leave their posts and the priests are going to kill her ah yes they little thought it but i was ensconced beneath a banner and i heard it all  what i said horrorstruck what do you mean  what i say monsieur that devil of a nasta he went last night to settle the affair with the archbishop agon  the guard will leave open the little gate leading from the great stair and go away and nasta and agons priests will come in and kill her themselves they would not kill her  come with me i said and shouting to the staffofficer next to me to take over the command i snatched his bridle and galloped as hard as i could for the spot between a quarter and half a mile off where i saw the royal pennon flying and where i knew that i should find curtis if he were still alive  on we tore our horses clearing heaps of dead and dying men and splashing through pools of blood on past the long broken lines of spearmen to where mounted on the white stallion nyleptha had sent to him as a parting gift i saw sir henrys form towering above the generals who surrounded him  just as we reached him the advance began again  a bloody cloth was bound around his head but i saw that his eye was as bright and keen as ever  beside him was old umslopogaas his axe red with blood but looking quite fresh and uninjured  whats wrong quatermain he shouted  everything  there is a plot to murder the queen tomorrow at dawn  alphonse here who has just escaped from sorais has overheard it all and i rapidly repeated to him what the frenchman had told me  curtis face turned deadly pale and his jaw dropped  at dawn he gasped and it is now sunset it dawns before four and we are nearly a hundred miles off  nine hours at the outside  what is to be done  an idea entered into my head  is that horse of yours fresh i said  yes i have only just got on to him  when my last was killed and he has been fed  so is mine  get off him and let umslopogaas mount he can ride well  we will be at milosis before dawn or if we are not  well we cannot help it  no no it is impossible for you to leave now  you would be seen and it would turn the fate of the battle  it is not half won yet  the soldiers would think you were making a bolt of it  quick now  in a moment he was down and at my bidding umslopogaas sprang into the empty saddle  now farewell i said  send a thousand horsemen with remounts after us in an hour if possible  stay despatch a general to the left wing to take over the command and explain my absence  you will do your best to save her quatermain he said in a broken voice  ay that i will  go on you are being left behind  he cast one glance at us and accompanied by his staff galloped off to join the advance which by this time was fording the little brook that now ran red with the blood of the fallen  as for umslopogaas and myself we left that dreadful field as arrows leave a bow and in a few minutes had passed right out of the sight of slaughter the smell of blood and the turmoil and shouting which only came to our ears as a faint faroff roaring like the sound of distant breakers     chapter xxi away  away    at the top of the rise we halted for a second to breathe our horses and turning glanced at the battle beneath us which illumined as it was by the fierce rays of the sinking sun staining the whole scene red looked from where we were more like some wild titanic picture than an actual handtohand combat  the distinguishing scenic effect from that distance was the countless distinct flashes of light reflected from the swords and spears otherwise the panorama was not so grand as might have been expected the great green lap of sward in which the struggle was being fought out the bold round outline of the hills behind and the wide sweep of the plain beyond seemed to dwarf it and what was tremendous enough when one was in it grew insignificant when viewed from the distance  but is it not thus with all the affairs and doings of our race about which we blow the loud trumpet and make such a fuss and worry  how utterly antlike and morally and physically insignificant must they seem to the calm eyes that watch them from the arching depths above  we win the day macumazahn said old umslopogaas taking in the whole situation with a glance of his practised eye  look the lady of the nights forces give on every side there is no stiffness left in them they bend like hot iron they are fighting with but half a heart  but alas the battle will in a manner be drawn for the darkness gathers and the regiments will not be able to follow and slay  and he shook his head sadly but he added i do not think that they will fight again we have fed them with too strong a meat  ah it is well to have lived  at last i have seen a fight worth seeing  by this time we were on our way again and as we went side by side i told him what our mission was and how that if it failed all the lives that had been lost that day would have been lost in vain  ah he said nigh on a hundred miles and no horses but these and to be there before the dawn  well  away away man can but try macumazahn and mayhap we shall be there in time to split that old witchfinders agons skull for him  once he wanted to burn us the old rainmaker did he  and now he would set a snare for my mother nyleptha would he  good so sure as my name is the name of the woodpecker so surely be my mother alive or dead will i split him to the beard  ay by tchakas head i swear it and he shook inkosikaas as he galloped  by now the darkness was closing in but fortunately there would be a moon later and the road was good  on we sped through the twilight the two splendid horses we bestrode had got their wind by this and were sweeping along with a wide steady stride that neither failed nor varied for mile upon mile down the side of slopes we galloped across wide vales that stretched to the foot of faroff hills  nearer and nearer grew the blue hills now we were travelling up their steeps and now we were over and passing towards others that sprang up like visions in the far faint distance beyond  on never pausing or drawing rein through the perfect quiet of the night that was set like a song to the falling music of our horses hoofs on past deserted villages where only some forgotten starving dog howled a melancholy welcome on past lonely moated dwellings on through the white patchy moonlight that lay coldly upon the wide bosom of the earth as though there was no warmth in it on knee to knee for hour after hour  we spake not but bent us forward on the necks of those two glorious horses and listened to their deep longdrawn breaths as they filled their great lungs and to the regular unfaltering ring of their round hoofs  grim and black indeed did old umslopogaas look beside me mounted upon the great white horse like death in the revelation of st john as now and again lifting his fierce set face he gazed out along the road and pointed with his axe towards some distant rise or house  and so on still on without break or pause for hour after hour  at last i felt that even the splendid animal that i rode was beginning to give out  i looked at my watch it was nearly midnight and we were considerably more than half way  on the top of a rise was a little spring which i remembered because i had slept by it a few nights before and here i motioned to umslopogaas to pull up having determined to give the horses and ourselves ten minutes to breathe in  he did so and we dismounted  that is to say umslopogaas did and then helped me off for what with fatigue stiffness and the pain of my wound i could not do so for myself and then the gallant horses stood panting there resting first one leg and then another while the sweat fell drip drip from them and the steam rose and hung in pale clouds in the still night air  leaving umslopogaas to hold the horses i hobbled to the spring and drank deep of its sweet waters  i had had nothing but a single mouthful of wine since midday when the battle began and i was parched up though my fatigue was too great to allow me to feel hungry  then having laved my fevered head and hands i returned and the zulu went and drank  next we allowed the horses to take a couple of mouthfuls each  no more and oh what a struggle we had to get the poor beasts away from the water there were yet two minutes and i employed it in hobbling up and down to try and relieve my stiffness and in inspecting the condition of the horses  my mare gallant animal though she was was evidently much distressed she hung her head and her eye looked sick and dull but daylight nylepthas glorious horse  who if he is served aright should like the steeds who saved great rameses in his need feed for the rest of his days out of a golden manger  was still comparatively speaking fresh notwithstanding the fact that he had had by far the heavier weight to carry  he was tucked up indeed and his legs were weary but his eye was bright and clear and he held his shapely head up and gazed out into the darkness round him in a way that seemed to say that whoever failed he was good for those fiveandforty miles that yet lay between us and milosis  then umslopogaas helped me into the saddle and  vigorous old savage that he was  vaulted into his own without touching a stirrup and we were off once more slowly at first till the horses got into their stride and then more swiftly  so we passed over another ten miles and then came a long weary rise of some six or seven miles and three times did my poor black mare nearly come to the ground with me  but on the top she seemed to gather herself together and rattled down the slope with long convulsive strides breathing in gasps we did that three or four miles more swiftly than any since we had started on our wild ride but i felt it to be a last effort and i was right  suddenly my poor horse took the bit between her teeth and bolted furiously along a stretch of level ground for some three or four hundred yards and then with two or three jerky strides pulled herself up and fell with a crash right on to her head i rolling myself free as she did so  as i struggled to my feet the brave beast raised her head and looked at me with piteous bloodshot eyes and then her head dropped with a groan and she was dead  her heart was broken  umslopogaas pulled up beside the carcase and i looked at him in dismay  there were still more than twenty miles to do by dawn and how were we to do it with one horse  it seemed hopeless but i had forgotten the old zulus extraordinary running powers  without a single word he sprang from the saddle and began to hoist me into it  what wilt thou do i asked  run he answered seizing my stirrupleather  then off we went again almost as fast as before and oh the relief it was to me to get that change of horses  anybody who has ever ridden against time will know what it meant  daylight sped along at a long stretching handgallop giving the gaunt zulu a lift at every stride  it was a wonderful thing to see old umslopogaas run mile after mile his lips slightly parted and his nostrils agape like the horses  every five miles or so we stopped for a few minutes to let him get his breath and then flew on again  canst thou go farther i said at the third of these stoppages or shall i leave thee to follow me  he pointed with his axe to a dim mass before us  it was the temple of the sun now not more than five miles away  i reach it or i die he gasped  oh that last five miles  the skin was rubbed from the inside of my legs and every movement of my horse gave me anguish nor was that all  i was exhausted with toil want of food and sleep and also suffering very much from the blow i had received on my left side it seemed as though a piece of bone or something was slowly piercing into my lung  poor daylight too was pretty nearly finished and no wonder  but there was a smell of dawn in the air and we might not stay better that all three of us should die upon the road than that we should linger while there was life in us  the air was thick and heavy as it sometimes is before the dawn breaks and  another infallible sign in certain parts of zuvendis that sunrise is at hand  hundreds of little spiders pendant on the end of long tough webs were floating about in it  these earlyrising creatures or rather their webs caught upon the horses and our own forms by scores and as we had neither the time nor the energy to brush them off we rushed along covered with hundreds of long grey threads that streamed out a yard or more behind us  and a very strange appearance they must have given us  and now before us are the huge brazen gates of the outer wall of the frowning city and a new and horrible doubt strikes me what if they will not let us in  open open i shout imperiously at the same time giving the royal password  open open a messenger a messenger with tidings of the war  what news cried the guard  and who art thou that ridest so madly and who is that whose tongue lolls out  and it actually did  and who runs by thee like a dog by a chariot  it is the lord macumazahn and with him is his dog his black dog open open i bring tidings  the great gates ran back on their rollers and the drawbridge fell with a rattling crash and we dashed on through the one and over the other  what news my lord what news cried the guard  incubu rolls sorais back as the wind a cloud i answered and was gone  one more effort gallant horse and yet more gallant man  so fall not now daylight and hold thy life in thee for fifteen short minutes more old zulu wardog and ye shall both live for ever in the annals of the land  on clattering through the sleeping streets  we are passing the flower temple now  one mile more only one little mile  hold on keep your life in thee see the houses run past of themselves  up good horse up there  but fifty yards now ah you see your stables and stagger on gallantly  thank god the palace at last and see the first arrows of the dawn are striking on the temples golden dome endnote 21 but shall i get in here or is the deed done and the way barred  once more i give the password and shout open open  no answer and my heart grows very faint  again i call and this time a single voice replies and to my joy i recognize it as belonging to kara a fellowofficer of nylepthas guards a man i know to be as honest as the light  indeed the same whom nyleptha had sent to arrest sorais on the day she fled to the temple  is it thou kara i cry i am macumazahn  bid the guard let down the bridge and throw wide the gate  quick quick  then followed a space that seemed to me endless but at length the bridge fell and one half of the gate opened and we got into the courtyard where at last poor daylight fell down beneath me as i thought dead  except kara there was nobody to be seen and his look was wild and his garments were all torn he had opened the gate and let down the bridge alone and was now getting them up and shut again as owing to a very ingenious arrangement of cranks and levers one man could easily do and indeed generally did do  where are the guard i gasped fearing his answer as i never feared anything before  i know not he answered two hours ago as i slept was i seized and bound by the watch under me and but now this very moment have i freed myself with my teeth  i fear i greatly fear that we are betrayed  his words gave me fresh energy  catching him by the arm i staggered followed by umslopogaas who reeled after us like a drunken man through the courtyards up the great hall which was silent as the grave towards the queens sleepingplace  we reached the first anteroom  no guards the second still no guards  oh surely the thing was done we were too late after all too late  the silence and solitude of those great chambers was dreadful and weighed me down like an evil dream  on right into nylepthas chamber we rushed and staggered sick at heart fearing the very worst we saw there was a light in it ay and a figure bearing the light  oh thank god it is the white queen herself the queen unharmed  there she stands in her night gear roused by the clatter of our coming from her bed the heaviness of sleep yet in her eyes and a red blush of fear and shame mantling her lovely breast and cheek  who is it she cries  what means this  oh macumazahn is it thou  why lookest thou so wildly  thou comest as one bearing evil tidings  and my lord  oh tell me not my lord is dead  not dead she wailed wringing her white hands  i left incubu wounded but leading the advance against sorais last night at sundown therefore let thy heart have rest sorais is beaten back all along her lines and thy arms prevail  i knew it she cried in triumph  i knew that he would win and they called him outlander and shook their wise heads when i gave him the command  last night at sundown sayest thou and it is not yet dawn  surely   throw a cloak around thee nyleptha i broke in and give us wine to drink ay and call thy maidens quick if thou wouldst save thyself alive  nay stay not  thus adjured she ran and called through the curtains towards some room beyond and then hastily put on her sandals and a thick cloak by which time a dozen or so of halfdressed women were pouring into the room  follow us and be silent i said to them as they gazed with wondering eyes clinging one to another  so we went into the first anteroom  now i said give us wine to drink and food if ye have it for we are near to death  the room was used as a messroom for the officers of the guards and from a cupboard some flagons of wine and some cold flesh were brought forth and umslopogaas and i drank and felt life flow back into our veins as the good red wine went down  hark to me nyleptha i said as i put down the empty tankard hast thou here among these thy waitingladies any two of discretion  ay she said surely  then bid them go out by the side entrance to any citizens whom thou canst bethink thee of as men loyal to thee and pray them come armed with all honest folk that they can gather to rescue thee from death  nay question not do as i say and quickly kara here will let out the maids  she turned and selecting two of the crowd of damsels repeated the words i had uttered giving them besides a list of the names of the men to whom each should run  go swiftly and secretly go for your very lives i added  in another moment they had left with kara whom i told to rejoin us at the door leading from the great courtyard on to the stairway as soon as he had made fast behind the girls  thither too umslopogaas and i made our way followed by the queen and her women  as we went we tore off mouthfuls of food and between them i told her what i knew of the danger which encompassed her and how we found kara and how all the guards and menservants were gone and she was alone with her women in that great place and she told me too that a rumour had spread through the town that our army had been utterly destroyed and that sorais was marching in triumph on milosis and how in consequence thereof all men had fallen away from her  though all this takes some time to tell we had not been but six or seven minutes in the palace and notwithstanding that the golden roof of the temple being very lofty was ablaze with the rays of the rising sun it was not yet dawn nor would be for another ten minutes  we were in the courtyard now and here my wound pained me so that i had to take nylepthas arm while umslopogaas rolled along after us eating as he went  now we were across it and had reached the narrow doorway through the palace wall that opened on to the mighty stair  i looked through and stood aghast as well i might  the door was gone and so were the outer gates of bronze  entirely gone they had been taken from their hinges and as we afterwards found hurled from the stairway to the ground two hundred feet beneath  there in front of us was the semicircular standingspace about twice the size of a large oval diningtable and the ten curved black marble steps leading on to the main stair  and that was all     chapter xxii how umslopogaas held the stair    we looked at one another  thou seest i said they have taken away the door  is there aught with which we may fill the place  speak quickly for they will be on us ere the daylight  i spoke thus because i knew that we must hold this place or none as there were no inner doors in the palace the rooms being separated one from another by curtains  i also knew that if we could by any means defend this doorway the murderers could get in nowhere else for the palace is absolutely impregnable that is since the secret door by which sorais had entered on that memorable night of attempted murder had by nylepthas order been closed up with masonry  i have it said nyleptha who as usual with her rose to the emergency in a wonderful way  on the farther side of the courtyard are blocks of cut marble  the workmen brought them there for the bed of the new statue of incubu my lord let us block the door with them  i jumped at the idea and having despatched one of the remaining maidens down the great stair to see if she could obtain assistance from the docks below where her father who was a great merchant employing many men had his dwellingplace and set another to watch through the doorway we made our way back across the courtyard to where the hewn marble lay and here we met kara returning from despatching the first two messengers  there were the marble blocks sure enough broad massive lumps some six inches thick and weighing about eighty pounds each and there too were a couple of implements like small stretchers that the workmen used to carry them on  without delay we got some of the blocks on to the stretchers and four of the girls carried them to the doorway  listen macumazahn said umslopogaas if those low fellows come it is i who will hold the stair against them till the door is built up  nay nay it will be a mans death gainsay me not old friend  it has been a good day let it now be good night  see i throw myself down to rest on the marble there when their footsteps are nigh wake thou me not before for i need my strength and without a word he went outside and flung himself down on the marble and was instantly asleep  at this time i too was overcome and was forced to sit down by the doorway and content myself with directing operations the girls brought the block while kara and nyleptha built them up across the sixfootwide doorway a triple row of them for less would be useless  but the marble had to be brought forty yards and then there were forty yards to run back and though the girls laboured gloriously even staggering along alone each with a block in her arms it was slow work dreadfully slow  the light was growing now and presently in the silence we heard a commotion at the farbottom of the stair and the faint clinking of armed men  as yet the wall was only two feet high and we had been eight minutes at the building of it  so they had come  alphonse had heard aright  the clanking sound came nearer and in the ghostly grey of the dawning we could make out long files of men some fifty or so in all slowly creeping up the stair  they were now at the halfway standing place that rested on the great flying arch and here perceiving that something was going on above they to our great gain halted for three or four minutes and consulted then slowly and cautiously advanced again  we had been nearly a quarter of an hour at the work now and it was almost three feet high  then i woke umslopogaas  the great man rose stretched himself and swung inkosikaas round his head  it is well he said  i feel as a young man once more  my strength has come back to me ay even as a lamp flares up before it dies  fear not i shall fight a good fight the wine and the sleep have put a new heart into me  macumazahn i have dreamed a dream  i dreamed that thou and i stood together on a star and looked down on the world and thou wast as a spirit macumazahn for light flamed through thy flesh but i could not see what was the fashion of mine own face the hour has come for us old hunter  so be it we have had our time but i would that in it i had seen some more such fights as yesterdays  let them bury me after the fashion of my people macumazahn and set my eyes towards zululand and he took my hand and shook it and then turned to face the advancing foe  just then to my astonishment the zuvendi officer kara clambered over our improvised wall in his quiet determined sort of way and took his stand by the zulu unsheathing his sword as he did so  what comest thou too laughed out the old warrior  welcome  a welcome to thee brave heart  ow for the man who can die like a man ow for the death grip and the ringing of steel ow we are ready  we wet our beaks like eagles our spears flash in the sun we shake our assegais and are hungry to fight who comes to give greeting to the chieftainess inkosikaas who would taste her kiss whereof the fruit is death  i the woodpecker i the slaughterer i the swiftfooted  i umslopogaas of the tribe of the maquilisini of the people of amazulu a captain of the regiment of the nkomabakosi i umslopogaas the son of indabazimbi the son of arpi the son of mosilikaatze i of the royal blood of tchaka i of the kings house i the ringed man i the induna i call to them as a buck calls i challenge them i await them  ow it is thou it is thou  as he spake or rather chanted his wild warsong the armed men among whom in the growing light i recognized both nasta and agon came streaming up the stair with a rush and one big fellow armed with a heavy spear dashed up the ten semicircular steps ahead of his comrades and struck at the great zulu with the spear  umslopogaas moved his body but not his legs so that the blow missed him and next instant inkosikaas crashed through headpiece hair and skull and the mans corpse was rattling down the steps  as he dropped his round hippopotamushide shield fell from his hand on to the marble and the zulu stooped down and seized it still chanting as he did so  in another second the sturdy kara had also slain a man and then began a scene the like of which has not been known to me  up rushed the assailants one two three at a time and as fast as they came the axe crashed and the sword swung and down they rolled again dead or dying  and ever as the fight thickened the old zulus eye seemed to get quicker and his arm stronger he shouted out his warcries and the names of chiefs whom he had slain and the blows of his awful axe rained straight and true shearing through everything they fell on  there was none of the scientific method he was so fond of about this last immortal fight of his he had no time for it but struck with his full strength and at every stroke a man sank in his tracks and went rattling down the marble steps  they hacked and hewed at him with swords and spears wounding him in a dozen places till he streamed red with blood but the shield protected his head and the chainshirt his vitals and for minute after minute aided by the gallant zuvendi he still held the stair  at last karas sword broke and he grappled with a foe and they rolled down together and he was cut to pieces dying like the brave man that he was  umslopogaas was alone now but he never blenched or turned shouting out some wild zulu battlecry he beat down a foe ay and another and another till at last they drew back from the slippery bloodstained steps and stared at him with amazement thinking that he was no mortal man  the wall of marble block was four feet six high now and hope rose in my teeth as i leaned there against it a miserable helpless log and ground my teeth and watched that glorious struggle i could do no more for i had lost my revolver in the battle  and old umslopogaas he leaned too on his good axe and faint as he was with wounds he mocked them he called them women  the grand old warrior standing there one against so many and for a breathing space none would come against him notwithstanding nastas exhortations till at last old agon who to do him justice was a brave man mad with baffled rage and seeing that the wall would soon be built and his plans defeated shook the great spear he held and rushed up the dripping steps  ah ah shouted the zulu as he recognized the priests flowing white beard it is thou old witchfinder  come on  i await thee white medicine man come on come on  i have sworn to slay thee and i ever keep my faith  on he came taking him at his word and drave the big spear with such force at umslopogaas that it sunk right through the tough shield and pierced him in the neck  the zulu cast down the transfixed shield and that moment was agons last for before he could free his spear and strike again with a shout of theres for thee rainmaker umslopogaas gripped inkosikaas with both hands and whirled on high and drave her right on to his venerable head so that agon rolled down dead among the corpses of his fellowmurderers and there was an end to him and his plots altogether and even as he fell a great cry rose from the foot of the stair and looking out through the portion of the doorway that was yet unclosed we saw armed men rushing up to the rescue and called an answer to their shouts  then the wouldbe murderers who yet remained on the stairway and amongst whom i saw several priests turned to fly but having nowhere to go were butchered as they fled  only one man stayed and he was the great lord nasta nylepthas suitor and the father of the plot  for a moment the blackbearded nasta stood with bowed face leaning on his long sword as though in despair and then with a dreadful shout he too rushed up at the zulu and swinging the glittering sword around his head dealt him such a mighty blow beneath his guard that the keen steel of the heavy blade bit right through the chain armour and deep into umslopogaas side for a moment paralysing him and causing him to drop his axe  raising the sword again nasta sprang forward to make an end of him but little he knew his foe  with a shake and a yell of fury the zulu gathered himself together and sprang straight at nastas throat as i have sometimes seen a wounded lion spring he struck him full as his foot was on the topmost stair and his long arms closing round him like iron bands down they rolled together struggling furiously  nasta was a strong man and a desperate but he could not match the strongest man in zululand sore wounded though he was whose strength was as the strength of a bull  in a minute the end came  i saw old umslopogaas stagger to his feet  ay and saw him by a single gigantic effort swing up the struggling nasta and with a shout of triumph hurl him straight over the parapet of the bridge to be crushed to powder on the rocks two hundred feet below  the succour which had been summoned by the girl who had passed down the stair before the assassins passed up was at hand and the loud shouts which reached us from the outer gates told us that the town was also aroused and the men awakened by the women were calling to be admitted  some of nylepthas brave ladies who in their nightshifts and with their long hair streaming down their backs just as they had been aroused from rest went off to admit them at the side entrance whilst others assisted by the rescuing party outside pushed and pulled down the marble blocks they had placed there with so much labour  soon the wall was down again and through the doorway followed by a crowd of rescuers staggered old umslopogaas an awful and in a way a glorious figure  the man was a mass of wounds and a glance at his wild eye told me that he was dying  the keshla gumring upon his head was severed in two places by swordcuts one just over the curious hole in his skull and the blood poured down his face from the gashes  also on the right side of his neck was a stab from a spear inflicted by agon there was a deep cut on his left arm just below where the mail shirtsleeve stopped and on the right side of his body the armour was severed by a gash six inches long where nastas mighty sword had bitten through it and deep into its wearers vitals  on axe in hand he staggered that dreadfullooking splendid savage and the ladies forgot to turn faint at the scene of blood and cheered him as well they might but he never stayed or heeded with outstretched arms and tottering gait he pursued his way followed by us all along the broad shellstrewn walk that ran through the courtyard past the spot where the blocks of marble lay through the round arched doorway and the thick curtains that hung within it down the short passage and into the great hall which was now filling with hastilyarmed men who poured through the side entrance  straight up the hall he went leaving behind him a track of blood on the marble pavement till at last he reached the sacred stone which stood in the centre of it and here his strength seemed to fail him for he stopped and leaned upon his axe  then suddenly he lifted up his voice and cried aloud   i die i die  but it was a kingly fray  where are they who came up the great stair  i see them not  art thou there macumazahn or art thou gone before to wait for me in the dark whither i go  the blood blinds me  the place turns round  i hear the voice of waters  next as though a new thought had struck him he lifted the red axe and kissed the blade  farewell inkosikaas he cried  nay nay we will go together we cannot part thou and i  we have lived too long one with another thou and i  one more stroke only one  a good stroke a straight stroke a strong stroke and drawing himself to his full height with a wild heartshaking shout he with both hands began to whirl the axe round his head till it looked like a circle of flaming steel then suddenly with awful force he brought it down straight on to the crown of the mass of sacred stone  a shower of sparks flew up and such was the almost superhuman strength of the blow that the massive marble split with a rending sound into a score of pieces whilst of inkosikaas there remained but some fragments of steel and a fibrous rope of shattered horn that had been the handle  down with a crash on to the pavement fell the fragments of the holy stone and down with a crash on to them still grasping the knob of inkosikaas fell the brave old zulu  dead  and thus the hero died  a gasp of wonder and astonishment rose from all those who witnessed the extraordinary sight and then somebody cried the prophecy the prophecy  he has shattered the sacred stone and at once a murmuring arose  ay said nyleptha with that quick wit which distinguishes her  ay my people he has shattered the stone and behold the prophecy is fulfilled for a stranger king rules in zuvendis incubu my lord hath beat sorais back and i fear her no more and to him who hath saved the crown it shall surely be  and this man she said turning to me and laying her hand upon my shoulder wot ye that though wounded in the fight of yesterday he rode with that old warrior who lies there one hundred miles twixt sun set and rise to save me from the plots of cruel men ay and he has saved me by a very little and therefore because of the deeds that they have done  deeds of glory such as our history cannot show the like  therefore i say that the name of macumazahn and the name of dead umslopogaas ay and the name of kara my servant who aided him to hold the stair shall be blazoned in letters of gold above my throne and shall be glorious for ever while the land endures  i the queen have said it  this spirited speech was met with loud cheering and i said that after all we had only done our duty as it is the fashion of both englishmen and zulus to do and there was nothing to make an outcry about at which they cheered still more and then i was supported across the outer courtyard to my old quarters in order that i might be put to bed  as i went my eyes lit upon the brave horse daylight that lay there his white head outstretched on the pavement exactly as he had fallen on entering the yard and i bade those who supported me take me near him that i might look on the good beast once more before he was dragged away  and as i looked to my astonishment he opened his eyes and lifting his head a little whinnied faintly  i could have shouted for joy to find that he was not dead only unfortunately i had not a shout left in me but as it was grooms were sent for and he was lifted up and wine poured down his throat and in a fortnight he was as well and strong as ever and is the pride and joy of all the people of milosis who whenever they see him point him out to the little children as the horse which saved the white queens life  then i went on and got off to bed and was washed and had my mail shirt removed  they hurt me a great deal in getting it off and no wonder for on my left breast and side was a black bruise the size of a saucer  the next thing that i remember was the tramp of horsemen outside the palace wall some ten hours later  i raised myself and asked what was the news and they told me that a large body of cavalry sent by curtis to assist the queen had arrived from the scene of the battle which they had left two hours after sundown when they left the wreck of sorais army was in full retreat upon marstuna followed by all our effective cavalry  sir henry was encamping the remains of his wornout forces on the site such is the fortune of war that sorais had occupied the night before and proposed marching to marstuna on the morrow  having heard this i felt that i could die with a light heart and then everything became a blank   when next i awoke the first thing i saw was the round disc of a sympathetic eyeglass behind which was good  how are you getting on old chap said a voice from the neighbourhood of the eyeglass  what are you doing here i asked faintly  you ought to be at marstuna  have you run away or what  marstuna he replied cheerfully  ah marstuna fell last week  youve been unconscious for a fortnight you see  with all the honours of war you know  trumpets blowing flags flying just as though they had had the best of it but for all that werent they glad to go  israel made for his tents i can tell you  never saw such a sight in my life  and sorais i asked  sorais  oh sorais is a prisoner they gave her up the scoundrels he added with a change of tone  sacrificed the queen to save their skins you see  she is being brought up here and i dont know what will happen to her poor soul and he sighed  where is curtis i asked  he is with nyleptha  she rode out to meet us today and there was a grand todo i can tell you  he is coming to see you tomorrow the doctors for there is a medical faculty in zuvendis as elsewhere thought that he had better not come today  i said nothing but somehow i thought to myself that notwithstanding the doctors he might have given me a look but there when a man is newly married and has just gained a great victory he is apt to listen to the advice of doctors and quite right too  just then i heard a familiar voice informing me that monsieur must now couch himself and looking up perceived alphonses enormous black mustachios curling away in the distance  so you are here i said  mais oui monsieur the war is now finished my military instincts are satisfied and i return to nurse monsieur  i laughed or rather tried to but whatever may have been alphonses failings as a warrior and i fear that he did not come up to the level of his heroic grandfather in this particular showing thereby how true is the saying that it is a bad thing to be overshadowed by some great ancestral name a better or kinder nurse never lived  poor alphonse  i hope he will always think of me as kindly as i think of him  on the morrow i saw curtis and nyleptha with him and he told me the whole history of what had happened since umslopogaas and i galloped wildly away from the battle to save the life of the queen  it seemed to me that he had managed the thing exceedingly well and showed great ability as a general  of course however our loss had been dreadfully heavy  indeed i am afraid to say how many perished in the desperate battle i have described but i know that the slaughter has appreciably affected the male population of the country  he was very pleased to see me dear fellow that he is and thanked me with tears in his eyes for the little that i had been able to do  i saw him however start violently when his eyes fell upon my face  as for nyleptha she was positively radiant now that her dear lord had come back with no other injury than an ugly scar on his forehead  i do not believe that she allowed all the fearful slaughter that had taken place to weigh ever so little in the balance against this one fact or even to greatly diminish her joy and i cannot blame her for it seeing that it is the nature of loving woman to look at all things through the spectacles of her love and little does she reck of the misery of the many if the happiness of the one be assured  that is human nature which the positivists tell us is just perfection so no doubt it is all right  and what art thou going to do with sorais i asked her  instantly her bright brow darkened to a frown  sorais she said with a little stamp of the foot ah but sorais  sir henry hastened to turn the subject  you will soon be about and all right again now old fellow he said  i shook my head and laughed  dont deceive yourselves i said  i may be about for a little but i shall never be all right again  i am a dying man curtis i may die slow but die i must  do you know i have been spitting blood all the morning  i tell you there is something working away into my lung i can feel it  there dont look distressed i have had my day and am ready to go  give me the mirror will you i want to look at myself  he made some excuse but i saw through it and insisted and at last he handed me one of the discs of polished silver set in a wooden frame like a handscreen which serve as lookingglasses in zuvendis  i looked and put it down  ah i said quietly i thought so and you talk of my getting all right  i did not like to let them see how shocked i really was at my own appearance  my grizzled stubby hair was turned snowwhite and my yellow face was shrunk like an aged womans and had two deep purple rings painted beneath the eyes  here nyleptha began to cry and sir henry again turned the subject telling me that the artists had taken a cast of the dead body of old umslopogaas and that a great statue in black marble was to be erected of him in the act of splitting the sacred stone which was to be matched by another statue in white marble of myself and the horse daylight as he appeared when at the termination of that wild ride he sank beneath me in the courtyard of the palace  i have since seen these statues which at the time of writing this six months after the battle are nearly finished and very beautiful they are especially that of umslopogaas which is exactly like him  as for that of myself it is good but they have idealized my ugly face a little which is perhaps as well seeing that thousands of people will probably look at it in the centuries to come and it is not pleasant to look at ugly things  then they told me that umslopogaas last wish had been carried out and that instead of being cremated as i shall be after the usual custom here he had been tied up zulu fashion with his knees beneath his chin and having been wrapped in a thin sheet of beaten gold entombed in a hole hollowed out of the masonry of the semicircular space at the top of the stair he defended so splendidly which faces as far as we can judge almost exactly towards zululand  there he sits and will sit for ever for they embalmed him with spices and put him in an airtight stone coffer keeping his grim watch beneath the spot he held alone against a multitude and the people say that at night his ghost rises and stands shaking the phantom of inkosikaas at phantom foes  certainly they fear during the dark hours to pass the place where the hero is buried  oddly enough too a new legend or prophecy has arisen in the land in that unaccountable way in which such things to arise among barbarous and semicivilized people blowing like the wind no man knows whence  according to this saying so long as the old zulu sits there looking down the stairway he defended when alive so long will the new house of the stairway springing from the union of the englishman and nyleptha endure and flourish but when he is taken from thence or when ages after his bones at last crumble into dust the house will fall and the stairway shall fall and the nation of the zuvendi shall cease to be a nation     chapter xxiii i have spoken    it was a week after nylepthas visit when i had begun to get about a little in the middle of the day that a message came to me from sir henry to say that sorais would be brought before them in the queens first antechamber at midday and requesting my attendance if possible  accordingly greatly drawn by curiosity to see this unhappy woman once more i made shift with the help of that kind little fellow alphonse who is a perfect treasure to me and that of another waitingman to reach the antechamber i got there indeed before anybody else except a few of the great court officials who had been bidden to be present but i had scarcely seated myself before sorais was brought in by a party of guards looking as beautiful and defiant as ever but with a worn expression on her proud face  she was as usual dressed in her royal kaf emblazoned with the emblem of the sun and in her right hand she still held the toy spear of silver a pang of admiration and pity went through me as i looked at her and struggling to my feet i bowed deeply at the same time expressing my sorrow that i was not able owing to my condition to remain standing before her  she coloured a little and then laughed bitterly  thou dost forget macumazahn she said i am no more a queen save in blood i am an outcast and a prisoner one whom all men should scorn and none show deference to  at least i replied thou art still a lady and therefore one to whom deference is due  also thou art in an evil case and therefore it is doubly due  ah she answered with a little laugh thou dost forget that i would have wrapped thee in a sheet of gold and hung thee to the angels trumpet at the topmost pinnacle of the temple  no i answered i assure thee that i forgot it not indeed i often thought of it when it seemed to me that the battle of the pass was turning against us but the trumpet is there and i am still here though perchance not for long so why talk of it now  ah she went on the battle the battle  oh would that i were once more a queen if only for one little hour and i would take such a vengeance on those accursed jackals who deserted me in my need that it should only be spoken of in whispers those woman those pigeonhearted halfbreeds who suffered themselves to be overcome and she choked in her wrath  ay and that little coward beside thee she went on pointing at alphonse with the silver spear whereat he looked very uncomfortable he escaped and betrayed my plans  i tried to make a general of him telling the soldiers it was bougwan and to scourge valour into him here alphonse shivered at some unhappy recollection but it was of no avail  he hid beneath a banner in my tent and thus overheard my plans i would that i had slain him but alas i held my hand  and thou macumazahn i have heard of what thou didst thou art brave and hast a loyal heart  and the black one too ah he was a man  i would fain have seen him hurl nasta from the stairway  thou art a strange woman sorais i said i pray thee now plead with the queen nyleptha that perchance she may show mercy unto thee  she laughed out loud  i plead for mercy she said and at that moment the queen entered accompanied by sir henry and good and took her seat with an impassive face  as for poor good he looked intensely ill at ease  greeting sorais said nyleptha after a short pause  thou hast rent the kingdom like a rag thou hast put thousands of my people to the sword thou hast twice basely plotted to destroy my life by murder thou hast sworn to slay my lord and his companions and to hurl me from the stairway  what hast thou to say why thou shouldst not die  speak o sorais  methinks my sister the queen hath forgotten the chief count of the indictment answered sorais in her slow musical tones it runs thus thou didst strive to win the love of my lord incubu  it is for this crime that my sister will slay me not because i levied war  it is perchance happy for thee nyleptha that i fixed my mind upon his love too late  listen she went on raising her voice  i have nought to say save that i would i had won instead of lost  do thou with me even as thou wilt o queen and let my lord the king there pointing to sir henry  for now will he be king  carry out the sentence as it is meet he should for as he is the beginning of the evil let him also be the end  and she drew herself up and shot one angry glance at him from her deep fringed eyes and then began to toy with her spear  sir henry bent towards nyleptha and whispered something that i could not catch and then the queen spoke  sorais ever have i been a good sister to thee  when our father died and there was much talk in the land as to whether thou shouldst sit upon the throne with me i being the elder i gave my voice for thee and said nay let her sit  she is twin with me we were born at a birth wherefore should the one be preferred before the other  and so has it ever been twixt thee and me my sister  but now thou knowest in what sort thou hast repaid me but i have prevailed and thy life is forfeit sorais  and yet art thou my sister born at a birth with me and we played together when we were little and loved each other much and at night we slept in the same cot with our arms each around the others neck and therefore even now does my heart go out to thee sorais  but not for that would i spare thy life for thy offence has been too heavy it doth drag down the wide wings of my mercy even to the ground  also while thou dost live the land will never be at peace  yet shalt thou not die sorais because my dear lord here hath begged thy life of me as a boon therefore as a boon and as a marriage gift give i it to him to do with even as he wills knowing that though thou dost love him he loves thee not sorais for all thy beauty  nay though thou art lovely as the night in all her stars o lady of the night yet it is me his wife whom he loves and not thee and therefore do i give thy life to him  sorais flushed up to her eyes and said nothing and i do not think that i ever saw a man look more miserable than did sir henry at that moment  somehow nylepthas way of putting the thing though true and forcible enough was not altogether pleasant  i understand stammered curtis looking at good i understood that he were attached  eh  attached to  to the queen sorais i am  eh  not aware what the  in short the state of your feelings may be just now but if they happened to be that way inclined it has struck me that  in short it might put a satisfactory end to an unpleasant business  the lady also has ample private estates where i am sure she would be at liberty to live unmolested as far as we are concerned eh nyleptha  of course i only suggest  so far as i am concerned said good colouring up i am quite willing to forget the past and if the lady of the night thinks me worth the taking i will marry her tomorrow or when she likes and try to make her a good husband  all eyes were now turned to sorais who stood with that same slow smile upon her beautiful face which i had noticed the first time that i ever saw her  she paused a little while and cleared her throat and then thrice she curtseyed low once to nyleptha once to curtis and once to good and began to speak in measured tones  i thank thee most gracious queen and royal sister for the lovingkindness thou hast shown me from my youth up and especially in that thou hast been pleased to give my person and my fate as a gift to the lord incubu  the king that is to be  may prosperity peace and plenty deck the lifepath of one so merciful and so tender even as flowers do  long mayst thou reign o great and glorious queen and hold thy husbands love in both thy hands and many be the sons and daughters of thy beauty and i thank thee my lord incubu  the king that is to be  i thank thee a thousand times in that thou hast been pleased to accept that gracious gift and to pass it on to thy comrade in arms and in adventure the lord bougwan  surely the act is worthy of thy greatness my lord incubu  and now lastly i thank thee also my lord bougwan who in thy turn hast deigned to accept me and my poor beauty  i thank thee a thousand times and i will add that thou art a good and honest man and i put my hand upon my heart and swear that i would that i could say thee yea  and now that i have rendered thanks to all in turn  and again she smiled  i will add one short word  little can you understand of me queen nyleptha and my lords if ye know not that for me there is no middle path that i scorn your pity and hate you for it that i cast off your forgiveness as though it were a serpents sting and that standing here betrayed deserted insulted and alone i yet triumph over you mock you and defy you one and all and thus i answer you and then of a sudden before anybody guessed what she intended to do she drove the little silver spear she carried in her hand into her side with such a strong and steady aim that the keen point projected through her back and she fell prone upon the pavement  nyleptha shrieked and poor good almost fainted at the sight while the rest of us rushed towards her  but sorais of the night lifted herself upon her hand and for a moment fixed her glorious eyes intently on curtis face as though there were some message in the glance then dropped her head and sighed and with a sob her dark but splendid spirit passed  well they gave her a royal funeral and there was an end of her   it was a month after the last act of the sorais tragedy that a great ceremony was held in the flower temple and curtis was formally declared kingconsort of zuvendis  i was too ill to go myself and indeed i hate all that sort of thing with the crowds and the trumpetblowing and bannerwaving but good who was there in his fulldress uniform came back much impressed and told me that nyleptha had looked lovely and curtis had borne himself in a right royal fashion and had been received with acclamations that left no doubt as to his popularity  also he told me that when the horse daylight was led along in the procession the populace had shouted macumazahn macumazahn till they were hoarse and would only be appeased when he good rose in his chariot and told them that i was too ill to be present  afterwards too sir henry or rather the king came to see me looking very tired and vowing that he had never been so bored in his life but i dare say that that was a slight exaggeration it is not in human nature that a man should be altogether bored on such an extraordinary occasion and indeed as i pointed out to him it was a marvellous thing that a man who but little more than one short year before had entered a great country as an unknown wanderer should today be married to its beautiful and beloved queen and lifted amidst public rejoicings to its throne  i even went the length to exhort him in the future not to be carried away by the pride and pomp of absolute power but always to strive to remember that he was first a christian gentleman and next a public servant called by providence to a great and almost unprecedented trust  these remarks which he might fairly have resented he was so good as to receive with patience and even to thank me for making them  it was immediately after this ceremony that i caused myself to be moved to the house where i am now writing  it is a very pleasant country seat situated about two miles from the frowning city on to which it looks  that was five months ago during the whole of which time i have being confined to a kind of couch employed my leisure in compiling this history of our wanderings from my journal and from our joint memories  it is probable that it will never be read but it does not much matter whether it is or not at any rate it has served to while away many hours of suffering for i have suffered a deal of pain lately  thank god however there will not be much more of it   it is a week since i wrote the above and now i take up my pen for the last time for i know that the end is at hand  my brain is still clear and i can manage to write though with difficulty the pain in my lung which has been very bad during the last week has suddenly quite left me and been succeeded by a feeling of numbness of which i cannot mistake the meaning  and just as the pain has gone so with it all fear of that end has departed and i feel only as though i were going to sink into the arms of an unutterable rest  happily contentedly and with the same sense of security with which an infant lays itself to sleep in its mothers arms do i lay myself down in the arms of the angel death  all the tremors all the heartshaking fears which have haunted me through a life that seems long as i looked back upon it have left me now the storms have passed and the star of our eternal hope shines clear and steady on the horizon that seems so far from man and yet is so very near to me tonight  and so this is the end of it  a brief space of troubling a few restless fevered anguished years and then the arms of that great angel death  many times have i been near to them and now it is my turn at last and it is well  twentyfour hours more and the world will be gone from me and with it all its hopes and all its fears  the air will close in over the space that my form filled and my place know me no more for the dull breath of the worlds forgetfulness will first dim the brightness of my memory and then blot it out for ever and of a truth i shall be dead  so is it with us all  how many millions have lain as i lie and thought these thoughts and been forgotten  thousands upon thousands of years ago they thought them those dying men of the dim past and thousands on thousands of years hence will their descendants think them and be in their turn forgotten  as the breath of the oxen in winter as the quick star that runs along the sky as a little shadow that loses itself at sunset as i once heard a zulu called ignosi put it such is the order of our life the order that passeth away  well it is not a good world  nobody can say that it is save those who wilfully blind themselves to facts  how can a world be good in which money is the moving power and selfinterest the guiding star  the wonder is not that it is so bad but that there should be any good left in it  still now that my life is over i am glad to have lived glad to have known the dear breath of womans love and that true friendship which can even surpass the love of woman glad to have heard the laughter of little children to have seen the sun and the moon and the stars to have felt the kiss of the salt sea on my face and watched the wild game trek down to the water in the moonlight  but i should not wish to live again  everything is changing to me  the darkness draws near and the light departs  and yet it seems to me that through that darkness i can already see the shining welcome of many a longlost face harry is there and others one above all to my mind the sweetest and most perfect woman that ever gladdened this grey earth but of her i have already written elsewhere and at length so why speak of her now  why speak of her after this long silence now that she is again so near to me now that i go where she has gone  the sinking sun is turning the golden roof of the great temple to a fiery flame and my fingers tire  so to all who have known me or known of me to all who can think one kindly thought of the old hunter i stretch out my hand from the faroff shore and bid a long farewell  and now into the hands of almighty god who sent it do i commit my spirit  i have spoken as the zulus say     chapter xxiv  by another hand    a year has elapsed since our most dear friend allan quatermain wrote the words i have spoken at the end of his record of our adventures  nor should i have ventured to make any additions to the record had it not happened that by a most strange accident a chance has arisen of its being conveyed to england  the chance is but a faint one it is true but as it is not probable that another will arise in our lifetimes good and myself think that we may as well avail ourselves of it such as it is  during the last six months several frontier commissions have been at work on the various boundaries of zuvendis with a view of discovering whether there exists any possible means of ingress or egress from the country with the result that a channel of communication with the outer world hitherto overlooked has been discovered this channel apparently the only one for i have discovered that it was by it that the native who ultimately reached mr mackenzies mission station and whose arrival in the country together with the fact of his expulsion  for he did arrive about three years before ourselves  was for reasons of their own kept a dead secret by the priests to whom he was brought is about to be effectually closed  but before this is done a messenger is to be despatched bearing with him this manuscript and also one or two letters from good to his friends and from myself to my brother george whom it deeply grieves me to think i shall never see again informing them as our next heirs that they are welcome to our effects in england if the court of probate will allow them to take them endnote 22 inasmuchas we have made up our minds never to return to europe  indeed it would be impossible for us to leave zuvendis even if we wished to do so  the messenger who is to go  and i wish him joy of his journey  is alphonse  for a long while he has been wearied to death of zuvendis and its inhabitants  oh oui cest beau he says with an expressive shrug mais je mennuie ce nest pas chic  again he complains dreadfully of the absence of cafes and theatres and moans continually for his lost annette of whom he says he dreams three times a week  but i fancy his secret cause of disgust at the country putting aside the homesickness to which every frenchman is subject is that the people here laugh at him so dreadfully about his conduct on the occasion of the great battle of the pass about eighteen months ago when he hid beneath a banner in soraiss tent in order to avoid being sent forth to fight which he says would have gone against his conscience even the little boys call out at him in the streets thereby offending his pride and making his life unbearable  at any rate he has determined to brave the horrors of a journey of almost unprecedented difficulty and danger and also to run the risk of falling into the hands of the french police to answer for a certain little indiscretion of his own some years old though i do not consider that a very serious matter rather than remain in ce triste pays  poor alphonse we shall be very sorry to part with him but i sincerely trust for his own sake and also for the sake of this history which is i think worth giving to the world that he may arrive in safety  if he does and can carry the treasure we have provided him with in the shape of bars of solid gold he will be comparatively speaking a rich man for life and well able to marry his annette if she is still in the land of the living and willing to marry her alphonse  anyhow on the chance i may as well add a word or two to dear old quatermains narrative  he died at dawn on the day following that on which he wrote the last words of the last chapter  nyleptha good and myself were present and a most touching and yet in its way beautiful scene it was  an hour before the daybreak it became apparent to us that he was sinking and our distress was very keen  indeed good melted into tears at the idea  a fact that called forth a last gentle flicker of humour from our dying friend for even at that hour he could be humorous  goods emotion had by loosening the muscles naturally caused his eyeglass to fall from its accustomed place and quatermain who always observed everything observed this also  at last he gasped with an attempt at a smile i have seen good without his eyeglass  after that he said no more till the day broke when he asked to be lifted up to watch the rising of the sun for the last time  in a very few minutes he said after gazing earnestly at it i shall have passed through those golden gates  ten minutes afterwards he raised himself and looked us fixedly in the face  i am going a stranger journey than any we have ever taken together think of me sometimes he murmured  god bless you all i shall wait for you  and with a sigh he fell back dead  and so passed away a character that i consider went as near perfection as any it has ever been my lot to encounter  tender constant humorous and possessing of many of the qualities that go to make a poet he was yet almost unrivalled as a man of action and a citizen of the world  i never knew any one so competent to form an accurate judgment of men and their motives i have studied human nature all my life he would say and i ought to know something about it and he certainly did he had but two faults  one was his excessive modesty and the other a slight tendency which he had to be jealous of anybody on whom he concentrated his affections  as regards the first of these points anybody who reads what he has written will be able to form his own opinion but i will add one last instance of it  as the reader will doubtless remember it is a favourite trick of his to talk of himself as a timid man whereas really though very cautious he possessed a most intrepid spirit and what is more never lost his head  well in the great battle of the pass where he got the wound that finally killed him one would imagine from the account which he gives of the occurrence that it was a chance blow that fell on him in the scrimmage  as a matter of fact however he was wounded in a most gallant and successful attempt to save goods life at the risk and as it ultimately turned out at the cost of his own  good was down on the ground and one of nastas highlanders was about to dispatch him when quatermain threw himself on to his prostrate form and received the blow on his own body and then rising killed the soldier  as regards his jealousy a single instance which i give in justice to myself and nyleptha will suffice  the reader will perhaps recollect that in one or two places he speaks as though nyleptha monopolized me and he was left by both of us rather out in the cold  now nyleptha is not perfect any more than any other woman is and she may be a little exigeante at times but as regards quatermain the whole thing is pure imagination  thus when he complains about my not coming to see him when he is ill the fact was that in spite of my entreaties the doctors positively forbade it  those little remarks of his pained me very much when i read them for i loved quatermain as dearly as though he were my own father and should never have dreamed of allowing my marriage to interfere with that affection  but let it pass it is after all but one little weakness which makes no great show among so many and such lovable virtues  well he died and good read the burial service over him in the presence of nyleptha and myself and then his remains were in deference to the popular clamour accorded a great public funeral or rather cremation  i could not help thinking however as i marched in that long and splendid procession up to the temple how he would have hated the whole thing could he have been there to see it for he had a horror of ostentation  and so a few minutes before sunset on the third night after his death they laid him on the brazen flooring before the altar and waited for the last ray of the setting sun to fall upon his face  presently it came and struck him like a golden arrow crowning the pale brows with glory and then the trumpets blew and the flooring revolved and all that remained of our beloved friend fell into the furnace below  we shall never see his like again if we live a hundred years he was the ablest man the truest gentleman the firmest friend the finest sportsman and i believe the best shot in all africa  and so ended the very remarkable and adventurous life of hunter quatermain   since then things have gone very well with us  good has been and still is busily employed in the construction of a navy on lake milosis and another of the large lakes by means of which we hope to be able to increase trade and commerce and also to overcome some very troublesome and warlike sections of the population who live upon their borders  poor fellow he is beginning to get over the sad death of that misguided but most attractive woman sorais but it is a sad blow to him for he was really deeply attached to her  i hope however that he will in time make a suitable marriage and get that unhappy business out of his head  nyleptha has one or two young ladies in view especially a daughter of nastas who was a widower a very fine imperiallooking girl but with too much of her fathers intriguing and yet haughty spirit to suit my taste  as for myself i should scarcely know where to begin if i set to work to describe my doings so i had best leave them undescribed and content myself with saying that on the whole i am getting on very well in my curious position of kingconsort  better indeed than i had any right to expect  but of course it is not all plain sailing and i find the responsibilities very heavy still i hope to be able to do some good in my time and i intend to devote myself to two great ends  namely to the consolidation of the various clans which together make up the zuvendi people under one strong central government and to the sapping of the power of the priesthood  the first of these reforms will if it can be carried out put an end to the disastrous civil wars that have for centuries devastated this country and the second besides removing a source of political danger will pave the road for the introduction of true religion in the place of this senseless sun worship  i yet hope to see the shadow of the cross of christ lying on the golden dome of the flower temple or if i do not that my successors may  there is one more thing that i intend to devote myself to and that is the total exclusion of all foreigners from zuvendis not indeed that any more are ever likely to get here but if they do i warn them fairly that they will be shown the shortest way out of the country  i do not say this from any sense of inhospitality but because i am convinced of the sacred duty that rests upon me of preserving to this on the whole upright and generoushearted people the blessings of comparative barbarism where would all my brave army be if some enterprising rascal were to attack us with fieldguns and martinihenrys  i cannot see that gunpowder telegraphs steam daily newspapers universal suffrage etc etc have made mankind one whit the happier than they used to be and i am certain that they have brought many evils in their train  i have no fancy for handing over this beautiful country to be torn and fought for by speculators tourists politicians and teachers whose voice is as the voice of babel just as those horrible creatures in the valley of the underground river tore and fought for the body of the wild swan nor will i endow it with the greed drunkenness new diseases gunpowder and general demoralization which chiefly mark the progress of civilization amongst unsophisticated peoples  if in due course it pleases providence to throw zuvendis open to the world that is another matter but of myself i will not take the responsibility and i may add that good entirely approves of my decision  farewell  henry curtis   december 15 18  ps  i quite forgot to say that about nine months ago nyleptha who is very well and in my eyes at any rate more beautiful than ever presented me with a son and heir  he is a regular curlyhaired blueeyed young englishman in looks and though he is destined if he lives to inherit the throne of zuvendis i hope i may be able to bring him up to become what an english gentleman should be and generally is  which is to my mind even a prouder and a finer thing than being born heir apparent to the great house of the stairway and indeed the highest rank that a man can reach upon this earth  h c     note by george curtis esq    the ms of this history addressed to me in the handwriting of my dear brother henry curtis whom we had given up for dead and bearing the aden postmark reached me in safety on december 20 18 or a little more than two years after it left his hands in the far centre of africa and i hasten to give the astonishing story it contains to the world  speaking for myself i have read it with very mixed feelings for though it is a great relief to know that he and good are alive and strangely prosperous i cannot but feel that for me and for all their friends they might as well be dead since we can never hope to see them more  they have cut themselves off from old england and from their homes and their relations for ever and perhaps under the circumstances they were right and wise to do so  how the ms came to be posted i have been quite unable to discover but i presume from the fact of its being posted at all that the little frenchman alphonse accomplished his hazardous journey in safety  i have however advertised for him and caused various inquiries to be made in marseilles and elsewhere with a view of discovering his whereabouts but so far without the slightest success  possibly he is dead and the packet was posted by another hand or possibly he is now happily wedded to his annette but still fears the vengeance of the law and prefers to remain incognito i cannot say i have not yet abandoned my hopes of finding him but i am bound to say that they grow fainter day by day and one great obstacle to my search is that nowhere in the whole history does mr quatermain mention his surname  he is always spoken of as alphonse and there are so many alphonses the letters which my brother henry says he is sending with the packet of manuscript have never arrived so i presume that they are lost or destroyed  george curtis     authorities    a novelist is not usually asked like a historian for his quellen as i have however judging from certain experiences in the past some reason to anticipate such a demand i wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to mr thomsons admirable history of travel through masai land for much information as to the habits and customs of the tribes inhabiting that portion of the east coast and the country where they live also to my brother john g haggard rn hbms consul at madagascar and formerly consul at lamu for many details furnished by him of the mode of life and war of those engaging people the masai also to my sisterinlaw mrs john haggard who kindly put the lines of p 183 into rhyme for me also to an extract in a review from some book of travel of which i cannot recollect the name to which i owe the idea of the great crabs in the valley of the subterranean river endnote 23 but if i remember right the crabs in the book when irritated projected their eyes quite out of their heads i regret that i was not able to plagiarize this effect but i felt that although crabs may and doubtless do behave thus in real life in romance they will not do so  there is an underground river in peter wilkins but at the time of writing the foregoing pages i had not read that quaint but entertaining work  it has been pointed out to me that there exists a similarity between the scene of umslopogaas frightening alphonse with his axe and a scene in far from the madding crowd  i regret this coincidence and believe that the talented author of that work will not be inclined to accuse me of literary immorality on its account  finally i may say that mr quatermains little frenchman appears to belong to the same class of beings as those english ladies whose long yellow teeth and feet of enormous size excite our hearty amusement in the pages of the illustrated gallic press  the writer of allan quatermain   endnote 1  among the zulus a man assumes the ring which is made of a species of black gum twisted in with the hair and polished a brilliant black when he has reached a certain dignity and age or is the husband of a sufficient number of wives  till he is in a position to wear a ring he is looked on as a boy though he may be thirtyfive years of age or even more   a q   endnote 2  one of the fleetest of the african antelopes   a q   endnote 3  alluding to the zulu custom of opening the stomach of a dead foe  they have a superstition that if this is not done as the body of their enemy swells up so will the bodies of those who killed him swell up   a q   endnote 4  no doubt this owl was a wingless bird  i afterwards learnt that the hooting of an owl is a favourite signal among the masai tribes  a q   endnote 5  since i saw the above i have examined hundreds of these swords but have never been able to discover how the gold plates were inlaid in the fretwork  the armourers who make them in zuvendis bind themselves by oath not to reveal the secret   a q   endnote 6  the masai elmoran or young warriors can own no property so all the booty they may win in battle belongs to their fathers alone   a q   endnote 7  as i think i have already said one of umslopogaass zulu names was the woodpecker  i could never make out why he was called so until i saw him in action with inkosikaas when i at once recognized the resemblance   a q   endnote 8  by a sad coincidence since the above was written by mr quatermain the masai have in april 1886 massacred a missionary and his wife  mr and mrs houghton  on this very tana river and at the spot described  these are i believe the first white people who are known to have fallen victims to this cruel tribe   editor   endnote 9  mr allan quatermain misquotes  pleasure sat at the helm   editor   endnote 10  where alph the sacred river ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea   endnote 11  mr quatermain does not seem to have been aware that it is common for animalworshipping people to annually sacrifice the beasts they adore  see herodotus ii 45   editor   endnote 12  there is another theory which might account for the origin of the zuvendi which does not seem to have struck my friend mr quatermain and his companions and that is that they are descendants of the phoenicians  the cradle of the phoenician race is supposed to have been on the western shore of the persian gulf thence as there is good evidence to show they emigrated in two streams one of which took possession of the shores of palestine while the other is supposed by savants to have immigrated down the coast of eastern africa where near mozambique signs and remains of their occupation are not wanting  indeed it would have been very extraordinary if they did not when leaving the persian gulf make straight for the east coast seeing that the northeast monsoon blows for six months in the year dead in that direction while for the other six months it blows back again and by the way of illustrating the probability i may add that to this day a very extensive trade is carried on between the persian gulf and lamu and other east african ports as far south as madagascar which is of course the ancient ebony isle of the arabian nights   editor   endnote 13  there are twentytwo letters in the phoenician alphabet see appendix masperos histoire ancienne des peuples de lorient p 746 etc  unfortunately mr quatermain gives us no specimen of the zuvendi writing but what he here states seems to go a long way towards substantiating the theory advanced in the note on p 149   editor   endnote 14  these are internal measurements   a q   endnote 15  light was also admitted by sliding shutters under the eaves of the dome and in the roof   a q   endnote 16  this line is interesting as being one of the few allusions to be found in the zuvendi ritual to a vague divine essence independent of the material splendour of the orb they worship  taia the word used here has a very indeterminate meaning and signifies essence vital principle spirit or even god   endnote 17  alluding to the zulu custom   a q   endnote 18  in zuvendis members of the royal house can only be married by the high priest or a formally appointed deputy   a q   endnote 19  alluding to the zuvendi custom of carrying dead officers on a framework of spears   endnote 20  the zuvendi people do not use bows   a q   endnote 21  of course the roof of the temple being so high caught the light some time before the breaking of the dawn   a q   endnote 22  of course the court of probate would allow nothing of the sort   editor   endnote 23  it is suggested to me that this book is the cruise of the falcon with which work i am personally unacquainted
