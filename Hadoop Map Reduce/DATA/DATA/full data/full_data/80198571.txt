80198571	the point of view  by henry james     i  from miss aurora church at sea to miss whiteside in paris       my dear child the bromide of sodium if thats what you call it proved perfectly useless  i dont mean that it did me no good but that i never had occasion to take the bottle out of my bag  it might have done wonders for me if i had needed it but i didnt simply because i have been a wonder myself  will you believe that i have spent the whole voyage on deck in the most animated conversation and exercise  twelve times round the deck make a mile i believe and by this measurement i have been walking twenty miles a day  and down to every meal if you please where i have displayed the appetite of a fishwife  of course the weather has been lovely so theres no great merit  the wicked old atlantic has been as blue as the sapphire in my only ring a rather good one and as smooth as the slippery floor of madame galopins diningroom we have been for the last three hours in sight of land and we are soon to enter the bay of new york which is said to be exquisitely beautiful  but of course you recall it though they say that everything changes so fast over here  i find i dont remember anything for my recollections of our voyage to europe so many years ago are exceedingly dim i only have a painful impression that mamma shut me up for an hour every day in the stateroom and made me learn by heart some religious poem  i was only five years old and i believe that as a child i was extremely timid on the other hand mamma as you know was dreadfully severe  she is severe to this day only i have become indifferent i have been so pinched and pushedmorally speaking bien entendu  it is true however that there are children of five on the vessel today who have been extremely conspicuousranging all over the ship and always under ones feet  of course they are little compatriots which means that they are little barbarians  i dont mean that all our compatriots are barbarous they seem to improve somehow after their first communion  i dont know whether its that ceremony that improves them especially as so few of them go in for it but the women are certainly nicer than the little girls i mean of course in proportion you know  you warned me not to generalise and you see i have already begun before we have arrived  but i suppose there is no harm in it so long as it is favourable  isnt it favourable when i say that i have had the most lovely time  i have never had so much liberty in my life and i have been out alone as you may say every day of the voyage  if it is a foretaste of what is to come i shall take to that very kindly  when i say that i have been out alone i mean that we have always been two  but we two were alone so to speak and it was not like always having mamma or madame galopin or some lady in the pension or the temporary cook  mamma has been very poorly she is so very well on land its a wonder to see her at all taken down  she says however that it isnt the being at sea its on the contrary approaching the land  she is not in a hurry to arrive she says that great disillusions await us  i didnt know that she had any illusionsshes so stern so philosophic  she is very serious she sits for hours in perfect silence with her eyes fixed on the horizon  i heard her say yesterday to an english gentlemana very odd mr antrobus the only person with whom she conversesthat she was afraid she shouldnt like her native land and that she shouldnt like not liking it  but this is a mistakeshe will like that immensely i mean not liking it  if it should prove at all agreeable mamma will be furious for that will go against her system  you know all about mammas system i have explained that so often  it goes against her system that we should come back at all that was my systemi have had at last to invent one  she consented to come only because she saw that having no dot i should never marry in europe and i pretended to be immensely preoccupied with this idea in order to make her start  in reality cela mest parfaitement egal  i am only afraid i shall like it too much i dont mean marriage of course but ones native land  say what you will its a charming thing to go out alone and i have given notice to mamma that i mean to be always en course  when i tell her that she looks at me in the same silence her eye dilates and then she slowly closes it  its as if the sea were affecting her a little though its so beautifully calm  i ask her if she will try my bromide which is there in my bag but she motions me off and i begin to walk again tapping my little bootsoles upon the smooth clean deck  this allusion to my bootsoles by the way is not prompted by vanity but its a fact that at sea ones feet and ones shoes assume the most extraordinary importance so that we should take the precaution to have nice ones  they are all you seem to see as the people walk about the deck you get to know them intimately and to dislike some of them so much  i am afraid you will think that i have already broken loose and for aught i know i am writing as a demoiselle bienelevee should not write  i dont know whether its the american air if it is all i can say is that the american air is very charming  it makes me impatient and restless and i sit scribbling here because i am so eager to arrive and the time passes better if i occupy myself  i am in the saloon where we have our meals and opposite to me is a big round porthole wide open to let in the smell of the land  every now and then i rise a little and look through it to see whether we are arriving  i mean in the bay you know for we shall not come up to the city till dark  i dont want to lose the bay it appears that its so wonderful  i dont exactly understand what it contains except some beautiful islands but i suppose you will know all about that  it is easy to see that these are the last hours for all the people about me are writing letters to put into the post as soon as we come up to the dock  i believe they are dreadful at the customhouse and you will remember how many new things you persuaded mamma that with my preoccupation of marriage i should take to this country where even the prettiest girls are expected not to go unadorned  we ruined ourselves in paris that is part of mammas solemnity mais au moins je serai belle  moreover i believe that mamma is prepared to say or to do anything that may be necessary for escaping from their odious duties as she very justly remarks she cant afford to be ruined twice  i dont know how one approaches these terrible douaniers but i mean to invent something very charming  i mean to say voyons messieurs a young girl like me brought up in the strictest foreign traditions kept always in the background by a very superior motherla voila you can see for yourselfwhat is it possible that she should attempt to smuggle in  nothing but a few simple relics of her convent  i wont tell them that my convent was called the magasin du bon marche  mamma began to scold me three days ago for insisting on so many trunks and the truth is that between us we have not fewer than seven  for relics thats a good many  we are all writing very long lettersor at least we are writing a great number  there is no news of the bay as yet mr antrobus mammas friend opposite to me is beginning on his ninth  he is an honourable and a member of parliament he has written during the voyage about a hundred letters and he seems greatly alarmed at the number of stamps he will have to buy when he arrives  he is full of information but he has not enough for he asks as many questions as mamma when she goes to hire apartments he is going to look into various things he speaks as if they had a little hole for the purpose  he walks almost as much as i and he has very big shoes  he asks questions even of me and i tell him again and again that i know nothing about america  but it makes no difference he always begins again and indeed it is not strange that he should find my ignorance incredible  now how would it be in one of your southwestern statesthats his favourite way of opening conversation  fancy me giving an account of the south western states  i tell him he had better ask mammaa little to tease that lady who knows no more about such places than i  mr antrobus is very big and black he speaks with a sort of brogue he has a wife and ten children he is not very romantic  but he has lots of letters to people labas i forget that we are just arriving and mamma who takes an interest in him in spite of his views which are dreadfully advanced and not at all like mammas own has promised to give him the entree to the best society  i dont know what she knows about the best society over here today for we have not kept up our connections at all and no one will know or i am afraid care anything about us  she has an idea that we shall be immensely recognised but really except the poor little rucks who are bankrupt and i am told in no society at all i dont know on whom we can count  cest egal  mamma has an idea that whether or not we appreciate america ourselves we shall at least be universally appreciated  its true that we have begun to be a little you would see that by the way that mr cockerel and mr louis leverett are always inviting me to walk  both of these gentlemen who are americans have asked leave to call upon me in new york and i have said mon dieu oui if its the custom of the country  of course i have not dared to tell this to mamma who flatters herself that we have brought with us in our trunks a complete set of customs of our own and that we shall only have to shake them out a little and put them on when we arrive  if only the two gentlemen i just spoke of dont call at the same time i dont think i shall be too much frightened  if they do on the other hand i wont answer for it  they have a particular aversion to each other and they are ready to fight about poor little me  i am only the pretext however for as mr leverett says its really the opposition of temperaments  i hope they wont cut each others throats for i am not crazy about either of them  they are very well for the deck of a ship but i shouldnt care about them in a salon they are not at all distinguished  they think they are but they are not at least mr louis leverett does mr cockerel doesnt appear to care so much  they are extremely different with their opposed temperaments and each very amusing for a while but i should get dreadfully tired of passing my life with either  neither has proposed that as yet but it is evidently what they are coming to  it will be in a great measure to spite each other for i think that au fond they dont quite believe in me  if they dont its the only point on which they agree  they hate each other awfully they take such different views  that is mr cockerel hates mr leveretthe calls him a sickly little ass he says that his opinions are half affectation and the other half dyspepsia  mr leverett speaks of mr cockerel as a strident savage but he declares he finds him most diverting  he says there is nothing in which we cant find a certain entertainment if we only look at it in the right way and that we have no business with either hating or loving we ought only to strive to understand  to understand is to forgive he says  that is very pretty but i dont like the suppression of our affections though i have no desire to fix mine upon mr leverett  he is very artistic and talks like an article in some review he has lived a great deal in paris and mr cockerel says that is what has made him such an idiot  that is not complimentary to you dear louisa and still less to your brilliant brother for mr cockerel explains that he means it the bad effect of paris chiefly of the men  in fact he means the bad effect of europe altogether  this however is compromising to mamma and i am afraid there is no doubt that from what i have told him he thinks mamma also an idiot  i am not responsible you knowi have always wanted to go home  if mamma knew him which she doesnt for she always closes her eyes when i pass on his arm she would think him disgusting  mr leverett however tells me he is nothing to what we shall see yet  he is from philadelphia mr cockerel he insists that we shall go and see philadelphia but mamma says she saw it in 1855 and it was then affreux  mr cockerel says that mamma is evidently not familiar with the march of improvement in this country he speaks of 1855 as if it were a hundred years ago mamma says she knows it goes only too fastit goes so fast that it has time to do nothing well and then mr cockerel who to do him justice is perfectly goodnatured remarks that she had better wait till she has been ashore and seen the improvements  mamma rejoins that she sees them from here the improvements and that they give her a sinking of the heart  this little exchange of ideas is carried on through me they have never spoken to each other  mr cockerel as i say is extremely goodnatured and he carries out what i have heard said about the men in america being very considerate of the women  they evidently listen to them a great deal they dont contradict them but it seems to me that this is rather negative  there is very little gallantry in not contradicting one and it strikes me that there are some things the men dont express  there are others on the ship whom ive noticed its as if they were all ones brothers or ones cousins  but i promised you not to generalise and perhaps there will be more expression when we arrive  mr cockerel returns to america after a general tour with a renewed conviction that this is the only country  i left him on deck an hour ago looking at the coastline with an operaglass and saying it was the prettiest thing he had seen in all his tour  when i remarked that the coast seemed rather low he said it would be all the easier to get ashore mr leverett doesnt seem in a hurry to get ashore he is sitting within sight of me in a corner of the saloonwriting letters i suppose but looking from the way he bites his pen and rolls his eyes about as if he were composing a sonnet and waiting for a rhyme  perhaps the sonnet is addressed to me but i forget that he suppresses the affections  the only person in whom mamma takes much interest is the great french critic m lejaune whom we have the honour to carry with us  we have read a few of his works though mamma disapproves of his tendencies and thinks him a dreadful materialist we have read them for the style you know he is one of the new academicians  he is a frenchman like any other except that he is rather more quiet and he has a gray mustache and the ribbon of the legion of honour  he is the first french writer of distinction who has been to america since de tocqueville the french in such matters are not very enterprising  also he has the air of wondering what he is doing dans cette galere  he has come with his beaufrere who is an engineer and is looking after some mines and he talks with scarcely any one else as he speaks no english and appears to take for granted that no one speaks french  mamma would be delighted to assure him of the contrary she has never conversed with an academician  she always makes a little vague inclination with a smile when he passes her and he answers with a most respectful bow but it goes no farther to mammas disappointment he is always with the beaufrere a rather untidy fat bearded man decorated too always smoking and looking at the feet of the ladies whom mamma though she has very good feet has not the courage to aborder  i believe m lejaune is going to write a book about america and mr leverett says it will be terrible  mr leverett has made his acquaintance and says m lejaune will put him into his book he says the movement of the french intellect is superb  as a general thing he doesnt care for academicians but he thinks m lejaune is an exception he is so living so personal i asked mr cockerel what he thought of m lejaunes plan of writing a book and he answered that he didnt see what it mattered to him that a frenchman the more should make a monkey of himself  i asked him why he hadnt written a book about europe and he said that in the first place europe isnt worth writing about and in the second if he said what he thought people would think it was a joke  he said they are very superstitious about europe over here he wants people in america to behave as if europe didnt exist  i told this to mr leverett and he answered that if europe didnt exist america wouldnt for europe keeps us alive by buying our corn  he said also that the trouble with america in the future will be that she will produce things in such enormous quantities that there wont be enough people in the rest of the world to buy them and that we shall be left with our productionsmost of them very hideouson our hands  i asked him if he thought corn a hideous production and he replied that there is nothing more unbeautiful than too much food  i think that to feed the world too well however that will be after all a beau role  of course i dont understand these things and i dont believe mr leverett does but mr cockerel seems to know what he is talking about and he says that america is complete in herself  i dont know exactly what he means but he speaks as if human affairs had somehow moved over to this side of the world  it may be a very good place for them and heaven knows i am extremely tired of europe which mamma has always insisted so on my appreciating but i dont think i like the idea of our being so completely cut off  mr cockerel says it is not we that are cut off but europe and he seems to think that europe has deserved it somehow  that may be our life over there was sometimes extremely tiresome though mamma says it is now that our real fatigues will begin  i like to abuse those dreadful old countries myself but i am not sure that i am pleased when others do the same  we had some rather pretty moments there after all and at piacenza we certainly lived on four francs a day  mamma is already in a terrible state of mind about the expenses here she is frightened by what people on the ship the few that she has spoken to have told her  there is one comfort at any ratewe have spent so much money in coming here that we shall have none left to get away  i am scribbling along as you see to occupy me till we get news of the islands  here comes mr cockerel to bring it  yes they are in sight he tells me that they are lovelier than ever and that i must come right up right away  i suppose you will think that i am already beginning to use the language of the country  it is certain that at the end of a month i shall speak nothing else  i have picked up every dialect wherever we have travelled you have heard my plattdeutsch and my neapolitan  but voyons un peu the bay  i have just called to mr leverett to remind him of the islands  the islandsthe islands  ah my dear young lady i have seen capri i have seen ischia  well so have i but that doesnt prevent     a little lateri have seen the islands they are rather queer    ii  mrs church in new york to madame galopin at geneva    october 17 1880  if i felt far away from you in the middle of that deplorable atlantic chere madame how do i feel now in the heart of this extraordinary city  we have arrivedwe have arrived dear friend but i dont know whether to tell you that i consider that an advantage  if we had been given our choice of coming safely to land or going down to the bottom of the sea i should doubtless have chosen the former course for i hold with your noble husband and in opposition to the general tendency of modern thought that our lives are not our own to dispose of but a sacred trust from a higher power by whom we shall be held responsible  nevertheless if i had foreseen more vividly some of the impressions that awaited me here i am not sure that for my daughter at least i should not have preferred on the spot to hand in our account  should i not have been less rather than more guilty in presuming to dispose of her destiny than of my own  there is a nice point for dear m galopin to settleone of those points which i have heard him discuss in the pulpit with such elevation  we are safe however as i say by which i mean that we are physically safe  we have taken up the thread of our familiar pensionlife but under strikingly different conditions  we have found a refuge in a boardinghouse which has been highly recommended to me and where the arrangements partake of that barbarous magnificence which in this country is the only alternative from primitive rudeness  the terms per week are as magnificent as all the rest  the landlady wears diamond ear rings and the drawingrooms are decorated with marble statues  i should indeed be sorry to let you know how i have allowed myself to be ranconnee and ishould be still more sorry that it should come to the ears of any of my good friends in geneva who know me less well than you and might judge me more harshly  there is no wine given for dinner and i have vainly requested the person who conducts the establishment to garnish her table more liberally  she says i may have all the wine i want if i will order it at the merchants and settle the matter with him  but i have never as you know consented to regard our modest allowance of eau rougie as an extra indeed i remember that it is largely to your excellent advice that i have owed my habit of being firm on this point  there are however greater difficulties than the question of what we shall drink for dinner chere madame  still i have never lost courage and i shall not lose courage now  at the worst we can re embark again and seek repose and refreshment on the shores of your beautiful lake  there is absolutely no scenery here  we shall not perhaps in that case have achieved what we desired but we shall at least have made an honourable retreat  what we desirei know it is just this that puzzles you dear friend i dont think you ever really comprehended my motives in taking this formidable step though you were good enough and your magnanimous husband was good enough to press my hand at parting in a way that seemed to say that you would still be with me even if i was wrong  to be very brief i wished to put an end to the reclamations of my daughter many americans had assured her that she was wasting her youth in those historic lands which it was her privilege to see so intimately and this unfortunate conviction had taken possession of her  let me at least see for myself she used to say if i should dislike it over there as much as you promise me so much the better for you  in that case we will come back and make a new arrangement at stuttgart  the experiment is a terribly expensive one but you know that my devotion never has shrunk from an ordeal there is another point moreover which from a mother to a mother it would be affectation not to touch upon  i remember the just satisfaction with which you announced to me the betrothal of your charming cecile  you know with what earnest care my aurora has been educatedhow thoroughly she is acquainted with the principal results of modern research  we have always studied together we have always enjoyed together  it will perhaps surprise you to hear that she makes these very advantages a reproach to merepresents them as an injury to herself  in this country she says the gentlemen have not those accomplishments they care nothing for the results of modern research and it will not help a young person to be sought in marriage that she can give an account of the last german theory of pessimism  that is possible and i have never concealed from her that it was not for this country that i had educated her  if she marries in the united states it is of course my intention that my soninlaw shall accompany us to europe  but when she calls my attention more and more to these facts i feel that we are moving in a different world  this is more and more the country of the many the few find less and less place for them and the individualwell the individual has quite ceased to be recognised  he is recognised as a voter but he is not recognised as a gentlemanstill less as a lady  my daughter and i of course can only pretend to constitute a few  you know that i have never for a moment remitted my pretensions as an individual though among the agitations of pensionlife i have sometimes needed all my energy to uphold them  oh yes i may be poor i have had occasion to say i may be unprotected i may be reserved i may occupy a small apartment in the quatrieme and be unable to scatter unscrupulous bribes among the domestics but at least i am a person with personal rights  in this country the people have rights but the person has none  you would have perceived that if you had come with me to make arrangements at this establishment  the very fine lady who condescends to preside over it kept me waiting twenty minutes and then came sailing in without a word of apology  i had sat very silent with my eyes on the clock aurora amused herself with a false admiration of the rooma wonderful drawingroom with magenta curtains frescoed walls and photographs of the landladys friendsas if one cared anything about her friends  when this exalted personage came in she simply remarked that she had just been trying on a dressthat it took so long to get a skirt to hang it seems to take very long indeed i answered  but i hope the skirt is right at last  you might have sent for us to come up and look at it  she evidently didnt understand and when i asked her to show us her rooms she handed us over to a negro as degingande as herself  while we looked at them i heard her sit down to the piano in the drawingroom she began to sing an air from a comic opera  i began to fear we had gone quite astray i didnt know in what house we could be and was only reassured by seeing a bible in every room when we came down our musical hostess expressed no hope that the rooms had pleased us and seemed quite indifferent to our taking them  she would not consent moreover to the least diminution and was inflexible as i told you on the subject of wine  when i pushed this point she was so good as to observe that she didnt keep a cabaret  one is not in the least considered there is no respect for ones privacy for ones preferences for ones reserves  the familiarity is without limits and i have already made a dozen acquaintances of whom i know and wish to know nothing  aurora tells me that she is the belle of the boarding house  it appears that this is a great distinction  it brings me back to my poor child and her prospects  she takes a very critical view of them herself  she tells me that i have given her a false education and that no one will marry her today  no american will marry her because she is too much of a foreigner and no foreigner will marry her because she is too much of an american  i remind her that scarcely a day passes that a foreigner usually of distinction doesnt select an american bride and she answers me that in these cases the young lady is not married for her fine eyes  not always i reply and then she declares that she would marry no foreigner who should not be one of the first of the first  you will say doubtless that she should content herself with advantages that have not been deemed insufficient for cecile but i will not repeat to you the remark she made when i once made use of this argument  you will doubtless be surprised to hear that i have ceased to argue but it is time i should tell you that i have at last agreed to let her act for herself  she is to live for three months a lamericaine and i am to be a mere spectator  you will feel with me that this is a cruel position for a coeur de mere  i count the days till our three months are over and i know that you will join with me in my prayers  aurora walks the streets alone  she goes out in the tramway a voiture de place costs five francs for the least little course  i beseech you not to let it be known that i have sometimes had the weakness     my daughter is sometimes accompanied by a gentlemanby a dozen gentlemen she remains out for hours and her conduct excites no surprise in this establishment  i know but too well the emotions it will excite in your quiet home  if you betray us chere madame we are lost and why after all should any one know of these things in geneva  aurora pretends that she has been able to persuade herself that she doesnt care who knows them but there is a strange expression in her face which proves that her conscience is not at rest  i watch her i let her go but i sit with my hands clasped  there is a peculiar custom in this country i shouldnt know how to express it in geneveseit is called being attentive and young girls are the object of the attention  it has not necessarily anything to do with projects of marriagethough it is the privilege only of the unmarried and though at the same time fortunately and this may surprise you it has no relation to other projects  it is simply an invention by which young persons of the two sexes pass their time together  how shall i muster courage to tell you that aurora is now engaged in this delassement in company with several gentlemen  though it has no relation to marriage it happily does not exclude it and marriages have been known to take place in consequence or in spite of it  it is true that even in this country a young lady may marry but one husband at a time whereas she may receive at once the attentions of several gentlemen who are equally entitled admirers  my daughter then has admirers to an indefinite number  you will think i am joking perhaps when i tell you that i am unable to be exacti who was formerly lexactitude meme  two of these gentlemen are to a certain extent old friends having been passengers on the steamer which carried us so far from you  one of them still young is typical of the american character but a respectable person and a lawyer in considerable practice  every one in this country follows a profession but it must be admitted that the professions are more highly remunerated than chez vous  mr cockerel even while i write you is in complete possession of my daughter  he called for her an hour ago in a bogheya strange unsafe rickety vehicle mounted on enormous wheels which holds two persons very near together and i watched her from the window take her place at his side  then he whirled her away behind two little horses with terribly thin legs the whole equipageand most of all her being in itwas in the most questionable taste  but she will return and she will return very much as she went  it is the same when she goes down to mr louis leverett who has no vehicle and who merely comes and sits with her in the front salon  he has lived a great deal in europe and is very fond of the arts and though i am not sure i agree with him in his views of the relation of art to life and life to art and in his interpretation of some of the great works that aurora and i have studied together he seems to me a sufficiently serious and intelligent young man  i do not regard him as intrinsically dangerous but on the other hand he offers absolutely no guarantees  i have no means whatever of ascertaining his pecuniary situation  there is a vagueness on these points which is extremely embarrassing and it never occurs to young men to offer you a reference  in geneva i should not be at a loss i should come to you chere madame with my little inquiry and what you should not be able to tell me would not be worth knowing  but no one in new york can give me the smallest information about the etat de fortune of mr louis leverett  it is true that he is a native of boston where most of his friends reside i cannot however go to the expense of a journey to boston simply to learn perhaps that mr leverett the young louis has an income of five thousand francs as i say however he does not strike me as dangerous  when aurora comes back to me after having passed an hour with the young louis she says that he has described to her his emotions on visiting the home of shelley or discussed some of the differences between the boston temperament and that of the italians of the renaissance  you will not enter into these rapprochements and i cant blame you but you wont betray me chere madame    iii  from miss sturdy at newport to mrs  draper in florence    september 30  i promised to tell you how i like it but the truth is i have gone to and fro so often that i have ceased to like and dislike  nothing strikes me as unexpected i expect everything in its order  then too you know i am not a critic i have no talent for keen analysis as the magazines say i dont go into the reasons of things  it is true i have been for a longer time than usual on the wrong side of the water and i admit that i feel a little out of training for american life  they are breaking me in very fast however  i dont mean that they bully me i absolutely decline to be bullied  i say what i think because i believe that i have on the whole the advantage of knowing what i thinkwhen i think anythingwhich is half the battle  sometimes indeed i think nothing at all  they dont like that over here they like you to have impressions  that they like these impressions to be favourable appears to me perfectly natural i dont make a crime to them of that it seems to me on the contrary a very amiable quality  when individuals have it we call them sympathetic i dont see why we shouldnt give nations the same benefit  but there are things i havent the least desire to have an opinion about  the privilege of indifference is the dearest one we possess and i hold that intelligent people are known by the way they exercise it  life is full of rubbish and we have at least our share of it over here when you wake up in the morning you find that during the night a cartload has been deposited in your front garden  i decline however to have any of it in my premises there are thousands of things i want to know nothing about  i have outlived the necessity of being hypocritical i have nothing to gain and everything to lose  when one is fifty years oldsingle stout and red in the faceone has outlived a good many necessities  they tell me over here that my increase of weight is extremely marked and though they dont tell me that i am coarse i am sure they think me so  there is very little coarseness herenot quite enough i thinkthough there is plenty of vulgarity which is a very different thing  on the whole the country is becoming much more agreeable  it isnt that the people are charming for that they always were the best of them i mean for it isnt true of the others but that places and things as well have acquired the art of pleasing  the houses are extremely good and they look so extraordinarily fresh and clean european interiors in comparison seem musty and gritty  we have a great deal of taste i shouldnt wonder if we should end by inventing something pretty we only need a little time  of course as yet its all imitation except by the way these piazzas  i am sitting on one now i am writing to you with my portfolio on my knees  this broad light loggia surrounds the house with a movement as free as the expanded wings of a bird and the wandering airs come up from the deep sea which murmurs on the rocks at the end of the lawn  newport is more charming even than you remember it like everything else over here it has improved  it is very exquisite today it is indeed i think in all the world the only exquisite wateringplace for i detest the whole genus  the crowd has left it now which makes it all the better though plenty of talkers remain in these large light luxurious houses which are planted with a kind of dutch definiteness all over the green carpet of the cliff this carpet is very neatly laid and wonderfully well swept and the sea just at hand is capable of prodigies of blue  here and there a pretty woman strolls over one of the lawns which all touch each other you know without hedges or fences the light looks intense as it plays upon her brilliant dress her large parasol shines like a silver dome  the long lines of the far shores are soft and pure though they are places that one hasnt the least desire to visit altogether the effect is very delicate and anything that is delicate counts immensely over here for delicacy i think is as rare as coarseness  i am talking to you of the sea however without having told you a word of my voyage  it was very comfortable and amusing i should like to take another next month you know i am almost offensively well at seathat i breast the weather and brave the storm  we had no storm fortunately and i had brought with me a supply of light literature so i passed nine days on deck in my seachair with my heels up reading tauchnitz novels there was a great lot of people but no one in particular save some fifty american girls  you know all about the american girl however having been one yourself  they are on the whole very nice but fifty is too many there are always too many  there was an inquiring briton a radical mp by name mr antrobus who entertained me as much as any one else  he is an excellent man i even asked him to come down here and spend a couple of days  he looked rather frightened till i told him he shouldnt be alone with me that the house was my brothers and that i gave the invitation in his name  he came a week ago he goes everywhere we have heard of him in a dozen places  the english are very simple or at least they seem so over here  their old measurements and comparisons desert them they dont know whether its all a joke or whether its too serious by half  we are quicker than they though we talk so much more slowly  we think fast and yet we talk as deliberately as if we were speaking a foreign language  they toss off their sentences with an air of easy familiarity with the tongue and yet they misunderstand twothirds of what people say to them  perhaps after all it is only our thoughts they think slowly they think their own often to a lively tune enough  mr antrobus arrived here at eight oclock in the morning i dont know how he managed it it appears to be his favourite hour wherever we have heard of him he has come in with the dawn  in england he would arrive at 530 pm he asks innumerable questions but they are easy to answer for he has a sweet credulity  he made me rather ashamed he is a better american than so many of us he takes us more seriously than we take ourselves  he seems to think that an oligarchy of wealth is growing up here and he advised me to be on my guard against it  i dont know exactly what i can do but i promised him to look out  he is fearfully energetic the energy of the people here is nothing to that of the inquiring briton  if we should devote half the energy to building up our institutions that they devote to obtaining information about them we should have a very satisfactory country mr antrobus seemed to think very well of us which surprised me on the whole because say what one will its not so agreeable as england  its very horrid that this should be and its delightful when one thinks of it that some things in england are after all so disagreeable  at the same time mr antrobus appeared to be a good deal preoccupied with our dangers  i dont understand quite what they are they seem to me so few on a newport piazza on this bright still day  but after all what one sees on a newport piazza is not america its the back of europe  i dont mean to say that i havent noticed any dangers since my return there are two or three that seem to me very serious but they are not those that mr antrobus means  one for instance is that we shall cease to speak the english language which i prefer so much to any other  its less and less spoken american is crowding it out  all the children speak american and as a childs language its dreadfully rough its exclusively in use in the schools all the magazines and newspapers are in american  of course a people of fifty millions who have invented a new civilisation have a right to a language of their own thats what they tell me and i cant quarrel with it but i wish they had made it as pretty as the mothertongue from which after all it is more or less derived  we ought to have invented something as noble as our country  they tell me its more expressive and yet some admirable things have been said in the queens english  there can be no question of the queen over here of course and american no doubt is the music of the future  poor dear future how expressive youll be  for women and children as i say it strikes one as very rough and moreover they dont speak it well their own though it be  my little nephews when i first came home had not gone back to school and it distressed me to see that though they are charming children they had the vocal inflections of little newsboys  my niece is sixteen years old she has the sweetest nature possible she is extremely wellbred and is dressed to perfection  she chatters from morning till night but it isnt a pleasant sound  these little persons are in the opposite case from so many english girls who know how to speak but dont know how to talk  my niece knows how to talk but doesnt know how to speak  a propos of the young people that is our other danger the young people are eating us upthere is nothing in america but the young people  the country is made for the rising generation life is arranged for them they are the destruction of society people talk of them consider them defer to them bow down to them they are always present and whenever they are present there is an end to everything else  they are often very pretty and physically they are wonderfully looked after they are scoured and brushed they wear hygienic clothes they go every week to the dentists but the little boys kick your shins and the little girls offer to slap your face  there is an immense literature entirely addressed to them in which the kicking of shins and the slapping of faces is much recommended  as a woman of fifty i protest  i insist on being judged by my peers  its too late however for several millions of little feet are actively engaged in stamping out conversation and i dont see how they can long fail to keep it under  the future is theirs maturity will evidently be at an increasing discount  longfellow wrote a charming little poem called the childrens hour but he ought to have called it the childrens century  and by children of course i dont mean simple infants i mean everything of less than twenty  the social importance of the young american increases steadily up to that age and then it suddenly stops  the young girls of course are more important than the lads but the lads are very important too  i am struck with the way they are known and talked about they are little celebrities they have reputations and pretentions they are taken very seriously  as for the young girls as i said just now there are too many  you will say perhaps that i am jealous of them with my fifty years and my red face  i dont think so because i dont suffer my red face doesnt frighten people away and i always find plenty of talkers  the young girls themselves i believe like me very much and as for me i delight in the young girls  they are often very pretty not so pretty as people say in the magazines but pretty enough  the magazines rather overdo that they make a mistake  i have seen no great beauties but the level of prettiness is high and occasionally one sees a woman completely handsome  as a general thing a pretty person here means a person with a pretty face  the figure is rarely mentioned though there are several good ones  the level of prettiness is high but the level of conversation is low thats one of the signs of its being a young ladies country  there are a good many things young ladies cant talk about but think of all the things they can when they are as clever as most of these  perhaps one ought to content ones self with that measure but its difficult if one has lived for a while by a larger one  this one is decidedly narrow i stretch it sometimes till it cracks  then it is that they call me coarse which i undoubtedly am thank heaven  peoples talk is of course much more chatiee over here than in europe i am struck with that wherever i go  there are certain things that are never said at all certain allusions that are never made  there are no light stories no propos risques  i dont know exactly what people talk about for the supply of scandal is small and its poor in quality  they dont seem however to lack topics  the young girls are always there they keep the gates of conversation very little passes that is not innocent  i find we do very well without wickedness and for myself as i take my ease i dont miss my liberties  you remember what i thought of the tone of your table in florence and how surprised you were when i asked you why you allowed such things you said they were like the courses of the seasons one couldnt prevent them also that to change the tone of your table you would have to change so many other things  of course in your house one never saw a young girl i was the only spinster and no one was afraid of me  of course too if talk is more innocent in this country manners are so to begin with  the liberty of the young people is the strongest proof of it  the young girls are let loose in the world and the world gets more good of it than ces demoiselles get harm  in your worldexcuse me but you know what i meanthis wouldnt do at all  your world is a sad affair and the young ladies would encounter all sorts of horrors  over here considering the way they knock about they remain wonderfully simple and the reason is that society protects them instead of setting them traps  there is almost no gallantry as you understand it the flirtations are childs play  people have no time for making love the men in particular are extremely busy  i am told that sort of thing consumes hours i have never had any time for it myself  if the leisure class should increase here considerably there may possibly be a change but i doubt it for the women seem to me in all essentials exceedingly reserved  great superficial frankness but an extreme dread of complications  the men strike me as very good fellows  i think that at bottom they are better than the women who are very subtle but rather hard  they are not so nice to the men as the men are to them i mean of course in proportion you know  but women are not so nice as men anyhow as they say here  the men of course are professional commercial there are very few gentlemen pure and simple  this personage needs to be very well done however to be of great utility and i suppose you wont pretend that he is always well done in your countries when hes not the less of him the better  its very much the same however with the system on which the young girls in this country are brought up  you see i have to come back to the young girls when it succeeds they are the most charming possible when it doesnt the failure is disastrous  if a girl is a very nice girl the american method brings her to great completenessmakes all her graces flower but if she isnt nice it makes her exceedingly disagreeableelaborately and fatally perverts her  in a word the american girl is rarely negative and when she isnt a great success she is a great warning  in nineteen cases out of twenty among the people who know how to livei wont say what their proportion is the results are highly satisfactory  the girls are not shy but i dont know why they should be for there is really nothing here to be afraid of  manners are very gentle very humane the democratic system deprives people of weapons that every one doesnt equally possess  no one is formidable no one is on stilts no one has great pretensions or any recognised right to be arrogant  i think there is not much wickedness and there is certainly less cruelty than with you  every one can sit no one is kept standing  one is much less liable to be snubbed which you will say is a pity  i think it is to a certain extent but on the other hand folly is less fatuous in form than in your countries and as people generally have fewer revenges to take there is less need of their being stamped on in advance  the general good nature the social equality deprive them of triumphs on the one hand and of grievances on the other  there is extremely little impertinence there is almost none  you will say i am describing a terrible societya society without great figures or great social prizes you have hit it my dear there are no great figures  the great prize of course in europe is the opportunity to be a great figure  you would miss these things a good dealyou who delight to contemplate greatness and my advice to you of course is never to come back  you would miss the small people even more than the great every one is middlesized and you can never have that momentary sense of tallness which is so agreeable in europe  there are no brilliant types the most important people seem to lack dignity  they are very bourgeois they make little jokes on occasion they make puns they have no form they are too good natured  the men have no style the women who are fidgety and talk too much have it only in their coiffure where they have it superabundantly  but i console myself with the greater bonhomie have you ever arrived at an english countryhouse in the dusk of a winters day  have you ever made a call in london when you knew nobody but the hostess  people here are more expressive more demonstrative and it is a pleasure when one comes back if one happens like me to be no one in particular to feel ones social value rise  they attend to you more they have you on their mind they talk to you they listen to you  that is the men do the women listen very littlenot enough  they interrupt they talk too much one feels their presence too much as a sound  i imagine it is partly because their wits are quick and they think of a good many things to say not that they always say such wonders  perfect repose after all is not all selfcontrol it is also partly stupidity  american women however make too many vague exclamationssay too many indefinite things  in short they have a great deal of nature  on the whole i find very little affectation though we shall probably have more as we improve  as yet people havent the assurance that carries those things off they know too much about each other  the trouble is that over here we have all been brought up together  you will think this a picture of a dreadfully insipid society but i hasten to add that its not all so tame as that  i have been speaking of the people that one meets socially and these are the smallest part of american life  the othersthose one meets on a basis of mere convenienceare much more exciting they keep ones temper in healthy exercise  i mean the people in the shops and on the railroads the servants the hackmen the labourers every one of whom you buy anything or have occasion to make an inquiry  with them you need all your best manners for you must always have enough for two  if you think we are too democratic taste a little of american life in these walks and you will be reassured  this is the region of inequality and you will find plenty of people to make your courtesy to  you see it from belowthe weight of inequality is on your own back  you asked me to tell you about prices they are simply dreadful    iv  from the honourable edward antrobus mp in boston to the honourable mrs antrobus    october 17  my dear susani sent you a postcard on the 13th and a native newspaper yesterday i really have had no time to write  i sent you the newspaper partly because it contained a reportextremely incorrectof some remarks i made at the meeting of the association of the teachers of new england partly because it is so curious that i thought it would interest you and the children  i cut out some portions which i didnt think it would be well for the children to see the parts remaining contain the most striking features  please point out to the children the peculiar orthography which probably will be adopted in england by the time they are grown up the amusing oddities of expression etc  some of them are intentional you will have heard of the celebrated american humour etc remind me by the way on my return to thistleton to give you a few examples of it others are unconscious and are perhaps on that account the more diverting  point out to the children the difference in so far as you are sure that you yourself perceive it  you must excuse me if these lines are not very legible i am writing them by the light of a railway lamp which rattles above my left ear it being only at odd moments that i can find time to look into everything that i wish to  you will say that this is a very odd moment indeed when i tell you that i am in bed in a sleeping car  i occupy the upper berth i will explain to you the arrangement when i return while the lower forms the couchthe jolts are fearfulof an unknown female  you will be very anxious for my explanation but i assure you that it is the custom of the country  i myself am assured that a lady may travel in this manner all over the union the union of states without a loss of consideration  in case of her occupying the upper berth i presume it would be different but i must make inquiries on this point whether it be the fact that a mysterious being of another sex has retired to rest behind the same curtains or whether it be the swing of the train which rushes through the air with very much the same movement as the tail of a kite the situation is at any rate so anomalous that i am unable to sleep  a ventilator is open just over my head and a lively draught mingled with a drizzle of cinders pours in through this ingenious orifice  i will describe to you its form on my return  if i had occupied the lower berth i should have had a whole window to myself and by drawing back the blind a safe proceeding at the dead of night i should have been able by the light of an extraordinary brilliant moon to see a little better what i write  the question occurs to me howeverwould the lady below me in that case have ascended to the upper berth  you know my old taste for contingent inquiries  i incline to think from what i have seen that she would simply have requested me to evacuate my own couch  the ladies in this country ask for anything they want  in this case i suppose i should have had an extensive view of the country which from what i saw of it before i turned in while the lady beneath me was going to bed offered a rather ragged expanse dotted with little white wooden houses which looked in the moonshine like pasteboard boxes  i have been unable to ascertain as precisely as i should wish by whom these modest residences are occupied for they are too small to be the homes of country gentlemen there is no peasantry here and in new england for all the corn comes from the far west there are no yeomen nor farmers  the information that one receives in this country is apt to be rather conflicting but i am determined to sift the mystery to the bottom  i have already noted down a multitude of facts bearing upon the points that interest me mostthe operation of the school boards the coeducation of the sexes the elevation of the tone of the lower classes the participation of the latter in political life  political life indeed is almost wholly confined to the lower middle class and the upper section of the lower class  in some of the large towns indeed the lowest order of all participates considerablya very interesting phrase to which i shall give more attention  it is very gratifying to see the taste for public affairs pervading so many social strata but the indifference of the gentry is a fact not to be lightly considered it may be objected indeed that there are no gentry and it is very true that i have not yet encountered a character of the type of lord bottomleya type which i am free to confess i should be sorry to see disappear from our english system if system it may be called where so much is the growth of blind and incoherent forces  it is nevertheless obvious that an idle and luxurious class exists in this country and that it is less exempt than in our own from the reproach of preferring inglorious ease to the furtherance of liberal ideas  it is rapidly increasing and i am not sure that the indefinite growth of the dilettante spirit in connection with large and lavishlyexpended wealth is an unmixed good even in a society in which freedom of development has obtained so many interesting triumphs  the fact that this body is not represented in the governing class is perhaps as much the result of the jealousy with which it is viewed by the more earnest workers as of its owni dare not perhaps apply a harsher term thanlevity  such at least is the impression i have gathered in the middle states and in new england in the southwest the northwest and the far west it will doubtless be liable to correction  these divisions are probably new to you but they are the general denomination of large and flourishing communities with which i hope to make myself at least superficially acquainted  the fatigue of traversing as i habitually do three or four hundred miles at a bound is of course considerable but there is usually much to inquire into by the way  the conductors of the trains with whom i freely converse are often men of vigorous and original minds and even of some social eminence  one of them a few days ago gave me a letter of introduction to his brotherinlaw who is president of a western university  dont have any fear therefore that i am not in the best society  the arrangements for travelling are as a general thing extremely ingenious as you will probably have inferred from what i told you above but it must at the same time be conceded that some of them are more ingenious than happy  some of the facilities with regard to luggage the transmission of parcels etc are doubtless very useful when explained but i have not yet succeeded in mastering the intricacies  there are on the other hand no cabs and no porters and i have calculated that i have myself carried my impedimentawhich you know are somewhat numerous and from which i cannot bear to be separatedsome seventy or eighty miles  i have sometimes thought it was a great mistake not to bring plummeridge he would have been useful on such occasions  on the other hand the startling question would have presented itselfwho would have carried plummeridges portmanteau  he would have been useful indeed for brushing and packing my clothes and getting me my tub i travel with a large tin onethere are none to be obtained at the innsand the transport of this receptacle often presents the most insoluble difficulties  it is often too an object of considerable embarrassment in arriving at private houses where the servants have less reserve of manner than in england and to tell you the truth i am by no means certain at the present moment that the tub has been placed in the train with me  on board the train is the consecrated phrase here it is an allusion to the tossing and pitching of the concatenation of cars so similar to that of a vessel in a storm  as i was about to inquire however who would get plummeridge his tub and attend to his little comforts  we could not very well make our appearance on coming to stay with people with two of the utensils i have named though as regards a single one i have had the courage as i may say of a lifelong habit  it would hardly be expected that we should both use the same though there have been occasions in my travels as to which i see no way of blinking the fact that plummeridge would have had to sit down to dinner with me  such a contingency would completely have unnerved him and on the whole it was doubtless the wiser part to leave him respectfully touching his hat on the tender in the mersey  no one touches his hat over here and though it is doubtless the sign of a more advanced social order i confess that when i see poor plummeridge again this familiar little gesture familiar i mean only in the sense of being often seenwill give me a measurable satisfaction  you will see from what i tell you that democracy is not a mere word in this country and i could give you many more instances of its universal reign  this however is what we come here to look at and in so far as there seems to be proper occasion to admire though i am by no means sure that we can hope to establish within an appreciable time a corresponding change in the somewhat rigid fabric of english manners  i am not even prepared to affirm that such a change is desirable you know this is one of the points on which i do not as yet see my way to going as far as lord b   i have always held that there is a certain social ideal of inequality as well as of equality and if i have found the people of this country as a general thing quite equal to each other i am not sure that i am prepared to go so far as to say that as a whole they are equal toexcuse that dreadful blot  the movement of the train and the precarious nature of the lightit is close to my nose and most offensivewould i flatter myself long since have got the better of a less resolute diarist  what i was not prepared for was the very considerable body of aristocratic feeling that lurks beneath this republican simplicity  i have on several occasions been made the confidant of these romantic but delusive vagaries of which the stronghold appears to be the empire citya slang name for new york  i was assured in many quarters that that locality at least is ripe for a monarchy and if one of the queens sons would come and talk it over he would meet with the highest encouragement  this information was given me in strict confidence with closed doors as it were it reminded me a good deal of the dreams of the old jacobites when they whispered their messages to the king across the water  i doubt however whether these less excusable visionaries will be able to secure the services of a pretender for i fear that in such a case he would encounter a still more fatal culloden  i have given a good deal of time as i told you to the educational system and have visited no fewer than one hundred and fortythree schools and colleges  it is extraordinary the number of persons who are being educated in this country and yet at the same time the tone of the people is less scholarly than one might expect  a lady a few days since described to me her daughter as being always on the go which i take to be a jocular way of saying that the young lady was very fond of paying visits  another person the wife of a united states senator informed me that if i should go to washington in january i should be quite in the swim  i inquired the meaning of the phrase but her explanation made it rather more than less ambiguous to say that i am on the go describes very accurately my own situation  i went yesterday to the pognanuc high school to hear fiftyseven boys and girls recite in unison a most remarkable ode to the american flag and shortly afterward attended a ladies lunch at which some eighty or ninety of the sex were present  there was only one individual in trousershis trousers by the way though he brought a dozen pair are getting rather seedy  the men in america do not partake of this meal at which ladies assemble in large numbers to discuss religions political and social topics  these immense female symposia at which every delicacy is provided are one of the most striking features of american life and would seem to prove that men are not so indispensable in the scheme of creation as they sometimes suppose  i have been admitted on the footing of an englishmanjust to show you some of our bright women the hostess yesterday remarked  bright here has the meaning of intellectual  i perceived indeed a great many intellectual foreheads  these curious collations are organised according to age i have also been present as an inquiring stranger at several girls lunches from which married ladies are rigidly excluded but where the fair revellers are equally numerous and equally bright  there is a good deal i should like to tell you about my study of the educational question but my position is somewhat cramped and i must dismiss it briefly  my leading impression is that the children in this country are better educated than the adults  the position of a child is on the whole one of great distinction  there is a popular ballad of which the refrain if i am not mistaken is make me a child again just for tonight and which seems to express the sentiment of regret for lost privileges  at all events they are a powerful and independent class and have organs of immense circulation in the press  they are often extremely bright  i have talked with a great many teachers most of them ladyteachers as they are called in this country  the phrase does not mean teachers of ladies as you might suppose but applies to the sex of the instructress who often has large classes of young men under her control  i was lately introduced to a young woman of twentythree who occupies the chair of moral philosophy and belleslettres in a western college and who told me with the utmost frankness that she was adored by the undergraduates  this young woman was the daughter of a petty trader in one of the south western states and had studied at amanda college in missourah an institution at which young people of the two sexes pursue their education together  she was very pretty and modest and expressed a great desire to see something of english country life in consequence of which i made her promise to come down to thistleton in the event of her crossing the atlantic  she is not the least like gwendolen or charlotte and i am not prepared to say how they would get on with her the boys would probably do better  still i think her acquaintance would be of value to miss bumpus and the two might pass their time very pleasantly in the schoolroom  i grant you freely that those i have seen here are much less comfortable than the schoolroom at thistleton  has charlotte by the way designed any more texts for the walls  i have been extremely interested in my visit to philadelphia where i saw several thousand little red houses with white steps occupied by intelligent artizans and arranged in streets on the rectangular system  improved cookingstoves rosewood pianos gas and hot water aesthetic furniture and complete sets of the british essayists  a tramway through every street every block of equal length blocks and houses scientifically lettered and numbered  there is absolutely no loss of time and no need of looking for anything or indeed at anything  the mind always on ones object it is very delightful    v  from louis leverett in boston to harvard tremont in paris    november  the scales have turned my sympathetic harvard and the beam that has lifted you up has dropped me again on this terribly hard spot i am extremely sorry to have missed you in london but i received your little note and took due heed of your injunction to let you know how i got on  i dont get on at all my dear harvardi am consumed with the love of the farther shore  i have been so long away that i have dropped out of my place in this little boston world and the shallow tides of new england life have closed over it  i am a stranger here and i find it hard to believe that i ever was a native  it is very hard very cold very vacant  i think of your warm rich paris i think of the boulevard st michel on the mild spring evenings  i see the little corner by the window of the cafe de la jeunessewhere i used to sit the doors are open the soft deep breath of the great city comes in  it is brilliant yet there is a kind of tone of body in the brightness the mighty murmur of the ripest civilisation in the world comes in the dear old peuple de paris the most interesting people in the world pass by  i have a little book in my pocket it is exquisitely printed a modern elzevir  it is a lyric cry from the heart of young france and is full of the sentiment of form  there is no form here dear harvard i had no idea how little form there was  i dont know what i shall do i feel so undraped so uncurtained so uncushioned i feel as if i were sitting in the centre of a mighty reflector  a terrible crude glare is over everything the earth looks peeled and excoriated the raw heavens seem to bleed with the quick hard light i have not got back my rooms in west cedar street they are occupied by a mesmeric healer  i am staying at an hotel and it is very dreadful  nothing for ones self nothing for ones preferences and habits  no one to receive you when you arrive you push in through a crowd you edge up to a counter you write your name in a horrible book where every one may come and stare at it and finger it  a man behind the counter stares at you in silence his stare seems to say to you what the devil do you want  but after this stare he never looks at you again  he tosses down a key at you he presses a bell a savage irishman arrives  take him away he seems to say to the irishman but it is all done in silence there is no answer to your own speechwhat is to be done with me please  wait and you will see the awful silence seems to say  there is a great crowd around you but there is also a great stillness every now and then you hear some one expectorate  there are a thousand people in this huge and hideous structure they feed together in a big whitewalled room  it is lighted by a thousand gasjets and heated by castiron screens which vomit forth torrents of scorching air  the temperature is terrible the atmosphere is more so the furious light and heat seem to intensify the dreadful definiteness  when things are so ugly they should not be so definite and they are terribly ugly here  there is no mystery in the corners there is no light and shade in the types  the people are haggard and joyless they look as if they had no passions no tastes no senses  they sit feeding in silence in the dry hard light occasionally i hear the high firm note of a child  the servants are black and familiar their faces shine as they shuffle about there are blue tones in their dark masks  they have no manners they address you but they dont answer you they plant themselves at your elbow it rubs their clothes as you eat and watch you as if your proceedings were strange  they deluge you with iced water its the only thing they will bring you if you look round to summon them they have gone for more  if you read the newspaperwhich i dont gracious heaven  i cantthey hang over your shoulder and peruse it also  i always fold it up and present it to them the newspapers here are indeed for an african taste  there are long corridors defended by gusts of hot air down the middle swoops a pale little girl on parlour skates  get out of my way she shrieks as she passes she has ribbons in her hair and frills on her dress she makes the tour of the immense hotel  i think of puck who put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes and wonder what he said as he flitted by  a black waiter marches past me bearing a tray which he thrusts into my spine as he goes  it is laden with large white jugs they tinkle as he moves and i recognise the unconsoling fluid  we are dying of iced water of hot air of gas  i sit in my room thinking of these thingsthis room of mine which is a chamber of pain  the walls are white and bare they shine in the rays of a horrible chandelier of imitation bronze which depends from the middle of the ceiling  it flings a patch of shadow on a small table covered with white marble of which the genial surface supports at the present moment the sheet of paper on which i address you and when i go to bed i like to read in bed harvard it becomes an object of mockery and torment it dangles at inaccessible heights it stares me in the face it flings the light upon the covers of my book but not upon the page the little french elzevir that i love so well  i rise and put out the gas and then my room becomes even lighter than before  then a crude illumination from the hall from the neighbouring room pours through the glass openings that surmount the two doors of my apartment  it covers my bed where i toss and groan it beats in through my closed lids it is accompanied by the most vulgar though the most human sounds  i spring up to call for some help some remedy but there is no bell and i feel desolate and weak  there is only a strange orifice in the wall through which the traveller in distress may transmit his appeal  i fill it with incoherent sounds and sounds more incoherent yet come back to me  i gather at last their meaning they appear to constitute a somewhat stern inquiry  a hollow impersonal voice wishes to know what i want and the very question paralyses me  i want everythingyet i want nothingnothing this hard impersonality can give  i want my little corner of paris i want the rich the deep the dark old world i want to be out of this horrible place  yet i cant confide all this to that mechanical tube it would be of no use a mocking laugh would come up from the office  fancy appealing in these sacred these intimate moments to an office fancy calling out into indifferent space for a candle for a curtain  i pay incalculable sums in this dreadful house and yet i havent a servant to wait upon me  i fling myself back on my couch and for a long time afterward the orifice in the wall emits strange murmurs and rumblings  it seems unsatisfied indignant it is evidently scolding me for my vagueness  my vagueness indeed dear harvard i loathe their horrible arrangements isnt that definite enough you asked me to tell you whom i see and what i think of my friends i havent very many i dont feel at all en rapport  the people are very good very serious very devoted to their work but there is a terrible absence of variety of type  every one is mr jones mr brown and every one looks like mr jones and mr brown  they are thin they are diluted in the great tepid bath of democracy  they lack completeness of identity they are quite without modelling no they are not beautiful my poor harvard it must be whispered that they are not beautiful  you may say that they are as beautiful as the french as the germans but i cant agree with you there the french the germans have the greatest beauty of allthe beauty of their uglinessthe beauty of the strange the grotesque  these people are not even ugly they are only plain  many of the girls are pretty but to be only pretty is to my sense to be plain  yet i have had some talk  i have seen a woman  she was on the steamer and i afterward saw her in new yorka peculiar type a real personality a great deal of modelling a great deal of colour and yet a great deal of mystery  she was not however of this country she was a compound of faroff things  but she was looking for something herelike me  we found each other and for a moment that was enough  i have lost her now i am sorry because she liked to listen to me  she has passed away i shall not see her again  she liked to listen to me she almost understood    vi  from m gustave lejaune of the french academy to m adolphe bouche in paris    washington october 5  i give you my little notes you must make allowances for haste for bad inns for the perpetual scramble for illhumour  everywhere the same impressionthe platitude of unbalanced democracy intensified by the platitude of the spirit of commerce  everything on an immense scaleeverything illustrated by millions of examples my brotherinlaw is always busy he has appointments inspections interviews disputes  the people it appears are incredibly sharp in conversation in argument they wait for you in silence at the corner of the road and then they suddenly discharge their revolver if you fall they empty your pockets the only chance is to shoot them first  with that no amenities no preliminaries no manners no care for the appearance  i wander about while my brother is occupied i lounge along the streets i stop at the corners i look into the shops je regarde passer les femmes  its an easy country to see one sees everything there is the civilisation is skin deep you dont have to dig  this positive practical pushing bourgeoisie is always about its business it lives in the street in the hotel in the train one is always in a crowdthere are seventyfive people in the tramway  they sit in your lap they stand on your toes when they wish to pass they simply push you everything in silence they know that silence is golden and they have the worship of gold  when the conductor wishes your fare he gives you a poke very serious without a word  as for the types but there is only onethey are all variations of the samethe commisvoyageur minus the gaiety  the women are often pretty you meet the young ones in the streets in the trains in search of a husband  they look at you frankly coldly judicially to see if you will serve but they dont want what you might think du moins on me lassure they only want the husband  a frenchman may mistake he needs to be sure he is right and i always make sure they begin at fifteen the mother sends them out it lasts all day with an interval for dinner at a pastrycooks sometimes it goes on for ten years  if they havent found the husband then they give it up they make place for the cadettes as the number of women is enormous  no salons no society no conversation people dont receive at home the young girls have to look for the husband where they can  it is no disgrace not to find himseveral have never done so  they continue to go about unmarriedfrom the force of habit from the love of movement without hopes without regretno imagination no sensibility no desire for the convent  we have made several journeysfew of less than three hundred miles enormous trains enormous waggons with beds and lavatories and negroes who brush you with a big broom as if they were grooming a horse  a bounding movement a roaring noise a crowd of people who look horribly tired a boy who passes up and down throwing pamphlets and sweetmeats into your lapthat is an american journey  there are windows in the waggonsenormous like everything else but there is nothing to see  the country is a voidno features no objects no details nothing to show you that you are in one place more than another  aussi you are not in one place you are everywhere anywhere the train goes a hundred miles an hour  the cities are all the same little houses ten feet high or else big ones two hundred tramways telegraphpoles enormous signs holes in the pavement oceans of mud commisvoyageurs young ladies looking for the husband  on the other hand no beggars and no cocottesnone at least that you see  a colossal mediocrity except my brotherinlaw tells me in the machinery which is magnificent  naturally no architecture they make houses of wood and of iron no art no literature no theatre  i have opened some of the books mais ils ne se laissent pas lire  no form no matter no style no general ideas they seem to be written for children and young ladies  the most successful those that they praise most are the facetious they sell in thousands of editions  i have looked into some of the most vantes but you need to be forewarned to know that they are amusing des plaisanteries de croquemort  they have a novelist with pretensions to literature who writes about the chase for the husband and the adventures of the rich americans in our corrupt old europe where their primaeval candour puts the europeans to shame  cest proprement ecrit but its terribly pale  what isnt pale is the newspapersenormous like everything else fifty columns of advertisements and full of the commerages of a continent  and such a tone grand dieu  the amenities the personalities the recriminations are like so many coups de revolver  headings six inches tall correspondences from places one never heard of telegrams from europe about sarah bernhardt little paragraphs about nothing at all the menu of the neighbours dinner articles on the european situation a pouffer de rire all the tripotage of local politics  the reportage is incredible i am chased up and down by the interviewers  the matrimonial infelicities of m and madame x they give the name tout au long with every detailnot in six lines discreetly veiled with an art of insinuation as with us but with all the facts or the fictions the letters the dates the places the hours  i open a paper at hazard and i find au beau milieu a propos of nothing the announcementmiss susan green has the longest nose in western new york  miss susan green je me renseigne is a celebrated authoress and the americans have the reputation of spoiling their women  they spoil them a coups de poing  we have seen few interiors no one speaks french but if the newspapers give an idea of the domestic moeurs the moeurs must be curious  the passport is abolished but they have printed my signalement in these sheets perhaps for the young ladies who look for the husband  we went one night to the theatre the piece was french they are the only ones but the acting was americantoo american we came out in the middle  the want of taste is incredible  an englishman whom i met tells me that even the language corrupts itself from day to day an englishman ceases to understand  it encourages me to find that i am not the only one  there are things every day that one cant describe  such is washington where we arrived this morning coming from philadelphia  my brotherinlaw wishes to see the bureau of patents and on our arrival he went to look at his machines while i walked about the streets and visited the capitol  the human machine is what interests me most  i dont even care for the politicalfor thats what they call their government herethe machine  it operates very roughly and some day evidently it will explode  it is true that you would never suspect that they have a government this is the principal seat but save for three or four big buildings most of them affreux it looks like a settlement of negroes  no movement no officials no authority no embodiment of the state  enormous streets comme toujours lined with little red houses where nothing ever passes but the tramway  the capitola vast structure false classic white marble iron and stucco which has assez grand airmust be seen to be appreciated  the goddess of liberty on the top dressed in a bears skin their liberty over here is the liberty of bears  you go into the capitol as you would into a railway station you walk about as you would in the palais royal  no functionaries no doorkeepers no officers no uniforms no badges no restrictions no authoritynothing but a crowd of shabby people circulating in a labyrinth of spittoons  we are too much governed perhaps in france but at least we have a certain incarnation of the national conscience of the national dignity the dignity is absent here and i am told that the conscience is an abyss  letat cest moi eveni like that better than the spittoons  these implements are architectural monumental they are the only monuments  en somme the country is interesting now that we too have the republic it is the biggest illustration the biggest warning  it is the last word of democracy and that word isflatness  it is very big very rich and perfectly ugly  a frenchman couldnt live here for life with us after all at the worst is a sort of appreciation  here there is nothing to appreciate  as for the people they are the english minus the conventions  you can fancy what remains  the women pourtant are sometimesrather well turned  there was one at philadelphiai made her acquaintance by accidentwhom it is probable i shall see again  she is not looking for the husband she has already got one it was at the hotel i think the husband doesnt matter  a frenchman as i have said may mistake and he needs to be sure he is right  aussi i always make sure    vii  from marcellus cockerel in washington to mrs cooler nee cockerel at oakland california    october 25  i ought to have written to you long before this for i have had your last excellent letter for four months in my hands  the first half of that time i was still in europe the last i have spent on my native soil  i think therefore my silence is owing to the fact that over there i was too miserable to write and that here i have been too happy  i got back the 1st of septemberyou will have seen it in the papers  delightful country where one sees everything in the papersthe big familiar vulgar goodnatured delightful papers none of which has any reputation to keep up for anything but getting the news  i really think that has had as much to do as anything else with my satisfaction at getting homethe difference in what they call the tone of the press  in europe its too drearythe sapience the solemnity the false respectability the verbosity the long disquisitions on superannuated subjects  here the newspapers are like the railroad trains which carry everything that comes to the station and have only the religion of punctuality  as a woman however you probably detest them you think they are the great word vulgar  i admitted it just now and i am very happy to have an early opportunity to announce to you that that idea has quite ceased to have any terrors for me  there are some conceptions to which the female mind can never rise  vulgarity is a stupid superficial questionbegging accusation which has become today the easiest refuge of mediocrity  better than anything else it saves people the trouble of thinking and anything which does that succeeds  you must know that in these last three years in europe i have become terribly vulgar myself thats one service my travels have rendered me  by three years in europe i mean three years in foreign parts altogether for i spent several months of that time in japan india and the rest of the east  do you remember when you bade me goodbye in san francisco the night before i embarked for yokohama  you foretold that i should take such a fancy to foreign life that america would never see me more and that if you should wish to see me an event you were good enough to regard as possible you would have to make a rendezvous in paris or in rome  i think we made one which you never kept but i shall never make another for those cities  it was in paris however that i got your letter i remember the moment as well as if it were to my honour much more recent  you must know that among many places i dislike paris carries the palm  i am bored to death there its the home of every humbug  the life is full of that false comfort which is worse than discomfort and the small fat irritable people give me the shivers  i had been making these reflections even more devoutly than usual one very tiresome evening toward the beginning of last summer when as i reentered my hotel at ten oclock the little reptile of a portress handed me your gracious lines  i was in a villainous humour  i had been having an over dressed dinner in a stuffy restaurant and had gone from there to a suffocating theatre where by way of amusement i saw a play in which blood and lies were the least of the horrors  the theatres over there are insupportable the atmosphere is pestilential people sit with their elbows in your sides they squeeze past you every halfhour  it was one of my bad moments i have a great many in europe  the conventional perfunctory play all in falsetto which i seemed to have seen a thousand times the horrible faces of the people the pushing bullying ouvreuse with her false politeness and her real rapacity drove me out of the place at the end of an hour and as it was too early to go home i sat down before a cafe on the boulevard where they served me a glass of sour watery beer  there on the boulevard in the summer night life itself was even uglier than the play and it wouldnt do for me to tell you what i saw  besides i was sick of the boulevard with its eternal grimace and the deadly sameness of the article de paris which pretends to be so variousthe shopwindows a wilderness of rubbish and the passersby a procession of manikins suddenly it came over me that i was supposed to be amusing myself my face was a yard longand that you probably at that moment were saying to your husband  he stays away so long  what a good time he must be having  the idea was the first thing that had made me smile for a month i got up and walked home reflecting as i went that i was seeing europe and that after all one must see europe  it was because i had been convinced of this that i came out and it is because the operation has been brought to a close that i have been so happy for the last eight weeks  i was very conscientious about it and though your letter that night made me abominably homesick i held out to the end knowing it to be once for all  i shant trouble europe again i shall see america for the rest of my days  my long delay has had the advantage that now at least i can give you my impressionsi dont mean of europe impressions of europe are easy to getbut of this country as it strikes the reinstated exile  very likely youll think them queer but keep my letter and twenty years hence they will be quite commonplace  they wont even be vulgar  it was very deliberate my going round the world  i knew that one ought to see for ones self and that i should have eternity so to speak to rest  i travelled energetically i went everywhere and saw everything took as many letters as possible and made as many acquaintances  in short i held my nose to the grindstone  the upshot of it all is that i have got rid of a superstition  we have so many that one the less perhaps the biggest of allmakes a real difference in ones comfort  the superstition in questionof course you have itis that there is no salvation but through europe  our salvation is here if we have eyes to see it and the salvation of europe into the bargain that is if europe is to be saved which i rather doubt  of course youll call me a bird of freedom a braggart a waver of the stars and stripes but im in the delightful position of not minding in the least what any one calls me  i havent a mission i dont want to preach i have simply arrived at a state of mind i have got europe off my back  you have no idea how it simplifies things and how jolly it makes me feel  now i can live now i can talk  if we wretched americans could only say once for all oh europe be hanged we should attend much better to our proper business  we have simply to live our life and the rest will look after itself  you will probably inquire what it is that i like better over here and i will answer that its simplylife disagreeables for disagreeables i prefer our own  the way i have been bored and bullied in foreign parts and the way i have had to say i found it pleasant  for a good while this appeared to be a sort of congenital obligation but one fine day it occurred to me that there was no obligation at all and that it would ease me immensely to admit to myself that for me at least all those things had no importance  i mean the things they rub into you in europe the tiresome international topics the petty politics the stupid social customs the babyhouse scenery  the vastness and freshness of this american world the great scale and great pace of our development the good sense and good nature of the people console me for there being no cathedrals and no titians  i hear nothing about prince bismarck and gambetta about the emperor william and the czar of russia about lord beaconsfield and the prince of wales  i used to get so tired of their mumbojumbo of a bismarck of his secrets and surprises his mysterious intentions and oracular words  they revile us for our party politics but what are all the european jealousies and rivalries their armaments and their wars their rapacities and their mutual lies but the intensity of the spirit of party what question what interest what idea what need of mankind is involved in any of these things their big pompous armies drawn up in great silly rows their gold lace their salaams their hierarchies seem a pastime for children theres a sense of humour and of reality over here that laughs at all that  yes we are nearer the realitywe are nearer what they will all have to come to  the questions of the future are social questions which the bismarcks and beaconsfields are very much afraid to see settled and the sight of a row of supercilious potentates holding their peoples like their personal property and bristling all over to make a mutual impression with feathers and sabres strikes us as a mixture of the grotesque and the abominable what do we care for the mutual impressions of potentates who amuse themselves with sitting on people  those things are their own affair and they ought to be shut up in a dark room to have it out together  once one feels over here that the great questions of the future are social questions that a mighty tide is sweeping the world to democracy and that this country is the biggest stage on which the drama can be enacted the fashionable european topics seem petty and parochial  they talk about things that we have settled ages ago and the solemnity with which they propound to you their little domestic embarrassments makes a heavy draft on ones good nature  in england they were talking about the hares and rabbits bill about the extension of the county franchise about the dissenters burials about the deceased wifes sister about the abolition of the house of lords about heaven knows what ridiculous little measure for the proppingup of their ridiculous little country  and they call us provincial  it is hard to sit and look respectable while people discuss the utility of the house of lords and the beauty of a state church and its only in a dowdy musty civilisation that youll find them doing such things  the lightness and clearness of the social air thats the great relief in these parts  the gentility of bishops the propriety of parsons even the impressiveness of a restored cathedral give less of a charm to life than that  i used to be furious with the bishops and parsons with the humbuggery of the whole affair which every one was conscious of but which people agreed not to expose because they would be compromised all round  the convenience of life over here the quick and simple arrangements the absence of the spirit of routine are a blessed change from the stupid stiffness with which i struggled for two long years  there were people with swords and cockades who used to order me about for the simplest operation of life i had to kootoo to some bloated official  when it was a question of my doing a little differently from others the bloated official gasped as if i had given him a blow on the stomach he needed to take a week to think of it  on the other hand its impossible to take an american by surprise he is ashamed to confess that he has not the wit to do a thing that another man has had the wit to think of  besides being as good as his neighbour he must therefore be as cleverwhich is an affliction only to people who are afraid he may be cleverer  if this general efficiency and spontaneity of the peoplethe union of the sense of freedom with the love of knowledgeisnt the very essence of a high civilisation i dont know what a high civilisation is  i felt this greater ease on my first railroad journeyfelt the blessing of sitting in a train where i could move about where i could stretch my legs and come and go where i had a seat and a window to myself where there were chairs and tables and food and drink  the villainous little boxes on the european trains in which you are stuck down in a corner with doubledup knees opposite to a row of peopleoften most offensive types who stare at you for ten hours on endthese were part of my two years ordeal  the large free way of doing things here is everywhere a pleasure  in london at my hotel they used to come to me on saturday to make me order my sundays dinner and when i asked for a sheet of paper they put it into the bill  the meagreness the stinginess the perpetual expectation of a sixpence used to exasperate me  of course i saw a great many people who were pleasant but as i am writing to you and not to one of them i may say that they were dreadfully apt to be dull  the imagination among the people i see here is more flexible and then they have the advantage of a larger horizon  its not bounded on the north by the british aristocracy and on the south by the scrutin de liste  i mix up the countries a little but they are not worth the keeping apart  the absence of little conventional measurements of little cutanddried judgments is an immense refreshment  we are more analytic more discriminating more familiar with realities  as for manners there are bad manners everywhere but an aristocracy is bad manners organised  i dont mean that they may not be polite among themselves but they are rude to every one else  the sight of all these growing millions simply minding their business is impressive to memore so than all the gilt buttons and padded chests of the old world and there is a certain powerful type of practical american youll find him chiefly in the west who doesnt brag as i do im not practical but who quietly feels that he has the future in his vitalsa type that strikes me more than any i met in your favourite countries  of course youll come back to the cathedrals and titians but theres a thought that helps one to do without themthe thought that though theres an immense deal of plainness theres little misery little squalor little degradation  there is no regular wifebeating class and there are none of the stultified peasants of whom it takes so many to make a european noble  the people here are more conscious of things they invent they act they answer for themselves they are not i speak of social matters tied up by authority and precedent  we shall have all the titians by and by and we shall move over a few cathedrals  you had better stay here if you want to have the best  of course i am a roaring yankee but youll call me that if i say the least so i may as well take my ease and say the most  washingtons a most entertaining place and here at least at the seat of government one isnt overgoverned  in fact theres no government at all to speak of it seems too good to be true  the first day i was here i went to the capitol and it took me ever so long to figure to myself that i had as good a right there as any one elsethat the whole magnificent pile it is magnificent by the way was in fact my own  in europe one doesnt rise to such conceptions and my spirit had been broken in europe  the doors were gaping widei walked all about there were no doorkeepers no officers nor flunkeysnot even a policeman to be seen  it seemed strange not to see a uniform if only as a patch of colour  but this isnt government by livery the absence of these things is odd at first you seem to miss something to fancy the machine has stopped  it hasnt though it only works without fire and smoke  at the end of three days this simple negative impressionthe fact is that there are no soldiers nor spies nothing but plain black coatsbegins to affect the imagination becomes vivid majestic symbolic  it ends by being more impressive than the biggest review i saw in germany  of course im a roaring yankee but one has to take a big brush to copy a big model  the future is here of course but it isnt only thatthe present is here as well  you will complain that i dont give you any personal news but i am more modest for myself than for my country  i spent a month in new york and while i was there i saw a good deal of a rather interesting girl who came over with me in the steamer and whom for a day or two i thought i should like to marry  but i shouldnt  she has been spoiled by europe    viii  from miss aurora church in new york to miss whiteside in paris    january 9  i told you after we landed about my agreement with mammathat i was to have my liberty for three months and if at the end of this time i shouldnt have made a good use of it i was to give it back to her  well the time is up today and i am very much afraid i havent made a good use of it  in fact i havent made any use of it at alli havent got married for that is what mamma meant by our little bargain  she has been trying to marry me in europe for years without a dot and as she has never to the best of my knowledge even come near it she thought at last that if she were to leave it to me i might do better  i couldnt certainly do worse  well my dear i have done very badlythat is i havent done at all  i havent even tried  i had an idea that this affair came of itself over here but it hasnt come to me  i wont say i am disappointed for i havent on the whole seen any one i should like to marry  when you marry people over here they expect you to love them and i havent seen any one i should like to love  i dont know what the reason is but they are none of them what i have thought of  it may be that i have thought of the impossible and yet i have seen people in europe whom i should have liked to marry it is true they were almost always married to some one else  what i am disappointed in is simply having to give back my liberty  i dont wish particularly to be married and i do wish to do as i likeas i have been doing for the last month  all the same i am sorry for poor mamma as nothing has happened that she wished to happen  to begin with we are not appreciated not even by the rucks who have disappeared in the strange way in which people over here seem to vanish from the world  we have made no sensation my new dresses count for nothing they all have better ones our philological and historical studies dont show  we have been told we might do better in boston but on the other hand mamma hears that in boston the people only marry their cousins  then mamma is out of sorts because the country is exceedingly dear and we have spent all our money  moreover i have neither eloped nor been insulted nor been talked about norso far as i knowdeteriorated in manners or character so that mamma is wrong in all her previsions  i think she would have rather liked me to be insulted but i have been insulted as little as i have been adored  they dont adore you over here they only make you think they are going to  do you remember the two gentlemen who were on the ship and who after we arrived here came to see me a tour de role  at first i never dreamed they were making love to me though mamma was sure it must be that then as it went on a good while i thought perhaps it was that and i ended by seeing that it wasnt anything  it was simply conversation they are very fond of conversation over here mr leverett and mr cockerel disappeared one fine day without the smallest pretension to having broken my heart i am sure though it only depended on me to think they had  all the gentlemen are like that you cant tell what they mean everything is very confused society appears to consist of a sort of innocent jilting  i think on the whole i am a little disappointedi dont mean about ones not marrying i mean about the life generally  it seems so different at first that you expect it will be very exciting and then you find that after all when you have walked out for a week or two by yourself and driven out with a gentleman in a buggy thats about all there is of it as they say here  mamma is very angry at not finding more to dislike she admitted yesterday that once one has got a little settled the country has not even the merit of being hateful  this has evidently something to do with her suddenly proposing three days ago that we should go to the west imagine my surprise at such an idea coming from mamma  the people in the pensionwho as usual wish immensely to get rid of her have talked to her about the west and she has taken it up with a kind of desperation  you see we must do something we cant simply remain here  we are rapidly being ruined and we are notso to speakgetting married  perhaps it will be easier in the west at any rate it will be cheaper and the country will have the advantage of being more hateful  it is a question between that and returning to europe and for the moment mamma is balancing  i say nothing  i am really indifferent perhaps i shall marry a pioneer i am just thinking how i shall give back my liberty  it really wont be possible i havent got it any more i have given it away to others  mamma may recover it if she can from them  she comes in at this moment to say that we must push farthershe has decided for the west  wonderful mamma  it appears that my real chance is for a pioneerthey have sometimes millions  but fancy us in the west
