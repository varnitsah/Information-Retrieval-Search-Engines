34151112	the son of tarzan   by  edgar rice burroughs     to hulbert burroughs     chapter 1   the long boat of the marjorie w was floating down the broad ugambi with ebb tide and current  her crew were lazily enjoying this respite from the arduous labor of rowing up stream  three miles below them lay the marjorie w  herself quite ready to sail so soon as they should have clambered aboard and swung the long boat to its davits  presently the attention of every man was drawn from his dreaming or his gossiping to the northern bank of the river  there screaming at them in a cracked falsetto and with skinny arms outstretched stood a strange apparition of a man  wot the ell ejaculated one of the crew  a white man muttered the mate and then  man the oars boys and well just pull over an see what he wants  when they came close to the shore they saw an emaciated creature with scant white locks tangled and matted  the thin bent body was naked but for a loin cloth  tears were rolling down the sunken pockmarked cheeks  the man jabbered at them in a strange tongue  rooshun hazarded the mate  savvy english he called to the man  he did and in that tongue brokenly and haltingly as though it had been many years since he had used it he begged them to take him with them away from this awful country  once on board the marjorie w the stranger told his rescuers a pitiful tale of privation hardships and torture extending over a period of ten years  how he happened to have come to africa he did not tell them leaving them to assume he had forgotten the incidents of his life prior to the frightful ordeals that had wrecked him mentally and physically  he did not even tell them his true name and so they knew him only as michael sabrov nor was there any resemblance between this sorry wreck and the virile though unprincipled alexis paulvitch of old  it had been ten years since the russian had escaped the fate of his friend the archfiend rokoff and not once but many times during those ten years had paulvitch cursed the fate that had given to nicholas rokoff death and immunity from suffering while it had meted to him the hideous terrors of an existence infinitely worse than the death that persistently refused to claim him  paulvitch had taken to the jungle when he had seen the beasts of tarzan and their savage lord swarm the deck of the kincaid and in his terror lest tarzan pursue and capture him he had stumbled on deep into the jungle only to fall at last into the hands of one of the savage cannibal tribes that had felt the weight of rokoffs evil temper and cruel brutality  some strange whim of the chief of this tribe saved paulvitch from death only to plunge him into a life of misery and torture  for ten years he had been the butt of the village beaten and stoned by the women and children cut and slashed and disfigured by the warriors a victim of often recurring fevers of the most malignant variety  yet he did not die  smallpox laid its hideous clutches upon him leaving him unspeakably branded with its repulsive marks  between it and the attentions of the tribe the countenance of alexis paulvitch was so altered that his own mother could not have recognized in the pitiful mask he called his face a single familiar feature  a few scraggly yellowwhite locks had supplanted the thick dark hair that had covered his head  his limbs were bent and twisted he walked with a shuffling unsteady gait his body doubled forward  his teeth were goneknocked out by his savage masters  even his mentality was but a sorry mockery of what it once had been  they took him aboard the marjorie w and there they fed and nursed him  he gained a little in strength but his appearance never altered for the bettera human derelict battered and wrecked they had found him a human derelict battered and wrecked he would remain until death claimed him  though still in his thirties alexis paulvitch could easily have passed for eighty  inscrutable nature had demanded of the accomplice a greater penalty than his principal had paid  in the mind of alexis paulvitch there lingered no thoughts of revengeonly a dull hatred of the man whom he and rokoff had tried to break and failed  there was hatred too of the memory of rokoff for rokoff had led him into the horrors he had undergone  there was hatred of the police of a score of cities from which he had had to flee there was hatred of law hatred of order hatred of everything  every moment of the mans waking life was filled with morbid thought of hatredhe had become mentally as he was physically in outward appearance the personification of the blighting emotion of hate  he had little or nothing to do with the men who had rescued him  he was too weak to work and too morose for company and so they quickly left him alone to his own devices  the marjorie w had been chartered by a syndicate of wealthy manufacturers equipped with a laboratory and a staff of scientists and sent out to search for some natural product which the manufacturers who footed the bills had been importing from south america at an enormous cost  what the product was none on board the marjorie w knew except the scientists nor is it of any moment to us other than that it led the ship to a certain island off the coast of africa after alexis paulvitch had been taken aboard  the ship lay at anchor off the coast for several weeks  the monotony of life aboard her became trying for the crew  they went often ashore and finally paulvitch asked to accompany themhe too was tiring of the blighting sameness of existence upon the ship  the island was heavily timbered  dense jungle ran down almost to the beach  the scientists were far inland prosecuting their search for the valuable commodity that native rumor upon the mainland had led them to believe might be found here in marketable quantity  the ships company fished hunted and explored  paulvitch shuffled up and down the beach or lay in the shade of the great trees that skirted it  one day as the men were gathered at a little distance inspecting the body of a panther that had fallen to the gun of one of them who had been hunting inland paulvitch lay sleeping beneath his tree  he was awakened by the touch of a hand upon his shoulder  with a start he sat up to see a huge anthropoid ape squatting at his side inspecting him intently  the russian was thoroughly frightened  he glanced toward the sailorsthey were a couple of hundred yards away  again the ape plucked at his shoulder jabbering plaintively  paulvitch saw no menace in the inquiring gaze or in the attitude of the beast  he got slowly to his feet  the ape rose at his side  half doubled the man shuffled cautiously away toward the sailors  the ape moved with him taking one of his arms  they had come almost to the little knot of men before they were seen and by this time paulvitch had become assured that the beast meant no harm  the animal evidently was accustomed to the association of human beings  it occurred to the russian that the ape represented a certain considerable money value and before they reached the sailors he had decided he should be the one to profit by it  when the men looked up and saw the oddly paired couple shuffling toward them they were filled with amazement and started on a run toward the two  the ape showed no sign of fear  instead he grasped each sailor by the shoulder and peered long and earnestly into his face  having inspected them all he returned to paulvitchs side disappointment written strongly upon his countenance and in his carriage  the men were delighted with him  they gathered about asking paulvitch many questions and examining his companion  the russian told them that the ape was hisnothing further would he offerbut kept harping continually upon the same theme the ape is mine  the ape is mine tiring of paulvitch one of the men essayed a pleasantry  circling about behind the ape he prodded the anthropoid in the back with a pin like a flash the beast wheeled upon its tormentor and in the briefest instant of turning the placid friendly animal was metamorphosed to a frenzied demon of rage  the broad grin that had sat upon the sailors face as he perpetrated his little joke froze to an expression of terror  he attempted to dodge the long arms that reached for him but failing drew a long knife that hung at his belt  with a single wrench the ape tore the weapon from the mans grasp and flung it to one side then his yellow fangs were buried in the sailors shoulder  with sticks and knives the mans companions fell upon the beast while paulvitch danced around the cursing snarling pack mumbling and screaming pleas and threats  he saw his visions of wealth rapidly dissipating before the weapons of the sailors  the ape however proved no easy victim to the superior numbers that seemed fated to overwhelm him  rising from the sailor who had precipitated the battle he shook his giant shoulders freeing himself from two of the men that were clinging to his back and with mighty blows of his open palms felled one after another of his attackers leaping hither and thither with the agility of a small monkey  the fight had been witnessed by the captain and mate who were just landing from the marjorie w and paulvitch saw these two now running forward with drawn revolvers while the two sailors who had brought them ashore trailed at their heels  the ape stood looking about him at the havoc he had wrought but whether he was awaiting a renewal of the attack or was deliberating which of his foes he should exterminate first paulvitch could not guess  what he could guess however was that the moment the two officers came within firing distance of the beast they would put an end to him in short order unless something were done and done quickly to prevent  the ape had made no move to attack the russian but even so the man was none too sure of what might happen were he to interfere with the savage beast now thoroughly aroused to bestial rage and with the smell of new spilled blood fresh in its nostrils  for an instant he hesitated and then again there rose before him the dreams of affluence which this great anthropoid would doubtless turn to realities once paulvitch had landed him safely in some great metropolis like london  the captain was shouting to him now to stand aside that he might have a shot at the animal but instead paulvitch shuffled to the apes side and though the mans hair quivered at its roots he mastered his fear and laid hold of the apes arm  come he commanded and tugged to pull the beast from among the sailors many of whom were now sitting up in wide eyed fright or crawling away from their conqueror upon hands and knees  slowly the ape permitted itself to be led to one side nor did it show the slightest indication of a desire to harm the russian  the captain came to a halt a few paces from the odd pair  get aside sabrov he commanded  ill put that brute where he wont chew up any more able seamen  it wasnt his fault captain pleaded paulvitch  please dont shoot him  the men started itthey attacked him first  you see hes perfectly gentleand hes minehes minehes mine  i wont let you kill him he concluded as his halfwrecked mentality pictured anew the pleasure that money would buy in londonmoney that he could not hope to possess without some such windfall as the ape represented  the captain lowered his weapon  the men started it did they he repeated  how about that and he turned toward the sailors who had by this time picked themselves from the ground none of them much the worse for his experience except the fellow who had been the cause of it and who would doubtless nurse a sore shoulder for a week or so  simpson done it said one of the men  he stuck a pin into the monk from behind and the monk got himwhich served him bloomin well rightan he got the rest of us too for which i cant blame him since we all jumped him to once  the captain looked at simpson who sheepishly admitted the truth of the allegation then he stepped over to the ape as though to discover for himself the sort of temper the beast possessed but it was noticeable that he kept his revolver cocked and leveled as he did so  however he spoke soothingly to the animal who squatted at the russians side looking first at one and then another of the sailors  as the captain approached him the ape half rose and waddled forward to meet him  upon his countenance was the same strange searching expression that had marked his scrutiny of each of the sailors he had first encountered he came quite close to the officer and laid a paw upon one of the mans shoulders studying his face intently for a long moment then came the expression of disappointment accompanied by what was almost a human sigh as he turned away to peer in the same curious fashion into the faces of the mate and the two sailors who had arrived with the officers  in each instance he sighed and passed on returning at length to paulvitchs side where he squatted down once more thereafter evincing little or no interest in any of the other men and apparently forgetful of his recent battle with them  when the party returned aboard the marjorie w paulvitch was accompanied by the ape who seemed anxious to follow him  the captain interposed no obstacles to the arrangement and so the great anthropoid was tacitly admitted to membership in the ships company  once aboard he examined each new face minutely evincing the same disappointment in each instance that had marked his scrutiny of the others  the officers and scientists aboard often discussed the beast but they were unable to account satisfactorily for the strange ceremony with which he greeted each new face  had he been discovered upon the mainland or any other place than the almost unknown island that had been his home they would have concluded that he had formerly been a pet of man but that theory was not tenable in the face of the isolation of his uninhabited island  he seemed continually to be searching for someone and during the first days of the return voyage from the island he was often discovered nosing about in various parts of the ship but after he had seen and examined each face of the ships company and explored every corner of the vessel he lapsed into utter indifference of all about him  even the russian elicited only casual interest when he brought him food  at other times the ape appeared merely to tolerate him  he never showed affection for him or for anyone else upon the marjorie w nor did he at any time evince any indication of the savage temper that had marked his resentment of the attack of the sailors upon him at the time that he had come among them  most of his time was spent in the eye of the ship scanning the horizon ahead as though he were endowed with sufficient reason to know that the vessel was bound for some port where there would be other human beings to undergo his searching scrutiny  all in all ajax as he had been dubbed was considered the most remarkable and intelligent ape that any one aboard the marjorie w ever had seen  nor was his intelligence the only remarkable attribute he owned  his stature and physique were for an ape awe inspiring  that he was old was quite evident but if his age had impaired his physical or mental powers in the slightest it was not apparent  and so at length the marjorie w came to england and there the officers and the scientists filled with compassion for the pitiful wreck of a man they had rescued from the jungles furnished paulvitch with funds and bid him and his ajax godspeed  upon the dock and all through the journey to london the russian had his hands full with ajax  each new face of the thousands that came within the anthropoids ken must be carefully scrutinized much to the horror of many of his victims but at last failing apparently to discover whom he sought the great ape relapsed into morbid indifference only occasionally evincing interest in a passing face  in london paulvitch went directly with his prize to a certain famous animal trainer  this man was much impressed with ajax with the result that he agreed to train him for a lions share of the profits of exhibiting him and in the meantime to provide for the keep of both the ape and his owner  and so came ajax to london and there was forged another link in the chain of strange circumstances that were to affect the lives of many people     chapter 2   mr harold moore was a biliouscountenanced studious young man  he took himself very seriously and life and his work which latter was the tutoring of the young son of a british nobleman  he felt that his charge was not making the progress that his parents had a right to expect and he was now conscientiously explaining this fact to the boys mother  its not that he isnt bright he was saying if that were true i should have hopes of succeeding for then i might bring to bear all my energies in overcoming his obtuseness but the trouble is that he is exceptionally intelligent and learns so quickly that i can find no fault in the matter of the preparation of his lessons  what concerns me however is the fact that he evidently takes no interest whatever in the subjects we are studying  he merely accomplishes each lesson as a task to be rid of as quickly as possible and i am sure that no lesson ever again enters his mind until the hours of study and recitation once more arrive  his sole interests seem to be feats of physical prowess and the reading of everything that he can get hold of relative to savage beasts and the lives and customs of uncivilized peoples but particularly do stories of animals appeal to him  he will sit for hours together poring over the work of some african explorer and upon two occasions i have found him setting up in bed at night reading carl hagenbecks book on men and beasts  the boys mother tapped her foot nervously upon the hearth rug  you discourage this of course she ventured  mr moore shuffled embarrassedly  iahessayed to take the book from him he replied a slight flush mounting his sallow cheek butahyour son is quite muscular for one so young  he wouldnt let you take it asked the mother  he would not confessed the tutor  he was perfectly good natured about it but he insisted upon pretending that he was a gorilla and that i was a chimpanzee attempting to steal food from him  he leaped upon me with the most savage growls i ever heard lifted me completely above his head hurled me upon his bed and after going through a pantomime indicative of choking me to death he stood upon my prostrate form and gave voice to a most fearsome shriek which he explained was the victory cry of a bull ape  then he carried me to the door shoved me out into the hall and locked me from his room  for several minutes neither spoke again  it was the boys mother who finally broke the silence  it is very necessary mr moore she said that you do everything in your power to discourage this tendency in jack he but she got no further  a loud whoop from the direction of the window brought them both to their feet  the room was upon the second floor of the house and opposite the window to which their attention had been attracted was a large tree a branch of which spread to within a few feet of the sill  upon this branch now they both discovered the subject of their recent conversation a tall wellbuilt boy balancing with ease upon the bending limb and uttering loud shouts of glee as he noted the terrified expressions upon the faces of his audience  the mother and tutor both rushed toward the window but before they had crossed half the room the boy had leaped nimbly to the sill and entered the apartment with them  the wild man from borneo has just come to town he sang dancing a species of war dance about his terrified mother and scandalized tutor and ending up by throwing his arms about the formers neck and kissing her upon either cheek  oh mother he cried theres a wonderful educated ape being shown at one of the music halls  willie grimsby saw it last night  he says it can do everything but talk  it rides a bicycle eats with knife and fork counts up to ten and ever so many other wonderful things and can i go and see it too  oh please motherplease let me  patting the boys cheek affectionately the mother shook her head negatively  no jack she said you know i do not approve of such exhibitions  i dont see why not mother replied the boy  all the other fellows go and they go to the zoo too and youll never let me do even that anybodyd think i was a girlor a mollycoddle  oh father he exclaimed as the door opened to admit a tall grayeyed man  oh father cant i go  go where my son asked the newcomer  he wants to go to a music hall to see a trained ape said the mother looking warningly at her husband  who ajax questioned the man  the boy nodded  well i dont know that i blame you my son said the father i wouldnt mind seeing him myself  they say he is very wonderful and that for an anthropoid he is unusually large  lets all go janewhat do you say  and he turned toward his wife but that lady only shook her head in a most positive manner and turning to mr moore asked him if it was not time that he and jack were in the study for the morning recitations  when the two had left she turned toward her husband  john she said something must be done to discourage jacks tendency toward anything that may excite the cravings for the savage life which i fear he has inherited from you  you know from your own experience how strong is the call of the wild at times  you know that often it has necessitated a stern struggle on your part to resist the almost insane desire which occasionally overwhelms you to plunge once again into the jungle life that claimed you for so many years and at the same time you know better than any other how frightful a fate it would be for jack were the trail to the savage jungle made either alluring or easy to him  i doubt if there is any danger of his inheriting a taste for jungle life from me replied the man for i cannot conceive that such a thing may be transmitted from father to son  and sometimes jane i think that in your solicitude for his future you go a bit too far in your restrictive measures  his love for animalshis desire for example to see this trained apeis only natural in a healthy normal boy of his age  just because he wants to see ajax is no indication that he would wish to marry an ape and even should he far be it from you jane to have the right to cry shame and john clayton lord greystoke put an arm about his wife laughing goodnaturedly down into her upturned face before he bent his head and kissed her  then more seriously he continued  you have never told jack anything concerning my early life nor have you permitted me to and in this i think that you have made a mistake  had i been able to tell him of the experiences of tarzan of the apes i could doubtless have taken much of the glamour and romance from jungle life that naturally surrounds it in the minds of those who have had no experience of it  he might then have profited by my experience but now should the jungle lust ever claim him he will have nothing to guide him but his own impulses and i know how powerful these may be in the wrong direction at times  but lady greystoke only shook her head as she had a hundred other times when the subject had claimed her attention in the past  no john she insisted i shall never give my consent to the implanting in jacks mind of any suggestion of the savage life which we both wish to preserve him from  it was evening before the subject was again referred to and then it was raised by jack himself  he had been sitting curled in a large chair reading when he suddenly looked up and addressed his father  why he asked coming directly to the point cant i go and see ajax  your mother does not approve replied his father  do you  that is not the question evaded lord greystoke  it is enough that your mother objects  i am going to see him announced the boy after a few moments of thoughtful silence  i am not different from willie grimsby or any other of the fellows who have been to see him  it did not harm them and it will not harm me  i could go without telling you but i would not do that  so i tell you now beforehand that i am going to see ajax  there was nothing disrespectful or defiant in the boys tone or manner his was merely a dispassionate statement of facts  his father could scarce repress either a smile or a show of the admiration he felt for the manly course his son had pursued  i admire your candor jack he said  permit me to be candid as well  if you go to see ajax without permission i shall punish you  i have never inflicted corporal punishment upon you but i warn you that should you disobey your mothers wishes in this instance i shall  yes sir replied the boy and then  i shall tell you sir when i have been to see ajax  mr moores room was next to that of his youthful charge and it was the tutors custom to have a look into the boys each evening as the former was about to retire  this evening he was particularly careful not to neglect his duty for he had just come from a conference with the boys father and mother in which it had been impressed upon him that he must exercise the greatest care to prevent jack visiting the music hall where ajax was being shown  so when he opened the boys door at about half after nine he was greatly excited though not entirely surprised to find the future lord greystoke fully dressed for the street and about to crawl from his open bed room window  mr moore made a rapid spring across the apartment but the waste of energy was unnecessary for when the boy heard him within the chamber and realized that he had been discovered he turned back as though to relinquish his planned adventure  where were you going panted the excited mr moore  i am going to see ajax replied the boy quietly  i am astonished cried mr moore but a moment later he was infinitely more astonished for the boy approaching close to him suddenly seized him about the waist lifted him from his feet and threw him face downward upon the bed shoving his face deep into a soft pillow  be quiet admonished the victor or ill choke you  mr moore struggled but his efforts were in vain  whatever else tarzan of the apes may or may not have handed down to his son he had at least bequeathed him almost as marvelous a physique as he himself had possessed at the same age  the tutor was as putty in the boys hands kneeling upon him jack tore strips from a sheet and bound the mans hands behind his back then he rolled him over and stuffed a gag of the same material between his teeth securing it with a strip wound about the back of his victims head  all the while he talked in a low conversational tone  i am waja chief of the waji he explained and you are mohammed dubn the arab sheik who would murder my people and steal my ivory and he dexterously trussed mr moores hobbled ankles up behind to meet his hobbled wrists  ahha  villain  i have you in me power at last  i go but i shall return  and the son of tarzan skipped across the room slipped through the open window and slid to liberty by way of the down spout from an eaves trough  mr moore wriggled and struggled about the bed  he was sure that he should suffocate unless aid came quickly  in his frenzy of terror he managed to roll off the bed  the pain and shock of the fall jolted him back to something like sane consideration of his plight  where before he had been unable to think intelligently because of the hysterical fear that had claimed him he now lay quietly searching for some means of escape from his dilemma  it finally occurred to him that the room in which lord and lady greystoke had been sitting when he left them was directly beneath that in which he lay upon the floor  he knew that some time had elapsed since he had come up stairs and that they might be gone by this time for it seemed to him that he had struggled about the bed in his efforts to free himself for an eternity  but the best that he could do was to attempt to attract attention from below and so after many failures he managed to work himself into a position in which he could tap the toe of his boot against the floor  this he proceeded to do at short intervals until after what seemed a very long time he was rewarded by hearing footsteps ascending the stairs and presently a knock upon the door  mr moore tapped vigorously with his toehe could not reply in any other way  the knock was repeated after a moments silence  again mr moore tapped  would they never open the door  laboriously he rolled in the direction of succor  if he could get his back against the door he could then tap upon its base when surely he must be heard  the knocking was repeated a little louder and finally a voice called  mr jack  it was one of the house menmr moore recognized the fellows voice he came near to bursting a blood vessel in an endeavor to scream come in through the stifling gag  after a moment the man knocked again quite loudly and again called the boys name  receiving no reply he turned the knob and at the same instant a sudden recollection filled the tutor anew with numbing terrorhe had himself locked the door behind him when he had entered the room  he heard the servant try the door several times and then depart  upon which mr moore swooned  in the meantime jack was enjoying to the full the stolen pleasures of the music hall  he had reached the temple of mirth just as ajaxs act was commencing and having purchased a box seat was now leaning breathlessly over the rail watching every move of the great ape his eyes wide in wonder  the trainer was not slow to note the boys handsome eager face and as one of ajaxs biggest hits consisted in an entry to one or more boxes during his performance ostensibly in search of a longlost relative as the trainer explained the man realized the effectiveness of sending him into the box with the handsome boy who doubtless would be terror stricken by proximity to the shaggy powerful beast  when the time came therefore for the ape to return from the wings in reply to an encore the trainer directed its attention to the boy who chanced to be the sole occupant of the box in which he sat  with a spring the huge anthropoid leaped from the stage to the boys side but if the trainer had looked for a laughable scene of fright he was mistaken  a broad smile lighted the boys features as he laid his hand upon the shaggy arm of his visitor  the ape grasping the boy by either shoulder peered long and earnestly into his face while the latter stroked his head and talked to him in a low voice  never had ajax devoted so long a time to an examination of another as he did in this instance  he seemed troubled and not a little excited jabbering and mumbling to the boy and now caressing him as the trainer had never seen him caress a human being before  presently he clambered over into the box with him and snuggled down close to the boys side  the audience was delighted but they were still more delighted when the trainer the period of his act having elapsed attempted to persuade ajax to leave the box  the ape would not budge the manager becoming excited at the delay urged the trainer to greater haste but when the latter entered the box to drag away the reluctant ajax he was met by bared fangs and menacing growls  the audience was delirious with joy  they cheered the ape  they cheered the boy and they hooted and jeered at the trainer and the manager which luckless individual had inadvertently shown himself and attempted to assist the trainer  finally reduced to desperation and realizing that this show of mutiny upon the part of his valuable possession might render the animal worthless for exhibition purposes in the future if not immediately subdued the trainer had hastened to his dressing room and procured a heavy whip  with this he now returned to the box but when he had threatened ajax with it but once he found himself facing two infuriated enemies instead of one for the boy had leaped to his feet and seizing a chair was standing ready at the apes side to defend his new found friend  there was no longer a smile upon his handsome face  in his gray eyes was an expression which gave the trainer pause and beside him stood the giant anthropoid growling and ready  what might have happened but for a timely interruption may only be surmised but that the trainer would have received a severe mauling if nothing more was clearly indicated by the attitudes of the two who faced him   it was a palefaced man who rushed into the greystoke library to announce that he had found jacks door locked and had been able to obtain no response to his repeated knocking and calling other than a strange tapping and the sound of what might have been a body moving about upon the floor  four steps at a time john clayton took the stairs that led to the floor above  his wife and the servant hurried after him  once he called his sons name in a loud voice but receiving no reply he launched his great weight backed by all the undiminished power of his giant muscles against the heavy door  with a snapping of iron butts and a splintering of wood the obstacle burst inward  at its foot lay the body of the unconscious mr moore across whom it fell with a resounding thud  through the opening leaped tarzan and a moment later the room was flooded with light from a dozen electric bulbs  it was several minutes before the tutor was discovered so completely had the door covered him but finally he was dragged forth his gag and bonds cut away and a liberal application of cold water had hastened returning consciousness  where is jack was john claytons first question and then who did this as the memory of rokoff and the fear of a second abduction seized him  slowly mr moore staggered to his feet  his gaze wandered about the room  gradually he collected his scattered wits  the details of his recent harrowing experience returned to him  i tender my resignation sir to take effect at once were his first words  you do not need a tutor for your sonwhat he needs is a wild animal trainer  but where is he cried lady greystoke  he has gone to see ajax  it was with difficulty that tarzan restrained a smile and after satisfying himself that the tutor was more scared than injured he ordered his closed car around and departed in the direction of a certain wellknown music hall     chapter 3   as the trainer with raised lash hesitated an instant at the entrance to the box where the boy and the ape confronted him a tall broadshouldered man pushed past him and entered  as his eyes fell upon the newcomer a slight flush mounted the boys cheeks  father he exclaimed  the ape gave one look at the english lord and then leaped toward him calling out in excited jabbering  the man his eyes going wide in astonishment stopped as though turned to stone  akut he cried  the boy looked bewildered from the ape to his father and from his father to the ape  the trainers jaw dropped as he listened to what followed for from the lips of the englishman flowed the gutturals of an ape that were answered in kind by the huge anthropoid that now clung to him  and from the wings a hideously bent and disfigured old man watched the tableau in the box his pockmarked features working spasmodically in varying expressions that might have marked every sensation in the gamut from pleasure to terror  long have i looked for you tarzan said akut  now that i have found you i shall come to your jungle and live there always  the man stroked the beasts head  through his mind there was running rapidly a train of recollection that carried him far into the depths of the primeval african forest where this huge manlike beast had fought shoulder to shoulder with him years before  he saw the black mugambi wielding his deadly knobstick and beside them with bared fangs and bristling whiskers sheeta the terrible and pressing close behind the savage and the savage panther the hideous apes of akut  the man sighed  strong within him surged the jungle lust that he had thought dead  ah if he could go back even for a brief month of it to feel again the brush of leafy branches against his naked hide to smell the musty rot of dead vegetationfrankincense and myrrh to the jungle born to sense the noiseless coming of the great carnivora upon his trail to hunt and to be hunted to kill  the picture was alluring and then came another picturea sweetfaced woman still young and beautiful friends a home a son  he shrugged his giant shoulders  it cannot be akut he said but if you would return i shall see that it is done  you could not be happy herei may not be happy there  the trainer stepped forward  the ape bared his fangs growling  go with him akut said tarzan of the apes  i will come and see you tomorrow  the beast moved sullenly to the trainers side  the latter at john claytons request told where they might be found  tarzan turned toward his son  come he said and the two left the theater  neither spoke for several minutes after they had entered the limousine  it was the boy who broke the silence  the ape knew you he said and you spoke together in the apes tongue  how did the ape know you and how did you learn his language  and then briefly and for the first time tarzan of the apes told his son of his early lifeof the birth in the jungle of the death of his parents and of how kala the great she ape had suckled and raised him from infancy almost to manhood  he told him too of the dangers and the horrors of the jungle of the great beasts that stalked one by day and by night of the periods of drought and of the cataclysmic rains of hunger of cold of intense heat of nakedness and fear and suffering  he told him of all those things that seem most horrible to the creature of civilization in the hope that the knowledge of them might expunge from the lads mind any inherent desire for the jungle yet they were the very things that made the memory of the jungle what it was to tarzanthat made up the composite jungle life he loved  and in the telling he forgot one thingthe principal thingthat the boy at his side listening with eager ears was the son of tarzan of the apes  after the boy had been tucked away in bedand without the threatened punishmentjohn clayton told his wife of the events of the evening and that he had at last acquainted the boy with the facts of his jungle life  the mother who had long foreseen that her son must some time know of those frightful years during which his father had roamed the jungle a naked savage beast of prey only shook her head hoping against hope that the lure she knew was still strong in the fathers breast had not been transmitted to his son  tarzan visited akut the following day but though jack begged to be allowed to accompany him he was refused  this time tarzan saw the pockmarked old owner of the ape whom he did not recognize as the wily paulvitch of former days  tarzan influenced by akuts pleadings broached the question of the apes purchase but paulvitch would not name any price saying that he would consider the matter  when tarzan returned home jack was all excitement to hear the details of his visit and finally suggested that his father buy the ape and bring it home  lady greystoke was horrified at the suggestion  the boy was insistent  tarzan explained that he had wished to purchase akut and return him to his jungle home and to this the mother assented  jack asked to be allowed to visit the ape but again he was met with flat refusal  he had the address however which the trainer had given his father and two days later he found the opportunity to elude his new tutorwho had replaced the terrified mr mooreand after a considerable search through a section of london which he had never before visited he found the smelly little quarters of the pockmarked old man  the old fellow himself replied to his knocking and when he stated that he had come to see ajax opened the door and admitted him to the little room which he and the great ape occupied in former years paulvitch had been a fastidious scoundrel but ten years of hideous life among the cannibals of africa had eradicated the last vestige of niceness from his habits  his apparel was wrinkled and soiled  his hands were unwashed his few straggling locks uncombed his room was a jumble of filthy disorder  as the boy entered he saw the great ape squatting upon the bed the coverlets of which were a tangled wad of filthy blankets and illsmelling quilts  at sight of the youth the ape leaped to the floor and shuffled forward  the man not recognizing his visitor and fearing that the ape meant mischief stepped between them ordering the ape back to the bed  he will not hurt me cried the boy  we are friends and before he was my fathers friend  they knew one another in the jungle  my father is lord greystoke  he does not know that i have come here  my mother forbid my coming but i wished to see ajax and i will pay you if you will let me come here often and see him  at the mention of the boys identity paulvitchs eyes narrowed  since he had first seen tarzan again from the wings of the theater there had been forming in his deadened brain the beginnings of a desire for revenge  it is a characteristic of the weak and criminal to attribute to others the misfortunes that are the result of their own wickedness and so now it was that alexis paulvitch was slowly recalling the events of his past life and as he did so laying at the door of the man whom he and rokoff had so assiduously attempted to ruin and murder all the misfortunes that had befallen him in the failure of their various schemes against their intended victim  he saw at first no way in which he could with safety to himself wreak vengeance upon tarzan through the medium of tarzans son but that great possibilities for revenge lay in the boy was apparent to him and so he determined to cultivate the lad in the hope that fate would play into his hands in some way in the future  he told the boy all that he knew of his fathers past life in the jungle and when he found that the boy had been kept in ignorance of all these things for so many years and that he had been forbidden visiting the zoological gardens that he had had to bind and gag his tutor to find an opportunity to come to the music hall and see ajax he guessed immediately the nature of the great fear that lay in the hearts of the boys parentsthat he might crave the jungle as his father had craved it  and so paulvitch encouraged the boy to come and see him often and always he played upon the lads craving for tales of the savage world with which paulvitch was all too familiar  he left him alone with akut much and it was not long until he was surprised to learn that the boy could make the great beast understand himthat he had actually learned many of the words of the primitive language of the anthropoids  during this period tarzan came several times to visit paulvitch  he seemed anxious to purchase ajax and at last he told the man frankly that he was prompted not only by a desire upon his part to return the beast to the liberty of his native jungle but also because his wife feared that in some way her son might learn the whereabouts of the ape and through his attachment for the beast become imbued with the roving instinct which as tarzan explained to paulvitch had so influenced his own life  the russian could scarce repress a smile as he listened to lord greystokes words since scarce a half hour had passed since the time the future lord greystoke had been sitting upon the disordered bed jabbering away to ajax with all the fluency of a born ape  it was during this interview that a plan occurred to paulvitch and as a result of it he agreed to accept a certain fabulous sum for the ape and upon receipt of the money to deliver the beast to a vessel that was sailing south from dover for africa two days later  he had a double purpose in accepting claytons offer  primarily the money consideration influenced him strongly as the ape was no longer a source of revenue to him having consistently refused to perform upon the stage after having discovered tarzan  it was as though the beast had suffered himself to be brought from his jungle home and exhibited before thousands of curious spectators for the sole purpose of searching out his long lost friend and master and having found him considered further mingling with the common herd of humans unnecessary however that may be the fact remained that no amount of persuasion could influence him even to show himself upon the music hall stage and upon the single occasion that the trainer attempted force the results were such that the unfortunate man considered himself lucky to have escaped with his life  all that saved him was the accidental presence of jack clayton who had been permitted to visit the animal in the dressing room reserved for him at the music hall and had immediately interfered when he saw that the savage beast meant serious mischief  and after the money consideration strong in the heart of the russian was the desire for revenge which had been growing with constant brooding over the failures and miseries of his life which he attributed to tarzan the latest and by no means the least of which was ajaxs refusal to longer earn money for him  the apes refusal he traced directly to tarzan finally convincing himself that the ape man had instructed the great anthropoid to refuse to go upon the stage  paulvitchs naturally malign disposition was aggravated by the weakening and warping of his mental and physical faculties through torture and privation  from cold calculating highly intelligent perversity it had deteriorated into the indiscriminating dangerous menace of the mentally defective  his plan however was sufficiently cunning to at least cast a doubt upon the assertion that his mentality was wandering  it assured him first of the competence which lord greystoke had promised to pay him for the deportation of the ape and then of revenge upon his benefactor through the son he idolized  that part of his scheme was crude and brutalit lacked the refinement of torture that had marked the master strokes of the paulvitch of old when he had worked with that virtuoso of villainy nikolas rokoffbut it at least assured paulvitch of immunity from responsibility placing that upon the ape who would thus also be punished for his refusal longer to support the russian  everything played with fiendish unanimity into paulvitchs hands  as chance would have it tarzans son overheard his father relating to the boys mother the steps he was taking to return akut safely to his jungle home and having overheard he begged them to bring the ape home that he might have him for a playfellow  tarzan would not have been averse to this plan but lady greystoke was horrified at the very thought of it  jack pleaded with his mother but all unavailingly she was obdurate and at last the lad appeared to acquiesce in his mothers decision that the ape must be returned to africa and the boy to school from which he had been absent on vacation  he did not attempt to visit paulvitchs room again that day but instead busied himself in other ways  he had always been well supplied with money so that when necessity demanded he had no difficulty in collecting several hundred pounds  some of this money he invested in various strange purchases which he managed to smuggle into the house undetected when he returned late in the afternoon  the next morning after giving his father time to precede him and conclude his business with paulvitch the lad hastened to the russians room  knowing nothing of the mans true character the boy dared not take him fully into his confidence for fear that the old fellow would not only refuse to aid him but would report the whole affair to his father  instead he simply asked permission to take ajax to dover  he explained that it would relieve the old man of a tiresome journey as well as placing a number of pounds in his pocket for the lad purposed paying the russian well  you see he went on there will be no danger of detection since i am supposed to be leaving on an afternoon train for school  instead i will come here after they have left me on board the train  then i can take ajax to dover you see and arrive at school only a day late  no one will be the wiser no harm will be done and i shall have had an extra day with ajax before i lose him forever  the plan fitted perfectly with that which paulvitch had in mind  had he known what further the boy contemplated he would doubtless have entirely abandoned his own scheme of revenge and aided the boy whole heartedly in the consummation of the lads which would have been better for paulvitch could he have but read the future but a few short hours ahead  that afternoon lord and lady greystoke bid their son goodbye and saw him safely settled in a firstclass compartment of the railway carriage that would set him down at school in a few hours  no sooner had they left him however than he gathered his bags together descended from the compartment and sought a cab stand outside the station  here he engaged a cabby to take him to the russians address  it was dusk when he arrived  he found paulvitch awaiting him  the man was pacing the floor nervously  the ape was tied with a stout cord to the bed  it was the first time that jack had ever seen ajax thus secured  he looked questioningly at paulvitch  the man mumbling explained that he believed the animal had guessed that he was to be sent away and he feared he would attempt to escape  paulvitch carried another piece of cord in his hand  there was a noose in one end of it which he was continually playing with  he walked back and forth up and down the room  his pockmarked features were working horribly as he talked silent to himself  the boy had never seen him thusit made him uneasy  at last paulvitch stopped on the opposite side of the room far from the ape  come here he said to the lad  i will show you how to secure the ape should he show signs of rebellion during the trip  the lad laughed  it will not be necessary he replied  ajax will do whatever i tell him to do  the old man stamped his foot angrily  come here as i tell you he repeated  if you do not do as i say you shall not accompany the ape to doveri will take no chances upon his escaping  still smiling the lad crossed the room and stood before the russ  turn around with your back toward me directed the latter that i may show you how to bind him quickly  the boy did as he was bid placing his hands behind him when paulvitch told him to do so  instantly the old man slipped the running noose over one of the lads wrists took a couple of half hitches about his other wrist and knotted the cord  the moment that the boy was secured the attitude of the man changed with an angry oath he wheeled his prisoner about tripped him and hurled him violently to the floor leaping upon his breast as he fell from the bed the ape growled and struggled with his bonds  the boy did not cry outa trait inherited from his savage sire whom long years in the jungle following the death of his foster mother kala the great ape had taught that there was none to come to the succor of the fallen  paulvitchs fingers sought the lads throat  he grinned down horribly into the face of his victim  your father ruined me he mumbled  this will pay him he will think that the ape did it  i will tell him that the ape did it  that i left him alone for a few minutes and that you sneaked in and the ape killed you  i will throw your body upon the bed after i have choked the life from you and when i bring your father he will see the ape squatting over it and the twisted fiend cackled in gloating laughter  his fingers closed upon the boys throat  behind them the growling of the maddened beast reverberated against the walls of the little room  the boy paled but no other sign of fear or panic showed upon his countenance  he was the son of tarzan  the fingers tightened their grip upon his throat  it was with difficulty that he breathed gaspingly  the ape lunged against the stout cord that held him  turning he wrapped the cord about his hands as a man might have done and surged heavily backward  the great muscles stood out beneath his shaggy hide  there was a rending as of splintered woodthe cord held but a portion of the footboard of the bed came away  at the sound paulvitch looked up  his hideous face went white with terrorthe ape was free  with a single bound the creature was upon him  the man shrieked  the brute wrenched him from the body of the boy  great fingers sunk into the mans flesh  yellow fangs gaped close to his throathe struggled futilelyand when they closed the soul of alexis paulvitch passed into the keeping of the demons who had long been awaiting it  the boy struggled to his feet assisted by akut  for two hours under the instructions of the former the ape worked upon the knots that secured his friends wrists  finally they gave up their secret and the boy was free  then he opened one of his bags and drew forth some garments  his plans had been well made  he did not consult the beast which did all that he directed  together they slunk from the house but no casual observer might have noted that one of them was an ape     chapter 4   the killing of the friendless old russian michael sabrov by his great trained ape was a matter for newspaper comment for a few days  lord greystoke read of it and while taking special precautions not to permit his name to become connected with the affair kept himself well posted as to the police search for the anthropoid  as was true of the general public his chief interest in the matter centered about the mysterious disappearance of the slayer  or at least this was true until he learned several days subsequent to the tragedy that his son jack had not reported at the public school en route for which they had seen him safely ensconced in a railway carriage  even then the father did not connect the disappearance of his son with the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the ape  nor was it until a month later that careful investigation revealed the fact that the boy had left the train before it pulled out of the station at london and the cab driver had been found who had driven him to the address of the old russian that tarzan of the apes realized that akut had in some way been connected with the disappearance of the boy  beyond the moment that the cab driver had deposited his fare beside the curb in front of the house in which the russian had been quartered there was no clue  no one had seen either the boy or the ape from that instantat least no one who still lived  the proprietor of the house identified the picture of the lad as that of one who had been a frequent visitor in the room of the old man  aside from this he knew nothing  and there at the door of a grimy old building in the slums of london the searchers came to a blank wallbaffled  the day following the death of alexis paulvitch a youth accompanying his invalid grandmother boarded a steamer at dover  the old lady was heavily veiled and so weakened by age and sickness that she had to be wheeled aboard the vessel in an invalid chair  the boy would permit none but himself to wheel her and with his own hands assisted her from the chair to the interior of their stateroomand that was the last that was seen of the old lady by the ships company until the pair disembarked  the boy even insisted upon doing the work of their cabin steward since as he explained his grandmother was suffering from a nervous disposition that made the presence of strangers extremely distasteful to her  outside the cabinand none there was aboard who knew what he did in the cabinthe lad was just as any other healthy normal english boy might have been  he mingled with his fellow passengers became a prime favorite with the officers and struck up numerous friendships among the common sailors  he was generous and unaffected yet carried an air of dignity and strength of character that inspired his many new friends with admiration as well as affection for him  among the passengers there was an american named condon a noted blackleg and crook who was wanted in a half dozen of the larger cities of the united states  he had paid little attention to the boy until on one occasion he had seen him accidentally display a roll of bank notes  from then on condon cultivated the youthful briton  he learned easily that the boy was traveling alone with his invalid grandmother and that their destination was a small port on the west coast of africa a little below the equator that their name was billings and that they had no friends in the little settlement for which they were bound  upon the point of their purpose in visiting the place condon found the boy reticent and so he did not push the matterhe had learned all that he cared to know as it was  several times condon attempted to draw the lad into a card game but his victim was not interested and the black looks of several of the other men passengers decided the american to find other means of transferring the boys bank roll to his own pocket  at last came the day that the steamer dropped anchor in the lee of a wooded promontory where a score or more of sheetiron shacks making an unsightly blot upon the fair face of nature proclaimed the fact that civilization had set its heel  straggling upon the outskirts were the thatched huts of natives picturesque in their primeval savagery harmonizing with the background of tropical jungle and accentuating the squalid hideousness of the white mans pioneer architecture  the boy leaning over the rail was looking far beyond the manmade town deep into the godmade jungle  a little shiver of anticipation tingled his spine and then quite without volition he found himself gazing into the loving eyes of his mother and the strong face of the father which mirrored beneath its masculine strength a love no less than the mothers eyes proclaimed  he felt himself weakening in his resolve  nearby one of the ships officers was shouting orders to a flotilla of native boats that was approaching to lighter the consignment of the steamers cargo destined for this tiny post  when does the next steamer for england touch here the boy asked  the emanuel ought to be along most any time now replied the officer i figgered wed find her here and he went on with his bellowing remarks to the dusty horde drawing close to the steamers side  the task of lowering the boys grandmother over the side to a waiting canoe was rather difficult  the lad insisted on being always at her side and when at last she was safely ensconced in the bottom of the craft that was to bear them shoreward her grandson dropped catlike after her  so interested was he in seeing her comfortably disposed that he failed to notice the little package that had worked from his pocket as he assisted in lowering the sling that contained the old woman over the steamers side nor did he notice it even as it slipped out entirely and dropped into the sea  scarcely had the boat containing the boy and the old woman started for the shore than condon hailed a canoe upon the other side of the ship and after bargaining with its owner finally lowered his baggage and himself aboard  once ashore he kept out of sight of the twostory atrocity that bore the legend hotel to lure unsuspecting wayfarers to its multitudinous discomforts  it was quite dark before he ventured to enter and arrange for accommodations  in a back room upon the second floor the lad was explaining not without considerable difficulty to his grandmother that he had decided to return to england upon the next steamer  he was endeavoring to make it plain to the old lady that she might remain in africa if she wished but that for his part his conscience demanded that he return to his father and mother who doubtless were even now suffering untold sorrow because of his absence from which it may be assumed that his parents had not been acquainted with the plans that he and the old lady had made for their adventure into african wilds  having come to a decision the lad felt a sense of relief from the worry that had haunted him for many sleepless nights  when he closed his eyes in sleep it was to dream of a happy reunion with those at home and as he dreamed fate cruel and inexorable crept stealthily upon him through the dark corridor of the squalid building in which he sleptfate in the form of the american crook condon  cautiously the man approached the door of the lads room  there he crouched listening until assured by the regular breathing of those within that both slept  quietly he inserted a slim skeleton key in the lock of the door  with deft fingers long accustomed to the silent manipulation of the bars and bolts that guarded other mens property condon turned the key and the knob simultaneously  gentle pressure upon the door swung it slowly inward upon its hinges  the man entered the room closing the door behind him  the moon was temporarily overcast by heavy clouds  the interior of the apartment was shrouded in gloom  condon groped his way toward the bed  in the far corner of the room something movedmoved with a silent stealthiness which transcended even the trained silence of the burglar  condon heard nothing  his attention was riveted upon the bed in which he thought to find a young boy and his helpless invalid grandmother  the american sought only the bank roll  if he could possess himself of this without detection well and good but were he to meet resistance he was prepared for that too  the lads clothes lay across a chair beside the bed  the americans fingers felt swiftly through themthe pockets contained no roll of crisp new notes  doubtless they were beneath the pillows of the bed  he stepped closer toward the sleeper his hand was already half way beneath the pillow when the thick cloud that had obscured the moon rolled aside and the room was flooded with light  at the same instant the boy opened his eyes and looked straight into those of condon  the man was suddenly conscious that the boy was alone in the bed  then he clutched for his victims throat  as the lad rose to meet him condon heard a low growl at his back then he felt his wrists seized by the boy and realized that beneath those tapering white fingers played muscles of steel  he felt other hands at his throat rough hairy hands that reached over his shoulders from behind  he cast a terrified glance backward and the hairs of his head stiffened at the sight his eyes revealed for grasping him from the rear was a huge manlike ape  the bared fighting fangs of the anthropoid were close to his throat  the lad pinioned his wrists  neither uttered a sound  where was the grandmother  condons eyes swept the room in a single allinclusive glance  his eyes bulged in horror at the realization of the truth which that glance revealed  in the power of what creatures of hideous mystery had he placed himself  frantically he fought to beat off the lad that he might turn upon the fearsome thing at his back  freeing one hand he struck a savage blow at the lads face  his act seemed to unloose a thousand devils in the hairy creature clinging to his throat condon heard a low and savage snarl  it was the last thing that the american ever heard in this life  then he was dragged backward upon the floor a heavy body fell upon him powerful teeth fastened themselves in his jugular his head whirled in the sudden blackness which rims eternitya moment later the ape rose from his prostrate form but condon did not knowhe was quite dead  the lad horrified sprang from the bed to lean over the body of the man  he knew that akut had killed in his defense as he had killed michael sabrov but here in savage africa far from home and friends what would they do to him and his faithful ape  the lad knew that the penalty of murder was death  he even knew that an accomplice might suffer the death penalty with the principal  who was there who would plead for them  all would be against them  it was little more than a halfcivilized community and the chances were that they would drag akut and him forth in the morning and hang them both to the nearest treehe had read of such things being done in america and africa was worse even and wilder than the great west of his mothers native land yes they would both be hanged in the morning  was there no escape  he thought in silence for a few moments and then with an exclamation of relief he struck his palms together and turned toward his clothing upon the chair  money would do anything money would save him and akut  he felt for the bank roll in the pocket in which he had been accustomed to carry it  it was not there  slowly at first and at last frantically he searched through the remaining pockets of his clothing  then he dropped upon his hands and knees and examined the floor  lighting the lamp he moved the bed to one side and inch by inch he felt over the entire floor  beside the body of condon he hesitated but at last he nerved himself to touch it rolling it over he sought beneath it for the money  nor was it there he guessed that condon had entered their room to rob but he did not believe that the man had had time to possess himself of the money however as it was nowhere else it must be upon the body of the dead man  again and again he went over the room only to return each time to the corpse but no where could he find the money  he was halffrantic with despair  what were they to do  in the morning they would be discovered and killed  for all his inherited size and strength he was after all only a little boya frightened homesick little boyreasoning faultily from the meager experience of childhood  he could think of but a single glaring factthey had killed a fellow man and they were among savage strangers thirsting for the blood of the first victim whom fate cast into their clutches this much he had gleaned from pennydreadfuls  and they must have money  again he approached the corpse  this time resolutely  the ape squatted in a corner watching his young companion  the youth commenced to remove the americans clothing piece by piece and piece by piece he examined each garment minutely  even to the shoes he searched with painstaking care and when the last article had been removed and scrutinized he dropped back upon the bed with dilated eyes that saw nothing in the presentonly a grim tableau of the future in which two forms swung silently from the limb of a great tree  how long he sat thus he did not know but finally he was aroused by a noise coming from the floor below  springing quickly to his feet he blew out the lamp and crossing the floor silently locked the door then he turned toward the ape his mind made up  last evening he had been determined to start for home at the first opportunity to beg the forgiveness of his parents for this mad adventure  now he knew that he might never return to them  the blood of a fellow man was upon his handsin his morbid reflections he had long since ceased to attribute the death of condon to the ape  the hysteria of panic had fastened the guilt upon himself  with money he might have bought justice but pennilessah what hope could there be for strangers without money here  but what had become of the money  he tried to recall when last he had seen it  he could not nor could he would he have been able to account for its disappearance for he had been entirely unconscious of the falling of the little package from his pocket into the sea as he clambered over the ships side into the waiting canoe that bore him to shore  now he turned toward akut  come he said in the language of the great apes  forgetful of the fact that he wore only a thin pajama suit he led the way to the open window  thrusting his head out he listened attentively  a single tree grew a few feet from the window  nimbly the lad sprang to its bole clinging catlike for an instant before he clambered quietly to the ground below  close behind him came the great ape  two hundred yards away a spur of the jungle ran close to the straggling town  toward this the lad led the way  none saw them and a moment later the jungle swallowed them and john clayton future lord greystoke passed from the eyes and the knowledge of men  it was late the following morning that a native houseman knocked upon the door of the room that had been assigned to mrs billings and her grandson  receiving no response he inserted his pass key in the lock only to discover that another key was already there but from the inside  he reported the fact to herr skopf the proprietor who at once made his way to the second floor where he too pounded vigorously upon the door  receiving no reply he bent to the key hole in an attempt to look through into the room beyond  in so doing being portly he lost his balance which necessitated putting a palm to the floor to maintain his equilibrium  as he did so he felt something soft and thick and wet beneath his fingers  he raised his open palm before his eyes in the dim light of the corridor and peered at it  then he gave a little shudder for even in the semidarkness he saw a dark red stain upon his hand  leaping to his feet he hurled his shoulder against the door  herr skopf is a heavy manor at least he was theni have not seen him for several years  the frail door collapsed beneath his weight and herr skopf stumbled precipitately into the room beyond  before him lay the greatest mystery of his life  upon the floor at his feet was the dead body of a strange man  the neck was broken and the jugular severed as by the fangs of a wild beast  the body was entirely naked the clothing being strewn about the corpse  the old lady and her grandson were gone  the window was open  they must have disappeared through the window for the door had been locked from the inside  but how could the boy have carried his invalid grandmother from a second story window to the ground  it was preposterous  again herr skopf searched the small room  he noticed that the bed was pulled well away from the wallwhy  he looked beneath it again for the third or fourth time  the two were gone and yet his judgment told him that the old lady could not have gone without porters to carry her down as they had carried her up the previous day  further search deepened the mystery  all the clothing of the two was still in the roomif they had gone then they must have gone naked or in their night clothes  herr skopf shook his head then he scratched it  he was baffled  he had never heard of sherlock holmes or he would have lost no time in invoking the aid of that celebrated sleuth for here was a real mystery  an old womanan invalid who had to be carried from the ship to her room in the hoteland a handsome lad her grandson had entered a room on the second floor of his hostelry the day before  they had had their evening meal served in their roomthat was the last that had been seen of them  at nine the following morning the corpse of a strange man had been the sole occupant of that room no boat had left the harbor in the meantimethere was not a railroad within hundreds of milesthere was no other white settlement that the two could reach under several days of arduous marching accompanied by a wellequipped safari  they had simply vanished into thin air for the native he had sent to inspect the ground beneath the open window had just returned to report that there was no sign of a footstep there and what sort of creatures were they who could have dropped that distance to the soft turf without leaving spoor  herr skopf shuddered  yes it was a great mysterythere was something uncanny about the whole thinghe hated to think about it and he dreaded the coming of night  it was a great mystery to herr skopfand doubtless still is     chapter 5   captain armand jacot of the foreign legion sat upon an outspread saddle blanket at the foot of a stunted palm tree  his broad shoulders and his closecropped head rested in luxurious ease against the rough bole of the palm  his long legs were stretched straight before him overlapping the meager blanket his spurs buried in the sandy soil of the little desert oasis  the captain was taking his ease after a long day of weary riding across the shifting sands of the desert  lazily he puffed upon his cigarette and watched his orderly who was preparing his evening meal  captain armand jacot was well satisfied with himself and the world  a little to his right rose the noisy activity of his troop of suntanned veterans released for the time from the irksome trammels of discipline relaxing tired muscles laughing joking and smoking as they too prepared to eat after a twelvehour fast  among them silent and taciturn squatted five whiterobed arabs securely bound and under heavy guard  it was the sight of these that filled captain armand jacot with the pleasurable satisfaction of a duty wellperformed  for a long hot gaunt month he and his little troop had scoured the places of the desert waste in search of a band of marauders to the sinstained account of which were charged innumerable thefts of camels horses and goats as well as murders enough to have sent the whole unsavory gang to the guillotine several times over  a week before he had come upon them  in the ensuing battle he had lost two of his own men but the punishment inflicted upon the marauders had been severe almost to extinction  a half dozen perhaps had escaped but the balance with the exception of the five prisoners had expiated their crimes before the nickel jacketed bullets of the legionaries  and best of all the ring leader achmet ben houdin was among the prisoners  from the prisoners captain jacot permitted his mind to traverse the remaining miles of sand to the little garrison post where upon the morrow he should find awaiting him with eager welcome his wife and little daughter  his eyes softened to the memory of them as they always did  even now he could see the beauty of the mother reflected in the childish lines of little jeannes face and both those faces would be smiling up into his as he swung from his tired mount late the following afternoon  already he could feel a soft cheek pressed close to each of hisvelvet against leather  his reverie was broken in upon by the voice of a sentry summoning a noncommissioned officer  captain jacot raised his eyes  the sun had not yet set but the shadows of the few trees huddled about the water hole and of his men and their horses stretched far away into the east across the now golden sand  the sentry was pointing in this direction and the corporal through narrowed lids was searching the distance captain jacot rose to his feet  he was not a man content to see through the eyes of others  he must see for himself  usually he saw things long before others were aware that there was anything to seea trait that had won for him the sobriquet of hawk  now he saw just beyond the long shadows a dozen specks rising and falling among the sands  they disappeared and reappeared but always they grew larger jacot recognized them immediately  they were horsemenhorsemen of the desert  already a sergeant was running toward him  the entire camp was straining its eyes into the distance  jacot gave a few terse orders to the sergeant who saluted turned upon his heel and returned to the men  here he gathered a dozen who saddled their horses mounted and rode out to meet the strangers  the remaining men disposed themselves in readiness for instant action  it was not entirely beyond the range of possibilities that the horsemen riding thus swiftly toward the camp might be friends of the prisoners bent upon the release of their kinsmen by a sudden attack  jacot doubted this however since the strangers were evidently making no attempt to conceal their presence  they were galloping rapidly toward the camp in plain view of all  there might be treachery lurking beneath their fair appearance but none who knew the hawk would be so gullible as to hope to trap him thus  the sergeant with his detail met the arabs two hundred yards from the camp  jacot could see him in conversation with a tall whiterobed figureevidently the leader of the band  presently the sergeant and this arab rode side by side toward camp  jacot awaited them  the two reined in and dismounted before him  sheik amor ben khatour announced the sergeant by way of introduction  captain jacot eyed the newcomer  he was acquainted with nearly every principal arab within a radius of several hundred miles  this man he never had seen  he was a tall weather beaten sour looking man of sixty or more  his eyes were narrow and evil  captain jacot did not relish his appearance  well he asked tentatively  the arab came directly to the point  achmet ben houdin is my sisters son he said  if you will give him into my keeping i will see that he sins no more against the laws of the french  jacot shook his head  that cannot be he replied  i must take him back with me  he will be properly and fairly tried by a civil court if he is innocent he will be released  and if he is not innocent asked the arab  he is charged with many murders  for any one of these if he is proved guilty he will have to die  the arabs left hand was hidden beneath his burnous  now he withdrew it disclosing a large goatskin purse bulging and heavy with coins  he opened the mouth of the purse and let a handful of the contents trickle into the palm of his right handall were pieces of good french gold from the size of the purse and its bulging proportions captain jacot concluded that it must contain a small fortune  sheik amor ben khatour dropped the spilled gold pieces one by one back into the purse  jacot was eyeing him narrowly  they were alone  the sergeant having introduced the visitor had withdrawn to some little distancehis back was toward them  now the sheik having returned all the gold pieces held the bulging purse outward upon his open palm toward captain jacot  achmet ben houdin my sisters son might escape tonight he said eh  captain armand jacot flushed to the roots of his closecropped hair then he went very white and took a halfstep toward the arab  his fists were clenched  suddenly he thought better of whatever impulse was moving him  sergeant he called  the noncommissioned officer hurried toward him saluting as his heels clicked together before his superior  take this black dog back to his people he ordered  see that they leave at once  shoot the first man who comes within range of camp tonight  sheik amor ben khatour drew himself up to his full height  his evil eyes narrowed  he raised the bag of gold level with the eyes of the french officer  you will pay more than this for the life of achmet ben houdin my sisters son he said  and as much again for the name that you have called me and a hundred fold in sorrow in the bargain  get out of here growled captain armand jacot before i kick you out  all of this happened some three years before the opening of this tale the trail of achmet ben houdin and his accomplices is a matter of recordyou may verify it if you care to  he met the death he deserved and he met it with the stoicism of the arab  a month later little jeanne jacot the sevenyearold daughter of captain armand jacot mysteriously disappeared  neither the wealth of her father and mother or all the powerful resources of the great republic were able to wrest the secret of her whereabouts from the inscrutable desert that had swallowed her and her abductor  a reward of such enormous proportions was offered that many adventurers were attracted to the hunt  this was no case for the modern detective of civilization yet several of these threw themselves into the searchthe bones of some are already bleaching beneath the african sun upon the silent sands of the sahara  two swedes carl jenssen and sven malbihn after three years of following false leads at last gave up the search far to the south of the sahara to turn their attention to the more profitable business of ivory poaching  in a great district they were already known for their relentless cruelty and their greed for ivory  the natives feared and hated them  the european governments in whose possessions they worked had long sought them but working their way slowly out of the north they had learned many things in the nomansland south of the sahara which gave them immunity from capture through easy avenues of escape that were unknown to those who pursued them  their raids were sudden and swift  they seized ivory and retreated into the trackless wastes of the north before the guardians of the territory they raped could be made aware of their presence  relentlessly they slaughtered elephants themselves as well as stealing ivory from the natives  their following consisted of a hundred or more renegade arabs and negro slavesa fierce relentless band of cutthroats  remember themcarl jenssen and sven malbihn yellowbearded swedish giantsfor you will meet them later   in the heart of the jungle hidden away upon the banks of a small unexplored tributary of a large river that empties into the atlantic not so far from the equator lay a small heavily palisaded village twenty palmthatched beehive huts sheltered its black population while a halfdozen goat skin tents in the center of the clearing housed the score of arabs who found shelter here while by trading and raiding they collected the cargoes which their ships of the desert bore northward twice each year to the market of timbuktu  playing before one of the arab tents was a little girl of tena blackhaired blackeyed little girl who with her nutbrown skin and graceful carriage looked every inch a daughter of the desert  her little fingers were busily engaged in fashioning a skirt of grasses for a muchdisheveled doll which a kindly disposed slave had made for her a year or two before  the head of the doll was rudely chipped from ivory while the body was a rat skin stuffed with grass  the arms and legs were bits of wood perforated at one end and sewn to the rat skin torso  the doll was quite hideous and altogether disreputable and soiled but meriem thought it the most beautiful and adorable thing in the whole world which is not so strange in view of the fact that it was the only object within that world upon which she might bestow her confidence and her love  everyone else with whom meriem came in contact was almost without exception either indifferent to her or cruel  there was for example the old black hag who looked after her mabunutoothless filthy and ill tempered  she lost no opportunity to cuff the little girl or even inflict minor tortures upon her such as pinching or as she had twice done searing the tender flesh with hot coals  and there was the sheik her father  she feared him more than she did mabunu  he often scolded her for nothing quite habitually terminating his tirades by cruelly beating her until her little body was black and blue  but when she was alone she was happy playing with geeka or decking her hair with wild flowers or making ropes of grasses  she was always busy and always singingwhen they left her alone  no amount of cruelty appeared sufficient to crush the innate happiness and sweetness from her full little heart  only when the sheik was near was she quiet and subdued  him she feared with a fear that was at times almost hysterical terror she feared the gloomy jungle toothe cruel jungle that surrounded the little village with chattering monkeys and screaming birds by day and the roaring and coughing and moaning of the carnivora by night  yes she feared the jungle but so much more did she fear the sheik that many times it was in her childish head to run away out into the terrible jungle forever rather than longer to face the ever present terror of her father  as she sat there this day before the sheiks goatskin tent fashioning a skirt of grasses for geeka the sheik appeared suddenly approaching instantly the look of happiness faded from the childs face  she shrunk aside in an attempt to scramble from the path of the leathernfaced old arab but she was not quick enough  with a brutal kick the man sent her sprawling upon her face where she lay quite still tearless but trembling  then with an oath at her the man passed into the tent  the old black hag shook with appreciative laughter disclosing an occasional and lonesome yellow fang  when she was sure the sheik had gone the little girl crawled to the shady side of the tent where she lay quite still hugging geeka close to her breast her little form racked at long intervals with choking sobs  she dared not cry aloud since that would have brought the sheik upon her again  the anguish in her little heart was not alone the anguish of physical pain but that infinitely more pathetic anguishof love denied a childish heart that yearns for love  little meriem could scarce recall any other existence than that of the stern cruelty of the sheik and mabunu  dimly in the back of her childish memory there lurked a blurred recollection of a gentle mother but meriem was not sure but that even this was but a dream picture induced by her own desire for the caresses she never received but which she lavished upon the much loved geeka  never was such a spoiled child as geeka  its little mother far from fashioning her own conduct after the example set her by her father and nurse went to the extreme of indulgence  geeka was kissed a thousand times a day  there was play in which geeka was naughty but the little mother never punished instead she caressed and fondled her attitude influenced solely by her own pathetic desire for love  now as she pressed geeka close to her her sobs lessened gradually until she was able to control her voice and pour out her misery into the ivory ear of her only confidante  geeka loves meriem she whispered  why does the sheik my father not love me too  am i so naughty  i try to be good but i never know why he strikes me so i cannot tell what i have done which displeases him  just now he kicked me and hurt me so geeka but i was only sitting before the tent making a skirt for you  that must be wicked or he would not have kicked me for it  but why is it wicked geeka oh dear  i do not know i do not know  i wish geeka that i were dead  yesterday the hunters brought in the body of el adrea  el adrea was quite dead  no more will he slink silently upon his unsuspecting prey  no more will his great head and his maned shoulders strike terror to the hearts of the grass eaters at the drinking ford by night no more will his thundering roar shake the ground  el adrea is dead they beat his body terribly when it was brought into the village but el adrea did not mind  he did not feel the blows for he was dead when i am dead geeka neither shall i feel the blows of mabunu or the kicks of the sheik my father  then shall i be happy  oh geeka how i wish that i were dead  if geeka contemplated a remonstrance it was cut short by sounds of altercation beyond the village gates  meriem listened  with the curiosity of childhood she would have liked to have run down there and learn what it was that caused the men to talk so loudly  others of the village were already trooping in the direction of the noise  but meriem did not dare  the sheik would be there doubtless and if he saw her it would be but another opportunity to abuse her so meriem lay still and listened  presently she heard the crowd moving up the street toward the sheiks tent  cautiously she stuck her little head around the edge of the tent  she could not resist the temptation for the sameness of the village life was monotonous and she craved diversion  what she saw was two strangerswhite men  they were alone but as they approached she learned from the talk of the natives that surrounded them that they possessed a considerable following that was camped outside the village they were coming to palaver with the sheik  the old arab met them at the entrance to his tent  his eyes narrowed wickedly when they had appraised the newcomers  they stopped before him exchanging greetings  they had come to trade for ivory they said the sheik grunted  he had no ivory  meriem gasped  she knew that in a nearby hut the great tusks were piled almost to the roof  she poked her little head further forward to get a better view of the strangers how white their skins  how yellow their great beards  suddenly one of them turned his eyes in her direction  she tried to dodge back out of sight for she feared all men but he saw her meriem noticed the look of almost shocked surprise that crossed his face  the sheik saw it too and guessed the cause of it  i have no ivory he repeated  i do not wish to trade  go away  go now  he stepped from his tent and almost pushed the strangers about in the direction of the gates  they demurred and then the sheik threatened it would have been suicide to have disobeyed so the two men turned and left the village making their way immediately to their own camp  the sheik returned to his tent but he did not enter it  instead he walked to the side where little meriem lay close to the goat skin wall very frightened  the sheik stooped and clutched her by the arm viciously he jerked her to her feet dragged her to the entrance of the tent and shoved her viciously within  following her he again seized her beating her ruthlessly  stay within he growled  never let the strangers see thy face next time you show yourself to strangers i shall kill you  with a final vicious cuff he knocked the child into a far corner of the tent where she lay stifling her moans while the sheik paced to and fro muttering to himself  at the entrance sat mabunu muttering and chuckling  in the camp of the strangers one was speaking rapidly to the other  there is no doubt of it malbihn he was saying  not the slightest but why the old scoundrel hasnt claimed the reward long since is what puzzles me  there are some things dearer to an arab jenssen than money returned the first speakerrevenge is one of them  anyhow it will not harm to try the power of gold replied jenssen  malbihn shrugged  not on the sheik he said  we might try it on one of his people but the sheik will not part with his revenge for gold  to offer it to him would only confirm his suspicions that we must have awakened when we were talking to him before his tent  if we got away with our lives then we should be fortunate  well try bribery then assented jenssen  but bribery failedgrewsomely  the tool they selected after a stay of several days in their camp outside the village was a tall old headman of the sheiks native contingent  he fell to the lure of the shining metal for he had lived upon the coast and knew the power of gold  he promised to bring them what they craved late that night  immediately after dark the two white men commenced to make arrangements to break camp  by midnight all was prepared  the porters lay beside their loads ready to swing them aloft at a moments notice  the armed askaris loitered between the balance of the safari and the arab village ready to form a rear guard for the retreat that was to begin the moment that the head man brought that which the white masters awaited  presently there came the sound of footsteps along the path from the village  instantly the askaris and the whites were on the alert  more than a single man was approaching  jenssen stepped forward and challenged the newcomers in a low whisper  who comes he queried  mbeeda came the reply  mbeeda was the name of the traitorous head man  jenssen was satisfied though he wondered why mbeeda had brought others with him  presently he understood  the thing they fetched lay upon a litter borne by two men  jenssen cursed beneath his breath  could the fool be bringing them a corpse  they had paid for a living prize  the bearers came to a halt before the white men  this has your gold purchased said one of the two  they set the litter down turned and vanished into the darkness toward the village malbihn looked at jenssen a crooked smile twisting his lips  the thing upon the litter was covered with a piece of cloth  well queried the latter  raise the covering and see what you have bought  much money shall we realize on a corpseespecially after the six months beneath the burning sun that will be consumed in carrying it to its destination  the fool should have known that we desired her alive grumbled malbihn grasping a corner of the cloth and jerking the cover from the thing that lay upon the litter  at sight of what lay beneath both men stepped backinvoluntary oaths upon their lipsfor there before them lay the dead body of mbeeda the faithless head man  five minutes later the safari of jenssen and malbihn was forcing its way rapidly toward the west nervous askaris guarding the rear from the attack they momentarily expected     chapter 6   his first night in the jungle was one which the son of tarzan held longest in his memory  no savage carnivora menaced him  there was never a sign of hideous barbarian  or if there were the boys troubled mind took no cognizance of them  his conscience was harassed by the thought of his mothers suffering  selfblame plunged him into the depths of misery  the killing of the american caused him little or no remorse  the fellow had earned his fate  jacks regret on this score was due mainly to the effect which the death of condon had had upon his own plans  now he could not return directly to his parents as he had planned  fear of the primitive borderland law of which he had read highly colored imaginary tales had thrust him into the jungle a fugitive  he dared not return to the coast at this pointnot that he was so greatly influenced through personal fear as from a desire to shield his father and mother from further sorrow and from the shame of having their honored name dragged through the sordid degradation of a murder trial  with returning day the boys spirits rose  with the rising sun rose new hope within his breast  he would return to civilization by another way  none would guess that he had been connected with the killing of the stranger in the little outoftheway trading post upon a remote shore  crouched close to the great ape in the crotch of a tree the boy had shivered through an almost sleepless night  his light pajamas had been but little protection from the chill dampness of the jungle and only that side of him which was pressed against the warm body of his shaggy companion approximated to comfort  and so he welcomed the rising sun with its promise of warmth as well as lightthe blessed sun dispeller of physical and mental ills  he shook akut into wakefulness  come he said  i am cold and hungry  we will search for food out there in the sunlight and he pointed to an open plain dotted with stunted trees and strewn with jagged rock  the boy slid to the ground as he spoke but the ape first looked carefully about sniffing the morning air  then satisfied that no danger lurked near he descended slowly to the ground beside the boy  numa and sabor his mate feast upon those who descend first and look afterward while those who look first and descend afterward live to feast themselves  thus the old ape imparted to the son of tarzan the boys first lesson in jungle lore  side by side they set off across the rough plain for the boy wished first to be warm  the ape showed him the best places to dig for rodents and worms but the lad only gagged at the thought of devouring the repulsive things  some eggs they found and these he sucked raw as also he ate roots and tubers which akut unearthed  beyond the plain and across a low bluff they came upon waterbrackish illsmelling stuff in a shallow water hole the sides and bottom of which were trampled by the feet of many beasts a herd of zebra galloped away as they approached  the lad was too thirsty by now to cavil at anything even remotely resembling water so he drank his fill while akut stood with raised head alert for any danger  before the ape drank he cautioned the boy to be watchful but as he drank he raised his head from time to time to cast a quick glance toward a clump of bushes a hundred yards away upon the opposite side of the water hole  when he had done he rose and spoke to the boy in the language that was their common heritagethe tongue of the great apes  there is no danger near he asked  none replied the boy  i saw nothing move while you drank  your eyes will help you but little in the jungle said the ape  here if you would live you must depend upon your ears and your nose but most upon your nose  when we came down to drink i knew that no danger lurked near upon this side of the water hole for else the zebras would have discovered it and fled before we came but upon the other side toward which the wind blows danger might lie concealed  we could not smell it for its scent is being blown in the other direction and so i bent my ears and eyes down wind where my nose cannot travel  and you foundnothing asked the lad with a laugh  i found numa crouching in that clump of bushes where the tall grasses grow and akut pointed  a lion exclaimed the boy  how do you know  i can see nothing  numa is there though replied the great ape  first i heard him sigh  to you the sigh of numa may sound no different from the other noises which the wind makes among the grasses and the trees but later you must learn to know the sigh of numa  then i watched and at last i saw the tall grasses moving at one point to a force other than the force of the wind  see they are spread there upon either side of numas great body and as he breathesyou see  you see the little motion at either side that is not caused by the windthe motion that none of the other grasses have  the boy strained his eyesbetter eyes than the ordinary boy inheritsand at last he gave a little exclamation of discovery  yes he said i see  he lies there and he pointed  his head is toward us  is he watching us  numa is watching us replied akut but we are in little danger unless we approach too close for he is lying upon his kill  his belly is almost full or we should hear him crunching the bones  he is watching us in silence merely from curiosity  presently he will resume his feeding or he will rise and come down to the water for a drink  as he neither fears or desires us he will not try to hide his presence from us but now is an excellent time to learn to know numa for you must learn to know him well if you would live long in the jungle where the great apes are many numa leaves us alone  our fangs are long and strong and we can fight but when we are alone and he is hungry we are no match for him  come we will circle him and catch his scent the sooner you learn to know it the better but keep close to the trees as we go around him for numa often does that which he is least expected to do  and keep your ears and your eyes and your nose open remember always that there may be an enemy behind every bush in every tree and amongst every clump of jungle grass  while you are avoiding numa do not run into the jaws of sabor his mate  follow me and akut set off in a wide circle about the water hole and the crouching lion  the boy followed close upon his heels his every sense upon the alert his nerves keyed to the highest pitch of excitement  this was life for the instant he forgot his resolutions of a few minutes past to hasten to the coast at some other point than that at which he had landed and make his way immediately back to london  he thought now only of the savage joy of living and of pitting ones wits and prowess against the wiles and might of the savage jungle brood which haunted the broad plains and the gloomy forest aisles of the great untamed continent  he knew no fear  his father had had none to transmit to him but honor and conscience he did have and these were to trouble him many times as they battled with his inherent love of freedom for possession of his soul  they had passed but a short distance to the rear of numa when the boy caught the unpleasant odor of the carnivore  his face lighted with a smile  something told him that he would have known that scent among a myriad of others even if akut had not told him that a lion lay near there was a strange familiaritya weird familiarity in it that made the short hairs rise at the nape of his neck and brought his upper lip into an involuntary snarl that bared his fighting fangs  there was a sense of stretching of the skin about his ears for all the world as though those members were flattening back against his skull in preparation for deadly combat  his skin tingled  he was aglow with a pleasurable sensation that he never before had known  he was upon the instant another creaturewary alert ready  thus did the scent of numa the lion transform the boy into a beast  he had never seen a lionhis mother had gone to great pains to prevent it  but he had devoured countless pictures of them and now he was ravenous to feast his eyes upon the king of beasts in the flesh  as he trailed akut he kept an eye cocked over one shoulder rearward in the hope that numa might rise from his kill and reveal himself  thus it happened that he dropped some little way behind akut and the next he knew he was recalled suddenly to a contemplation of other matters than the hidden numa by a shrill scream of warning from the ape  turning his eyes quickly in the direction of his companion the boy saw that standing in the path directly before him which sent tremors of excitement racing along every nerve of his body  with body halfmerging from a clump of bushes in which she must have lain hidden stood a sleek and beautiful lioness  her yellowgreen eyes were round and staring boring straight into the eyes of the boy  not ten paces separated them  twenty paces behind the lioness stood the great ape bellowing instructions to the boy and hurling taunts at the lioness in an evident effort to attract her attention from the lad while he gained the shelter of a nearby tree  but sabor was not to be diverted  she had her eyes upon the lad  he stood between her and her mate between her and the kill  it was suspicious  probably he had ulterior designs upon her lord and master or upon the fruits of their hunting  a lioness is short tempered akuts bellowing annoyed her  she uttered a little rumbling growl taking a step toward the boy  the tree screamed akut  the boy turned and fled and at the same instant the lioness charged the tree was but a few paces away  a limb hung ten feet from the ground and as the boy leaped for it the lioness leaped for him  like a monkey he pulled himself up and to one side  a great forepaw caught him a glancing blow at the hipsjust grazing him  one curved talon hooked itself into the waist band of his pajama trousers ripping them from him as the lioness sped by  halfnaked the lad drew himself to safety as the beast turned and leaped for him once more  akut from a nearby tree jabbered and scolded calling the lioness all manner of foul names  the boy patterning his conduct after that of his preceptor unstoppered the vials of his invective upon the head of the enemy until in realization of the futility of words as weapons he bethought himself of something heavier to hurl  there was nothing but dead twigs and branches at hand but these he flung at the upturned snarling face of sabor just as his father had before him twenty years ago when as a boy he too had taunted and tantalized the great cats of the jungle  the lioness fretted about the bole of the tree for a short time but finally either realizing the uselessness of her vigil or prompted by the pangs of hunger she stalked majestically away and disappeared in the brush that hid her lord who had not once shown himself during the altercation  freed from their retreats akut and the boy came to the ground to take up their interrupted journey once more  the old ape scolded the lad for his carelessness  had you not been so intent upon the lion behind you you might have discovered the lioness much sooner than you did  but you passed right by her without seeing her retorted the boy  akut was chagrined  it is thus he said that jungle folk die  we go cautiously for a lifetime and then just for an instant we forget and he ground his teeth in mimicry of the crunching of great jaws in flesh  it is a lesson he resumed  you have learned that you may not for too long keep your eyes and your ears and your nose all bent in the same direction  that night the son of tarzan was colder than he ever had been in all his life  the pajama trousers had not been heavy but they had been much heavier than nothing  and the next day he roasted in the hot sun for again their way led much across wide and treeless plains  it was still in the boys mind to travel to the south and circle back to the coast in search of another outpost of civilization  he had said nothing of this plan to akut for he knew that the old ape would look with displeasure upon any suggestion that savored of separation  for a month the two wandered on the boy learning rapidly the laws of the jungle his muscles adapting themselves to the new mode of life that had been thrust upon them  the thews of the sire had been transmitted to the sonit needed only the hardening of use to develop them  the lad found that it came quite naturally to him to swing through the trees  even at great heights he never felt the slightest dizziness and when he had caught the knack of the swing and the release he could hurl himself through space from branch to branch with even greater agility than the heavier akut  and with exposure came a toughening and hardening of his smooth white skin browning now beneath the sun and wind  he had removed his pajama jacket one day to bathe in a little stream that was too small to harbor crocodiles and while he and akut had been disporting themselves in the cool waters a monkey had dropped down from the over hanging trees snatched up the boys single remaining article of civilized garmenture and scampered away with it  for a time jack was angry but when he had been without the jacket for a short while he began to realize that being halfclothed is infinitely more uncomfortable than being entirely naked  soon he did not miss his clothing in the least and from that he came to revel in the freedom of his unhampered state  occasionally a smile would cross his face as he tried to imagine the surprise of his schoolmates could they but see him now  they would envy him  yes how they would envy him  he felt sorry for them at such times and again as he thought of them amid luxuries and comforts of their english homes happy with their fathers and mothers a most uncomfortable lump would arise into the boys throat and he would see a vision of his mothers face through a blur of mist that came unbidden to his eyes  then it was that he urged akut onward for now they were headed westward toward the coast  the old ape thought that they were searching for a tribe of his own kind nor did the boy disabuse his mind of this belief  it would do to tell akut of his real plans when they had come within sight of civilization  one day as they were moving slowly along beside a river they came unexpectedly upon a native village  some children were playing beside the water  the boys heart leaped within his breast at sight of themfor over a month he had seen no human being  what if these were naked savages  what if their skins were black  were they not creatures fashioned in the mold of their maker as was he  they were his brothers and sisters  he started toward them  with a low warning akut laid a hand upon his arm to hold him back  the boy shook himself free and with a shout of greeting ran forward toward the ebon players  the sound of his voice brought every head erect  wide eyes viewed him for an instant and then with screams of terror the children turned and fled toward the village  at their heels ran their mothers and from the village gate in response to the alarm came a score of warriors hastily snatched spears and shields ready in their hands  at sight of the consternation he had wrought the boy halted  the glad smile faded from his face as with wild shouts and menacing gestures the warriors ran toward him  akut was calling to him from behind to turn and flee telling him that the blacks would kill him  for a moment he stood watching them coming then he raised his hand with the palm toward them in signal for them to halt calling out at the same time that he came as a friendthat he had only wanted to play with their children  of course they did not understand a word that he addressed to them and their answer was what any naked creature who had run suddenly out of the jungle upon their women and children might have expecteda shower of spears  the missiles struck all about the boy but none touched him  again his spine tingled and the short hairs lifted at the nape of his neck and along the top of his scalp  his eyes narrowed  sudden hatred flared in them to wither the expression of glad friendliness that had lighted them but an instant before  with a low snarl quite similar to that of a baffled beast he turned and ran into the jungle  there was akut awaiting him in a tree  the ape urged him to hasten in flight for the wise old anthropoid knew that they two naked and unarmed were no match for the sinewy black warriors who would doubtless make some sort of search for them through the jungle  but a new power moved the son of tarzan  he had come with a boys glad and open heart to offer his friendship to these people who were human beings like himself  he had been met with suspicion and spears  they had not even listened to him  rage and hatred consumed him  when akut urged speed he held back  he wanted to fight yet his reason made it all too plain that it would be but a foolish sacrifice of his life to meet these armed men with his naked hands and his teethalready the boy thought of his teeth of his fighting fangs when possibility of combat loomed close  moving slowly through the trees he kept his eyes over his shoulder though he no longer neglected the possibilities of other dangers which might lurk on either hand or aheadhis experience with the lioness did not need a repetition to insure the permanency of the lesson it had taught  behind he could hear the savages advancing with shouts and cries  he lagged further behind until the pursuers were in sight they did not see him for they were not looking among the branches of the trees for human quarry  the lad kept just ahead of them  for a mile perhaps they continued the search and then they turned back toward the village  here was the boys opportunity that for which he had been waiting while the hot blood of revenge coursed through his veins until he saw his pursuers through a scarlet haze  when they turned back he turned and followed them  akut was no longer in sight  thinking that the boy followed he had gone on further ahead he had no wish to tempt fate within range of those deadly spears slinking silently from tree to tree the boy dogged the footsteps of the returning warriors  at last one dropped behind his fellows as they followed a narrow path toward the village  a grim smile lit the lads face  swiftly he hurried forward until he moved almost above the unconscious blackstalking him as sheeta the panther stalked his prey as the boy had seen sheeta do on many occasions  suddenly and silently he leaped forward and downward upon the broad shoulders of his prey  in the instant of contact his fingers sought and found the mans throat  the weight of the boys body hurled the black heavily to the ground the knees in his back knocking the breath from him as he struck  then a set of strong white teeth fastened themselves in his neck and muscular fingers closed tighter upon his windpipe  for a time the warrior struggled frantically throwing himself about in an effort to dislodge his antagonist but all the while he was weakening and all the while the grim and silent thing he could not see clung tenaciously to him and dragged him slowly into the bush to one side of the trail  hidden there at last safe from the prying eyes of searchers should they miss their fellow and return for him the lad choked the life from the body of his victim  at last he knew by the sudden struggle followed by limp relaxation that the warrior was dead  then a strange desire seized him  his whole being quivered and thrilled involuntarily he leaped to his feet and placed one foot upon the body of his kill  his chest expanded  he raised his face toward the heavens and opened his mouth to voice a strange weird cry that seemed screaming within him for outward expression but no sound passed his lipshe just stood there for a full minute his face turned toward the sky his breast heaving to the pent emotion like an animate statue of vengeance  the silence which marked the first great kill of the son of tarzan was to typify all his future kills just as the hideous victory cry of the bull ape had marked the kills of his mighty sire     chapter 7   akut discovering that the boy was not close behind him turned back to search for him  he had gone but a short distance in return when he was brought to a sudden and startled halt by sight of a strange figure moving through the trees toward him  it was the boy yet could it be in his hand was a long spear down his back hung an oblong shield such as the black warriors who had attacked them had worn and upon ankle and arm were bands of iron and brass while a loin cloth was twisted about the youths middle  a knife was thrust through its folds  when the boy saw the ape he hastened forward to exhibit his trophies proudly he called attention to each of his newly won possessions boastfully he recounted the details of his exploit  with my bare hands and my teeth i killed him he said  i would have made friends with them but they chose to be my enemies  and now that i have a spear i shall show numa too what it means to have me for a foe  only the white men and the great apes akut are our friends them we shall seek all others must we avoid or kill  this have i learned of the jungle  they made a detour about the hostile village and resumed their journey toward the coast  the boy took much pride in his new weapons and ornaments  he practiced continually with the spear throwing it at some object ahead hour by hour as they traveled their loitering way until he gained a proficiency such as only youthful muscles may attain to speedily  all the while his training went on under the guidance of akut  no longer was there a single jungle spoor but was an open book to the keen eyes of the lad and those other indefinite spoor that elude the senses of civilized man and are only partially appreciable to his savage cousin came to be familiar friends of the eager boy  he could differentiate the innumerable species of the herbivora by scent and he could tell too whether an animal was approaching or departing merely by the waxing or waning strength of its effluvium  nor did he need the evidence of his eyes to tell him whether there were two lions or four up winda hundred yards away or half a mile  much of this had akut taught him but far more was instinctive knowledgea species of strange intuition inherited from his father he had come to love the jungle life  the constant battle of wits and senses against the many deadly foes that lurked by day and by night along the pathway of the wary and the unwary appealed to the spirit of adventure which breathes strong in the heart of every redblooded son of primordial adam  yet though he loved it he had not let his selfish desires outweigh the sense of duty that had brought him to a realization of the moral wrong which lay beneath the adventurous escapade that had brought him to africa  his love of father and mother was strong within him too strong to permit unalloyed happiness which was undoubtedly causing them days of sorrow  and so he held tight to his determination to find a port upon the coast where he might communicate with them and receive funds for his return to london there he felt sure that he could now persuade his parents to let him spend at least a portion of his time upon those african estates which from little careless remarks dropped at home he knew his father possessed  that would be something better at least than a lifetime of the cramped and cloying restrictions of civilization  and so he was rather contented than otherwise as he made his way in the direction of the coast for while he enjoyed the liberty and the savage pleasures of the wild his conscience was at the same time clear for he knew that he was doing all that lay in his power to return to his parents  he rather looked forward too to meeting white men againcreatures of his own kindfor there had been many occasions upon which he had longed for other companionship than that of the old ape  the affair with the blacks still rankled in his heart  he had approached them in such innocent good fellowship and with such childlike assurance of a hospitable welcome that the reception which had been accorded him had proved a shock to his boyish ideals  he no longer looked upon the black man as his brother but rather as only another of the innumerable foes of the bloodthirsty junglea beast of prey which walked upon two feet instead of four  but if the blacks were his enemies there were those in the world who were not  there were those who always would welcome him with open arms who would accept him as a friend and brother and with whom he might find sanctuary from every enemy  yes there were always white men  somewhere along the coast or even in the depths of the jungle itself there were white men  to them he would be a welcome visitor they would befriend him  and there were also the great apesthe friends of his father and of akut  how glad they would be to receive the son of tarzan of the apes  he hoped that he could come upon them before he found a trading post upon the coast  he wanted to be able to tell his father that he had known his old friends of the jungle that he had hunted with them that he had joined with them in their savage life and their fierce primeval ceremoniesthe strange ceremonies of which akut had tried to tell him  it cheered him immensely to dwell upon these happy meetings  often he rehearsed the long speech which he would make to the apes in which he would tell them of the life of their former king since he had left them  at other times he would play at meeting with white men  then he would enjoy their consternation at sight of a naked white boy trapped in the war togs of a black warrior and roaming the jungle with only a great ape as his companion  and so the days passed and with the traveling and the hunting and the climbing the boys muscles developed and his agility increased until even phlegmatic akut marvelled at the prowess of his pupil  and the boy realizing his great strength and revelling in it became careless he strode through the jungle his proud head erect defying danger where akut took to the trees at the first scent of numa the lad laughed in the face of the king of beasts and walked boldly past him good fortune was with him for a long time  the lions he met were wellfed perhaps or the very boldness of the strange creature which invaded their domain so filled them with surprise that thoughts of attack were banished from their minds as they stood roundeyed watching his approach and his departure  whatever the cause however the fact remains that on many occasions the boy passed within a few paces of some great lion without arousing more than a warning growl  but no two lions are necessarily alike in character or temper  they differ as greatly as do individuals of the human family  because ten lions act similarly under similar conditions one cannot say that the eleventh lion will do likewisethe chances are that he will not  the lion is a creature of high nervous development  he thinks therefore he reasons  having a nervous system and brains he is the possessor of temperament which is affected variously by extraneous causes  one day the boy met the eleventh lion  the former was walking across a small plain upon which grew little clumps of bushes  akut was a few yards to the left of the lad who was the first to discover the presence of numa  run akut called the boy laughing  numa lies hid in the bushes to my right  take to the trees  akut  i the son of tarzan will protect you and the boy laughing kept straight along his way which led close beside the brush in which numa lay concealed  the ape shouted to him to come away but the lad only flourished his spear and executed an improvised war dance to show his contempt for the king of beasts  closer and closer to the dread destroyer he came until with a sudden angry growl the lion rose from his bed not ten paces from the youth  a huge fellow he was this lord of the jungle and the desert  a shaggy mane clothed his shoulders  cruel fangs armed his great jaws  his yellowgreen eyes blazed with hatred and challenge  the boy with his pitifully inadequate spear ready in his hand realized quickly that this lion was different from the others he had met but he had gone too far now to retreat  the nearest tree lay several yards to his leftthe lion could be upon him before he had covered half the distance and that the beast intended to charge none could doubt who looked upon him now  beyond the lion was a thorn treeonly a few feet beyond him  it was the nearest sanctuary but numa stood between it and his prey  the feel of the long spear shaft in his hand and the sight of the tree beyond the lion gave the lad an ideaa preposterous ideaa ridiculous forlorn hope of an idea but there was no time now to weigh chancesthere was but a single chance and that was the thorn tree if the lion charged it would be too latethe lad must charge first and to the astonishment of akut and none the less of numa the boy leaped swiftly toward the beast  just for a second was the lion motionless with surprise and in that second jack clayton put to the crucial test an accomplishment which he had practiced at school  straight for the savage brute he ran his spear held butt foremost across his body  akut shrieked in terror and amazement  the lion stood with wide round eyes awaiting the attack ready to rear upon his hind feet and receive this rash creature with blows that could crush the skull of a buffalo  just in front of the lion the boy placed the butt of his spear upon the ground gave a mighty spring and before the bewildered beast could guess the trick that had been played upon him sailed over the lions head into the rending embrace of the thorn treesafe but lacerated  akut had never before seen a polevault  now he leaped up and down within the safety of his own tree screaming taunts and boasts at the discomfited numa while the boy torn and bleeding sought some position in his thorny retreat in which he might find the least agony he had saved his life but at considerable cost in suffering  it seemed to him that the lion would never leave and it was a full hour before the angry brute gave up his vigil and strode majestically away across the plain  when he was at a safe distance the boy extricated himself from the thorn tree but not without inflicting new wounds upon his already tortured flesh  it was many days before the outward evidence of the lesson he had learned had left him while the impression upon his mind was one that was to remain with him for life  never again did he uselessly tempt fate  he took long chances often in his after life but only when the taking of chances might further the attainment of some cherished endand always thereafter he practiced polevaulting  for several days the boy and the ape lay up while the former recovered from the painful wounds inflicted by the sharp thorns  the great anthropoid licked the wounds of his human friend nor aside from this did they receive other treatment but they soon healed for healthy flesh quickly replaces itself  when the lad felt fit again the two continued their journey toward the coast and once more the boys mind was filled with pleasurable anticipation  and at last the much dreamed of moment came  they were passing through a tangled forest when the boys sharp eyes discovered from the lower branches through which he was traveling an old but wellmarked spoora spoor that set his heart to leapingthe spoor of man of white men for among the prints of naked feet were the well defined outlines of european made boots  the trail which marked the passage of a goodsized company pointed north at right angles to the course the boy and the ape were taking toward the coast  doubtless these white men knew the nearest coast settlement  they might even be headed for it now  at any rate it would be worth while overtaking them if even only for the pleasure of meeting again creatures of his own kind  the lad was all excitement palpitant with eagerness to be off in pursuit  akut demurred  he wanted nothing of men  to him the lad was a fellow ape for he was the son of the king of apes  he tried to dissuade the boy telling him that soon they should come upon a tribe of their own folk where some day when he was older the boy should be king as his father had before him  but jack was obdurate  he insisted that he wanted to see white men again  he wanted to send a message to his parents  akut listened and as he listened the intuition of the beast suggested the truth to himthe boy was planning to return to his own kind  the thought filled the old ape with sorrow  he loved the boy as he had loved the father with the loyalty and faithfulness of a hound for its master  in his ape brain and his ape heart he had nursed the hope that he and the lad would never be separated  he saw all his fondly cherished plans fading away and yet he remained loyal to the lad and to his wishes  though disconsolate he gave in to the boys determination to pursue the safari of the white men accompanying him upon what he believed would be their last journey together  the spoor was but a couple of days old when the two discovered it which meant that the slowmoving caravan was but a few hours distant from them whose trained and agile muscles could carry their bodies swiftly through the branches above the tangled undergrowth which had impeded the progress of the laden carriers of the white men  the boy was in the lead excitement and anticipation carrying him ahead of his companion to whom the attainment of their goal meant only sorrow  and it was the boy who first saw the rear guard of the caravan and the white men he had been so anxious to overtake  stumbling along the tangled trail of those ahead a dozen heavily laden blacks who from fatigue or sickness had dropped behind were being prodded by the black soldiers of the rear guard kicked when they fell and then roughly jerked to their feet and hustled onward  on either side walked a giant white man heavy blonde beards almost obliterating their countenances  the boys lips formed a glad cry of salutation as his eyes first discovered the whitesa cry that was never uttered for almost immediately he witnessed that which turned his happiness to anger as he saw that both the white men were wielding heavy whips brutally upon the naked backs of the poor devils staggering along beneath loads that would have overtaxed the strength and endurance of strong men at the beginning of a new day  every now and then the rear guard and the white men cast apprehensive glances rearward as though momentarily expecting the materialization of some long expected danger from that quarter  the boy had paused after his first sight of the caravan and now was following slowly in the wake of the sordid brutal spectacle  presently akut came up with him to the beast there was less of horror in the sight than to the lad yet even the great ape growled beneath his breath at useless torture being inflicted upon the helpless slaves  he looked at the boy  now that he had caught up with the creatures of his own kind why was it that he did not rush forward and greet them  he put the question to his companion  they are fiends muttered the boy  i would not travel with such as they for if i did i should set upon them and kill them the first time they beat their people as they are beating them now but he added after a moments thought i can ask them the whereabouts of the nearest port and then akut we can leave them  the ape made no reply and the boy swung to the ground and started at a brisk walk toward the safari  he was a hundred yards away perhaps when one of the whites caught sight of him  the man gave a shout of alarm instantly levelling his rifle upon the boy and firing  the bullet struck just in front of its mark scattering turf and fallen leaves against the lads legs  a second later the other white and the black soldiers of the rear guard were firing hysterically at the boy  jack leaped behind a tree unhit  days of panic ridden flight through the jungle had filled carl jenssen and sven malbihn with jangling nerves and their native boys with unreasoning terror  every new note from behind sounded to their frightened ears the coming of the sheik and his bloodthirsty entourage  they were in a blue funk and the sight of the naked white warrior stepping silently out of the jungle through which they had just passed had been sufficient shock to let loose in action all the pent nerve energy of malbihn who had been the first to see the strange apparition  and malbihns shout and shot had set the others going  when their nervous energy had spent itself and they came to take stock of what they had been fighting it developed that malbihn alone had seen anything clearly  several of the blacks averred that they too had obtained a good view of the creature but their descriptions of it varied so greatly that jenssen who had seen nothing himself was inclined to be a trifle skeptical  one of the blacks insisted that the thing had been eleven feet tall with a mans body and the head of an elephant  another had seen three immense arabs with huge black beards but when after conquering their nervousness the rear guard advanced upon the enemys position to investigate they found nothing for akut and the boy had retreated out of range of the unfriendly guns  jack was disheartened and sad  he had not entirely recovered from the depressing effect of the unfriendly reception he had received at the hands of the blacks and now he had found an even more hostile one accorded him by men of his own color  the lesser beasts flee from me in terror he murmured half to himself the greater beasts are ready to tear me to pieces at sight black men would kill me with their spears or arrows  and now white men men of my own kind have fired upon me and driven me away  are all the creatures of the world my enemies  has the son of tarzan no friend other than akut  the old ape drew closer to the boy  there are the great apes he said  they only will be the friends of akuts friend  only the great apes will welcome the son of tarzan you have seen that men want nothing of you  let us go now and continue our search for the great apesour people  the language of the great apes is a combination of monosyllabic gutturals amplified by gestures and signs  it may not be literally translated into human speech but as near as may be this is what akut said to the boy  the two proceeded in silence for some time after akut had spoken  the boy was immersed in deep thoughtbitter thoughts in which hatred and revenge predominated  finally he spoke  very well akut he said we will find our friends the great apes  the anthropoid was overjoyed but he gave no outward demonstration of his pleasure  a low grunt was his only response and a moment later he had leaped nimbly upon a small and unwary rodent that had been surprised at a fatal distance from its burrow  tearing the unhappy creature in two akut handed the lions share to the lad     chapter 8   a year had passed since the two swedes had been driven in terror from the savage country where the sheik held sway  little meriem still played with geeka lavishing all her childish love upon the now almost hopeless ruin of what had never even in its palmiest days possessed even a slight degree of loveliness  but to meriem geeka was all that was sweet and adorable  she carried to the deaf ears of the battered ivory head all her sorrows all her hopes and all her ambitions for even in the face of hopelessness in the clutches of the dread authority from which there was no escape little meriem yet cherished hopes and ambitions  it is true that her ambitions were rather nebulous in form consisting chiefly of a desire to escape with geeka to some remote and unknown spot where there were no sheiks no mabunuswhere el adrea could find no entrance and where she might play all day surrounded only by flowers and birds and the harmless little monkeys playing in the tree tops  the sheik had been away for a long time conducting a caravan of ivory skins and rubber far into the north  the interim had been one of great peace for meriem  it is true that mabunu had still been with her to pinch or beat her as the mood seized the villainous old hag but mabunu was only one  when the sheik was there also there were two of them and the sheik was stronger and more brutal even than mabunu little meriem often wondered why the grim old man hated her so  it is true that he was cruel and unjust to all with whom he came in contact but to meriem he reserved his greatest cruelties his most studied injustices  today meriem was squatting at the foot of a large tree which grew inside the palisade close to the edge of the village  she was fashioning a tent of leaves for geeka  before the tent were some pieces of wood and small leaves and a few stones  these were the household utensils  geeka was cooking dinner  as the little girl played she prattled continuously to her companion propped in a sitting position with a couple of twigs  she was totally absorbed in the domestic duties of geekaso much so that she did not note the gentle swaying of the branches of the tree above her as they bent to the body of the creature that had entered them stealthily from the jungle  in happy ignorance the little girl played on while from above two steady eyes looked down upon herunblinking unwavering  there was none other than the little girl in this part of the village which had been almost deserted since the sheik had left long months before upon his journey toward the north  and out in the jungle an hours march from the village the sheik was leading his returning caravan homeward   a year had passed since the white men had fired upon the lad and driven him back into the jungle to take up his search for the only remaining creatures to whom he might look for companionshipthe great apes  for months the two had wandered eastward deeper and deeper into the jungle  the year had done much for the boyturning his already mighty muscles to thews of steel developing his woodcraft to a point where it verged upon the uncanny perfecting his arboreal instincts and training him in the use of both natural and artificial weapons  he had become at last a creature of marvelous physical powers and mental cunning  he was still but a boy yet so great was his strength that the powerful anthropoid with which he often engaged in mimic battle was no match for him  akut had taught him to fight as the bull ape fights nor ever was there a teacher better fitted to instruct in the savage warfare of primordial man or a pupil better equipped to profit by the lessons of a master  as the two searched for a band of the almost extinct species of ape to which akut belonged they lived upon the best the jungle afforded antelope and zebra fell to the boys spear or were dragged down by the two powerful beasts of prey who leaped upon them from some overhanging limb or from the ambush of the undergrowth beside the trail to the water hole or the ford  the pelt of a leopard covered the nakedness of the youth but the wearing of it had not been dictated by any prompting of modesty  with the rifle shots of the white men showering about him he had reverted to the savagery of the beast that is inherent in each of us but that flamed more strongly in this boy whose father had been raised a beast of prey  he wore his leopard skin at first in response to a desire to parade a trophy of his prowess for he had slain the leopard with his knife in a handtohand combat  he saw that the skin was beautiful which appealed to his barbaric sense of ornamentation and when it stiffened and later commenced to decompose because of his having no knowledge of how to cure or tan it was  with sorrow and regret that he discarded it  later when he chanced upon a lone black warrior wearing the counterpart of it soft and clinging and beautiful from proper curing it required but an instant to leap from above upon the shoulders of the unsuspecting black sink a keen blade into his heart and possess the rightly preserved hide  there were no afterqualms of conscience  in the jungle might is right nor does it take long to inculcate this axiom in the mind of a jungle dweller regardless of what his past training may have been that the black would have killed him had he had the chance the boy knew full well  neither he nor the black were any more sacred than the lion or the buffalo the zebra or the deer or any other of the countless creatures who roamed or slunk or flew or wriggled through the dark mazes of the forest  each had but a single life which was sought by many  the greater number of enemies slain the better chance to prolong that life  so the boy smiled and donned the finery of the vanquished and went his way with akut searching always searching for the elusive anthropoids who were to welcome them with open arms  and at last they found them  deep in the jungle buried far from sight of man they came upon such another little natural arena as had witnessed the wild ceremony of the dumdum in which the boys father had taken part long years before  first at a great distance they heard the beating of the drum of the great apes  they were sleeping in the safety of a huge tree when the booming sound smote upon their ears  both awoke at once  akut was the first to interpret the strange cadence  the great apes he growled  they dance the dumdum  come korak son of tarzan let us go to our people  months before akut had given the boy a name of his own choosing since he could not master the man given name of jack  korak is as near as it may be interpreted into human speech  in the language of the apes it means killer  now the killer rose upon the branch of the great tree where he had been sleeping with his back braced against the stem  he stretched his lithe young muscles the moonlight filtering through the foliage from above dappling his brown skin with little patches of light  the ape too stood up half squatting after the manner of his kind low growls rumbled from the bottom of his deep chestgrowls of excited anticipation  the boy growled in harmony with the ape  then the anthropoid slid softly to the ground  close by in the direction of the booming drum lay a clearing which they must cross  the moon flooded it with silvery light  halferect the great ape shuffled into the full glare of the moon  at his side swinging gracefully along in marked contrast to the awkwardness of his companion strode the boy the dark shaggy coat of the one brushing against the smooth clear hide of the other  the lad was humming now a music hall air that had found its way to the forms of the great english public school that was to see him no more  he was happy and expectant  the moment he had looked forward to for so long was about to be realized  he was coming into his own  he was coming home  as the months had dragged or flown along retarded or spurred on as privation or adventure predominated thoughts of his own home while oft recurring had become less vivid the old life had grown to seem more like a dream than a reality and the balking of his determination to reach the coast and return to london had finally thrown the hope of realization so remotely into the future that it too now seemed little more than a pleasant but hopeless dream  now all thoughts of london and civilization were crowded so far into the background of his brain that they might as well have been nonexistent  except for form and mental development he was as much an ape as the great fierce creature at his side  in the exuberance of his joy he slapped his companion roughly on the side of the head  half in anger half in play the anthropoid turned upon him his fangs bared and glistening  long hairy arms reached out to seize him and as they had done a thousand times before the two clinched in mimic battle rolling upon the sward striking growling and biting though never closing their teeth in more than a rough pinch  it was wondrous practice for them both  the boy brought into play wrestling tricks that he had learned at school and many of these akut learned to use and to foil  and from the ape the boy learned the methods that had been handed down to akut from some common ancestor of them both who had roamed the teeming earth when ferns were trees and crocodiles were birds  but there was one art the boy possessed which akut could not master though he did achieve fair proficiency in it for an apeboxing  to have his bulllike charges stopped and crumpled with a suddenly planted fist upon the end of his snout or a painful jolt in the short ribs always surprised akut  it angered him too and at such times his mighty jaws came nearer to closing in the soft flesh of his friend than at any other for he was still an ape with an apes short temper and brutal instincts but the difficulty was in catching his tormentor while his rage lasted for when he lost his head and rushed madly into close quarters with the boy he discovered that the stinging hail of blows released upon him always found their mark and effectually stopped himeffectually and painfully  then he would withdraw growling viciously backing away with grinning jaws distended to sulk for an hour or so  tonight they did not box  just for a moment or two they wrestled playfully until the scent of sheeta the panther brought them to their feet alert and wary  the great cat was passing through the jungle in front of them  for a moment it paused listening  the boy and the ape growled menacingly in chorus and the carnivore moved on  then the two took up their journey toward the sound of the dumdum louder and louder came the beating of the drum  now at last they could hear the growling of the dancing apes and strong to their nostrils came the scent of their kind  the lad trembled with excitement  the hair down akuts spine stiffenedthe symptoms of happiness and anger are often similar  silently they crept through the jungle as they neared the meeting place of the apes  now they were in the trees worming their way forward alert for sentinels  presently through a break in the foliage the scene burst upon the eager eyes of the boy  to akut it was a familiar one but to korak it was all new  his nerves tingled at the savage sight  the great bulls were dancing in the moonlight leaping in an irregular circle about the flattopped earthen drum about which three old females sat beating its resounding top with sticks worn smooth by long years of use  akut knowing the temper and customs of his kind was too wise to make their presence known until the frenzy of the dance had passed  after the drum was quiet and the bellies of the tribe wellfilled he would hail them  then would come a parley after which he and korak would be accepted into membership by the community  there might be those who would object but such could be overcome by brute force of which he and the lad had an ample surplus  for weeks possibly months their presence might cause ever decreasing suspicion among others of the tribe but eventually they would become as born brothers to these strange apes  he hoped that they had been among those who had known tarzan for that would help in the introduction of the lad and in the consummation of akuts dearest wish that korak should become king of the apes  it was with difficulty however that akut kept the boy from rushing into the midst of the dancing anthropoidsan act that would have meant the instant extermination of them both since the hysterical frenzy into which the great apes work themselves during the performance of their strange rites is of such a nature that even the most ferocious of the carnivora give them a wide berth at such times  as the moon declined slowly toward the lofty foliaged horizon of the amphitheater the booming of the drum decreased and lessened were the exertions of the dancers until at last the final note was struck and the huge beasts turned to fall upon the feast they had dragged hither for the orgy  from what he had seen and heard akut was able to explain to korak that the rites proclaimed the choosing of a new king and he pointed out to the boy the massive figure of the shaggy monarch come into his kingship no doubt as many human rulers have come into theirsby the murder of his predecessor  when the apes had filled their bellies and many of them had sought the bases of the trees to curl up in sleep akut plucked korak by the arm  come he whispered  come slowly  follow me  do as akut does  then he advanced slowly through the trees until he stood upon a bough overhanging one side of the amphitheater  here he stood in silence for a moment  then he uttered a low growl  instantly a score of apes leaped to their feet  their savage little eyes sped quickly around the periphery of the clearing  the king ape was the first to see the two figures upon the branch  he gave voice to an ominous growl  then he took a few lumbering steps in the direction of the intruders  his hair was bristling  his legs were stiff imparting a halting jerky motion to his gait  behind him pressed a number of bulls  he stopped just a little before he came beneath the twojust far enough to be beyond their spring  wary king  here he stood rocking himself to and fro upon his short legs baring his fangs in hideous grinnings rumbling out an ever increasing volume of growls which were slowly but steadily increasing to the proportions of roars  akut knew that he was planning an attack upon them  the old ape did not wish to fight  he had come with the boy to cast his lot with the tribe  i am akut he said  this is korak  korak is the son of tarzan who was king of the apes  i too was king of the apes who dwelt in the midst of the great waters  we have come to hunt with you to fight with you  we are great hunters  we are mighty fighters  let us come in peace  the king ceased his rocking  he eyed the pair from beneath his beetling brows  his bloodshot eyes were savage and crafty  his kingship was very new and he was jealous of it  he feared the encroachments of two strange apes  the sleek brown hairless body of the lad spelled man and man he feared and hated  go away he growled  go away or i will kill you  the eager lad standing behind the great akut had been pulsing with anticipation and happiness  he wanted to leap down among these hairy monsters and show them that he was their friend that he was one of them  he had expected that they would receive him with open arms and now the words of the king ape filled him with indignation and sorrow the blacks had set upon him and driven him away  then he had turned to the white mento those of his own kindonly to hear the ping of bullets where he had expected words of cordial welcome  the great apes had remained his final hope  to them he looked for the companionship man had denied him  suddenly rage overwhelmed him  the king ape was almost directly beneath him  the others were formed in a half circle several yards behind the king  they were watching events interestedly  before akut could guess his intention or prevent the boy leaped to the ground directly in the path of the king who had now succeeded in stimulating himself to a frenzy of fury  i am korak shouted the boy  i am the killer  i came to live among you as a friend  you want to drive me away  very well then i shall go but before i go i shall show you that the son of tarzan is your master as his father was before himthat he is not afraid of your king or you  for an instant the king ape had stood motionless with surprise  he had expected no such rash action upon the part of either of the intruders akut was equally surprised  now he shouted excitedly for korak to come back for he knew that in the sacred arena the other bulls might be expected to come to the assistance of their king against an outsider though there was small likelihood that the king would need assistance once those mighty jaws closed upon the boys soft neck the end would come quickly  to leap to his rescue would mean death for akut too but the brave old ape never hesitated  bristling and growling he dropped to the sward just as the king ape charged  the beasts hands clutched for their hold as the animal sprang upon the lad  the fierce jaws were wide distended to bury the yellow fangs deeply in the brown hide  korak too leaped forward to meet the attack but leaped crouching beneath the outstretched arms  at the instant of contact the lad pivoted on one foot and with all the weight of his body and the strength of his trained muscles drove a clenched fist into the bulls stomach  with a gasping shriek the king ape collapsed clutching futilely for the agile naked creature nimbly sidestepping from his grasp  howls of rage and dismay broke from the bull apes behind the fallen king as with murder in their savage little hearts they rushed forward upon korak and akut but the old ape was too wise to court any such unequal encounter  to have counseled the boy to retreat now would have been futile and akut knew it  to delay even a second in argument would have sealed the death warrants of them both  there was but a single hope and akut seized it  grasping the lad around the waist he lifted him bodily from the ground and turning ran swiftly toward another tree which swung low branches above the arena  close upon their heels swarmed the hideous mob but akut old though he was and burdened by the weight of the struggling korak was still fleeter than his pursuers  with a bound he grasped a low limb and with the agility of a little monkey swung himself and the boy to temporary safety  nor did he hesitate even here but raced on through the jungle night bearing his burden to safety  for a time the bulls pursued but presently as the swifter outdistanced the slower and found themselves separated from their fellows they abandoned the chase standing roaring and screaming until the jungle reverberated to their hideous noises  then they turned and retraced their way to the amphitheater  when akut felt assured that they were no longer pursued he stopped and released korak  the boy was furious  why did you drag me away he cried  i would have taught them  i would have taught them all  now they will think that i am afraid of them  what they think cannot harm you said akut  you are alive  if i had not brought you away you would be dead now and so would i  do you not know that even numa slinks from the path of the great apes when there are many of them and they are mad     chapter 9   it was an unhappy korak who wandered aimlessly through the jungle the day following his inhospitable reception by the great apes  his heart was heavy from disappointment  unsatisfied vengeance smoldered in his breast  he looked with hatred upon the denizens of his jungle world baring his fighting fangs and growling at those that came within radius of his senses  the mark of his fathers early life was strong upon him and enhanced by months of association with beasts from whom the imitative faculty of youth had absorbed a countless number of little mannerisms of the predatory creatures of the wild  he bared his fangs now as naturally and upon as slight provocation as sheeta the panther bared his  he growled as ferociously as akut himself  when he came suddenly upon another beast his quick crouch bore a strange resemblance to the arching of a cats back  korak the killer was looking for trouble  in his heart of hearts he hoped to meet the king ape who had driven him from the amphitheater  to this end he insisted upon remaining in the vicinity but the exigencies of the perpetual search for food led them several miles further away during day  they were moving slowly down wind and warily because the advantage was with whatever beast might chance to be hunting ahead of them where their scentspoor was being borne by the light breeze  suddenly the two halted simultaneously  two heads were cocked upon one side  like creatures hewn from solid rock they stood immovable listening  not a muscle quivered  for several seconds they remained thus then korak advanced cautiously a few yards and leaped nimbly into a tree  akut followed close upon his heels  neither had made a noise that would have been appreciable to human ears at a dozen paces  stopping often to listen they crept forward through the trees  that both were greatly puzzled was apparent from the questioning looks they cast at one another from time to time  finally the lad caught a glimpse of a palisade a hundred yards ahead and beyond it the tops of some goatskin tents and a number of thatched huts  his lip upcurled in a savage snarl  blacks  how he hated them  he signed to akut to remain where he was while he advanced to reconnoiter  woe betide the unfortunate villager whom the killer came upon now slinking through the lower branches of the trees leaping lightly from one jungle giant to its neighbor where the distance was not too great or swinging from one hand hold to another korak came silently toward the village  he heard a voice beyond the palisade and toward that he made his way  a great tree overhung the enclosure at the very point from which the voice came  into this korak crept  his spear was ready in his hand  his ears told him of the proximity of a human being  all that his eyes required was a single glance to show him his target then lightning like the missile would fly to its goal  with raised spear he crept among the branches of the tree glaring narrowly downward in search of the owner of the voice which rose to him from below  at last he saw a human back  the spear hand flew to the limit of the throwing position to gather the force that would send the iron shod missile completely through the body of the unconscious victim  and then the killer paused  he leaned forward a little to get a better view of the target  was it to insure more perfect aim or had there been that in the graceful lines and the childish curves of the little body below him that had held in check the spirit of murder running riot in his veins  he lowered his spear cautiously that it might make no noise by scraping against foliage or branches  quietly he crouched in a comfortable position along a great limb and there he lay with wide eyes looking down in wonder upon the creature he had crept upon to killlooking down upon a little girl a little nut brown maiden  the snarl had gone from his lip  his only expression was one of interested attentionhe was trying to discover what the girl was doing  suddenly a broad grin overspread his face for a turn of the girls body had revealed geeka of the ivory head and the rat skin torsogeeka of the splinter limbs and the disreputable appearance  the little girl raised the marred face to hers and rocking herself backward and forward crooned a plaintive arab lullaby to the doll  a softer light entered the eyes of the killer  for a long hour that passed very quickly to him korak lay with gaze riveted upon the playing child  not once had he had a view of the girls full face  for the most part he saw only a mass of wavy black hair one brown little shoulder exposed upon the side from where her single robe was caught beneath her arm and a shapely knee protruding from beneath her garment as she sat cross legged upon the ground  a tilt of the head as she emphasized some maternal admonition to the passive geeka revealed occasionally a rounded cheek or a piquant little chin  now she was shaking a slim finger at geeka reprovingly and again she crushed to her heart this only object upon which she might lavish the untold wealth of her childish affections  korak momentarily forgetful of his bloody mission permitted the fingers of his spear hand to relax a little their grasp upon the shaft of his formidable weapon  it slipped almost falling but the occurrence recalled the killer to himself  it reminded him of his purpose in slinking stealthily upon the owner of the voice that had attracted his vengeful attention  he glanced at the spear with its wellworn grip and cruel barbed head  then he let his eyes wander again to the dainty form below him  in imagination he saw the heavy weapon shooting downward  he saw it pierce the tender flesh driving its way deep into the yielding body  he saw the ridiculous doll drop from its owners arms to lie sprawled and pathetic beside the quivering body of the little girl  the killer shuddered scowling at the inanimate iron and wood of the spear as though they constituted a sentient being endowed with a malignant mind  korak wondered what the girl would do were he to drop suddenly from the tree to her side  most likely she would scream and run away  then would come the men of the village with spears and guns and set upon him  they would either kill him or drive him away  a lump rose in the boys throat  he craved the companionship of his own kind though he scarce realized how greatly  he would have liked to slip down beside the little girl and talk with her though he knew from the words he had overheard that she spoke a language with which he was unfamiliar  they could have talked by signs a little  that would have been better than nothing  too he would have been glad to see her face  what he had glimpsed assured him that she was pretty but her strongest appeal to him lay in the affectionate nature revealed by her gentle mothering of the grotesque doll  at last he hit upon a plan  he would attract her attention and reassure her by a smiling greeting from a greater distance  silently he wormed his way back into the tree  it was his intention to hail her from beyond the palisade giving her the feeling of security which he imagined the stout barricade would afford  he had scarcely left his position in the tree when his attention was attracted by a considerable noise upon the opposite side of the village  by moving a little he could see the gate at the far end of the main street  a number of men women and children were running toward it  it swung open revealing the head of a caravan upon the opposite side  in trooped the motley organizationblack slaves and dark hued arabs of the northern deserts cursing camel drivers urging on their vicious charges overburdened donkeys waving sadly pendulous ears while they endured with stoic patience the brutalities of their masters goats sheep and horses  into the village they all trooped behind a tall sour old man who rode without greetings to those who shrunk from his path directly to a large goatskin tent in the center of the village  here he spoke to a wrinkled hag  korak from his vantage spot could see it all  he saw the old man asking questions of the black woman and then he saw the latter point toward a secluded corner of the village which was hidden from the main street by the tents of the arabs and the huts of the natives in the direction of the tree beneath which the little girl played  this was doubtless her father thought korak  he had been away and his first thought upon returning was of his little daughter  how glad she would be to see him  how she would run and throw herself into his arms to be crushed to his breast and covered with his kisses  korak sighed he thought of his own father and mother far away in london  he returned to his place in the tree above the girl  if he couldnt have happiness of this sort himself he wanted to enjoy the happiness of others  possibly if he made himself known to the old man he might be permitted to come to the village occasionally as a friend  it would be worth trying  he would wait until the old arab had greeted his daughter then he would make his presence known with signs of peace  the arab was striding softly toward the girl  in a moment he would be beside her and then how surprised and delighted she would be  koraks eyes sparkled in anticipationand now the old man stood behind the little girl  his stern old face was still unrelaxed  the child was yet unconscious of his presence  she prattled on to the unresponsive geeka  then the old man coughed  with a start the child glanced quickly up over her shoulder  korak could see her full face now  it was very beautiful in its sweet and innocent childishnessall soft and lovely curves  he could see her great dark eyes  he looked for the happy love light that would follow recognition but it did not come instead terror stark paralyzing terror was mirrored in her eyes in the expression of her mouth in the tense cowering attitude of her body  a grim smile curved the thin cruel lip of the arab  the child essayed to crawl away but before she could get out of his reach the old man kicked her brutally sending her sprawling upon the grass then he followed her up to seize and strike her as was his custom  above them in the tree a beast crouched where a moment before had been a boya beast with dilating nostrils and bared fangsa beast that trembled with rage  the sheik was stooping to reach for the girl when the killer dropped to the ground at his side  his spear was still in his left hand but he had forgotten it  instead his right fist was clenched and as the sheik took a backward step astonished by the sudden materialization of this strange apparition apparently out of clear air the heavy fist landed full upon his mouth backed by the weight of the young giant and the terrific power of his more than human muscles  bleeding and senseless the sheik sank to earth  korak turned toward the child  she had regained her feet and stood wide eyed and frightened looking first into his face and then horror struck at the recumbent figure of the sheik  in an involuntary gesture of protection the killer threw an arm about the girls shoulders and stood waiting for the arab to regain consciousness  for a moment they remained thus when the girl spoke  when he regains his senses he will kill me she said in arabic  korak could not understand her  he shook his head speaking to her first in english and then in the language of the great apes but neither of these was intelligible to her  she leaned forward and touched the hilt of the long knife that the arab wore  then she raised her clasped hand above her head and drove an imaginary blade into her breast above her heart  korak understood  the old man would kill her the girl came to his side again and stood there trembling  she did not fear him  why should she  he had saved her from a terrible beating at the hands of the sheik  never in her memory had another so befriended her  she looked up into his face  it was a boyish handsome face nutbrown like her own  she admired the spotted leopard skin that circled his lithe body from one shoulder to his knees  the metal anklets and armlets adorning him aroused her envy  always had she coveted something of the kind but never had the sheik permitted her more than the single cotton garment that barely sufficed to cover her nakedness  no furs or silks or jewelry had there ever been for little meriem  and korak looked at the girl  he had always held girls in a species of contempt  boys who associated with them were in his estimation mollycoddles  he wondered what he should do  could he leave her here to be abused possibly murdered by the villainous old arab  no  but on the other hand could he take her into the jungle with him  what could he accomplish burdened by a weak and frightened girl  she would scream at her own shadow when the moon came out upon the jungle night and the great beasts roamed moaning and roaring through the darkness  he stood for several minutes buried in thought  the girl watched his face wondering what was passing in his mind  she too was thinking of the future  she feared to remain and suffer the vengeance of the sheik  there was no one in all the world to whom she might turn other than this halfnaked stranger who had dropped miraculously from the clouds to save her from one of the sheiks accustomed beatings  would her new friend leave her now  wistfully she gazed at his intent face she moved a little closer to him laying a slim brown hand upon his arm  the contact awakened the lad from his absorption  he looked down at her and then his arm went about her shoulder once more for he saw tears upon her lashes  come he said  the jungle is kinder than man  you shall live in the jungle and korak and akut will protect you  she did not understand his words but the pressure of his arm drawing her away from the prostrate arab and the tents was quite intelligible one little arm crept about his waist and together they walked toward the palisade  beneath the great tree that had harbored korak while he watched the girl at play he lifted her in his arms and throwing her lightly across his shoulder leaped nimbly into the lower branches  her arms were about his neck and from one little hand geeka dangled down his straight young back  and so meriem entered the jungle with korak trusting in her childish innocence the stranger who had befriended her and perhaps influenced in her belief in him by that strange intuitive power possessed by woman  she had no conception of what the future might hold  she did not know nor could she have guessed the manner of life led by her protector  possibly she pictured a distant village similar to that of the sheik in which lived other white men like the stranger  that she was to be taken into the savage primeval life of a jungle beast could not have occurred to her  had it her little heart would have palpitated with fear  often had she wished to run away from the cruelties of the sheik and mabunu but the dangers of the jungle always had deterred her  the two had gone but a short distance from the village when the girl spied the huge proportions of the great akut  with a halfstifled scream she clung more closely to korak and pointed fearfully toward the ape  akut thinking that the killer was returning with a prisoner came growling toward thema little girl aroused no more sympathy in the beasts heart than would a fullgrown bull ape  she was a stranger and therefore to be killed  he bared his yellow fangs as he approached and to his surprise the killer bared his likewise but he bared them at akut and snarled menacingly  ah thought akut the killer has taken a mate and so obedient to the tribal laws of his kind he left them alone becoming suddenly absorbed in a fuzzy caterpillar of peculiarly succulent appearance the larva disposed of he glanced from the corner of an eye at korak the youth had deposited his burden upon a large limb where she clung desperately to keep from falling  she will accompany us said korak to akut jerking a thumb in the direction of the girl  do not harm her  we will protect her  akut shrugged  to be burdened by the young of man was in no way to his liking  he could see from her evident fright at her position on the branch and from the terrified glances she cast in his direction that she was hopelessly unfit  by all the ethics of akuts training and inheritance the unfit should be eliminated but if the killer wished this there was nothing to be done about it but to tolerate her  akut certainly didnt want herof that he was quite positive  her skin was too smooth and hairless  quite snakelike in fact and her face was most unattractive  not at all like that of a certain lovely she he had particularly noticed among the apes in the amphitheater the previous night  ah there was true feminine beauty for onea great generous mouth lovely yellow fangs and the cutest softest side whiskers akut sighed  then he rose expanded his great chest and strutted back and forth along a substantial branch for even a puny thing like this she of koraks might admire his fine coat and his graceful carriage  but poor little meriem only shrank closer to korak and almost wished that she were back in the village of the sheik where the terrors of existence were of human origin and so more or less familiar  the hideous ape frightened her  he was so large and so ferocious in appearance  his actions she could only interpret as a menace for how could she guess that he was parading to excite admiration  nor could she know of the bond of fellowship which existed between this great brute and the godlike youth who had rescued her from the sheik  meriem spent an evening and a night of unmitigated terror  korak and akut led her along dizzy ways as they searched for food  once they hid her in the branches of a tree while they stalked a nearby buck  even her natural terror of being left alone in the awful jungle was submerged in a greater horror as she saw the man and the beast spring simultaneously upon their prey and drag it down as she saw the handsome face of her preserver contorted in a bestial snarl as she saw his strong white teeth buried in the soft flesh of the kill  when he came back to her blood smeared his face and hands and breast and she shrank from him as he offered her a huge hunk of hot raw meat he was evidently much disturbed by her refusal to eat and when a moment later he scampered away into the forest to return with fruit for her she was once more forced to alter her estimation of him  this time she did not shrink but acknowledged his gift with a smile that had she known it was more than ample payment to the affection starved boy  the sleeping problem vexed korak  he knew that the girl could not balance herself in safety in a tree crotch while she slept nor would it be safe to permit her to sleep upon the ground open to the attacks of prowling beasts of prey  there was but a single solution that presented itselfhe must hold her in his arms all night  and that he did with akut braced upon one side of her and he upon the other so that she was warmed by the bodies of them both  she did not sleep much until the night was half spent but at last nature overcame her terrors of the black abyss beneath and the hairy body of the wild beast at her side and she fell into a deep slumber which outlasted the darkness  when she opened her eyes the sun was well up  at first she could not believe in the reality of her position  her head had rolled from koraks shoulder so that her eyes were directed upon the hairy back of the ape  at sight of it she shrank away  then she realized that someone was holding her and turning her head she saw the smiling eyes of the youth regarding her when he smiled she could not fear him and now she shrank closer against him in natural revulsion toward the rough coat of the brute upon her other side  korak spoke to her in the language of the apes but she shook her head and spoke to him in the language of the arab which was as unintelligible to him as was ape speech to her  akut sat up and looked at them  he could understand what korak said but the girl made only foolish noises that were entirely unintelligible and ridiculous  akut could not understand what korak saw in her to attract him  he looked at her long and steadily appraising her carefully then he scratched his head rose and shook himself  his movement gave the girl a little startshe had forgotten akut for the moment  again she shrank from him  the beast saw that she feared him and being a brute enjoyed the evidence of the terror his brutishness inspired  crouching he extended his huge hand stealthily toward her as though to seize her  she shrank still further away akuts eyes were busy drinking in the humor of the situationhe did not see the narrowing eyes of the boy upon him nor the shortening neck as the broad shoulders rose in a characteristic attitude of preparation for attack  as the apes fingers were about to close upon the girls arm the youth rose suddenly with a short vicious growl  a clenched fist flew before meriems eyes to land full upon the snout of the astonished akut  with an explosive bellow the anthropoid reeled backward and tumbled from the tree  korak stood glaring down upon him when a sudden swish in the bushes close by attracted his attention  the girl too was looking down but she saw nothing but the angry ape scrambling to his feet  then like a bolt from a cross bow a mass of spotted yellow fur shot into view straight for akuts back  it was sheeta the leopard     chapter 10   as the leopard leaped for the great ape meriem gasped in surprise and horrornot for the impending fate of the anthropoid but at the act of the youth who but an instant before had angrily struck his strange companion for scarce had the carnivore burst into view than with drawn knife the youth had leaped far out above him so that as sheeta was almost in the act of sinking fangs and talons in akuts broad back the killer landed full upon the leopards shoulders  the cat halted in mid air missed the ape by but a hairs breadth and with horrid snarlings rolled over upon its back clutching and clawing in an effort to reach and dislodge the antagonist biting at its neck and knifing it in the side  akut startled by the sudden rush from his rear and following hoary instinct was in the tree beside the girl with an agility little short of marvelous in so heavy a beast  but the moment that he turned to see what was going on below him brought him as quickly to the ground again personal differences were quickly forgotten in the danger which menaced his human companion nor was he a whit less eager to jeopardize his own safety in the service of his friend than korak had been to succor him  the result was that sheeta presently found two ferocious creatures tearing him to ribbons  shrieking snarling and growling the three rolled hither and thither among the underbrush while with staring eyes the sole spectator of the battle royal crouched trembling in the tree above them hugging geeka frantically to her breast  it was the boys knife which eventually decided the battle and as the fierce feline shuddered convulsively and rolled over upon its side the youth and the ape rose and faced one another across the prostrate carcass  korak jerked his head in the direction of the little girl in the tree  leave her alone he said she is mine  akut grunted blinked his bloodshot eyes and turned toward the body of sheeta  standing erect upon it he threw out his great chest raised his face toward the heavens and gave voice to so horrid a scream that once again the little girl shuddered and shrank  it was the victory cry of the bull ape that has made a kill  the boy only looked on for a moment in silence then he leaped into the tree again to the girls side  akut presently rejoined them  for a few minutes he busied himself licking his wounds then he wandered off to hunt his breakfast  for many months the strange life of the three went on unmarked by any unusual occurrences  at least without any occurrences that seemed unusual to the youth or the ape but to the little girl it was a constant nightmare of horrors for days and weeks until she too became accustomed to gazing into the eyeless sockets of death and to the feel of the icy wind of his shroudlike mantle  slowly she learned the rudiments of the only common medium of thought exchange which her companions possessedthe language of the great apes  more quickly she perfected herself in jungle craft so that the time soon came when she was an important factor in the chase watching while the others slept or helping them to trace the spoor of whatever prey they might be stalking  akut accepted her on a footing which bordered upon equality when it was necessary for them to come into close contact but for the most part he avoided her  the youth always was kind to her and if there were many occasions upon which he felt the burden of her presence he hid it from her  finding that the night damp and chill caused her discomfort and even suffering korak constructed a tight little shelter high among the swaying branches of a giant tree  here little meriem slept in comparative warmth and safety while the killer and the ape perched upon nearby branches the former always before the entrance to the lofty domicile where he best could guard its inmate from the dangers of arboreal enemies  they were too high to feel much fear of sheeta but there was always histah the snake to strike terror to ones soul and the great baboons who lived nearby and who while never attacking always bared their fangs and barked at any of the trio when they passed near them  after the construction of the shelter the activities of the three became localized  they ranged less widely for there was always the necessity of returning to their own tree at nightfall  a river flowed near by  game and fruit were plentiful as were fish also  existence had settled down to the daily humdrum of the wildthe search for food and the sleeping upon full bellies  they looked no further ahead than today  if the youth thought of his past and of those who longed for him in the distant metropolis it was in a detached and impersonal sort of way as though that other life belonged to another creature than himself  he had given up hope of returning to civilization for since his various rebuffs at the hands of those to whom he had looked for friendship he had wandered so far inland as to realize that he was completely lost in the mazes of the jungle  then too since the coming of meriem he had found in her that one thing which he had most missed before in his savage jungle lifehuman companionship  in his friendship for her there was appreciable no trace of sex influence of which he was cognizant  they were friendscompanionsthat was all  both might have been boys except for the half tender and always masterful manifestation of the protective instinct which was apparent in koraks attitude  the little girl idolized him as she might have idolized an indulgent brother had she had one  love was a thing unknown to either but as the youth neared manhood it was inevitable that it should come to him as it did to every other savage jungle male  as meriem became proficient in their common language the pleasures of their companionship grew correspondingly for now they could converse and aided by the mental powers of their human heritage they amplified the restricted vocabulary of the apes until talking was transformed from a task into an enjoyable pastime  when korak hunted meriem usually accompanied him for she had learned the fine art of silence when silence was desirable  she could pass through the branches of the great trees now with all the agility and stealth of the killer himself great heights no longer appalled her  she swung from limb to limb or she raced through the mighty branches surefooted lithe and fearless korak was very proud of her and even old akut grunted in approval where before he had growled in contempt  a distant village of blacks had furnished her with a mantle of fur and feathers with copper ornaments and weapons for korak would not permit her to go unarmed or unversed in the use of the weapons he stole for her  a leather thong over one shoulder supported the ever present geeka who was still the recipient of her most sacred confidences  a light spear and a long knife were her weapons of offense or defense  her body rounding into the fulness of an early maturity followed the lines of a greek goddess but there the similarity ceased for her face was beautiful  as she grew more accustomed to the jungle and the ways of its wild denizens fear left her  as time wore on she even hunted alone when korak and akut were prowling at a great distance as they were sometimes forced to do when game was scarce in their immediate vicinity  upon these occasions she usually confined her endeavors to the smaller animals though sometimes she brought down a deer and once even horta the boara great tusker that even sheeta might have thought twice before attacking  in their stamping grounds in the jungle the three were familiar figures  the little monkeys knew them well often coming close to chatter and frolic about them  when akut was by the small folk kept their distance but with korak they were less shy and when both the males were gone they would come close to meriem tugging at her ornaments or playing with geeka who was a never ending source of amusement to them  the girl played with them and fed them and when she was alone they helped her to pass the long hours until koraks return  nor were they worthless as friends  in the hunt they helped her locate her quarry  often they would come racing through the trees to her side to announce the near presence of antelope or giraffe or with excited warnings of the proximity of sheeta or numa  luscious sunkissed fruits which hung far out upon the frail bough of the jungles waving crest were brought to her by these tiny nimble allies  sometimes they played tricks upon her but she was always kind and gentle with them and in their wild halfhuman way they were kind to her and affectionate  their language being similar to that of the great apes meriem could converse with them though the poverty of their vocabulary rendered these exchanges anything but feasts of reason  for familiar objects they had names as well as for those conditions which induced pain or pleasure joy sorrow or rage  these root words were so similar to those in use among the great anthropoids as to suggest that the language of the manus was the mother tongue  at bests it lent itself to but material an sordid exchange  dreams aspirations hopes the past the future held no place in the conversation of manu the monkey all was of the presentparticularly of filling his belly and catching lice  poor food was this to nourish the mental appetite of a girl just upon the brink of womanhood  and so finding manu only amusing as an occasional playfellow or pet meriem poured out her sweetest soul thoughts into the deaf ears of geekas ivory head  to geeka she spoke in arabic knowing that geeka being but a doll could not understand the language of korak and akut and that the language of korak and akut being that of male apes contained nothing of interest to an arab doll  geeka had undergone a transformation since her little mother had left the village of the sheik  her garmenture now reflected in miniature that of meriem  a tiny bit of leopard skin covered her ratskin torso from shoulder to splinter knee  a band of braided grasses about her brow held in place a few gaudy feathers from the parakeet while other bits of grass were fashioned into imitations of arm and leg ornaments of metal  geeka was a perfect little savage but at heart she was unchanged being the same omnivorous listener as of yore  an excellent trait in geeka was that she never interrupted in order to talk about herself  today was no exception  she had been listening attentively to meriem for an hour propped against the bole of a tree while her lithe young mistress stretched catlike and luxurious along a swaying branch before her  little geeka said meriem our korak has been gone for a long time today  we miss him little geeka do we not  it is dull and lonesome in the great jungle when our korak is away  what will he bring us this time eh  another shining band of metal for meriems ankle  or a soft doeskin loin cloth from the body of a black she  he tells me that it is harder to get the possessions of the shes for he will not kill them as he does the males and they fight savagely when he leaps upon them to wrest their ornaments from them  then come the males with spears and arrows and korak takes to the trees  sometimes he takes the she with him and high among the branches divests her of the things he wishes to bring home to meriem  he says that the blacks fear him now and at first sight of him the women and children run shrieking to their huts but he follows them within and it is not often that he returns without arrows for himself and a present for meriem  korak is mighty among the jungle peopleour korak geekano my korak  meriems conversation was interrupted by the sudden plunge of an excited little monkey that landed upon her shoulders in a flying leap from a neighboring tree  climb he cried  climb  the mangani are coming  meriem glanced lazily over her shoulder at the excited disturber of her peace  climb yourself little manu she said  the only mangani in our jungle are korak and akut  it is they you have seen returning from the hunt  some day you will see your own shadow little manu and then you will be frightened to death  but the monkey only screamed his warning more lustily before he raced upward toward the safety of the high terrace where mangani the great ape could not follow  presently meriem heard the sound of approaching bodies swinging through the trees  she listened attentively  there were two and they were great apeskorak and akut  to her korak was an apea mangani for as such the three always described themselves  man was an enemy so they did not think of themselves as belonging any longer to the same genus  tarmangani or great white ape which described the white man in their language did not fit them all gomanganigreat black ape or negrodescribed none of them so they called themselves plain mangani  meriem decided that she would feign slumber and play a joke on korak so she lay very still with eyes tightly closed  she heard the two approaching closer and closer  they were in the adjoining tree now and must have discovered her for they had halted  why were they so quiet why did not korak call out his customary greeting  the quietness was ominous  it was followed presently by a very stealthy soundone of them was creeping upon her  was korak planning a joke upon his own account  well she would fool him  cautiously she opened her eyes the tiniest bit and as she did so her heart stood still  creeping silently toward her was a huge bull ape that she never before had seen behind him was another like him  with the agility of a squirrel meriem was upon her feet and at the same instant the great bull lunged for her  leaping from limb to limb the girl fled through the jungle while close behind her came the two great apes  above them raced a bevy of screaming chattering monkeys hurling taunts and insults at the mangani and encouragement and advice to the girl  from tree to tree swung meriem working ever upward toward the smaller branches which would not bear the weight of her pursuers  faster and faster came the bull apes after her  the clutching fingers of the foremost were almost upon her again and again but she eluded them by sudden bursts of speed or reckless chances as she threw herself across dizzy spaces  slowly she was gaining her way to the greater heights where safety lay when after a particularly daring leap the swaying branch she grasped bent low beneath her weight nor whipped upward again as it should have done  even before the rending sound which followed meriem knew that she had misjudged the strength of the limb  it gave slowly at first then there was a ripping as it parted from the trunk  releasing her hold meriem dropped among the foliage beneath clutching for a new support  she found it a dozen feet below the broken limb  she had fallen thus many times before so that she had no particular terror of a fallit was the delay which appalled her most and rightly for scarce had she scrambled to a place of safety than the body of the huge ape dropped at her side and a great hairy arm went about her waist  almost at once the other ape reached his companions side  he made a lunge at meriem but her captor swung her to one side bared his fighting fangs and growled ominously  meriem struggled to escape  she struck at the hairy breast and bearded cheek  she fastened her strong white teeth in one shaggy forearm  the ape cuffed her viciously across the face then he had to turn his attention to his fellow who quite evidently desired the prize for his own  the captor could not fight to advantage upon the swaying bough burdened as he was by a squirming struggling captive so he dropped quickly to the ground beneath  the other followed him and here they fought occasionally abandoning their duel to pursue and recapture the girl who took every advantage of her captors preoccupation in battle to break away in attempted escape but always they overtook her and first one and then the other possessed her as they struggled to tear one another to pieces for the prize  often the girl came in for many blows that were intended for a hairy foe and once she was felled lying unconscious while the apes relieved of the distraction of detaining her by force tore into one another in fierce and terrible combat  above them screamed the little monkeys racing hither and thither in a frenzy of hysterical excitement  back and forth over the battle field flew countless birds of gorgeous plumage squawking their hoarse cries of rage and defiance  in the distance a lion roared  the larger bull was slowly tearing his antagonist to pieces  they rolled upon the ground biting and striking  again erect upon their hind legs they pulled and tugged like human wrestlers but always the giant fangs found their bloody part to play until both combatants and the ground about them were red with gore  meriem through it all lay still and unconscious upon the ground  at last one found a permanent hold upon the jugular of the other and thus they went down for the last time  for several minutes they lay with scarce a struggle  it was the larger bull who arose alone from the last embrace  he shook himself  a deep growl rumbled from his hairy throat  he waddled back and forth between the body of the girl and that of his vanquished foe  then he stood upon the latter and gave tongue to his hideous challenge  the little monkeys broke screaming in all directions as the terrifying noise broke upon their ears  the gorgeous birds took wing and fled  once again the lion roared this time at a greater distance  the great ape waddled once more to the girls side  he turned her over upon her back and stooping commenced to sniff and listen about her face and breast  she lived  the monkeys were returning  they came in swarms and from above hurled down insults upon the victor  the ape showed his displeasure by baring his teeth and growling up at them  then he stooped and lifting the girl to his shoulder waddled off through the jungle  in his wake followed the angry mob     chapter 11   korak returning from the hunt heard the jabbering of the excited monkeys  he knew that something was seriously amiss  histah the snake had doubtless coiled his slimy folds about some careless manu the youth hastened ahead  the monkeys were meriems friends  he would help them if he could  he traveled rapidly along the middle terrace in the tree by meriems shelter he deposited his trophies of the hunt and called aloud to her  there was no answer  he dropped quickly to a lower level  she might be hiding from him  upon a great branch where meriem often swung at indolent ease he saw geeka propped against the trees great bole  what could it mean meriem had never left geeka thus alone before  korak picked up the doll and tucked it in his belt  he called again more loudly but no meriem answered his summons  in the distance the jabbering of the excited manus was growing less distinct  could their excitement be in any way connected with meriems disappearance  the bare thought was enough  without waiting for akut who was coming slowly along some distance in his rear korak swung rapidly in the direction of the chattering mob  but a few minutes sufficed to overtake the rearmost  at sight of him they fell to screaming and pointing downward ahead of them and a moment later korak came within sight of the cause of their rage  the youths heart stood still in terror as he saw the limp body of the girl across the hairy shoulders of a great ape  that she was dead he did not doubt and in that instant there arose within him a something which he did not try to interpret nor could have had he tried but all at once the whole world seemed centered in that tender graceful body that frail little body hanging so pitifully limp and helpless across the bulging shoulders of the brute  he knew then that little meriem was his worldhis sun his moon his starswith her going had gone all light and warmth and happiness  a groan escaped his lips and after that a series of hideous roars more bestial than the beasts as he dropped plummetlike in mad descent toward the perpetrator of this hideous crime  the bull ape turned at the first note of this new and menacing voice and as he turned a new flame was added to the rage and hatred of the killer for he saw that the creature before him was none other than the king ape which had driven him away from the great anthropoids to whom he had looked for friendship and asylum  dropping the body of the girl to the ground the bull turned to battle anew for possession of his expensive prize but this time he looked for an easy conquest  he too recognized korak  had he not chased him away from the amphitheater without even having to lay a fang or paw upon him  with lowered head and bulging shoulders he rushed headlong for the smoothskinned creature who was daring to question his right to his prey  they met head on like two charging bulls to go down together tearing and striking  korak forgot his knife  rage and bloodlust such as his could be satisfied only by the feel of hot flesh between rending fangs by the gush of new life blood against his bare skin for though he did not realize it korak the killer was fighting for something more compelling than hate or revengehe was a great male fighting another male for a she of his own kind  so impetuous was the attack of the manape that he found his hold before the anthropoid could prevent hima savage hold with strong jaws closed upon a pulsing jugular and there he clung with closed eyes while his fingers sought another hold upon the shaggy throat  it was then that meriem opened her eyes  at the sight before her they went wide  korak she cried  korak  my korak  i knew that you would come kill him korak  kill him  and with flashing eyes and heaving bosom the girl coming to her feet ran to koraks side to encourage him nearby lay the killers spear where he had flung it as he charged the ape  the girl saw it and snatched it up  no faintness overcame her in the face of this battle primeval at her feet  for her there was no hysterical reaction from the nerve strain of her own personal encounter with the bull  she was excited but cool and entirely unafraid  her korak was battling with another mangani that would have stolen her but she did not seek the safety of an overhanging bough there to watch the battle from afar as would a she mangani  instead she placed the point of koraks spear against the bull apes side and plunged the sharp point deep into the savage heart  korak had not needed her aid for the great bull had been already as good as dead with the blood gushing from his torn jugular but korak rose smiling with a word of approbation for his helper  how tall and fine she was  had she changed suddenly within the few hours of his absence or had his battle with the ape affected his vision  he might have been looking at meriem through new eyes for the many startling and wonderful surprises his gaze revealed  how long it had been since he had found her in her fathers village a little arab girl he did not know for time is of no import in the jungle and so he had kept no track of the passing days  but he realized as he looked upon her now that she was no longer such a little girl as he had first seen playing with geeka beneath the great tree just within the palisade  the change must have been very gradual to have eluded his notice until now  and what was it that had caused him to realize it so suddenly  his gaze wandered from the girl to the body of the dead bull  for the first time there flashed to his understanding the explanation of the reason for the girls attempted abduction  koraks eyes went wide and then they closed to narrow slits of rage as he stood glaring down upon the abysmal brute at his feet  when next his glance rose to meriems face a slow flush suffused his own  now indeed was he looking upon her through new eyesthe eyes of a man looking upon a maid  akut had come up just as meriem had speared koraks antagonist  the exultation of the old ape was keen  he strutted stifflegged and truculent about the body of the fallen enemy  he growled and upcurved his long flexible lip  his hair bristled  he was paying no attention to meriem and korak  back in the uttermost recesses of his little brain something was stirringsomething which the sight and smell of the great bull had aroused  the outward manifestation of the germinating idea was one of bestial rage but the inner sensations were pleasurable in the extreme  the scent of the great bull and the sight of his huge and hairy figure had wakened in the heart of akut a longing for the companionship of his own kind  so korak was not alone undergoing a change  and meriem  she was a woman  it is womans divine right to love always she had loved korak  he was her big brother  meriem alone underwent no change  she was still happy in the companionship of her korak  she still loved himas a sister loves an indulgent brotherand she was very very proud of him  in all the jungle there was no other creature so strong so handsome or so brave  korak came close to her  there was a new light in his eyes as she looked up into them but she did not understand it  she did not realize how close they were to maturity nor aught of all the difference in their lives the look in koraks eyes might mean  meriem he whispered and his voice was husky as he laid a brown hand upon her bare shoulder  meriem  suddenly he crushed her to him she looked up into his face laughing and then he bent and kissed her full upon the mouth  even then she did not understand  she did not recall ever having been kissed before  it was very nice  meriem liked it  she thought it was koraks way of showing how glad he was that the great ape had not succeeded in running away with her  she was glad too so she put her arms about the killers neck and kissed him again and again  then discovering the doll in his belt she transferred it to her own possession kissing it as she had kissed korak  korak wanted her to say something  he wanted to tell her how he loved her but the emotion of his love choked him and the vocabulary of the mangani was limited  there came a sudden interruption  it was from akuta sudden low growl no louder than those he had been giving vent to the while he pranced about the dead bull nor half so loud in fact but of a timbre that bore straight to the perceptive faculties of the jungle beast ingrained in korak  it was a warning  korak looked quickly up from the glorious vision of the sweet face so close to his  now his other faculties awoke  his ears his nostrils were on the alert  something was coming  the killer moved to akuts side  meriem was just behind them  the three stood like carved statues gazing into the leafy tangle of the jungle  the noise that had attracted their attention increased and presently a great ape broke through the underbrush a few paces from where they stood  the beast halted at sight of them  he gave a warning grunt back over his shoulder and a moment later coming cautiously another bull appeared  he was followed by othersboth bulls and females with young until two score hairy monsters stood glaring at the three  it was the tribe of the dead king ape  akut was the first to speak  he pointed to the body of the dead bull  korak mighty fighter has killed your king he grunted  there is none greater in all the jungle than korak son of tarzan  now korak is king  what bull is greater than korak  it was a challenge to any bull who might care to question koraks right to the kingship  the apes jabbered and chattered and growled among themselves for a time at last a young bull came slowly forward rocking upon his short legs bristling growling terrible  the beast was enormous and in the full prime of his strength  he belonged to that almost extinct species for which white men have long sought upon the information of the natives of the more inaccessible jungles  even the natives seldom see these great hairy primordial men  korak advanced to meet the monster  he too was growling  in his mind a plan was revolving  to close with this powerful untired brute after having just passed through a terrific battle with another of his kind would have been to tempt defeat  he must find an easier way to victory  crouching he prepared to meet the charge which he knew would soon come nor did he have long to wait  his antagonist paused only for sufficient time to permit him to recount for the edification of the audience and the confounding of korak a brief resume of his former victories of his prowess and of what he was about to do to this puny tarmangani  then he charged  with clutching fingers and wide opened jaws he came down upon the waiting korak with the speed of an express train  korak did not move until the great arms swung to embrace him then he dropped low beneath them swung a terrific right to the side of the beasts jaw as he sidestepped his rushing body and swinging quickly about stood ready over the fallen ape where he sprawled upon the ground  it was a surprised anthropoid that attempted to scramble to its feet froth flecked its hideous lips  red were the little eyes  blood curdling roars tumbled from the deep chest  but it did not reach its feet  the killer stood waiting above it and the moment that the hairy chin came upon the proper level another blow that would have felled an ox sent the ape over backward  again and again the beast struggled to arise but each time the mighty tarmangani stood waiting with ready fist and pile driver blow to bowl him over  weaker and weaker became the efforts of the bull  blood smeared his face and breast  a red stream trickled from nose and mouth  the crowd that had cheered him on at first with savage yells now jeered himtheir approbation was for the tarmangani  kagoda inquired korak as he sent the bull down once more  again the stubborn bull essayed to scramble to his feet  again the killer struck him a terrific blow  again he put the question kagodahave you had enough  for a moment the bull lay motionless  then from between battered lips came the single word kagoda  then rise and go back among your people said korak  i do not wish to be king among people who once drove me from them  keep your own ways and we will keep ours  when we meet we may be friends but we shall not live together  an old bull came slowly toward the killer  you have killed our king he said  you have defeated him who would have been king  you could have killed him had you wished  what shall we do for a king  korak turned toward akut  there is your king he said  but akut did not want to be separated from korak although he was anxious enough to remain with his own kind he wanted korak to remain too  he said as much  the youth was thinking of meriemof what would be best and safest for her  if akut went away with the apes there would be but one to watch over and protect her  on the other hand were they to join the tribe he would never feel safe to leave meriem behind when he went out to hunt for the passions of the apefolk are not ever well controlled  even a female might develop an insane hatred for the slender white girl and kill her during koraks absence  we will live near you he said at last  when you change your hunting ground we will change ours meriem and i and so remain near you but we shall not dwell among you  akut raised objections to this plan  he did not wish to be separated from korak  at first he refused to leave his human friend for the companionship of his own kind but when he saw the last of the tribe wandering off into the jungle again and his glance rested upon the lithe figure of the dead kings young mate as she cast admiring glances at her lords successor the call of blood would not be denied  with a farewell glance toward his beloved korak he turned and followed the she ape into the labyrinthine mazes of the wood   after korak had left the village of the blacks following his last thieving expedition the screams of his victim and those of the other women and children had brought the warriors in from the forest and the river  great was the excitement and hot was the rage of the men when they learned that the white devil had again entered their homes frightened their women and stolen arrows and ornaments and food  even their superstitious fear of this weird creature who hunted with a huge bull ape was overcome in their desire to wreak vengeance upon him and rid themselves for good and all of the menace of his presence in the jungle  and so it was that a score of the fleetest and most doughty warriors of the tribe set out in pursuit of korak and akut but a few minutes after they had left the scene of the killers many depredations  the youth and the ape had traveled slowly and with no precautions against a successful pursuit  nor was their attitude of careless indifference to the blacks at all remarkable  so many similar raids had gone unpunished that the two had come to look upon the negroes with contempt  the return journey led them straight up wind  the result being that the scent of their pursuers was borne away from them so they proceeded upon their way in total ignorance of the fact that tireless trackers but little less expert in the mysteries of woodcraft than themselves were dogging their trail with savage insistence  the little party of warriors was led by kovudoo the chief a middleaged savage of exceptional cunning and bravery  it was he who first came within sight of the quarry which they had followed for hours by the mysterious methods of their almost uncanny powers of observation intuition and even scent  kovudoo and his men came upon korak akut and meriem after the killing of the king ape the noise of the combat having led them at last straight to their quarry  the sight of the slender white girl had amazed the savage chief and held him gazing at the trio for a moment before ordering his warriors to rush out upon their prey  in that moment it was that the great apes came and again the blacks remained awestruck witnesses to the palaver and the battle between korak and the young bull  but now the apes had gone and the white youth and the white maid stood alone in the jungle  one of kovudoos men leaned close to the ear of his chief  look he whispered and pointed to something that dangled at the girls side  when my brother and i were slaves in the village of the sheik my brother made that thing for the sheiks little daughtershe played with it always and called it after my brother whose name is geeka  just before we escaped some one came and struck down the sheik stealing his daughter away  if this is she the sheik will pay you well for her return  koraks arm had again gone around the shoulders of meriem  love raced hot through his young veins  civilization was but a halfremembered statelondon as remote as ancient rome  in all the world there were but they twokorak the killer and meriem his mate  again he drew her close to him and covered her willing lips with his hot kisses  and then from behind him broke a hideous bedlam of savage war cries and a score of shrieking blacks were upon them  korak turned to give battle  meriem with her own light spear stood by his side  an avalanche of barbed missiles flew about them  one pierced koraks shoulder another his leg and he went down  meriem was unscathed for the blacks had intentionally spared her  now they rushed forward to finish korak and make good the girls capture but as they came there came also from another point in the jungle the great akut and at his heels the huge bulls of his new kingdom  snarling and roaring they rushed upon the black warriors when they saw the mischief they had already wrought  kovudoo realizing the danger of coming to close quarters with these mighty apemen seized meriem and called upon his warriors to retreat  for a time the apes followed them and several of the blacks were badly mauled and one killed before they succeeded in escaping  nor would they have gotten off thus easily had akut not been more concerned with the condition of the wounded korak than with the fate of the girl upon whom he had always looked as more or less of an interloper and an unquestioned burden  korak lay bleeding and unconscious when akut reached his side  the great ape tore the heavy spears from his flesh licked the wounds and then carried his friend to the lofty shelter that korak had constructed for meriem  further than this the brute could do nothing  nature must accomplish the rest unaided or korak must die  he did not die however  for days he lay helpless with fever while akut and the apes hunted close by that they might protect him from such birds and beasts as might reach his lofty retreat  occasionally akut brought him juicy fruits which helped to slake his thirst and allay his fever and little by little his powerful constitution overcame the effects of the spear thrusts  the wounds healed and his strength returned  all during his rational moments as he had lain upon the soft furs which lined meriems nest he had suffered more acutely from fears for meriem than from the pain of his own wounds  for her he must live for her he must regain his strength that he might set out in search of her  what had the blacks done to her  did she still live or had they sacrificed her to their lust for torture and human flesh  korak almost trembled with terror as the most hideous possibilities of the girls fate suggested themselves to him out of his knowledge of the customs of kovudoos tribe  the days dragged their weary lengths along but at last he had sufficiently regained his strength to crawl from the shelter and make his way unaided to the ground  now he lived more upon raw meat for which he was entirely dependent on akuts skill and generosity  with the meat diet his strength returned more rapidly and at last he felt that he was fit to undertake the journey to the village of the blacks     chapter 12   two tall bearded white men moved cautiously through the jungle from their camp beside a wide river  they were carl jenssen and sven malbihn but little altered in appearance since the day years before that they and their safari had been so badly frightened by korak and akut as the former sought haven with them  every year had they come into the jungle to trade with the natives or to rob them to hunt and trap or to guide other white men in the land they knew so well  always since their experience with the sheik had they operated at a safe distance from his territory  now they were closer to his village than they had been for years yet safe enough from discovery owing to the uninhabited nature of the intervening jungle and the fear and enmity of kovudoos people for the sheik who in time past had raided and all but exterminated the tribe  this year they had come to trap live specimens for a european zoological garden and today they were approaching a trap which they had set in the hope of capturing a specimen of the large baboons that frequented the neighborhood  as they approached the trap they became aware from the noises emanating from its vicinity that their efforts had been crowned with success  the barking and screaming of hundreds of baboons could mean naught else than that one or more of their number had fallen a victim to the allurements of the bait  the extreme caution of the two men was prompted by former experiences with the intelligent and doglike creatures with which they had to deal more than one trapper has lost his life in battle with enraged baboons who will hesitate to attack nothing upon one occasion while upon another a single gun shot will disperse hundreds of them  heretofore the swedes had always watched nearby their trap for as a rule only the stronger bulls are thus caught since in their greediness they prevent the weaker from approaching the covered bait and when once within the ordinary rude trap woven on the spot of interlaced branches they are able with the aid of their friends upon the outside to demolish their prison and escape  but in this instance the trappers had utilized a special steel cage which could withstand all the strength and cunning of a baboon  it was only necessary therefore to drive away the herd which they knew were surrounding the prison and wait for their boys who were even now following them to the trap  as they came within sight of the spot they found conditions precisely as they had expected  a large male was battering frantically against the steel wires of the cage that held him captive  upon the outside several hundred other baboons were tearing and tugging in his aid and all were roaring and jabbering and barking at the top of their lungs  but what neither the swedes nor the baboons saw was the halfnaked figure of a youth hidden in the foliage of a nearby tree  he had come upon the scene at almost the same instant as jenssen and malbihn and was watching the activities of the baboons with every mark of interest  koraks relations with the baboons had never been over friendly  a species of armed toleration had marked their occasional meetings  the baboons and akut had walked stiff legged and growling past one another while korak had maintained a bared fang neutrality  so now he was not greatly disturbed by the predicament of their king  curiosity prompted him to tarry a moment and in that moment his quick eyes caught the unfamiliar coloration of the clothing of the two swedes behind a bush not far from him  now he was all alertness  who were these interlopers  what was their business in the jungle of the mangani korak slunk noiselessly around them to a point where he might get their scent as well as a better view of them and scarce had he done so when he recognized themthey were the men who had fired upon him years before  his eyes blazed  he could feel the hairs upon his scalp stiffen at the roots  he watched them with the intentness of a panther about to spring upon its prey  he saw them rise and shouting attempt to frighten away the baboons as they approached the cage  then one of them raised his rifle and fired into the midst of the surprised and angry herd  for an instant korak thought that the baboons were about to charge but two more shots from the rifles of the white men sent them scampering into the trees  then the two europeans advanced upon the cage  korak thought that they were going to kill the king  he cared nothing for the king but he cared less for the two white men  the king had never attempted to kill himthe white men had  the king was a denizen of his own beloved junglethe white men were aliens  his loyalty therefore was to the baboon against the human  he could speak the language of the baboonit was identical to that of the great apes  across the clearing he saw the jabbering horde watching  raising his voice he shouted to them  the white men turned at the sound of this new factor behind them  they thought it was another baboon that had circled them but though they searched the trees with their eyes they saw nothing of the now silent figure hidden by the foliage  again korak shouted  i am the killer he cried  these men are my enemies and yours  i will help you free your king  run out upon the strangers when you see me do so and together we will drive them away and free your king  and from the baboons came a great chorus  we will do what you say korak  dropping from his tree korak ran toward the two swedes and at the same instant three hundred baboons followed his example  at sight of the strange apparition of the halfnaked white warrior rushing upon them with uplifted spear jenssen and malbihn raised their rifles and fired at korak but in the excitement both missed and a moment later the baboons were upon them  now their only hope of safety lay in escape and dodging here and there fighting off the great beasts that leaped upon their backs they ran into the jungle  even then they would have died but for the coming of their men whom they met a couple of hundred yards from the cage  once the white men had turned in flight korak gave them no further attention turning instead to the imprisoned baboon  the fastenings of the door that had eluded the mental powers of the baboons yielded their secret immediately to the human intelligence of the killer and a moment later the king baboon stepped forth to liberty  he wasted no breath in thanks to korak nor did the young man expect thanks  he knew that none of the baboons would ever forget his service though as a matter of fact he did not care if they did  what he had done had been prompted by a desire to be revenged upon the two white men  the baboons could never be of service to him  now they were racing in the direction of the battle that was being waged between their fellows and the followers of the two swedes and as the din of battle subsided in the distance korak turned and resumed his journey toward the village of kovudoo  on the way he came upon a herd of elephants standing in an open forest glade  here the trees were too far apart to permit korak to travel through the branchesa trail he much preferred not only because of its freedom from dense underbrush and the wider field of vision it gave him but from pride in his arboreal ability  it was exhilarating to swing from tree to tree to test the prowess of his mighty muscles to reap the pleasurable fruits of his hard won agility  korak joyed in the thrills of the highflung upper terraces of the great forest where unhampered and unhindered he might laugh down upon the great brutes who must keep forever to the darkness and the gloom of the musty soil  but here in this open glade where tantor flapped his giant ears and swayed his huge bulk from side to side the apeman must pass along the surface of the grounda pygmy amongst giants  a great bull raised his trunk to rattle a low warning as he sensed the coming of an intruder his weak eyes roved hither and thither but it was his keen scent and acute hearing which first located the apeman  the herd moved restlessly prepared for fight for the old bull had caught the scent of man  peace tantor called the killer  it is i korak tarmangani  the bull lowered his trunk and the herd resumed their interrupted meditations  korak passed within a foot of the great bull  a sinuous trunk undulated toward him touching his brown hide in a half caress korak slapped the great shoulder affectionately as he went by  for years he had been upon good terms with tantor and his people  of all the jungle folk he loved best the mighty pachydermthe most peaceful and at the same time the most terrible of them all  the gentle gazelle feared him not yet numa lord of the jungle gave him a wide berth among the younger bulls the cows and the calves korak wound his way now and then another trunk would run out to touch him and once a playful calf grasped his legs and upset him  the afternoon was almost spent when korak arrived at the village of kovudoo  there were many natives lolling in shady spots beside the conical huts or beneath the branches of the several trees which had been left standing within the enclosure  warriors were in evidence upon hand  it was not a good time for a lone enemy to prosecute a search through the village  korak determined to await the coming of darkness  he was a match for many warriors but he could not unaided overcome an entire tribenot even for his beloved meriem  while he waited among the branches and foliage of a nearby tree he searched the village constantly with his keen eyes and twice he circled it sniffing the vagrant breezes which puffed erratically from first one point of the compass and then another  among the various stenches peculiar to a native village the apemans sensitive nostrils were finally rewarded by cognizance of the delicate aroma which marked the presence of her he sought  meriem was therein one of those huts but which one he could not know without closer investigation and so he waited with the dogged patience of a beast of prey until night had fallen  the camp fires of the blacks dotted the gloom with little points of light casting their feeble rays in tiny circles of luminosity that brought into glistening relief the naked bodies of those who lay or squatted about them  it was then that korak slid silently from the tree that had hidden him and dropped lightly to the ground within the enclosure  keeping well in the shadows of the huts he commenced a systematic search of the villageears eyes and nose constantly upon the alert for the first intimation of the near presence of meriem  his progress must of necessity be slow since not even the keeneared curs of the savages must guess the presence of a stranger within the gates  how close he came to a detection on several occasions the killer well knew from the restless whining of several of them  it was not until he reached the back of a hut at the head of the wide village street that korak caught again plainly the scent of meriem with nose close to the thatched wall korak sniffed eagerly about the structuretense and palpitant as a hunting hound  toward the front and the door he made his way when once his nose had assured him that meriem lay within but as he rounded the side and came within view of the entrance he saw a burly negro armed with a long spear squatting at the portal of the girls prison  the fellows back was toward him his figure outlined against the glow of cooking fires further down the street  he was alone  the nearest of his fellows were beside a fire sixty or seventy feet beyond  to enter the hut korak must either silence the sentry or pass him unnoticed  the danger in the accomplishment of the former alternative lay in the practical certainty of alarming the warriors near by and bringing them and the balance of the village down upon him  to achieve the latter appeared practically impossible  to you or me it would have been impossible but korak the killer was not as you or i  there was a good twelve inches of space between the broad back of the black and the frame of the doorway  could korak pass through behind the savage warrior without detection  the light that fell upon the glistening ebony of the sentrys black skin fell also upon the light brown of koraks  should one of the many further down the street chance to look long in this direction they must surely note the tall lightcolored moving figure but korak depended upon their interest in their own gossip to hold their attention fast where it already lay and upon the firelight near them to prevent them seeing too plainly at a distance into the darkness at the village end where his work lay  flattened against the side of the hut yet not arousing a single warning rustle from its dried thatching the killer came closer and closer to the watcher  now he was at his shoulder  now he had wormed his sinuous way behind him  he could feel the heat of the naked body against his knees  he could hear the man breathe  he marveled that the dullwitted creature had not long since been alarmed but the fellow sat there as ignorant of the presence of another as though that other had not existed  korak moved scarcely more than an inch at a time then he would stand motionless for a moment  thus was he worming his way behind the guard when the latter straightened up opened his cavernous mouth in a wide yawn and stretched his arms above his head  korak stood rigid as stone  another step and he would be within the hut  the black lowered his arms and relaxed  behind him was the frame work of the doorway often before had it supported his sleepy head and now he leaned back to enjoy the forbidden pleasure of a cat nap  but instead of the door frame his head and shoulders came in contact with the warm flesh of a pair of living legs  the exclamation of surprise that almost burst from his lips was throttled in his throat by steelthewed fingers that closed about his windpipe with the suddenness of thought  the black struggled to ariseto turn upon the creature that had seized himto wriggle from its hold but all to no purpose as he had been held in a mighty vise of iron he could not move  he could not scream those awful fingers at his throat but closed more and more tightly  his eyes bulged from their sockets  his face turned an ashy blue  presently he relaxed once morethis time in the final dissolution from which there is no quickening  korak propped the dead body against the door frame  there it sat lifelike in the gloom then the apeman turned and glided into the stygian darkness of the huts interior  meriem he whispered  korak  my korak came an answering cry subdued by fear of alarming her captors and half stifled by a sob of joyful welcome  the youth knelt and cut the bonds that held the girls wrists and ankles  a moment later he had lifted her to her feet and grasping her by the hand led her towards the entrance  outside the grim sentinel of death kept his grisly vigil  sniffing at his dead feet whined a mangy native cur  at sight of the two emerging from the hut the beast gave an ugly snarl and an instant later as it caught the scent of the strange white man it raised a series of excited yelps  instantly the warriors at the nearby fire were attracted  they turned their heads in the direction of the commotion  it was impossible that they should fail to see the white skins of the fugitives  korak slunk quickly into the shadows at the huts side drawing meriem with him but he was too late  the blacks had seen enough to arouse their suspicions and a dozen of them were now running to investigate the yapping cur was still at koraks heels leading the searchers unerringly in pursuit  the youth struck viciously at the brute with his long spear but long accustomed to dodging blows the wily creature made a most uncertain target  other blacks had been alarmed by the running and shouting of their companions and now the entire population of the village was swarming up the street to assist in the search  their first discovery was the dead body of the sentry and a moment later one of the bravest of them had entered the hut and discovered the absence of the prisoner  these startling announcements filled the blacks with a combination of terror and rage but seeing no foe in evidence they were enabled to permit their rage to get the better of their terror and so the leaders pushed on by those behind them ran rapidly around the hut in the direction of the yapping of the mangy cur  here they found a single white warrior making away with their captive and recognizing him as the author of numerous raids and indignities and believing that they had him cornered and at a disadvantage they charged savagely upon him  korak seeing that they were discovered lifted meriem to his shoulders and ran for the tree which would give them egress from the village  he was handicapped in his flight by the weight of the girl whose legs would but scarce bear her weight to say nothing of maintaining her in rapid flight for the tightly drawn bonds that had been about her ankles for so long had stopped circulation and partially paralyzed her extremities  had this not been the case the escape of the two would have been a feat of little moment since meriem was scarcely a whit less agile than korak and fully as much at home in the trees as he  but with the girl on his shoulder korak could not both run and fight to advantage and the result was that before he had covered half the distance to the tree a score of native curs attracted by the yelping of their mate and the yells and shouts of their masters had closed in upon the fleeing white man snapping at his legs and at last succeeding in tripping him  as he went down the hyenalike brutes were upon him and as he struggled to his feet the blacks closed in  a couple of them seized the clawing biting meriem and subdued hera blow upon the head was sufficient  for the apeman they found more drastic measures would be necessary  weighted down as he was by dogs and warriors he still managed to struggle to his feet  to right and left he swung crushing blows to the faces of his human antagoniststo the dogs he paid not the slightest attention other than to seize the more persistent and wring their necks with a single quick movement of the wrist  a knob stick aimed at him by an ebon hercules he caught and wrested from his antagonist and then the blacks experienced to the full the possibilities for punishment that lay within those smooth flowing muscles beneath the velvet brown skin of the strange white giant  he rushed among them with all the force and ferocity of a bull elephant gone mad  hither and thither he charged striking down the few who had the temerity to stand against him and it was evident that unless a chance spear thrust brought him down he would rout the entire village and regain his prize  but old kovudoo was not to be so easily robbed of the ransom which the girl represented and seeing that their attack which had up to now resulted in a series of individual combats with the white warrior he called his tribesmen off and forming them in a compact body about the girl and the two who watched over her bid them do nothing more than repel the assaults of the apeman  again and again korak rushed against this human barricade bristling with spear points  again and again he was repulsed often with severe wounds to caution him to greater wariness  from head to foot he was red with his own blood and at last weakening from the loss of it he came to the bitter realization that alone he could do no more to succor his meriem  presently an idea flashed through his brain  he called aloud to the girl  she had regained consciousness now and replied  korak goes he shouted but he will return and take you from the gomangani  goodbye my meriem  korak will come for you again  goodbye cried the girl  meriem will look for you until you come  like a flash and before they could know his intention or prevent him korak wheeled raced across the village and with a single leap disappeared into the foliage of the great tree that was his highroad to the village of kovudoo  a shower of spears followed him but their only harvest was a taunting laugh flung back from out the darkness of the jungle     chapter 13   meriem again bound and under heavy guard in kovudoos own hut saw the night pass and the new day come without bringing the momentarily looked for return of korak  she had no doubt but that he would come back and less still that he would easily free her from her captivity  to her korak was little short of omnipotent  he embodied for her all that was finest and strongest and best in her savage world  she gloried in his prowess and worshipped him for the tender thoughtfulness that always had marked his treatment of her  no other within the ken of her memory had ever accorded her the love and gentleness that was his daily offering to her  most of the gentler attributes of his early childhood had long since been forgotten in the fierce battle for existence which the customs of the mysterious jungle had forced upon him  he was more often savage and bloodthirsty than tender and kindly  his other friends of the wild looked for no gentle tokens of his affection  that he would hunt with them and fight for them was sufficient  if he growled and showed his fighting fangs when they trespassed upon his inalienable rights to the fruits of his kills they felt no anger toward himonly greater respect for the efficient and the fitfor him who could not only kill but protect the flesh of his kill  but toward meriem he always had shown more of his human side  he killed primarily for her  it was to the feet of meriem that he brought the fruits of his labors  it was for meriem more than for himself that he squatted beside his flesh and growled ominously at whosoever dared sniff too closely to it  when he was cold in the dark days of rain or thirsty in a prolonged drouth his discomfort engendered first of all thoughts of meriems welfareafter she had been made warm after her thirst had been slaked then he turned to the affair of ministering to his own wants  the softest skins fell gracefully from the graceful shoulders of his meriem  the sweetestscented grasses lined her bower where other soft furry pelts made hers the downiest couch in all the jungle  what wonder then that meriem loved her korak  but she loved him as a little sister might love a big brother who was very good to her  as yet she knew naught of the love of a maid for a man  so now as she lay waiting for him she dreamed of him and of all that he meant to her  she compared him with the sheik her father and at thought of the stern grizzled old arab she shuddered  even the savage blacks had been less harsh to her than he  not understanding their tongue she could not guess what purpose they had in keeping her a prisoner  she knew that man ate man and she had expected to be eaten but she had been with them for some time now and no harm had befallen her  she did not know that a runner had been dispatched to the distant village of the sheik to barter with him for a ransom  she did not know nor did kovudoo that the runner had never reached his destinationthat he had fallen in with the safari of jenssen and malbihn and with the talkativeness of a native to other natives had unfolded his whole mission to the black servants of the two swedes these had not been long in retailing the matter to their masters and the result was that when the runner left their camp to continue his journey he had scarce passed from sight before there came the report of a rifle and he rolled lifeless into the underbrush with a bullet in his back  a few moments later malbihn strolled back into the encampment where he went to some pains to let it be known that he had had a shot at a fine buck and missed  the swedes knew that their men hated them and that an overt act against kovudoo would quickly be carried to the chief at the first opportunity  nor were they sufficiently strong in either guns or loyal followers to risk antagonizing the wily old chief  following this episode came the encounter with the baboons and the strange white savage who had allied himself with the beasts against the humans  only by dint of masterful maneuvering and the expenditure of much power had the swedes been able to repulse the infuriated apes and even for hours afterward their camp was constantly besieged by hundreds of snarling screaming devils  the swedes rifles in hand repelled numerous savage charges which lacked only efficient leadership to have rendered them as effective in results as they were terrifying in appearance  time and time again the two men thought they saw the smoothskinned body of the wild apeman moving among the baboons in the forest and the belief that he might head a charge upon them proved most disquieting  they would have given much for a clean shot at him for to him they attributed the loss of their specimen and the ugly attitude of the baboons toward them  the fellow must be the same we fired on several years ago said malbihn  that time he was accompanied by a gorilla  did you get a good look at him carl  yes replied jenssen  he was not five paces from me when i fired at him  he appears to be an intelligent looking europeanand not much more than a lad  there is nothing of the imbecile or degenerate in his features or expression as is usually true in similar cases where some lunatic escapes into the woods and by living in filth and nakedness wins the title of wild man among the peasants of the neighborhood  no this fellow is of different stuffand so infinitely more to be feared as much as i should like a shot at him i hope he stays away  should he ever deliberately lead a charge against us i wouldnt give much for our chances if we happened to fail to bag him at the first rush  but the white giant did not appear again to lead the baboons against them and finally the angry brutes themselves wandered off into the jungle leaving the frightened safari in peace  the next day the swedes set out for kovudoos village bent on securing possession of the person of the white girl whom kovudoos runner had told them lay captive in the chiefs village  how they were to accomplish their end they did not know  force was out of the question though they would not have hesitated to use it had they possessed it in former years they had marched rough shod over enormous areas taking toll by brute force even when kindliness or diplomacy would have accomplished more but now they were in bad straitsso bad that they had shown their true colors scarce twice in a year and then only when they came upon an isolated village weak in numbers and poor in courage  kovudoo was not as these and though his village was in a way remote from the more populous district to the north his power was such that he maintained an acknowledged suzerainty over the thin thread of villages which connected him with the savage lords to the north  to have antagonized him would have spelled ruin for the swedes  it would have meant that they might never reach civilization by the northern route to the west the village of the sheik lay directly in their path barring them effectually  to the east the trail was unknown to them and to the south there was no trail  so the two swedes approached the village of kovudoo with friendly words upon their tongues and deep craft in their hearts  their plans were well made  there was no mention of the white prisonerthey chose to pretend that they were not aware that kovudoo had a white prisoner  they exchanged gifts with the old chief haggling with his plenipotentiaries over the value of what they were to receive for what they gave as is customary and proper when one has no ulterior motives  unwarranted generosity would have aroused suspicion  during the palaver which followed they retailed the gossip of the villages through which they had passed receiving in exchange such news as kovudoo possessed  the palaver was long and tiresome as these native ceremonies always are to europeans  kovudoo made no mention of his prisoner and from his generous offers of guides and presents seemed anxious to assure himself of the speedy departure of his guests  it was malbihn who quite casually near the close of their talk mentioned the fact that the sheik was dead  kovudoo evinced interest and surprise  you did not know it asked malbihn  that is strange  it was during the last moon  he fell from his horse when the beast stepped in a hole  the horse fell upon him  when his men came up the sheik was quite dead  kovudoo scratched his head  he was much disappointed  no sheik meant no ransom for the white girl  now she was worthless unless he utilized her for a feast ora mate  the latter thought aroused him he spat at a small beetle crawling through the dust before him  he eyed malbihn appraisingly  these white men were peculiar  they traveled far from their own villages without women  yet he knew they cared for women  but how much did they care for themthat was the question that disturbed kovudoo  i know where there is a white girl he said unexpectedly  if you wish to buy her she may be had cheap  malbihn shrugged  we have troubles enough kovudoo he said without burdening ourselves with an old shehyena and as for paying for one  malbihn snapped his fingers in derision  she is young said kovudoo and good looking  the swedes laughed  there are no good looking white women in the jungle kovudoo said jenssen  you should be ashamed to try to make fun of old friends  kovudoo sprang to his feet  come he said i will show you that she is all i say  malbihn and jenssen rose to follow him and as they did so their eyes met and malbihn slowly drooped one of his lids in a sly wink together they followed kovudoo toward his hut  in the dim interior they discerned the figure of a woman lying bound upon a sleeping mat  malbihn took a single glance and turned away  she must be a thousand years old kovudoo he said as he left the hut  she is young cried the savage  it is dark in here  you cannot see  wait i will have her brought out into the sunlight and he commanded the two warriors who watched the girl to cut the bonds from her ankles and lead her forth for inspection  malbihn and jenssen evinced no eagerness though both were fairly bursting with itnot to see the girl but to obtain possession of her they cared not if she had the face of a marmoset or the figure of potbellied kovudoo himself  all that they wished to know was that she was the girl who had been stolen from the sheik several years before they thought that they would recognize her for such if she was indeed the same but even so the testimony of the runner kovudoo had sent to the sheik was such as to assure them that the girl was the one they had once before attempted to abduct  as meriem was brought forth from the darkness of the huts interior the two men turned with every appearance of disinterestedness to glance at her  it was with difficulty that malbihn suppressed an ejaculation of astonishment  the girls beauty fairly took his breath from him but instantly he recovered his poise and turned to kovudoo  well he said to the old chief  is she not both young and good looking asked kovudoo  she is not old replied malbihn but even so she will be a burden we did not come from the north after wivesthere are more than enough there for us  meriem stood looking straight at the white men  she expected nothing from themthey were to her as much enemies as the black men  she hated and feared them all  malbihn spoke to her in arabic  we are friends he said  would you like to have us take you away from here  slowly and dimly as though from a great distance recollection of the once familiar tongue returned to her  i should like to go free she said and go back to korak  you would like to go with us persisted malbihn  no said meriem  malbihn turned to kovudoo  she does not wish to go with us he said  you are men returned the black  can you not take her by force  it would only add to our troubles replied the swede  no kovudoo we do not wish her though if you wish to be rid of her we will take her away because of our friendship for you  now kovudoo knew that he had made a sale  they wanted her  so he commenced to bargain and in the end the person of meriem passed from the possession of the black chieftain into that of the two swedes in consideration of six yards of amerikan three empty brass cartridge shells and a shiny new jack knife from new jersey  and all but meriem were more than pleased with the bargain  kovudoo stipulated but a single condition and that was that the europeans were to leave his village and take the girl with them as early the next morning as they could get started  after the sale was consummated he did not hesitate to explain his reasons for this demand he told them of the strenuous attempt of the girls savage mate to rescue her and suggested that the sooner they got her out of the country the more likely they were to retain possession of her  meriem was again bound and placed under guard but this time in the tent of the swedes  malbihn talked to her trying to persuade her to accompany them willingly  he told her that they would return her to her own village but when he discovered that she would rather die than go back to the old sheik he assured her that they would not take her there nor as a matter of fact had they had an intention of so doing as he talked with the girl the swede feasted his eyes upon the beautiful lines of her face and figure  she had grown tall and straight and slender toward maturity since he had seen her in the sheiks village on that long gone day  for years she had represented to him a certain fabulous reward  in his thoughts she had been but the personification of the pleasures and luxuries that many francs would purchase  now as she stood before him pulsing with life and loveliness she suggested other seductive and alluring possibilities  he came closer to her and laid his hand upon her  the girl shrank from him he seized her and she struck him heavily in the mouth as he sought to kiss her  then jenssen entered the tent  malbihn he almost shouted  you fool  sven malbihn released his hold upon the girl and turned toward his companion  his face was red with mortification  what the devil are you trying to do growled jenssen  would you throw away every chance for the reward  if we maltreat her we not only couldnt collect a sou but theyd send us to prison for our pains  i thought you had more sense malbihn  im not a wooden man growled malbihn  youd better be rejoined jenssen at least until we have delivered her over in safety and collected what will be coming to us  oh hell cried malbihn  whats the use  theyll be glad enough to have her back and by the time we get there with her shell be only too glad to keep her mouth shut  why not  because i say not growled jenssen  ive always let you boss things sven but heres a case where what i say has got to gobecause im right and youre wrong and we both know it  youre getting damned virtuous all of a sudden growled malbihn perhaps you think i have forgotten about the inn keepers daughter and little celella and that nigger at  shut up snapped jenssen  its not a matter of virtue and you are as well aware of that as i  i dont want to quarrel with you but so help me god sven youre not going to harm this girl if i have to kill you to prevent it  ive suffered and slaved and been nearly killed forty times in the last nine or ten years trying to accomplish what luck has thrown at our feet at last and now im not going to be robbed of the fruits of success because you happen to be more of a beast than a man  again i warn you sven and he tapped the revolver that swung in its holster at his hip  malbihn gave his friend an ugly look shrugged his shoulders and left the tent  jenssen turned to meriem  if he bothers you again call me he said  i shall always be near  the girl had not understood the conversation that had been carried on by her two owners for it had been in swedish but what jenssen had just said to her in arabic she understood and from it grasped an excellent idea of what had passed between the two  the expressions upon their faces their gestures and jenssens final tapping of his revolver before malbihn had left the tent had all been eloquent of the seriousness of their altercation  now toward jenssen she looked for friendship and with the innocence of youth she threw herself upon his mercy begging him to set her free that she might return to korak and her jungle life but she was doomed to another disappointment for the man only laughed at her roughly and told her that if she tried to escape she would be punished by the very thing that he had just saved her from  all that night she lay listening for a signal from korak  all about the jungle life moved through the darkness  to her sensitive ears came sounds that the others in the camp could not hearsounds that she interpreted as we might interpret the speech of a friend but not once came a single note that reflected the presence of korak  but she knew that he would come  nothing short of death itself could prevent her korak from returning for her  what delayed him though  when morning came again and the night had brought no succoring korak meriems faith and loyalty were still unshaken though misgivings began to assail her as to the safety of her friend  it seemed unbelievable that serious mishap could have overtaken her wonderful korak who daily passed unscathed through all the terrors of the jungle  yet morning came the morning meal was eaten the camp broken and the disreputable safari of the swedes was on the move northward with still no sign of the rescue the girl momentarily expected  all that day they marched and the next and the next nor did korak even so much as show himself to the patient little waiter moving silently and stately beside her hard captors  malbihn remained scowling and angry  he replied to jenssens friendly advances in curt monosyllables  to meriem he did not speak but on several occasions she discovered him glaring at her from beneath half closed lidsgreedily  the look sent a shudder through her  she hugged geeka closer to her breast and doubly regretted the knife that they had taken from her when she was captured by kovudoo  it was on the fourth day that meriem began definitely to give up hope something had happened to korak  she knew it  he would never come now and these men would take her far away  presently they would kill her  she would never see her korak again  on this day the swedes rested for they had marched rapidly and their men were tired  malbihn and jenssen had gone from camp to hunt taking different directions  they had been gone about an hour when the door of meriems tent was lifted and malbihn entered  the look of a beast was on his face     chapter 14   with wide eyes fixed upon him like a trapped creature horrified beneath the mesmeric gaze of a great serpent the girl watched the approach of the man  her hands were free the swedes having secured her with a length of ancient slave chain fastened at one end to an iron collar padlocked about her neck and at the other to a long stake driven deep into the ground  slowly meriem shrank inch by inch toward the opposite end of the tent malbihn followed her  his hands were extended and his fingers halfopenedclawliketo seize her  his lips were parted and his breath came quickly pantingly  the girl recalled jenssens instructions to call him should malbihn molest her but jenssen had gone into the jungle to hunt  malbihn had chosen his time well  yet she screamed loud and shrill once twice a third time before malbihn could leap across the tent and throttle her alarming cries with his brute fingers  then she fought him as any jungle she might fight with tooth and nail  the man found her no easy prey  in that slender young body beneath the rounded curves and the fine soft skin lay the muscles of a young lioness  but malbihn was no weakling  his character and appearance were brutal nor did they belie his brawn  he was of giant stature and of giant strength slowly he forced the girl back upon the ground striking her in the face when she hurt him badly either with teeth or nails  meriem struck back but she was growing weaker from the choking fingers at her throat  out in the jungle jenssen had brought down two bucks  his hunting had not carried him far afield nor was he prone to permit it to do so  he was suspicious of malbihn  the very fact that his companion had refused to accompany him and elected instead to hunt alone in another direction would not under ordinary circumstances have seemed fraught with sinister suggestion but jenssen knew malbihn well and so having secured meat he turned immediately back toward camp while his boys brought in his kill  he had covered about half the return journey when a scream came faintly to his ears from the direction of camp  he halted to listen  it was repeated twice  then silence  with a muttered curse jenssen broke into a rapid run  he wondered if he would be too late  what a fool malbihn was indeed to thus chance jeopardizing a fortune  further away from camp than jenssen and upon the opposite side another heard meriems screamsa stranger who was not even aware of the proximity of white men other than himselfa hunter with a handful of sleek black warriors  he too listened intently for a moment  that the voice was that of a woman in distress he could not doubt and so he also hastened at a run in the direction of the affrighted voice but he was much further away than jenssen so that the latter reached the tent first  what the swede found there roused no pity within his calloused heart only anger against his fellow scoundrel  meriem was still fighting off her attacker  malbihn still was showering blows upon her jenssen streaming foul curses upon his erstwhile friend burst into the tent  malbihn interrupted dropped his victim and turned to meet jenssens infuriated charge  he whipped a revolver from his hip jenssen anticipating the lightning move of the others hand drew almost simultaneously and both men fired at once  jenssen was still moving toward malbihn at the time but at the flash of the explosion he stopped  his revolver dropped from nerveless fingers  for a moment he staggered drunkenly  deliberately malbihn put two more bullets into his friends body at close range  even in the midst of the excitement and her terror meriem found herself wondering at the tenacity of life which the hit man displayed  his eyes were closed his head dropped forward upon his breast his hands hung limply before him  yet still he stood there upon his feet though he reeled horribly  it was not until the third bullet had found its mark within his body that he lunged forward upon his face  then malbihn approached him and with an oath kicked him viciously  then he returned once more to meriem again he seized her and at the same instant the flaps of the tent opened silently and a tall white man stood in the aperture  neither meriem or malbihn saw the newcomer  the latters back was toward him while his body hid the stranger from meriems eyes  he crossed the tent quickly stepping over jenssens body  the first intimation malbihn had that he was not to carry out his design without further interruption was a heavy hand upon his shoulder  he wheeled to face an utter strangera tall blackhaired grayeyed stranger clad in khaki and pith helmet  malbihn reached for his gun again but another hand had been quicker than his and he saw the weapon tossed to the ground at the side of the tentout of reach  what is the meaning of this the stranger addressed his question to meriem in a tongue she did not understand  she shook her head and spoke in arabic  instantly the man changed his question to that language  these men are taking me away from korak explained the girl  this one would have harmed me  the other whom he had just killed tried to stop him  they were both very bad men but this one is the worse  if my korak were here he would kill him  i suppose you are like them so you will not kill him  the stranger smiled  he deserves killing he said  there is no doubt of that  once i should have killed him but not now  i will see though that he does not bother you any more  he was holding malbihn in a grasp the giant swede could not break though he struggled to do so and he was holding him as easily as malbihn might have held a little child yet malbihn was a huge man mightily thewed  the swede began to rage and curse  he struck at his captor only to be twisted about and held at arms length  then he shouted to his boys to come and kill the stranger  in response a dozen strange blacks entered the tent  they too were powerful cleanlimbed men not at all like the mangy crew that followed the swedes  we have had enough foolishness said the stranger to malbihn  you deserve death but i am not the law  i know now who you are  i have heard of you before  you and your friend here bear a most unsavory reputation  we do not want you in our country  i shall let you go this time but should you ever return i shall take the law into my own hands  you understand  malbihn blustered and threatened finishing by applying a most uncomplimentary name to his captor  for this he received a shaking that rattled his teeth  those who know say that the most painful punishment that can be inflicted upon an adult male short of injuring him is a good old fashioned shaking  malbihn received such a shaking  now get out said the stranger and next time you see me remember who i am and he spoke a name in the swedes eara name that more effectually subdued the scoundrel than many beatingsthen he gave him a push that carried him bodily through the tent doorway to sprawl upon the turf beyond  now he said turning toward meriem who has the key to this thing about your neck  the girl pointed to jenssens body  he carried it always she said  the stranger searched the clothing on the corpse until he came upon the key  a moment more meriem was free  will you let me go back to my korak she asked  i will see that you are returned to your people he replied  who are they and where is their village  he had been eyeing her strange barbaric garmenture wonderingly  from her speech she was evidently an arab girl but he had never before seen one thus clothed  who are your people  who is korak he asked again  korak  why korak is an ape  i have no other people  korak and i live in the jungle alone since aht went to be king of the apes she had always thus pronounced akuts name for so it had sounded to her when first she came with korak and the ape  korak could have been kind but he would not  a questioning expression entered the strangers eyes  he looked at the girl closely  so korak is an ape he said  and what pray are you  i am meriem  i also am an ape  mm was the strangers only oral comment upon this startling announcement but what he thought might have been partially interpreted through the pitying light that entered his eyes  he approached the girl and started to lay his hand upon her forehead  she drew back with a savage little growl  a smile touched his lips  you need not fear me he said  i shall not harm you  i only wish to discover if you have feverif you are entirely well  if you are we will set forth in search of korak  meriem looked straight into the keen gray eyes  she must have found there an unquestionable assurance of the honorableness of their owner for she permitted him to lay his palm upon her forehead and feel her pulse  apparently she had no fever  how long have you been an ape asked the man  since i was a little girl many many years ago and korak came and took me from my father who was beating me  since then i have lived in the trees with korak and aht  where in the jungle lives korak asked the stranger  meriem pointed with a sweep of her hand that took in generously half the continent of africa  could you find your way back to him  i do not know she replied but he will find his way to me  then i have a plan said the stranger  i live but a few marches from here  i shall take you home where my wife will look after you and care for you until we can find korak or korak finds us  if he could find you here he can find you at my village  is it not so  meriem thought that it was so but she did not like the idea of not starting immediately back to meet korak  on the other hand the man had no intention of permitting this poor insane child to wander further amidst the dangers of the jungle  from whence she had come or what she had undergone he could not guess but that her korak and their life among the apes was but a figment of a disordered mind he could not doubt  he knew the jungle well and he knew that men have lived alone and naked among the savage beasts for years but a frail and slender girl  no it was not possible  together they went outside  malbihns boys were striking camp in preparation for a hasty departure  the strangers blacks were conversing with them  malbihn stood at a distance angry and glowering  the stranger approached one of his own men  find out where they got this girl he commanded  the negro thus addressed questioned one of malbihns followers presently he returned to his master  they bought her from old kovudoo he said  that is all that this fellow will tell me  he pretends that he knows nothing more and i guess that he does not  these two white men were very bad men  they did many things that their boys knew not the meanings of  it would be well bwana to kill the other  i wish that i might but a new law is come into this part of the jungle  it is not as it was in the old days muviri replied the master  the stranger remained until malbihn and his safari had disappeared into the jungle toward the north  meriem trustful now stood at his side geeka clutched in one slim brown hand  they talked together the man wondering at the faltering arabic of the girl but attributing it finally to her defective mentality  could he have known that years had elapsed since she had used it until she was taken by the swedes he would not have wondered that she had half forgotten it  there was yet another reason why the language of the sheik had thus readily eluded her but of that reason she herself could not have guessed the truth any better than could the man  he tried to persuade her to return with him to his village as he called it or douar in arabic but she was insistent upon searching immediately for korak  as a last resort he determined to take her with him by force rather than sacrifice her life to the insane hallucination which haunted her but being a wise man he determined to humor her first and then attempt to lead her as he would have her go  so when they took up their march it was in the direction of the south though his own ranch lay almost due east  by degrees he turned the direction of their way more and more eastward and greatly was he pleased to note that the girl failed to discover that any change was being made  little by little she became more trusting  at first she had had but her intuition to guide her belief that this big tarmangani meant her no harm but as the days passed and she saw that his kindness and consideration never faltered she came to compare him with korak and to be very fond of him but never did her loyalty to her apeman flag  on the fifth day they came suddenly upon a great plain and from the edge of the forest the girl saw in the distance fenced fields and many buildings  at the sight she drew back in astonishment  where are we she asked pointing  we could not find korak replied the man and as our way led near my douar i have brought you here to wait and rest with my wife until my men can find your ape or he finds you  it is better thus little one you will be safer with us and you will be happier  i am afraid bwana said the girl  in thy douar they will beat me as did the sheik my father  let me go back into the jungle  there korak will find me  he would not think to look for me in the douar of a white man  no one will beat you child replied the man  i have not done so have i  well here all belong to me  they will treat you well  here no one is beaten  my wife will be very good to you and at last korak will come for i shall send men to search for him  the girl shook her head  they could not bring him for he would kill them as all men have tried to kill him  i am afraid  let me go bwana  you do not know the way to your own country  you would be lost  the leopards or the lions would get you the first night and after all you would not find your korak  it is better that you stay with us  did i not save you from the bad man  do you not owe me something for that well then remain with us for a few weeks at least until we can determine what is best for you  you are only a little girlit would be wicked to permit you to go alone into the jungle  meriem laughed  the jungle she said is my father and my mother it has been kinder to me than have men  i am not afraid of the jungle nor am i afraid of the leopard or the lion  when my time comes i shall die  it may be that a leopard or a lion shall kill me or it may be a tiny bug no bigger than the end of my littlest finger  when the lion leaps upon me or the little bug stings me i shall be afraidoh then i shall be terribly afraid i know but life would be very miserable indeed were i to spend it in terror of the thing that has not yet happened  if it be the lion my terror shall be short of life but if it be the little bug i may suffer for days before i die  and so i fear the lion least of all  he is great and noisy  i can hear him or see him or smell him in time to escape but any moment i may place a hand or foot on the little bug and never know that he is there until i feel his deadly sting  no i do not fear the jungle  i love it  i should rather die than leave it forever but your douar is close beside the jungle  you have been good to me  i will do as you wish and remain here for a while to wait the coming of my korak  good said the man and he led the way down toward the flowercovered bungalow behind which lay the barns and outhouses of a wellordered african farm  as they came nearer a dozen dogs ran barking toward themgaunt wolf hounds a huge great dane a nimblefooted collie and a number of yapping quarrelsome fox terriers  at first their appearance was savage and unfriendly in the extreme but once they recognized the foremost black warriors and the white man behind them their attitude underwent a remarkable change  the collie and the fox terriers became frantic with delirious joy and while the wolf hounds and the great dane were not a whit less delighted at the return of their master their greetings were of a more dignified nature  each in turn sniffed at meriem who displayed not the slightest fear of any of them  the wolf hounds bristled and growled at the scent of wild beasts that clung to her garment but when she laid her hand upon their heads and her soft voice murmured caressingly they halfclosed their eyes lifting their upper lips in contented canine smiles  the man was watching them and he too smiled for it was seldom that these savage brutes took thus kindly to strangers  it was as though in some subtile way the girl had breathed a message of kindred savagery to their savage hearts  with her slim fingers grasping the collar of a wolf hound upon either side of her meriem walked on toward the bungalow upon the porch of which a woman dressed in white waved a welcome to her returning lord there was more fear in the girls eyes now than there had been in the presence of strange men or savage beasts  she hesitated turning an appealing glance toward the man  this is my wife he said  she will be glad to welcome you  the woman came down the path to meet them  the man kissed her and turning toward meriem introduced them speaking in the arab tongue the girl understood  this is meriem my dear he said and he told the story of the jungle waif in so far as he knew it  meriem saw that the woman was beautiful  she saw that sweetness and goodness were stamped indelibly upon her countenance  she no longer feared her and when her brief story had been narrated and the woman came and put her arms about her and kissed her and called her poor little darling something snapped in meriems little heart  she buried her face on the bosom of this new friend in whose voice was the mother tone that meriem had not heard for so many years that she had forgotten its very existence  she buried her face on the kindly bosom and wept as she had not wept before in all her lifetears of relief and joy that she could not fathom  and so came meriem the savage little mangani out of her beloved jungle into the midst of a home of culture and refinement  already bwana and my dear as she first heard them called and continued to call them were as father and mother to her  once her savage fears allayed she went to the opposite extreme of trustfulness and love now she was willing to wait here until they found korak or korak found her  she did not give up that thoughtkorak her korak always was first     chapter 15   and out in the jungle far away korak covered with wounds stiff with clotted blood burning with rage and sorrow swung back upon the trail of the great baboons  he had not found them where he had last seen them nor in any of their usual haunts but he sought them along the wellmarked spoor they had left behind them and at last he overtook them  when first he came upon them they were moving slowly but steadily southward in one of those periodic migrations the reasons for which the baboon himself is best able to explain  at sight of the white warrior who came upon them from down wind the herd halted in response to the warning cry of the sentinel that had discovered him there was much growling and muttering much stifflegged circling on the part of the bulls  the mothers in nervous high pitched tones called their young to their sides and with them moved to safety behind their lords and masters  korak called aloud to the king who at the familiar voice advanced slowly warily and still stifflegged  he must have the confirmatory evidence of his nose before venturing to rely too implicitly upon the testimony of his ears and eyes  korak stood perfectly still  to have advanced then might have precipitated an immediate attack or as easily a panic of flight  wild beasts are creatures of nerves  it is a relatively simple thing to throw them into a species of hysteria which may induce either a mania for murder or symptoms of apparent abject cowardiceit is a question however if a wild animal ever is actually a coward  the king baboon approached korak  he walked around him in an ever decreasing circlegrowling grunting sniffing  korak spoke to him  i am korak he said  i opened the cage that held you  i saved you from the tarmangani  i am korak the killer  i am your friend  huh grunted the king  yes you are korak  my ears told me that you were korak  my eyes told me that you were korak  now my nose tells me that you are korak  my nose is never wrong  i am your friend  come we shall hunt together  korak cannot hunt now replied the apeman  the gomangani have stolen meriem  they have tied her in their village  they will not let her go  korak alone was unable to set her free  korak set you free now will you bring your people and set koraks meriem free  the gomangani have many sharp sticks which they throw  they pierce the bodies of my people  they kill us  the gomangani are bad people they will kill us all if we enter their village  the tarmangani have sticks that make a loud noise and kill at a great distance replied korak  they had these when korak set you free from their trap  if korak had run away from them you would now be a prisoner among the tarmangani  the baboon scratched his head  in a rough circle about him and the apeman squatted the bulls of his herd  they blinked their eyes shouldered one another about for more advantageous positions scratched in the rotting vegetation upon the chance of unearthing a toothsome worm or sat listlessly eyeing their king and the strange mangani who called himself thus but who more closely resembled the hated tarmangani  the king looked at some of the older of his subjects as though inviting suggestion  we are too few grunted one  there are the baboons of the hill country suggested another  they are as many as the leaves of the forest  they too hate the gomangani  they love to fight  they are very savage  let us ask them to accompany us  then can we kill all the gomangani in the jungle he rose and growled horribly bristling his stiff hair  that is the way to talk cried the killer but we do not need the baboons of the hill country  we are enough  it will take a long time to fetch them  meriem may be dead and eaten before we could free her let us set out at once for the village of the gomangani  if we travel very fast it will not take long to reach it  then all at the same time we can charge into the village growling and barking  the gomangani will be very frightened and will run away  while they are gone we can seize meriem and carry her off  we do not have to kill or be killedall that korak wishes is his meriem  we are too few croaked the old ape again  yes we are too few echoed others  korak could not persuade them  they would help him gladly but they must do it in their own way and that meant enlisting the services of their kinsmen and allies of the hill country  so korak was forced to give in  all he could do for the present was to urge them to haste and at his suggestion the king baboon with a dozen of his mightiest bulls agreed to go to the hill country with korak leaving the balance of the herd behind  once enlisted in the adventure the baboons became quite enthusiastic about it  the delegation set off immediately  they traveled swiftly but the apeman found no difficulty in keeping up with them  they made a tremendous racket as they passed through the trees in an endeavor to suggest to enemies in their front that a great herd was approaching for when the baboons travel in large numbers there is no jungle creature who cares to molest them  when the nature of the country required much travel upon the level and the distance between trees was great they moved silently knowing that the lion and the leopard would not be fooled by noise when they could see plainly for themselves that only a handful of baboons were on the trail  for two days the party raced through the savage country passing out of the dense jungle into an open plain and across this to timbered mountain slopes  here korak never before had been  it was a new country to him and the change from the monotony of the circumscribed view in the jungle was pleasing  but he had little desire to enjoy the beauties of nature at this time  meriem his meriem was in danger until she was freed and returned to him he had little thought for aught else  once in the forest that clothed the mountain slopes the baboons advanced more slowly  constantly they gave tongue to a plaintive note of calling  then would follow silence while they listened  at last faintly from the distance straight ahead came an answer  the baboons continued to travel in the direction of the voices that floated through the forest to them in the intervals of their own silence  thus calling and listening they came closer to their kinsmen who it was evident to korak were coming to meet them in great numbers but when at last the baboons of the hill country came in view the apeman was staggered at the reality that broke upon his vision  what appeared a solid wall of huge baboons rose from the ground through the branches of the trees to the loftiest terrace to which they dared entrust their weight  slowly they were approaching voicing their weird plaintive call and behind them as far as koraks eyes could pierce the verdure rose solid walls of their fellows treading close upon their heels  there were thousands of them  the apeman could not but think of the fate of his little party should some untoward incident arouse even momentarily the rage of fear of a single one of all these thousands  but nothing such befell  the two kings approached one another as was their custom with much sniffing and bristling  they satisfied themselves of each others identity  then each scratched the others back  after a moment they spoke together  koraks friend explained the nature of their visit and for the first time korak showed himself he had been hiding behind a bush  the excitement among the hill baboons was intense at sight of him  for a moment korak feared that he should be torn to pieces but his fear was for meriem  should he die there would be none to succor her  the two kings however managed to quiet the multitude and korak was permitted to approach  slowly the hill baboons came closer to him they sniffed at him from every angle  when he spoke to them in their own tongue they were filled with wonder and delight  they talked to him and listened while he spoke  he told them of meriem and of their life in the jungle where they were the friends of all the ape folk from little manu to mangani the great ape  the gomangani who are keeping meriem from me are no friends of yours he said  they kill you  the baboons of the low country are too few to go against them  they tell me that you are very many and very bravethat your numbers are as the numbers of the grasses upon the plains or the leaves within the forest and that even tantor the elephant fears you so brave you are  they told me that you would be happy to accompany us to the village of the gomangani and punish these bad people while i korak the killer carry away my meriem  the king ape puffed out his chest and strutted about very stifflegged indeed  so also did many of the other great bulls of his nation  they were pleased and flattered by the words of the strange tarmangani who called himself mangani and spoke the language of the hairy progenitors of man  yes said one we of the hill country are mighty fighters  tantor fears us  numa fears us  sheeta fears us  the gomangani of the hill country are glad to pass us by in peace  i for one will come with you to the village of the gomangani of the low places  i am the kings first hechild  alone can i kill all the gomangani of the low country and he swelled his chest and strutted proudly back and forth until the itching back of a comrade commanded his industrious attention  i am goob cried another  my fighting fangs are long  they are sharp  they are strong  into the soft flesh of many a gomangani have they been buried  alone i slew the sister of sheeta  goob will go to the low country with you and kill so many of the gomangani that there will be none left to count the dead and then he too strutted and pranced before the admiring eyes of the shes and the young  korak looked at the king questioningly  your bulls are very brave he said but braver than any is the king  thus addressed the shaggy bull still in his primeelse he had been no longer kinggrowled ferociously  the forest echoed to his lusty challenges  the little baboons clutched fearfully at their mothers hairy necks  the bulls electrified leaped high in air and took up the roaring challenge of their king  the din was terrific  korak came close to the king and shouted in his ear come then he started off through the forest toward the plain that they must cross on their long journey back to the village of kovudoo the gomangani  the king still roaring and shrieking wheeled and followed him  in their wake came the handful of low country baboons and the thousands of the hill clansavage wiry doglike creatures athirst for blood  and so they came upon the second day to the village of kovudoo  it was midafternoon  the village was sunk in the quiet of the great equatorial sunheat  the mighty herd traveled quietly now  beneath the thousands of padded feet the forest gave forth no greater sound than might have been produced by the increased soughing of a stronger breeze through the leafy branches of the trees  korak and the two kings were in the lead  close beside the village they halted until the stragglers had closed up  now utter silence reigned  korak creeping stealthily entered the tree that overhung the palisade  he glanced behind him  the pack were close upon his heels  the time had come  he had warned them continuously during the long march that no harm must befall the white she who lay a prisoner within the village  all others were their legitimate prey  then raising his face toward the sky he gave voice to a single cry  it was the signal  in response three thousand hairy bulls leaped screaming and barking into the village of the terrified blacks  warriors poured from every hut  mothers gathered their babies in their arms and fled toward the gates as they saw the horrid horde pouring into the village street kovudoo marshaled his fighting men about him and leaping and yelling to arouse their courage offered a bristling spear tipped front to the charging horde  korak as he had led the march led the charge  the blacks were struck with horror and dismay at the sight of this whiteskinned youth at the head of a pack of hideous baboons  for an instant they held their ground hurling their spears once at the advancing multitude but before they could fit arrows to their bows they wavered gave and turned in terrified rout  into their ranks upon their backs sinking strong fangs into the muscles of their necks sprang the baboons and first among them most ferocious most bloodthirsty most terrible was korak the killer  at the village gates through which the blacks poured in panic korak left them to the tender mercies of his allies and turned himself eagerly toward the hut in which meriem had been a prisoner  it was empty  one after another the filthy interiors revealed the same disheartening factmeriem was in none of them  that she had not been taken by the blacks in their flight from the village korak knew for he had watched carefully for a glimpse of her among the fugitives  to the mind of the apeman knowing as he did the proclivities of the savages there was but a single explanationmeriem had been killed and eaten  with the conviction that meriem was dead there surged through koraks brain a wave of blood red rage against those he believed to be her murderer  in the distance he could hear the snarling of the baboons mixed with the screams of their victims and towards this he made his way  when he came upon them the baboons had commenced to tire of the sport of battle and the blacks in a little knot were making a new stand using their knob sticks effectively upon the few bulls who still persisted in attacking them  among these broke korak from the branches of a tree above themswift relentless terrible he hurled himself upon the savage warriors of kovudoo  blind fury possessed him  too it protected him by its very ferocity  like a wounded lioness he was here there everywhere striking terrific blows with hard fists and with the precision and timeliness of the trained fighter  again and again he buried his teeth in the flesh of a foeman  he was upon one and gone again to another before an effective blow could be dealt him  yet though great was the weight of his execution in determining the result of the combat it was outweighed by the terror which he inspired in the simple superstitious minds of his foeman  to them this white warrior who consorted with the great apes and the fierce baboons who growled and snarled and snapped like a beast was not human  he was a demon of the foresta fearsome god of evil whom they had offended and who had come out of his lair deep in the jungle to punish them  and because of this belief there were many who offered but little defense feeling as they did the futility of pitting their puny mortal strength against that of a deity  those who could fled until at last there were no more to pay the penalty for a deed which while not beyond them they were nevertheless not guilty of  panting and bloody korak paused for want of further victims  the baboons gathered about him sated themselves with blood and battle  they lolled upon the ground fagged  in the distance kovudoo was gathering his scattered tribesmen and taking account of injuries and losses  his people were panic stricken nothing could prevail upon them to remain longer in this country  they would not even return to the village for their belongings  instead they insisted upon continuing their flight until they had put many miles between themselves and the stamping ground of the demon who had so bitterly attacked them  and thus it befell that korak drove from their homes the only people who might have aided him in a search for meriem and cut off the only connecting link between him and her from whomsoever might come in search of him from the douar of the kindly bwana who had befriended his little jungle sweetheart  it was a sour and savage korak who bade farewell to his baboon allies upon the following morning  they wished him to accompany him but the apeman had no heart for the society of any  jungle life had encouraged taciturnity in him  his sorrow had deepened this to a sullen moroseness that could not brook even the savage companionship of the illnatured baboons  brooding and despondent he took his solitary way into the deepest jungle  he moved along the ground when he knew that numa was abroad and hungry  he took to the same trees that harbored sheeta the panther  he courted death in a hundred ways and a hundred forms  his mind was ever occupied with reminiscences of meriem and the happy years that they had spent together  he realized now to the full what she had meant to him  the sweet face the tanned supple little body the bright smile that always had welcomed his return from the hunt haunted him continually  inaction soon threatened him with madness  he must be on the go  he must fill his days with labor and excitement that he might forgetthat night might find him so exhausted that he should sleep in blessed unconsciousness of his misery until a new day had come  had he guessed that by any possibility meriem might still live he would at least have had hope  his days could have been devoted to searching for her but he implicitly believed that she was dead  for a long year he led his solitary roaming life  occasionally he fell in with akut and his tribe hunting with them for a day or two or he might travel to the hill country where the baboons had come to accept him as a matter of course but most of all was he with tantor the elephantthe great gray battle ship of the junglethe superdreadnaught of his savage world  the peaceful quiet of the monster bulls the watchful solicitude of the mother cows the awkward playfulness of the calves rested interested and amused korak  the life of the huge beasts took his mind temporarily from his own grief  he came to love them as he loved not even the great apes and there was one gigantic tusker in particular of which he was very fondthe lord of the herda savage beast that was wont to charge a stranger upon the slightest provocation or upon no provocation whatsoever  and to korak this mountain of destruction was docile and affectionate as a lap dog  he came when korak called  he wound his trunk about the apemans body and lifted him to his broad neck in response to a gesture and there would korak lie at full length kicking his toes affectionately into the thick hide and brushing the flies from about the tender ears of his colossal chum with a leafy branch torn from a nearby tree by tantor for the purpose  and all the while meriem was scarce a hundred miles away     chapter 16   to meriem in her new home the days passed quickly  at first she was all anxiety to be off into the jungle searching for her korak  bwana as she insisted upon calling her benefactor dissuaded her from making the attempt at once by dispatching a head man with a party of blacks to kovudoos village with instructions to learn from the old savage how he came into possession of the white girl and as much of her antecedents as might be culled from the black chieftain  bwana particularly charged his head man with the duty of questioning kovudoo relative to the strange character whom the girl called korak and of searching for the apeman if he found the slightest evidence upon which to ground a belief in the existence of such an individual  bwana was more than fully convinced that korak was a creature of the girls disordered imagination  he believed that the terrors and hardships she had undergone during captivity among the blacks and her frightful experience with the two swedes had unbalanced her mind but as the days passed and he became better acquainted with her and able to observe her under the ordinary conditions of the quiet of his african home he was forced to admit that her strange tale puzzled him not a little for there was no other evidence whatever that meriem was not in full possession of her normal faculties  the white mans wife whom meriem had christened my dear from having first heard her thus addressed by bwana took not only a deep interest in the little jungle waif because of her forlorn and friendless state but grew to love her as well for her sunny disposition and natural charm of temperament  and meriem similarly impressed by little attributes in the gentle cultured woman reciprocated the others regard and affection  and so the days flew by while meriem waited the return of the head man and his party from the country of kovudoo  they were short days for into them were crowded many hours of insidious instruction of the unlettered child by the lonely woman  she commenced at once to teach the girl english without forcing it upon her as a task  she varied the instruction with lessons in sewing and deportment nor once did she let meriem guess that it was not all play  nor was this difficult since the girl was avid to learn  then there were pretty dresses to be made to take the place of the single leopard skin and in this she found the child as responsive and enthusiastic as any civilized miss of her acquaintance  a month passed before the head man returneda month that had transformed the savage halfnaked little tarmangani into a daintily frocked girl of at least outward civilization  meriem had progressed rapidly with the intricacies of the english language for bwana and my dear had persistently refused to speak arabic from the time they had decided that meriem must learn english which had been a day or two after her introduction into their home  the report of the head man plunged meriem into a period of despondency for he had found the village of kovudoo deserted nor search as he would could he discover a single native anywhere in the vicinity  for some time he had camped near the village spending the days in a systematic search of the environs for traces of meriems korak but in this quest too had he failed  he had seen neither apes nor apeman meriem at first insisted upon setting forth herself in search of korak but bwana prevailed upon her to wait  he would go himself he assured her as soon as he could find the time and at last meriem consented to abide by his wishes but it was months before she ceased to mourn almost hourly for her korak  my dear grieved with the grieving girl and did her best to comfort and cheer her  she told her that if korak lived he would find her but all the time she believed that korak had never existed beyond the childs dreams  she planned amusements to distract meriems attention from her sorrow and she instituted a welldesigned campaign to impress upon the child the desirability of civilized life and customs  nor was this difficult as she was soon to learn for it rapidly became evident that beneath the uncouth savagery of the girl was a bed rock of innate refinementa nicety of taste and predilection that quite equaled that of her instructor  my dear was delighted  she was lonely and childless and so she lavished upon this little stranger all the mother love that would have gone to her own had she had one  the result was that by the end of the first year none might have guessed that meriem ever had existed beyond the lap of culture and luxury  she was sixteen now though she easily might have passed for nineteen and she was very good to look upon with her black hair and her tanned skin and all the freshness and purity of health and innocence  yet she still nursed her secret sorrow though she no longer mentioned it to my dear  scarce an hour passed that did not bring its recollection of korak and its poignant yearning to see him again  meriem spoke english fluently now and read and wrote it as well  one day my dear spoke jokingly to her in french and to her surprise meriem replied in the same tongueslowly it is true and haltingly but none the less in excellent french such though as a little child might use  thereafter they spoke a little french each day and my dear often marveled that the girl learned this language with a facility that was at times almost uncanny  at first meriem had puckered her narrow arched little eye brows as though trying to force recollection of something all but forgotten which the new words suggested and then to her own astonishment as well as to that of her teacher she had used other french words than those in the lessonsused them properly and with a pronunciation that the english woman knew was more perfect than her own but meriem could neither read nor write what she spoke so well and as my dear considered a knowledge of correct english of the first importance other than conversational french was postponed for a later day  you doubtless heard french spoken at times in your fathers douar suggested my dear as the most reasonable explanation  meriem shook her head  it may be she said but i do not recall ever having seen a frenchman in my fathers companyhe hated them and would have nothing whatever to do with them and i am quite sure that i never heard any of these words before yet at the same time i find them all familiar  i cannot understand it  neither can i agreed my dear  it was about this time that a runner brought a letter that when she learned the contents filled meriem with excitement  visitors were coming  a number of english ladies and gentlemen had accepted my dears invitation to spend a month of hunting and exploring with them meriem was all expectancy  what would these strangers be like  would they be as nice to her as had bwana and my dear or would they be like the other white folk she had knowncruel and relentless  my dear assured her that they all were gentle folk and that she would find them kind considerate and honorable  to my dears surprise there was none of the shyness of the wild creature in meriems anticipation of the visit of strangers  she looked forward to their coming with curiosity and with a certain pleasurable anticipation when once she was assured that they would not bite her  in fact she appeared no different than would any pretty young miss who had learned of the expected coming of company  koraks image was still often in her thoughts but it aroused now a less welldefined sense of bereavement  a quiet sadness pervaded meriem when she thought of him but the poignant grief of her loss when it was young no longer goaded her to desperation  yet she was still loyal to him  she still hoped that some day he would find her nor did she doubt for a moment but that he was searching for her if he still lived  it was this last suggestion that caused her the greatest perturbation  korak might be dead  it scarce seemed possible that one so wellequipped to meet the emergencies of jungle life should have succumbed so young yet when she had last seen him he had been beset by a horde of armed warriors and should he have returned to the village again as she well knew he must have he may have been killed  even her korak could not single handed slay an entire tribe  at last the visitors arrived  there were three men and two womenthe wives of the two older men  the youngest member of the party was hon morison baynes a young man of considerable wealth who having exhausted all the possibilities for pleasure offered by the capitals of europe had gladly seized upon this opportunity to turn to another continent for excitement and adventure  he looked upon all things uneuropean as rather more than less impossible still he was not at all averse to enjoying the novelty of unaccustomed places and making the most of strangers indigenous thereto however unspeakable they might have seemed to him at home  in manner he was suave and courteous to allif possible a trifle more punctilious toward those he considered of meaner clay than toward the few he mentally admitted to equality  nature had favored him with a splendid physique and a handsome face and also with sufficient good judgment to appreciate that while he might enjoy the contemplation of his superiority to the masses there was little likelihood of the masses being equally entranced by the same cause  and so he easily maintained the reputation of being a most democratic and likeable fellow and indeed he was likable  just a shade of his egotism was occasionally apparentnever sufficient to become a burden to his associates  and this briefly was the hon morison baynes of luxurious european civilization  what would be the hon  morison baynes of central africa it were difficult to guess  meriem at first was shy and reserved in the presence of the strangers  her benefactors had seen fit to ignore mention of her strange past and so she passed as their ward whose antecedents not having been mentioned were not to be inquired into  the guests found her sweet and unassuming laughing vivacious and a never exhausted storehouse of quaint and interesting jungle lore  she had ridden much during her year with bwana and my dear  she knew each favorite clump of concealing reeds along the river that the buffalo loved best  she knew a dozen places where lions laired and every drinking hole in the drier country twentyfive miles back from the river  with unerring precision that was almost uncanny she could track the largest or the smallest beast to his hiding place  but the thing that baffled them all was her instant consciousness of the presence of carnivora that others exerting their faculties to the utmost could neither see nor hear  the hon morison baynes found meriem a most beautiful and charming companion  he was delighted with her from the first  particularly so it is possible because he had not thought to find companionship of this sort upon the african estate of his london friends  they were together a great deal as they were the only unmarried couple in the little company  meriem entirely unaccustomed to the companionship of such as baynes was fascinated by him  his tales of the great gay cities with which he was familiar filled her with admiration and with wonder  if the hon morison always shone to advantage in these narratives meriem saw in that fact but a most natural consequence to his presence upon the scene of his storywherever morison might be he must be a hero so thought the girl  with the actual presence and companionship of the young englishman the image of korak became less real  where before it had been an actuality to her she now realized that korak was but a memory  to that memory she still was loyal but what weight has a memory in the presence of a fascinating reality  meriem had never accompanied the men upon a hunt since the arrival of the guests  she never had cared particularly for the sport of killing the tracking she enjoyed but the mere killing for the sake of killing she could not find pleasure inlittle savage that she had been and still to some measure was  when bwana had gone forth to shoot for meat she had always been his enthusiastic companion but with the coming of the london guests the hunting had deteriorated into mere killing  slaughter the host would not permit yet the purpose of the hunts were for heads and skins and not for food  so meriem remained behind and spent her days either with my dear upon the shaded verandah or riding her favorite pony across the plains or to the forest edge here she would leave him untethered while she took to the trees for the moments unalloyed pleasures of a return to the wild free existence of her earlier childhood  then would come again visions of korak and tired at last of leaping and swinging through the trees she would stretch herself comfortably upon a branch and dream  and presently as today she found the features of korak slowly dissolve and merge into those of another and the figure of a tanned halfnaked tarmangani become a khaki clothed englishman astride a hunting pony  and while she dreamed there came to her ears from a distance faintly the terrified bleating of a kid  meriem was instantly alert  you or i even had we been able to hear the pitiful wail at so great distance could not have interpreted it but to meriem it meant a species of terror that afflicts the ruminant when a carnivore is near and escape impossible  it had been both a pleasure and a sport of koraks to rob numa of his prey whenever possible and meriem too had often joyed in the thrill of snatching some dainty morsel almost from the very jaws of the king of beasts  now at the sound of the kids bleat all the well remembered thrills recurred  instantly she was all excitement to play again the game of hide and seek with death  quickly she loosened her riding skirt and tossed it asideit was a heavy handicap to successful travel in the trees  her boots and stockings followed the skirt for the bare sole of the human foot does not slip upon dry or even wet bark as does the hard leather of a boot she would have liked to discard her riding breeches also but the motherly admonitions of my dear had convinced meriem that it was not good form to go naked through the world  at her hip hung a hunting knife  her rifle was still in its boot at her ponys withers  her revolver she had not brought  the kid was still bleating as meriem started rapidly in its direction which she knew was straight toward a certain water hole which had once been famous as a rendezvous for lions  of late there had been no evidence of carnivora in the neighborhood of this drinking place but meriem was positive that the bleating of the kid was due to the presence of either lion or panther  but she would soon know for she was rapidly approaching the terrified animal  she wondered as she hastened onward that the sounds continued to come from the same point  why did the kid not run away  and then she came in sight of the little animal and knew  the kid was tethered to a stake beside the waterhole  meriem paused in the branches of a nearby tree and scanned the surrounding clearing with quick penetrating eyes  where was the hunter  bwana and his people did not hunt thus  who could have tethered this poor little beast as a lure to numa  bwana never countenanced such acts in his country and his word was law among those who hunted within a radius of many miles of his estate  some wandering savages doubtless thought meriem but where were they not even her keen eyes could discover them  and where was numa  why had he not long since sprung upon this delicious and defenseless morsel  that he was close by was attested by the pitiful crying of the kid  ah  now she saw him  he was lying close in a clump of brush a few yards to her right  the kid was down wind from him and getting the full benefit of his terrorizing scent which did not reach meriem  to circle to the opposite side of the clearing where the trees approached closer to the kid  to leap quickly to the little animals side and cut the tether that held him would be the work of but a moment  in that moment numa might charge and then there would be scarce time to regain the safety of the trees yet it might be done meriem had escaped from closer quarters than that many times before  the doubt that gave her momentary pause was caused by fear of the unseen hunters more than by fear of numa  if they were stranger blacks the spears that they held in readiness for numa might as readily be loosed upon whomever dared release their bait as upon the prey they sought thus to trap  again the kid struggled to be free  again his piteous wail touched the tender heart strings of the girl  tossing discretion aside she commenced to circle the clearing  only from numa did she attempt to conceal her presence  at last she reached the opposite trees  an instant she paused to look toward the great lion and at the same moment she saw the huge beast rise slowly to his full height  a low roar betokened that he was ready  meriem loosened her knife and leaped to the ground  a quick run brought her to the side of the kid  numa saw her  he lashed his tail against his tawny sides  he roared terribly but for an instant he remained where he stoodsurprised into inaction doubtless by the strange apparition that had sprung so unexpectedly from the jungle  other eyes were upon meriem tooeyes in which were no less surprise than that reflected in the yellowgreen orbs of the carnivore  a white man hiding in a thorn boma half rose as the young girl leaped into the clearing and dashed toward the kid  he saw numa hesitate  he raised his rifle and covered the beasts breast  the girl reached the kids side  her knife flashed and the little prisoner was free  with a parting bleat it dashed off into the jungle  then the girl turned to retreat toward the safety of the tree from which she had dropped so suddenly and unexpectedly into the surprised view of the lion the kid and the man  as she turned the girls face was turned toward the hunter  his eyes went wide as he saw her features  he gave a little gasp of surprise but now the lion demanded all his attentionthe baffled angry beast was charging  his breast was still covered by the motionless rifle the man could have fired and stopped the charge at once but for some reason since he had seen the girls face he hesitated  could it be that he did not care to save her  or did he prefer if possible to remain unseen by her  it must have been the latter cause which kept the trigger finger of the steady hand from exerting the little pressure that would have brought the great beast to at least a temporary pause  like an eagle the man watched the race for life the girl was making  a second or two measured the time which the whole exciting event consumed from the moment that the lion broke into his charge  nor once did the rifle sights fail to cover the broad breast of the tawny sire as the lions course took him a little to the mans left  once at the very last moment when escape seemed impossible the hunters finger tightened ever so little upon the trigger but almost coincidentally the girl leaped for an over hanging branch and seized it  the lion leaped too but the nimble meriem had swung herself beyond his reach without a second or an inch to spare  the man breathed a sigh of relief as he lowered his rifle  he saw the girl fling a grimace at the angry roaring maneater beneath her and then laughing speed away into the forest  for an hour the lion remained about the water hole  a hundred times could the hunter have bagged his prey  why did he fail to do so  was he afraid that the shot might attract the girl and cause her to return  at last numa still roaring angrily strode majestically into the jungle  the hunter crawled from his boma and half an hour later was entering a little camp snugly hidden in the forest  a handful of black followers greeted his return with sullen indifference  he was a great bearded man a huge yellowbearded giant when he entered his tent half an hour later he emerged smooth shaven  his blacks looked at him in astonishment  would you know me he asked  the hyena that bore you would not know you bwana replied one  the man aimed a heavy fist at the blacks face but long experience in dodging similar blows saved the presumptuous one     chapter 17   meriem returned slowly toward the tree in which she had left her skirt her shoes and her stockings  she was singing blithely but her song came to a sudden stop when she came within sight of the tree for there disporting themselves with glee and pulling and hauling upon her belongings were a number of baboons  when they saw her they showed no signs of terror  instead they bared their fangs and growled at her what was there to fear in a single shetarmangani  nothing absolutely nothing  in the open plain beyond the forest the hunters were returning from the days sport  they were widely separated hoping to raise a wandering lion on the homeward journey across the plain  the hon  morison baynes rode closest to the forest  as his eyes wandered back and forth across the undulating shrub sprinkled ground they fell upon the form of a creature close beside the thick jungle where it terminated abruptly at the plains edge  he reined his mount in the direction of his discovery  it was yet too far away for his untrained eyes to recognize it but as he came closer he saw that it was a horse and was about to resume the original direction of his way when he thought that he discerned a saddle upon the beasts back  he rode a little closer  yes the animal was saddled  the hon morison approached yet nearer and as he did so his eyes expressed a pleasurable emotion of anticipation for they had now recognized the pony as the special favorite of meriem  he galloped to the animals side  meriem must be within the wood  the man shuddered a little at the thought of an unprotected girl alone in the jungle that was still to him a fearful place of terrors and stealthily stalking death  he dismounted and left his horse beside meriems  on foot he entered the jungle  he knew that she was probably safe enough and he wished to surprise her by coming suddenly upon her  he had gone but a short distance into the wood when he heard a great jabbering in a nearby tree  coming closer he saw a band of baboons snarling over something  looking intently he saw that one of them held a womans riding skirt and that others had boots and stockings  his heart almost ceased to beat as he quite naturally placed the most direful explanation upon the scene  the baboons had killed meriem and stripped this clothing from her body  morison shuddered  he was about to call aloud in the hope that after all the girl still lived when he saw her in a tree close beside that was occupied by the baboons and now he saw that they were snarling and jabbering at her to his amazement he saw the girl swing apelike into the tree below the huge beasts  he saw her pause upon a branch a few feet from the nearest baboon  he was about to raise his rifle and put a bullet through the hideous creature that seemed about to leap upon her when he heard the girl speak  he almost dropped his rifle from surprise as a strange jabbering identical with that of the apes broke from meriems lips  the baboons stopped their snarling and listened  it was quite evident that they were as much surprised as the hon morison baynes  slowly and one by one they approached the girl  she gave not the slightest evidence of fear of them  they quite surrounded her now so that baynes could not have fired without endangering the girls life but he no longer desired to fire  he was consumed with curiosity  for several minutes the girl carried on what could be nothing less than a conversation with the baboons and then with seeming alacrity every article of her apparel in their possession was handed over to her  the baboons still crowded eagerly about her as she donned them  they chattered to her and she chattered back  the hon morison baynes sat down at the foot of a tree and mopped his perspiring brow  then he rose and made his way back to his mount  when meriem emerged from the forest a few minutes later she found him there and he eyed her with wide eyes in which were both wonder and a sort of terror  i saw your horse here he explained and thought that i would wait and ride home with youyou do not mind  of course not she replied  it will be lovely  as they made their way stirrup to stirrup across the plain the hon morison caught himself many times watching the girls regular profile and wondering if his eyes had deceived him or if in truth he really had seen this lovely creature consorting with grotesque baboons and conversing with them as fluently as she conversed with him  the thing was uncannyimpossible yet he had seen it with his own eyes  and as he watched her another thought persisted in obtruding itself into his mind  she was most beautiful and very desirable but what did he know of her  was she not altogether impossible  was the scene that he had but just witnessed not sufficient proof of her impossibility  a woman who climbed trees and conversed with the baboons of the jungle it was quite horrible  again the hon morison mopped his brow  meriem glanced toward him  you are warm she said  now that the sun is setting i find it quite cool  why do you perspire now  he had not intended to let her know that he had seen her with the baboons but quite suddenly before he realized what he was saying he had blurted it out  i perspire from emotion he said  i went into the jungle when i discovered your pony  i wanted to surprise you but it was i who was surprised  i saw you in the trees with the baboons  yes she said quite unemotionally as though it was a matter of little moment that a young girl should be upon intimate terms with savage jungle beasts  it was horrible ejaculated the hon morison  horrible repeated meriem puckering her brows in bewilderment what was horrible about it  they are my friends is it horrible to talk with ones friends  you were really talking with them then cried the hon morison you understood them and they understood you  certainly  but they are hideous creaturesdegraded beasts of a lower order  how could you speak the language of beasts  they are not hideous and they are not degraded replied meriem friends are never that  i lived among them for years before bwana found me and brought me here  i scarce knew any other tongue than that of the mangani  should i refuse to know them now simply because i happen for the present to live among humans  for the present ejaculated the hon morison  you cannot mean that you expect to return to live among them  come come what foolishness are we talking  the very idea  you are spoofing me miss meriem  you have been kind to these baboons here and they know you and do not molest you but that you once lived among themno that is preposterous  but i did though insisted the girl seeing the real horror that the man felt in the presence of such an idea reflected in his tone and manner and rather enjoying baiting him still further  yes i lived almost naked among the great apes and the lesser apes  i dwelt among the branches of the trees  i pounced upon the smaller prey and devoured itraw  with korak and aht i hunted the antelope and the boar and i sat upon a tree limb and made faces at numa the lion and threw sticks at him and annoyed him until he roared so terribly in his rage that the earth shook  and korak built me a lair high among the branches of a mighty tree he brought me fruits and flesh  he fought for me and was kind to meuntil i came to bwana and my dear i do not recall that any other than korak was ever kind to me  there was a wistful note in the girls voice now and she had forgotten that she was bantering the hon morison  she was thinking of korak  she had not thought of him a great deal of late  for a time both were silently absorbed in their own reflections as they rode on toward the bungalow of their host  the girl was thinking of a godlike figure a leopard skin half concealing his smooth brown hide as he leaped nimbly through the trees to lay an offering of food before her on his return from a successful hunt  behind him shaggy and powerful swung a huge anthropoid ape while she meriem laughing and shouting her welcome swung upon a swaying limb before the entrance to her sylvan bower  it was a pretty picture as she recalled it  the other side seldom obtruded itself upon her memorythe long black nightsthe chill terrible jungle nightsthe cold and damp and discomfort of the rainy seasonthe hideous mouthings of the savage carnivora as they prowled through the stygian darkness beneaththe constant menace of sheeta the panther and histah the snakethe stinging insectsthe loathesome vermin  for in truth all these had been outweighed by the happiness of the sunny days the freedom of it all and most the companionship of korak  the mans thoughts were rather jumbled  he had suddenly realized that he had come mighty near falling in love with this girl of whom he had known nothing up to the previous moment when she had voluntarily revealed a portion of her past to him  the more he thought upon the matter the more evident it became to him that he had given her his lovethat he had been upon the verge of offering her his honorable name  he trembled a little at the narrowness of his escape  yet he still loved her  there was no objection to that according to the ethics of the hon morison baynes and his kind  she was a meaner clay than he  he could no more have taken her in marriage than he could have taken one of her baboon friends nor would she of course expect such an offer from him  to have his love would be sufficient honor for herhis name he would naturally bestow upon one in his own elevated social sphere  a girl who had consorted with apes who according to her own admission had lived almost naked among them could have no considerable sense of the finer qualities of virtue  the love that he would offer her then would far from offending her probably cover all that she might desire or expect  the more the hon morison baynes thought upon the subject the more fully convinced he became that he was contemplating a most chivalrous and unselfish act  europeans will better understand his point of view than americans poor benighted provincials who are denied a true appreciation of caste and of the fact that the king can do no wrong he did not even have to argue the point that she would be much happier amidst the luxuries of a london apartment fortified as she would be by both his love and his bank account than lawfully wed to such a one as her social position warranted  there was one question however which he wished to have definitely answered before he committed himself even to the program he was considering  who were korak and aht he asked  aht was a mangani replied meriem and korak a tarmangani  and what pray might a mangani be and a tarmangani  the girl laughed  you are a tarmangani she replied  the mangani are covered with hairyou would call them apes  then korak was a white man he asked  yes  and he wasahyoureryour  he paused for he found it rather difficult to go on with that line of questioning while the girls clear beautiful eyes were looking straight into his  my what insisted meriem far too unsophisticated in her unspoiled innocence to guess what the hon morison was driving at  whyahyour brother he stumbled  no korak was not my brother she replied  was he your husband then he finally blurted  far from taking offense meriem broke into a merry laugh  my husband she cried  why how old do you think i am  i am too young to have a husband  i had never thought of such a thing  korak waswhy and now she hesitated too for she never before had attempted to analyse the relationship that existed between herself and korakwhy korak was just korak and again she broke into a gay laugh as she realized the illuminating quality of her description  looking at her and listening to her the man beside her could not believe that depravity of any sort or degree entered into the girls nature yet he wanted to believe that she had not been virtuous for otherwise his task was less a sinecurethe hon  morison was not entirely without conscience  for several days the hon morison made no appreciable progress toward the consummation of his scheme  sometimes he almost abandoned it for he found himself time and again wondering how slight might be the provocation necessary to trick him into making a bonafide offer of marriage to meriem if he permitted himself to fall more deeply in love with her and it was difficult to see her daily and not love her there was a quality about her which all unknown to the hon morison was making his task an extremely difficult oneit was that quality of innate goodness and cleanness which is a good girls stoutest bulwark and protectionan impregnable barrier that only degeneracy has the effrontery to assail  the hon morison baynes would never be considered a degenerate  he was sitting with meriem upon the verandah one evening after the others had retired  earlier they had been playing tennisa game in which the hon morison shone to advantage as in truth he did in most all manly sports  he was telling meriem stories of london and paris of balls and banquets of the wonderful women and their wonderful gowns of the pleasures and pastimes of the rich and powerful  the hon morison was a past master in the art of insidious boasting  his egotism was never flagrant or tiresomehe was never crude in it for crudeness was a plebeianism that the hon morison studiously avoided yet the impression derived by a listener to the hon morison was one that was not at all calculated to detract from the glory of the house of baynes or from that of its representative  meriem was entranced  his tales were like fairy stories to this little jungle maid  the hon morison loomed large and wonderful and magnificent in her minds eye  he fascinated her and when he drew closer to her after a short silence and took her hand she thrilled as one might thrill beneath the touch of a deitya thrill of exaltation not unmixed with fear  he bent his lips close to her ear  meriem he whispered  my little meriem  may i hope to have the right to call you my little meriem  the girl turned wide eyes upward to his face but it was in shadow she trembled but she did not draw away  the man put an arm about her and drew her closer  i love you he whispered  she did not reply  she did not know what to say  she knew nothing of love  she had never given it a thought but she did know that it was very nice to be loved whatever it meant  it was nice to have people kind to one  she had known so little of kindness or affection  tell me he said that you return my love  his lips came steadily closer to hers  they had almost touched when a vision of korak sprang like a miracle before her eyes  she saw koraks face close to hers she felt his lips hot against hers and then for the first time in her life she guessed what love meant  she drew away gently  i am not sure she said that i love you  let us wait  there is plenty of time  i am too young to marry yet and i am not sure that i should be happy in london or paristhey rather frighten me  how easily and naturally she had connected his avowal of love with the idea of marriage  the hon morison was perfectly sure that he had not mentioned marriagehe had been particularly careful not to do so  and then she was not sure that she loved him  that too came rather in the nature of a shock to his vanity  it seemed incredible that this little barbarian should have any doubts whatever as to the desirability of the hon morison baynes  the first flush of passion cooled the hon morison was enabled to reason more logically  the start had been all wrong  it would be better now to wait and prepare her mind gradually for the only proposition which his exalted estate would permit him to offer her  he would go slow  he glanced down at the girls profile  it was bathed in the silvery light of the great tropic moon  the hon  morison baynes wondered if it were to be so easy a matter to go slow  she was most alluring  meriem rose  the vision of korak was still before her  good night she said  it is almost too beautiful to leave she waved her hand in a comprehensive gesture which took in the starry heavens the great moon the broad silvered plain and the dense shadows in the distance that marked the jungle  oh how i love it  you would love london more he said earnestly  and london would love you  you would be a famous beauty in any capital of europe  you would have the world at your feet meriem  good night she repeated and left him  the hon morison selected a cigarette from his crested case lighted it blew a thin line of blue smoke toward the moon and smiled     chapter 18   meriem and bwana were sitting on the verandah together the following day when a horseman appeared in the distance riding across the plain toward the bungalow  bwana shaded his eyes with his hand and gazed out toward the oncoming rider  he was puzzled  strangers were few in central africa  even the blacks for a distance of many miles in every direction were well known to him  no white man came within a hundred miles that word of his coming did not reach bwana long before the stranger  his every move was reported to the big bwanajust what animals he killed and how many of each species how he killed them too for bwana would not permit the use of prussic acid or strychnine and how he treated his boys  several european sportsmen had been turned back to the coast by the big englishmans orders because of unwarranted cruelty to their black followers and one whose name had long been heralded in civilized communities as that of a great sportsman was driven from africa with orders never to return when bwana found that his big bag of fourteen lions had been made by the diligent use of poisoned bait  the result was that all good sportsmen and all the natives loved and respected him  his word was law where there had never been law before there was scarce a head man from coast to coast who would not heed the big bwanas commands in preference to those of the hunters who employed them and so it was easy to turn back any undesirable strangerbwana had simply to threaten to order his boys to desert him  but there was evidently one who had slipped into the country unheralded  bwana could not imagine who the approaching horseman might be  after the manner of frontier hospitality the globe round he met the newcomer at the gate welcoming him even before he had dismounted he saw a tall well knit man of thirty or over blonde of hair and smooth shaven  there was a tantalizing familiarity about him that convinced bwana that he should be able to call the visitor by name yet he was unable to do so  the newcomer was evidently of scandinavian originboth his appearance and accent denoted that  his manner was rough but open  he made a good impression upon the englishman who was wont to accept strangers in this wild and savage country at their own valuation asking no questions and assuming the best of them until they proved themselves undeserving of his friendship and hospitality  it is rather unusual that a white man comes unheralded he said as they walked together toward the field into which he had suggested that the traveler might turn his pony  my friends the natives keep us rather wellposted  it is probably due to the fact that i came from the south explained the stranger that you did not hear of my coming  i have seen no village for several marches  no there are none to the south of us for many miles replied bwana since kovudoo deserted his country i rather doubt that one could find a native in that direction under two or three hundred miles  bwana was wondering how a lone white man could have made his way through the savage unhospitable miles that lay toward the south  as though guessing what must be passing through the others mind the stranger vouchsafed an explanation  i came down from the north to do a little trading and hunting he said and got way off the beaten track  my head man who was the only member of the safari who had ever before been in the country took sick and died  we could find no natives to guide us and so i simply swung back straight north  we have been living on the fruits of our guns for over a month  didnt have an idea there was a white man within a thousand miles of us when we camped last night by a water hole at the edge of the plain  this morning i started out to hunt and saw the smoke from your chimney so i sent my gun bearer back to camp with the good news and rode straight over here myself  of course ive heard of youeverybody who comes into central africa doesand id be mighty glad of permission to rest up and hunt around here for a couple of weeks  certainly replied bwana  move your camp up close to the river below my boys camp and make yourself at home  they had reached the verandah now and bwana was introducing the stranger to meriem and my dear who had just come from the bungalows interior  this is mr hanson he said using the name the man had given him he is a trader who has lost his way in the jungle to the south  my dear and meriem bowed their acknowledgments of the introduction the man seemed rather ill at ease in their presence  his host attributed this to the fact that his guest was unaccustomed to the society of cultured women and so found a pretext to quickly extricate him from his seemingly unpleasant position and lead him away to his study and the brandy and soda which were evidently much less embarrassing to mr hanson  when the two had left them meriem turned toward my dear  it is odd she said but i could almost swear that i had known mr hanson in the past  it is odd but quite impossible and she gave the matter no further thought  hanson did not accept bwanas invitation to move his camp closer to the bungalow  he said his boys were inclined to be quarrelsome and so were better off at a distance and he himself was around but little and then always avoided coming into contact with the ladies  a fact which naturally aroused only laughing comment on the rough traders bashfulness  he accompanied the men on several hunting trips where they found him perfectly at home and well versed in all the finer points of big game hunting  of an evening he often spent much time with the white foreman of the big farm evidently finding in the society of this rougher man more common interests than the cultured guests of bwana possessed for him  so it came that his was a familiar figure about the premises by night  he came and went as he saw fit often wandering along in the great flower garden that was the especial pride and joy of my dear and meriem  the first time that he had been surprised there he apologized gruffly explaining that he had always been fond of the good old blooms of northern europe which my dear had so successfully transplanted in african soil  was it though the ever beautiful blossoms of hollyhocks and phlox that drew him to the perfumed air of the garden or that other infinitely more beautiful flower who wandered often among the blooms beneath the great moonthe blackhaired suntanned meriem  for three weeks hanson had remained  during this time he said that his boys were resting and gaining strength after their terrible ordeals in the untracked jungle to the south but he had not been as idle as he appeared to have been  he divided his small following into two parties entrusting the leadership of each to men whom he believed that he could trust  to them he explained his plans and the rich reward that they would win from him if they carried his designs to a successful conclusion  one party he moved very slowly northward along the trail that connects with the great caravan routes entering the sahara from the south  the other he ordered straight westward with orders to halt and go into permanent camp just beyond the great river which marks the natural boundary of the country that the big bwana rightfully considers almost his own  to his host he explained that he was moving his safari slowly toward the northhe said nothing of the party moving westward  then one day he announced that half his boys had deserted for a hunting party from the bungalow had come across his northerly camp and he feared that they might have noticed the reduced numbers of his following  and thus matters stood when one hot night meriem unable to sleep rose and wandered out into the garden  the hon  morison had been urging his suit once more that evening and the girls mind was in such a turmoil that she had been unable to sleep  the wide heavens about her seemed to promise a greater freedom from doubt and questioning  baynes had urged her to tell him that she loved him  a dozen times she thought that she might honestly give him the answer that he demanded  korak fast was becoming but a memory  that he was dead she had come to believe since otherwise he would have sought her out  she did not know that he had even better reason to believe her dead and that it was because of that belief he had made no effort to find her after his raid upon the village of kovudoo  behind a great flowering shrub hanson lay gazing at the stars and waiting  he had lain thus and there many nights before  for what was he waiting or for whom  he heard the girl approaching and half raised himself to his elbow  a dozen paces away the reins looped over a fence post stood his pony  meriem walking slowly approached the bush behind which the waiter lay  hanson drew a large bandanna handkerchief from his pocket and rose stealthily to his knees  a pony neighed down at the corrals  far out across the plain a lion roared  hanson changed his position until he squatted upon both feet ready to come erect quickly  again the pony neighedthis time closer  there was the sound of his body brushing against shrubbery  hanson heard and wondered how the animal had gotten from the corral for it was evident that he was already in the garden  the man turned his head in the direction of the beast  what he saw sent him to the ground huddled close beneath the shrubberya man was coming leading two ponies  meriem heard now and stopped to look and listen  a moment later the hon morison baynes drew near the two saddled mounts at his heels  meriem looked up at him in surprise  the hon morison grinned sheepishly  i couldnt sleep he explained and was going for a bit of a ride when i chanced to see you out here and i thought youd like to join me  ripping good sport you know night riding  come on  meriem laughed  the adventure appealed to her  all right she said  hanson swore beneath his breath  the two led their horses from the garden to the gate and through it  there they discovered hansons mount  why heres the traders pony remarked baynes  hes probably down visiting with the foreman said meriem  pretty late for him isnt it remarked the hon morison  id hate to have to ride back through that jungle at night to his camp  as though to give weight to his apprehensions the distant lion roared again  the hon morison shivered and glanced at the girl to note the effect of the uncanny sound upon her  she appeared not to have noticed it  a moment later the two had mounted and were moving slowly across the moonbathed plain  the girl turned her ponys head straight toward the jungle  it was in the direction of the roaring of the hungry lion  hadnt we better steer clear of that fellow suggested the hon morison  i guess you didnt hear him  yes i heard him laughed meriem  lets ride over and call on him  the hon morison laughed uneasily  he didnt care to appear at a disadvantage before this girl nor did he care either to approach a hungry lion too closely at night  he carried his rifle in his saddle boot but moonlight is an uncertain light to shoot by nor ever had he faced a lion aloneeven by day  the thought gave him a distinct nausea  the beast ceased his roaring now  they heard him no more and the hon morison gained courage accordingly  they were riding down wind toward the jungle  the lion lay in a little swale to their right he was old  for two nights he had not fed for no longer was his charge as swift or his spring as mighty as in the days of his prime when he spread terror among the creatures of his wild domain  for two nights and days he had gone empty and for long time before that he had fed only upon carrion  he was old but he was yet a terrible engine of destruction  at the edge of the forest the hon morison drew rein  he had no desire to go further  numa silent upon his padded feet crept into the jungle beyond them  the wind now was blowing gently between him and his intended prey  he had come a long way in search of man for even in his youth he had tasted human flesh and while it was poor stuff by comparison with eland and zebra it was less difficult to kill  in numas estimation man was a slowwitted slowfooted creature which commanded no respect unless accompanied by the acrid odor which spelled to the monarchs sensitive nostrils the great noise and the blinding flash of an express rifle  he caught the dangerous scent tonight but he was ravenous to madness he would face a dozen rifles if necessary to fill his empty belly he circled about into the forest that he might again be down wind from his victims for should they get his scent he could not hope to overtake them  numa was famished but he was old and crafty  deep in the jungle another caught faintly the scent of man and of numa both  he raised his head and sniffed  he cocked it upon one side and listened  come on said meriem lets ride in a waythe forest is wonderful at night  it is open enough to permit us to ride  the hon morison hesitated  he shrank from revealing his fear in the presence of the girl  a braver man sure of his own position would have had the courage to have refused uselessly to expose the girl to danger  he would not have thought of himself at all but the egotism of the hon morison required that he think always of self first  he had planned the ride to get meriem away from the bungalow  he wanted to talk to her alone and far enough away so should she take offense at his purposed suggestion he would have time in which to attempt to right himself in her eyes before they reached home  he had little doubt of course but that he should succeed but it is to his credit that he did have some slight doubts  you neednt be afraid of the lion said meriem noting his slight hesitancy  there hasnt been a man eater around here for two years bwana says and the game is so plentiful that there is no necessity to drive numa to human flesh  then he has been so often hunted that he rather keeps out of mans way  oh im not afraid of lions replied the hon morison  i was just thinking what a beastly uncomfortable place a forest is to ride in what with the underbrush and the low branches and all that you know its not exactly cut out for pleasure riding  lets go afoot then suggested meriem and started to dismount  oh no cried the hon morison aghast at this suggestion  lets ride and he reined his pony into the dark shadows of the wood behind him came meriem and in front prowling ahead waiting a favorable opportunity skulked numa the lion  out upon the plain a lone horseman muttered a low curse as he saw the two disappear from sight  it was hanson  he had followed them from the bungalow  their way led in the direction of his camp so he had a ready and plausible excuse should they discover him but they had not seen him for they had not turned their eyes behind  now he turned directly toward the spot at which they had entered the jungle  he no longer cared whether he was observed or not  there were two reasons for his indifference  the first was that he saw in baynes act a counterpart of his own planned abduction of the girl  in some way he might turn the thing to his own purposes  at least he would keep in touch with them and make sure that baynes did not get her  his other reason was based on his knowledge of an event that had transpired at his camp the previous nightan event which he had not mentioned at the bungalow for fear of drawing undesired attention to his movements and bringing the blacks of the big bwana into dangerous intercourse with his own boys  he had told at the bungalow that half his men had deserted  that story might be quickly disproved should his boys and bwanas grow confidential  the event that he had failed to mention and which now urged him hurriedly after the girl and her escort had occurred during his absence early the preceding evening  his men had been sitting around their camp fire entirely encircled by a high thorn boma when without the slightest warning a huge lion had leaped amongst them and seized one of their number  it had been solely due to the loyalty and courage of his comrades that his life had been saved and then only after a battle royal with the hungerenraged beast had they been able to drive him off with burning brands spears and rifles  from this hanson knew that a man eater had wandered into the district or been developed by the aging of one of the many lions who ranged the plains and hills by night or lay up in the cool wood by day  he had heard the roaring of a hungry lion not half an hour before and there was little doubt in his mind but that the man eater was stalking meriem and baynes  he cursed the englishman for a fool and spurred rapidly after them  meriem and baynes had drawn up in a small natural clearing  a hundred yards beyond them numa lay crouching in the underbrush his yellowgreen eyes fixed upon his prey the tip of his sinuous tail jerking spasmodically  he was measuring the distance between him and them  he was wondering if he dared venture a charge or should he wait yet a little longer in the hope that they might ride straight into his jaws  he was very hungry but also was he very crafty  he could not chance losing his meat by a hasty and illconsidered rush  had he waited the night before until the blacks slept he would not have been forced to go hungry for another twentyfour hours  behind him the other that had caught his scent and that of man together came to a sitting posture upon the branch of a tree in which he had reposed himself for slumber  beneath him a lumbering gray hulk swayed to and fro in the darkness  the beast in the tree uttered a low guttural and dropped to the back of the gray mass  he whispered a word in one of the great ears and tantor the elephant raised his trunk aloft swinging it high and low to catch the scent that the word had warned him of  there was another whispered wordwas it a commandand the lumbering beast wheeled into an awkward yet silent shuffle in the direction of numa the lion and the stranger tarmangani his rider had scented  onward they went the scent of the lion and his prey becoming stronger and stronger  numa was becoming impatient  how much longer must he wait for his meat to come his way  he lashed his tail viciously now he almost growled  all unconscious of their danger the man and the girl sat talking in the little clearing  their horses were pressed side by side  baynes had found meriems hand and was pressing it as he poured words of love into her ear and meriem was listening  come to london with me urged the hon morison  i can gather a safari and we can be a whole day upon the way to the coast before they guess that we have gone  why must we go that way asked the girl  bwana and my dear would not object to our marriage  i cannot marry you just yet explained the hon morison there are some formalities to be attended to firstyou do not understand  it will be all right  we will go to london  i cannot wait  if you love me you will come  what of the apes you lived with  did they bother about marriage  they love as we love  had you stayed among them you would have mated as they mate  it is the law of natureno manmade law can abrogate the laws of god  what difference does it make if we love one another  what do we care for anyone in the world besides ourselves  i would give my life for youwill you give nothing for me  you love me she said  you will marry me when we have reached london  i swear it he cried  i will go with you she whispered though i do not understand why it is necessary  she leaned toward him and he took her in his arms and bent to press his lips to hers  at the same instant the head of a huge tusker poked through the trees that fringed the clearing  the hon morison and meriem with eyes and ears for one another alone did not see or hear but numa did  the man upon tantors broad head saw the girl in the mans arms  it was korak but in the trim figure of the neatly garbed girl he did not recognize his meriem  he only saw a tarmangani with his she  and then numa charged  with a frightful roar fearful lest tantor had come to frighten away his prey the great beast leaped from his hiding place  the earth trembled to his mighty voice  the ponies stood for an instant transfixed with terror  the hon morison baynes went white and cold the lion was charging toward them full in the brilliant light of the magnificent moon  the muscles of the hon  morison no longer obeyed his willthey flexed to the urge of a greater powerthe power of natures first law  they drove his spurred heels deep into his ponys flanks they bore the rein against the brutes neck that wheeled him with an impetuous drive toward the plain and safety  the girls pony squealing in terror reared and plunged upon the heels of his mate  the lion was close upon him  only the girl was coolthe girl and the halfnaked savage who bestrode the neck of his mighty mount and grinned at the exciting spectacle chance had staked for his enjoyment  to korak here were but two strange tarmangani pursued by numa who was empty  it was numas right to prey but one was a she  korak felt an intuitive urge to rush to her protection  why he could not guess all tarmangani were enemies now  he had lived too long a beast to feel strongly the humanitarian impulses that were inherent in himyet feel them he did for the girl at least  he urged tantor forward  he raised his heavy spear and hurled it at the flying target of the lions body  the girls pony had reached the trees upon the opposite side of the clearing  here he would become easy prey to the swiftly moving lion but numa infuriated preferred the woman upon his back  it was for her he leaped  korak gave an exclamation of astonishment and approval as numa landed upon the ponys rump and at the same instant the girl swung free of her mount to the branches of a tree above her  koraks spear struck numa in the shoulder knocking him from his precarious hold upon the frantically plunging horse  freed of the weight of both girl and lion the pony raced ahead toward safety  numa tore and struck at the missile in his shoulder but could not dislodge it  then he resumed the chase  korak guided tantor into the seclusion of the jungle  he did not wish to be seen nor had he  hanson had almost reached the wood when he heard the lions terrific roars and knew that the charge had come  an instant later the hon morison broke upon his vision racing like mad for safety  the man lay flat upon his ponys back hugging the animals neck tightly with both arms and digging the spurs into his sides  an instant later the second pony appearedriderless  hanson groaned as he guessed what had happened out of sight in the jungle  with an oath he spurred on in the hope of driving the lion from his preyhis rifle was ready in his hand  and then the lion came into view behind the girls pony  hanson could not understand  he knew that if numa had succeeded in seizing the girl he would not have continued in pursuit of the others  he drew in his own mount took quick aim and fired  the lion stopped in his tracks turned and bit at his side then rolled over dead hanson rode on into the forest calling aloud to the girl  here i am came a quick response from the foliage of the trees just ahead  did you hit him  yes replied hanson  where are you  you had a mighty narrow escape  it will teach you to keep out of the jungle at night  together they returned to the plain where they found the hon  morison riding slowly back toward them  he explained that his pony had bolted and that he had had hard work stopping him at all  hanson grinned for he recalled the pounding heels that he had seen driving sharp spurs into the flanks of baynes mount but he said nothing of what he had seen  he took meriem up behind him and the three rode in silence toward the bungalow     chapter 19   behind them korak emerged from the jungle and recovered his spear from numas side  he still was smiling  he had enjoyed the spectacle exceedingly  there was one thing that troubled himthe agility with which the she had clambered from her ponys back into the safety of the tree above her  that was more like manganimore like his lost meriem he sighed  his lost meriem  his little dead meriem  he wondered if this she stranger resembled his meriem in other ways  a great longing to see her overwhelmed him  he looked after the three figures moving steadily across the plain  he wondered where might lie their destination  a desire to follow them came over him but he only stood there watching until they had disappeared in the distance  the sight of the civilized girl and the dapper khaki clad englishman had aroused in korak memories long dormant  once he had dreamed of returning to the world of such as these but with the death of meriem hope and ambition seemed to have deserted him he cared now only to pass the remainder of his life in solitude as far from man as possible  with a sigh he turned slowly back into the jungle  tantor nervous by nature had been far from reassured by close proximity to the three strange whites and with the report of hansons rifle had turned and ambled away at his long swinging shuffle  he was nowhere in sight when korak returned to look for him  the apeman however was little concerned by the absence of his friend  tantor had a habit of wandering off unexpectedly  for a month they might not see one another for korak seldom took the trouble to follow the great pachyderm nor did he upon this occasion  instead he found a comfortable perch in a large tree and was soon asleep  at the bungalow bwana had met the returning adventurers on the verandah  in a moment of wakefulness he had heard the report of hansons rifle far out across the plain and wondered what it might mean  presently it had occurred to him that the man whom he considered in the light of a guest might have met with an accident on his way back to camp so he had arisen and gone to his foremans quarters where he had learned that hanson had been there earlier in the evening but had departed several hours before  returning from the foremans quarters bwana had noticed that the corral gate was open and further investigation revealed the fact that meriems pony was gone and also the one most often used by baynes  instantly bwana assumed that the shot had been fired by hon morison and had again aroused his foreman and was making preparations to set forth in investigation when he had seen the party approaching across the plain  explanation on the part of the englishman met a rather chilly reception from his host  meriem was silent  she saw that bwana was angry with her  it was the first time and she was heart broken  go to your room meriem he said and baynes if you will step into my study id like to have a word with you in a moment  he stepped toward hanson as the others turned to obey him  there was something about bwana even in his gentlest moods that commanded instant obedience  how did you happen to be with them hanson he asked  id been sitting in the garden replied the trader after leaving jervis quarters  i have a habit of doing that as your lady probably knows  tonight i fell asleep behind a bush and was awakened by them two spooning  i couldnt hear what they said but presently baynes brings two ponies and they ride off  i didnt like to interfere for it wasnt any of my business but i knew they hadnt ought to be ridin about that time of night leastways not the girlit wasnt right and it wasnt safe  so i follows them and its just as well i did  baynes was gettin away from the lion as fast as he could leavin the girl to take care of herself when i got a lucky shot into the beasts shoulder that fixed him  hanson paused  both men were silent for a time  presently the trader coughed in an embarrassed manner as though there was something on his mind he felt in duty bound to say but hated to  what is it hanson asked bwana  you were about to say something werent you  well you see its like this ventured hanson  bein around here evenings a good deal ive seen them two together a lot and beggin your pardon sir but i dont think mr baynes means the girl any good ive overheard enough to make me think hes tryin to get her to run off with him  hanson to fit his own ends hit nearer the truth than he knew  he was afraid that baynes would interfere with his own plans and he had hit upon a scheme to both utilize the young englishman and get rid of him at the same time  and i thought continued the trader that inasmuch as im about due to move you might like to suggest to mr baynes that he go with me id be willin to take him north to the caravan trails as a favor to you sir  bwana stood in deep thought for a moment  presently he looked up  of course hanson mr baynes is my guest he said a grim twinkle in his eye  really i cannot accuse him of planning to run away with meriem on the evidence that we have and as he is my guest i should hate to be so discourteous as to ask him to leave but if i recall his words correctly it seems to me that he has spoken of returning home and i am sure that nothing would delight him more than going north with youyou say you start tomorrow  i think mr baynes will accompany you  drop over in the morning if you please and now good night and thank you for keeping a watchful eye on meriem  hanson hid a grin as he turned and sought his saddle  bwana stepped from the verandah to his study where he found the hon morison pacing back and forth evidently very ill at ease  baynes said bwana coming directly to the point hanson is leaving for the north tomorrow  he has taken a great fancy to you and just asked me to say to you that hed be glad to have you accompany him good night baynes  at bwanas suggestion meriem kept to her room the following morning until after the hon morison baynes had departed  hanson had come for him earlyin fact he had remained all night with the foreman jervis that they might get an early start  the farewell exchanges between the hon morison and his host were of the most formal type and when at last the guest rode away bwana breathed a sigh of relief  it had been an unpleasant duty and he was glad that it was over but he did not regret his action  he had not been blind to baynes infatuation for meriem and knowing the young mans pride in caste he had never for a moment believed that his guest would offer his name to this nameless arab girl for extremely light in color though she was for a full blood arab bwana believed her to be such  he did not mention the subject again to meriem and in this he made a mistake for the young girl while realizing the debt of gratitude she owed bwana and my dear was both proud and sensitive so that bwanas action in sending baynes away and giving her no opportunity to explain or defend hurt and mortified her  also it did much toward making a martyr of baynes in her eyes and arousing in her breast a keen feeling of loyalty toward him  what she had halfmistaken for love before she now wholly mistook for love  bwana and my dear might have told her much of the social barriers that they only too well knew baynes must feel existed between meriem and himself but they hesitated to wound her  it would have been better had they inflicted this lesser sorrow and saved the child the misery that was to follow because of her ignorance  as hanson and baynes rode toward the formers camp the englishman maintained a morose silence  the other was attempting to formulate an opening that would lead naturally to the proposition he had in mind he rode a neck behind his companion grinning as he noted the sullen scowl upon the others patrician face  rather rough on you wasnt he he ventured at last jerking his head back in the direction of the bungalow as baynes turned his eyes upon him at the remark  he thinks a lot of the girl continued hanson and dont want nobody to marry her and take her away but it looks to me as though he was doin her more harm than good in sendin you away she ought to marry some time and she couldnt do better than a fine young gentleman like you  baynes who had at first felt inclined to take offense at the mention of his private affairs by this common fellow was mollified by hansons final remark and immediately commenced to see in him a man of fine discrimination  hes a darned bounder grumbled the hon morison but ill get even with him  he may be the whole thing in central africa but im as big as he is in london and hell find it out when he comes home  if i was you said hanson i wouldnt let any man keep me from gettin the girl i want  between you and me i aint got no use for him either and if i can help you any way just call on me  its mighty good of you hanson replied baynes warming up a bit but what can a fellow do here in this godforsaken hole  i know what id do said hanson  id take the girl along with me if she loves you shell go all right  it cant be done said baynes  he bosses this whole blooming country for miles around  hed be sure to catch us  no he wouldnt not with me running things said hanson  ive been trading and hunting here for ten years and i know as much about the country as he does  if you want to take the girl along ill help you and ill guarantee that there wont nobody catch up with us before we reach the coast  ill tell you what you write her a note and ill get it to her by my head man  ask her to meet you to say goodbyeshe wont refuse that  in the meantime we can be movin camp a little further north all the time and you can make arrangements with her to be all ready on a certain night  tell her ill meet her then while you wait for us in camp  thatll be better for i know the country well and can cover it quicker than you  you can take care of the safari and be movin along slow toward the north and the girl and ill catch up to you  but suppose she wont come suggested baynes  then make another date for a last goodbye said hanson and instead of you ill be there and ill bring her along anyway  shell have to come and after its all over she wont feel so bad about itespecially after livin with you for two months while were makin the coast  a shocked and angry protest rose to baynes lips but he did not utter it for almost simultaneously came the realization that this was practically the same thing he had been planning upon himself  it had sounded brutal and criminal from the lips of the rough trader but nevertheless the young englishman saw that with hansons help and his knowledge of african travel the possibilities of success would be much greater than as though the hon morison were to attempt the thing single handed  and so he nodded a glum assent  the balance of the long ride to hansons northerly camp was made in silence for both men were occupied with their own thoughts most of which were far from being either complimentary or loyal to the other as they rode through the wood the sounds of their careless passage came to the ears of another jungle wayfarer  the killer had determined to come back to the place where he had seen the white girl who took to the trees with the ability of long habitude  there was a compelling something in the recollection of her that drew him irresistibly toward her  he wished to see her by the light of day to see her features to see the color of her eyes and hair  it seemed to him that she must bear a strong resemblance to his lost meriem and yet he knew that the chances were that she did not  the fleeting glimpse that he had had of her in the moonlight as she swung from the back of her plunging pony into the branches of the tree above her had shown him a girl of about the same height as his meriem but of a more rounded and developed femininity  now he was moving lazily back in the direction of the spot where he had seen the girl when the sounds of the approaching horsemen came to his sharp ears  he moved stealthily through the branches until he came within sight of the riders  the younger man he instantly recognized as the same he had seen with his arms about the girl in the moonlit glade just the instant before numa charged  the other he did not recognize though there was a familiarity about his carriage and figure that puzzled korak  the apeman decided that to find the girl again he would but have to keep in touch with the young englishman and so he fell in behind the pair following them to hansons camp  here the hon morison penned a brief note which hanson gave into the keeping of one of his boys who started off forthwith toward the south  korak remained in the vicinity of the camp keeping a careful watch upon the englishman  he had half expected to find the girl at the destination of the two riders and had been disappointed when no sign of her materialized about the camp  baynes was restless pacing back and forth beneath the trees when he should have been resting against the forced marches of the coming flight  hanson lay in his hammock and smoked  they spoke but little korak lay stretched upon a branch among the dense foliage above them thus passed the balance of the afternoon  korak became hungry and thirsty  he doubted that either of the men would leave camp now before morning so he withdrew but toward the south for there it seemed most likely the girl still was  in the garden beside the bungalow meriem wandered thoughtfully in the moonlight  she still smarted from bwanas to her unjust treatment of the hon morison baynes  nothing had been explained to her for both bwana and my dear had wished to spare her the mortification and sorrow of the true explanation of baynes proposal  they knew as meriem did not that the man had no intention of marrying her else he would have come directly to bwana knowing full well that no objection would be interposed if meriem really cared for him  meriem loved them both and was grateful to them for all that they had done for her but deep in her little heart surged the savage love of liberty that her years of untrammeled freedom in the jungle had made part and parcel of her being  now for the first time since she had come to them meriem felt like a prisoner in the bungalow of bwana and my dear  like a caged tigress the girl paced the length of the enclosure  once she paused near the outer fence her head upon one sidelistening what was it she had heard  the pad of naked human feet just beyond the garden  she listened for a moment  the sound was not repeated  then she resumed her restless walking  down to the opposite end of the garden she passed turned and retraced her steps toward the upper end upon the sward near the bushes that hid the fence full in the glare of the moonlight lay a white envelope that had not been there when she had turned almost upon the very spot a moment before  meriem stopped short in her tracks listening again and sniffingmore than ever the tigress alert ready  beyond the bushes a naked black runner squatted peering through the foliage  he saw her take a step closer to the letter  she had seen it  he rose quietly and following the shadows of the bushes that ran down to the corral was soon gone from sight  meriems trained ears heard his every move  she made no attempt to seek closer knowledge of his identity  already she had guessed that he was a messenger from the hon morison  she stooped and picked up the envelope  tearing it open she easily read the contents by the moons brilliant light  it was as she had guessed from baynes  i cannot go without seeing you again it read  come to the clearing early tomorrow morning and say goodbye to me  come alone  there was a little morewords that made her heart beat faster and a happy flush mount her cheek     chapter 20   it was still dark when the hon morison baynes set forth for the trysting place  he insisted upon having a guide saying that he was not sure that he could find his way back to the little clearing  as a matter of fact the thought of that lonely ride through the darkness before the sun rose had been too much for his courage and he craved company  a black therefore preceded him on foot  behind and above him came korak whom the noise in the camp had awakened  it was nine oclock before baynes drew rein in the clearing  meriem had not yet arrived  the black lay down to rest  baynes lolled in his saddle  korak stretched himself comfortably upon a lofty limb where he could watch those beneath him without being seen  an hour passed  baynes gave evidence of nervousness  korak had already guessed that the young englishman had come here to meet another nor was he at all in doubt as to the identity of that other the killer was perfectly satisfied that he was soon again to see the nimble she who had so forcefully reminded him of meriem  presently the sound of an approaching horse came to koraks ears  she was coming  she had almost reached the clearing before baynes became aware of her presence and then as he looked up the foliage parted to the head and shoulders of her mount and meriem rode into view  baynes spurred to meet her  korak looked searchingly down upon her mentally anathematizing the broadbrimmed hat that hid her features from his eyes  she was abreast the englishman now  korak saw the man take both her hands and draw her close to his breast  he saw the mans face concealed for a moment beneath the same broad brim that hid the girls he could imagine their lips meeting and a twinge of sorrow and sweet recollection combined to close his eyes for an instant in that involuntary muscular act with which we attempt to shut out from the minds eye harrowing reflections  when he looked again they had drawn apart and were conversing earnestly  korak could see the man urging something  it was equally evident that the girl was holding back  there were many of her gestures and the way in which she tossed her head up and to the right tiptilting her chin that reminded korak still more strongly of meriem  and then the conversation was over and the man took the girl in his arms again to kiss her goodbye  she turned and rode toward the point from which she had come  the man sat on his horse watching her at the edge of the jungle she turned to wave him a final farewell  tonight she cried throwing back her head as she called the words to him across the little distance which separated themthrowing back her head and revealing her face for the first time to the eyes of the killer in the tree above  korak started as though pierced through the heart with an arrow  he trembled and shook like a leaf  he closed his eyes pressing his palms across them and then he opened them again and looked but the girl was goneonly the waving foliage of the jungles rim marked where she had disappeared  it was impossible  it could not be true  and yet with his own eyes he had seen his meriemolder a little with figure more rounded by nearer maturity and subtly changed in other ways more beautiful than ever yet still his little meriem yes he had seen the dead alive again he had seen his meriem in the flesh  she lived  she had not died  he had seen herhe had seen his meriemin the arms of another man  and that man sat below him now within easy reach  korak the killer fondled his heavy spear  he played with the grass rope dangling from his geestring  he stroked the hunting knife at his hip  and the man beneath him called to his drowsy guide bent the rein to his ponys neck and moved off toward the north  still sat korak the killer alone among the trees  now his hands hung idly at his sides  his weapons and what he had intended were forgotten for the moment  korak was thinking  he had noted that subtle change in meriem  when last he had seen her she had been his little halfnaked manganiwild savage and uncouth  she had not seemed uncouth to him then but now in the change that had come over her he knew that such she had been yet no more uncouth than he and he was still uncouth  in her had taken place the change  in her he had just seen a sweet and lovely flower of refinement and civilization and he shuddered as he recalled the fate that he himself had planned for herto be the mate of an apeman his mate in the savage jungle  then he had seen no wrong in it for he had loved her and the way he had planned had been the way of the jungle which they two had chosen as their home but now after having seen the meriem of civilized attire he realized the hideousness of his once cherished plan and he thanked god that chance and the blacks of kovudoo had thwarted him  yet he still loved her and jealousy seared his soul as he recalled the sight of her in the arms of the dapper young englishman  what were his intentions toward her  did he really love her  how could one not love her  and she loved him of that korak had had ample proof  had she not loved him she would not have accepted his kisses  his meriem loved another  for a long time he let that awful truth sink deep and from it he tried to reason out his future plan of action  in his heart was a great desire to follow the man and slay him but ever there rose in his consciousness the thought she loves him  could he slay the creature meriem loved  sadly he shook his head  no he could not then came a partial decision to follow meriem and speak with her  he half started and then glanced down at his nakedness and was ashamed he the son of a british peer had thus thrown away his life had thus degraded himself to the level of a beast that he was ashamed to go to the woman he loved and lay his love at her feet  he was ashamed to go to the little arab maid who had been his jungle playmate for what had he to offer her  for years circumstances had prevented a return to his father and mother and at last pride had stepped in and expunged from his mind the last vestige of any intention to return  in a spirit of boyish adventure he had cast his lot with the jungle ape  the killing of the crook in the coast inn had filled his childish mind with terror of the law and driven him deeper into the wilds  the rebuffs that he had met at the hands of men both black and white had had their effect upon his mind while yet it was in a formative state and easily influenced  he had come to believe that the hand of man was against him and then he had found in meriem the only human association he required or craved  when she had been snatched from him his sorrow had been so deep that the thought of ever mingling again with human beings grew still more unutterably distasteful  finally and for all time he thought the die was cast  of his own volition he had become a beast a beast he had lived a beast he would die  now that it was too late he regretted it  for now meriem still living had been revealed to him in a guise of progress and advancement that had carried her completely out of his life  death itself could not have further removed her from him  in her new world she loved a man of her own kind  and korak knew that it was right  she was not for himnot for the naked savage ape  no she was not for him but he still was hers  if he could not have her and happiness he would at least do all that lay in his power to assure happiness to her  he would follow the young englishman  in the first place he would know that he meant meriem no harm and after that though jealousy wrenched his heart he would watch over the man meriem loved for meriems sake but god help that man if he thought to wrong her  slowly he aroused himself  he stood erect and stretched his great frame the muscles of his arms gliding sinuously beneath his tanned skin as he bent his clenched fists behind his head  a movement on the ground beneath caught his eye  an antelope was entering the clearing immediately korak became aware that he was emptyagain he was a beast for a moment love had lifted him to sublime heights of honor and renunciation  the antelope was crossing the clearing  korak dropped to the ground upon the opposite side of the tree and so lightly that not even the sensitive ears of the antelope apprehended his presence  he uncoiled his grass ropeit was the latest addition to his armament yet he was proficient with it  often he traveled with nothing more than his knife and his ropethey were light and easy to carry  his spear and bow and arrows were cumbersome and he usually kept one or all of them hidden away in a private cache  now he held a single coil of the long rope in his right hand and the balance in his left  the antelope was but a few paces from him silently korak leaped from his hiding place swinging the rope free from the entangling shrubbery  the antelope sprang away almost instantly but instantly too the coiled rope with its sliding noose flew through the air above him  with unerring precision it settled about the creatures neck  there was a quick wrist movement of the thrower the noose tightened  the killer braced himself with the rope across his hip and as the antelope tautened the singing strands in a last frantic bound for liberty he was thrown over upon his back  then instead of approaching the fallen animal as a roper of the western plains might do korak dragged his captive to himself pulling him in hand over hand and when he was within reach leaping upon him even as sheeta the panther might have done and burying his teeth in the animals neck while he found its heart with the point of his hunting knife  recoiling his rope he cut a few generous strips from his kill and took to the trees again where he ate in peace  later he swung off in the direction of a nearby water hole and then he slept  in his mind of course was the suggestion of another meeting between meriem and the young englishman that had been borne to him by the girls parting  tonight  he had not followed meriem because he knew from the direction from which she had come and in which she returned that wheresoever she had found an asylum it lay out across the plains and not wishing to be discovered by the girl he had not cared to venture into the open after her  it would do as well to keep in touch with the young man and that was precisely what he intended doing  to you or me the possibility of locating the hon morison in the jungle after having permitted him to get such a considerable start might have seemed remote but to korak it was not at all so  he guessed that the white man would return to his camp but should he have done otherwise it would be a simple matter to the killer to trail a mounted man accompanied by another on foot  days might pass and still such a spoor would be sufficiently plain to lead korak unfalteringly to its end while a matter of a few hours only left it as clear to him as though the makers themselves were still in plain sight  and so it came that a few minutes after the hon morison baynes entered the camp to be greeted by hanson korak slipped noiselessly into a nearby tree  there he lay until late afternoon and still the young englishman made no move to leave camp  korak wondered if meriem were coming there  a little later hanson and one of his black boys rode out of camp  korak merely noted the fact  he was not particularly interested in what any other member of the company than the young englishman did  darkness came and still the young man remained  he ate his evening meal afterward smoking numerous cigarettes  presently he began to pace back and forth before his tent  he kept his boy busy replenishing the fire  a lion coughed and he went into his tent to reappear with an express rifle  again he admonished the boy to throw more brush upon the fire  korak saw that he was nervous and afraid and his lip curled in a sneer of contempt  was this the creature who had supplanted him in the heart of his meriem  was this a man who trembled when numa coughed  how could such as he protect meriem from the countless dangers of the jungle ah but he would not have to  they would live in the safety of european civilization where men in uniforms were hired to protect them  what need had a european of prowess to protect his mate  again the sneer curled koraks lip  hanson and his boy had ridden directly to the clearing  it was already dark when they arrived  leaving the boy there hanson rode to the edge of the plain leading the boys horse  there he waited  it was nine oclock before he saw a solitary figure galloping toward him from the direction of the bungalow  a few moments later meriem drew in her mount beside him  she was nervous and flushed  when she recognized hanson she drew back startled  mr baynes horse fell on him and sprained his ankle hanson hastened to explain  he couldnt very well come so he sent me to meet you and bring you to camp  the girl could not see in the darkness the gloating triumphant expression on the speakers face  we had better hurry continued hanson for well have to move along pretty fast if we dont want to be overtaken  is he hurt badly asked meriem  only a little sprain replied hanson  he can ride all right but we both thought hed better lie up tonight and rest for hell have plenty hard riding in the next few weeks  yes agreed the girl  hanson swung his pony about and meriem followed him  they rode north along the edge of the jungle for a mile and then turned straight into it toward the west  meriem following payed little attention to directions  she did not know exactly where hansons camp lay and so she did not guess that he was not leading her toward it  all night they rode straight toward the west  when morning came hanson permitted a short halt for breakfast which he had provided in wellfilled saddle bags before leaving his camp  then they pushed on again nor did they halt a second time until in the heat of the day he stopped and motioned the girl to dismount  we will sleep here for a time and let the ponies graze he said  i had no idea the camp was so far away said meriem  i left orders that they were to move on at day break explained the trader so that we could get a good start  i knew that you and i could easily overtake a laden safari  it may not be until tomorrow that well catch up with them  but though they traveled part of the night and all the following day no sign of the safari appeared ahead of them  meriem an adept in jungle craft knew that none had passed ahead of them for many days occasionally she saw indications of an old spoor a very old spoor of many men  for the most part they followed this wellmarked trail along elephant paths and through parklike groves  it was an ideal trail for rapid traveling  meriem at last became suspicious  gradually the attitude of the man at her side had begun to change  often she surprised him devouring her with his eyes  steadily the former sensation of previous acquaintanceship urged itself upon her  somewhere sometime before she had known this man  it was evident that he had not shaved for several days  a blonde stubble had commenced to cover his neck and cheeks and chin and with it the assurance that he was no stranger continued to grow upon the girl  it was not until the second day however that meriem rebelled  she drew in her pony at last and voiced her doubts hanson assured her that the camp was but a few miles further on  we should have overtaken them yesterday he said  they must have marched much faster than i had believed possible  they have not marched here at all said meriem  the spoor that we have been following is weeks old  hanson laughed  oh thats it is it he cried  why didnt you say so before  i could have easily explained  we are not coming by the same route but well pick up their trail sometime today even if we dont overtake them  now at last meriem knew the man was lying to her  what a fool he must be to think that anyone could believe such a ridiculous explanation  who was so stupid as to believe that they could have expected to overtake another party and he had certainly assured her that momentarily he expected to do so when that partys route was not to meet theirs for several miles yet  she kept her own counsel however planning to escape at the first opportunity when she might have a sufficient start of her captor as she now considered him to give her some assurance of outdistancing him  she watched his face continually when she could without being observed  tantalizingly the placing of his familiar features persisted in eluding her  where had she known him  under what conditions had they met before she had seen him about the farm of bwana  she ran over in her mind all the few white men she ever had known  there were some who had come to her fathers douar in the jungle  few it is true but there had been some  ah now she had it  she had seen him there  she almost seized upon his identity and then in an instant it had slipped from her again  it was mid afternoon when they suddenly broke out of the jungle upon the banks of a broad and placid river  beyond upon the opposite shore meriem described a camp surrounded by a high thorn boma  here we are at last said hanson  he drew his revolver and fired in the air  instantly the camp across the river was astir  black men ran down the rivers bank  hanson hailed them  but there was no sign of the hon morison baynes  in accordance with their masters instructions the blacks manned a canoe and rowed across  hanson placed meriem in the little craft and entered it himself leaving two boys to watch the horses which the canoe was to return for and swim across to the camp side of the river  once in the camp meriem asked for baynes  for the moment her fears had been allayed by the sight of the camp which she had come to look upon as more or less a myth  hanson pointed toward the single tent that stood in the center of the enclosure  there he said and preceded her toward it  at the entrance he held the flap aside and motioned her within  meriem entered and looked about  the tent was empty  she turned toward hanson  there was a broad grin on his face  where is mr baynes she demanded  he aint here replied hanson  leastwise i dont see him do you but im here and im a damned sight better man than that thing ever was  you dont need him no moreyou got me and he laughed uproariously and reached for her  meriem struggled to free herself  hanson encircled her arms and body in his powerful grip and bore her slowly backward toward the pile of blankets at the far end of the tent  his face was bent close to hers his eyes were narrowed to two slits of heat and passion and desire meriem was looking full into his face as she fought for freedom when there came over her a sudden recollection of a similar scene in which she had been a participant and with it full recognition of her assailant  he was the swede malbihn who had attacked her once before who had shot his companion who would have saved her and from whom she had been rescued by bwana  his smooth face had deceived her but now with the growing beard and the similarity of conditions recognition came swift and sure  but today there would be no bwana to save her     chapter 21   the black boy whom malbihn had left awaiting him in the clearing with instructions to remain until he returned sat crouched at the foot of a tree for an hour when he was suddenly startled by the coughing grunt of a lion behind him  with celerity born of the fear of death the boy clambered into the branches of the tree and a moment later the king of beasts entered the clearing and approached the carcass of an antelope which until now the boy had not seen  until daylight the beast fed while the black clung sleepless to his perch wondering what had become of his master and the two ponies  he had been with malbihn for a year and so was fairly conversant with the character of the white  his knowledge presently led him to believe that he had been purposely abandoned  like the balance of malbihns followers this boy hated his master cordiallyfear being the only bond that held him to the white man  his present uncomfortable predicament but added fuel to the fires of his hatred  as the sun rose the lion withdrew into the jungle and the black descended from his tree and started upon his long journey back to camp in his primitive brain revolved various fiendish plans for a revenge that he would not have the courage to put into effect when the test came and he stood face to face with one of the dominant race  a mile from the clearing he came upon the spoor of two ponies crossing his path at right angles  a cunning look entered the blacks eyes  he laughed uproariously and slapped his thighs  negroes are tireless gossipers which of course is but a roundabout way of saying that they are human  malbihns boys had been no exception to the rule and as many of them had been with him at various times during the past ten years there was little about his acts and life in the african wilds that was not known directly or by hearsay to them all  and so knowing his master and many of his past deeds knowing too a great deal about the plans of malbihn and baynes that had been overheard by himself or other servants and knowing well from the gossip of the headmen that half of malbihns party lay in camp by the great river far to the west it was not difficult for the boy to put two and two together and arrive at four as the sumthe four being represented by a firm conviction that his master had deceived the other white man and taken the latters woman to his western camp leaving the other to suffer capture and punishment at the hands of the big bwana whom all feared  again the boy bared his rows of big white teeth and laughed aloud  then he resumed his northward way traveling at a dogged trot that ate up the miles with marvelous rapidity  in the swedes camp the hon morison had spent an almost sleepless night of nervous apprehension and doubts and fears  toward morning he had slept utterly exhausted  it was the headman who awoke him shortly after sun rise to remind him that they must at once take up their northward journey  baynes hung back  he wanted to wait for hanson and meriem  the headman urged upon him the danger that lay in loitering  the fellow knew his masters plans sufficiently well to understand that he had done something to arouse the ire of the big bwana and that it would fare ill with them all if they were overtaken in big bwanas country  at the suggestion baynes took alarm  what if the big bwana as the headman called him had surprised hanson in his nefarious work  would he not guess the truth and possibly be already on the march to overtake and punish him  baynes had heard much of his hosts summary method of dealing out punishment to malefactors great and small who transgressed the laws or customs of his savage little world which lay beyond the outer ramparts of what men are pleased to call frontiers  in this savage world where there was no law the big bwana was law unto himself and all who dwelt about him  it was even rumored that he had extracted the death penalty from a white man who had maltreated a native girl  baynes shuddered at the recollection of this piece of gossip as he wondered what his host would exact of the man who had attempted to steal his young white ward  the thought brought him to his feet  yes he said nervously we must get away from here at once  do you know the trail to the north  the headman did and he lost no time in getting the safari upon the march  it was noon when a tired and sweatcovered runner overtook the trudging little column  the man was greeted with shouts of welcome from his fellows to whom he imparted all that he knew and guessed of the actions of their master so that the entire safari was aware of matters before baynes who marched close to the head of the column was reached and acquainted with the facts and the imaginings of the black boy whom malbihn had deserted in the clearing the night before  when the hon morison had listened to all that the boy had to say and realized that the trader had used him as a tool whereby he himself might get meriem into his possession his blood ran hot with rage and he trembled with apprehension for the girls safety  that another contemplated no worse a deed than he had contemplated in no way palliated the hideousness of the others offense  at first it did not occur to him that he would have wronged meriem no less than he believed hanson contemplated wronging her  now his rage was more the rage of a man beaten at his own game and robbed of the prize that he had thought already his  do you know where your master has gone he asked the black  yes bwana replied the boy  he has gone to the other camp beside the big afi that flows far toward the setting sun  can you take me to him demanded baynes  the boy nodded affirmatively  here he saw a method of revenging himself upon his hated bwana and at the same time of escaping the wrath of the big bwana whom all were positive would first follow after the northerly safari  can you and i alone reach his camp asked the hon morison  yes bwana assured the black  baynes turned toward the headman  he was conversant with hansons plans now  he understood why he had wished to move the northern camp as far as possible toward the northern boundary of the big bwanas countryit would give him far more time to make his escape toward the west coast while the big bwana was chasing the northern contingent well he would utilize the mans plans to his own end  he too must keep out of the clutches of his host  you may take the men north as fast as possible he said to the headman  i shall return and attempt to lead the big bwana to the west  the negro assented with a grunt  he had no desire to follow this strange white man who was afraid at night he had less to remain at the tender mercies of the big bwanas lusty warriors between whom and his people there was longstanding blood feud and he was more than delighted into the bargain for a legitimate excuse for deserting his much hated swede master  he knew a way to the north and his own country that the white men did not knowa short cut across an arid plateau where lay water holes of which the white hunters and explorers that had passed from time to time the fringe of the dry country had never dreamed  he might even elude the big bwana should he follow them and with this thought uppermost in his mind he gathered the remnants of malbihns safari into a semblance of order and moved off toward the north  and toward the southwest the black boy led the hon morison baynes into the jungles  korak had waited about the camp watching the hon morison until the safari had started north  then assured that the young englishman was going in the wrong direction to meet meriem he had abandoned him and returned slowly to the point where he had seen the girl for whom his heart yearned in the arms of another  so great had been his happiness at seeing meriem alive that for the instant no thought of jealousy had entered his mind  later these thoughts had comedark bloody thoughts that would have made the flesh of the hon morison creep could he have guessed that they were revolving in the brain of a savage creature creeping stealthily among the branches of the forest giant beneath which he waited the coming of hanson and the girl  and with passing of the hours had come subdued reflection in which he had weighed himself against the trimly clad english gentleman andfound that he was wanting  what had he to offer her by comparison with that which the other man might offer  what was his mess of pottage to the birthright that the other had preserved  how could he dare go naked and unkempt to that fair thing who had once been his junglefellow and propose the thing that had been in his mind when first the realization of his love had swept over him  he shuddered as he thought of the irreparable wrong that his love would have done the innocent child but for the chance that had snatched her from him before it was too late  doubtless she knew now the horror that had been in his mind  doubtless she hated and loathed him as he hated and loathed himself when he let his mind dwell upon it  he had lost her  no more surely had she been lost when he thought her dead than she was in reality now that he had seen her livingliving in the guise of a refinement that had transfigured and sanctified her  he had loved her before now he worshipped her  he knew that he might never possess her now but at least he might see her  from a distance he might look upon her  perhaps he might serve her but never must she guess that he had found her or that he lived  he wondered if she ever thought of himif the happy days that they had spent together never recurred to her mind  it seemed unbelievable that such could be the case and yet too it seemed almost equally unbelievable that this beautiful girl was the same disheveled half naked little sprite who skipped nimbly among the branches of the trees as they ran and played in the lazy happy days of the past  it could not be that her memory held more of the past than did her new appearance  it was a sad korak who ranged the jungle near the plains edge waiting for the coming of his meriemthe meriem who never came  but there came anothera tall broadshouldered man in khaki at the head of a swarthy crew of ebon warriors  the mans face was set in hard stern lines and the marks of sorrow were writ deep about his mouth and eyesso deep that the set expression of rage upon his features could not obliterate them  korak saw the man pass beneath him where he hid in the great tree that had harbored him before upon the edge of that fateful little clearing he saw him come and he set rigid and frozen and suffering above him he saw him search the ground with his keen eyes and he only sat there watching with eyes that glazed from the intensity of his gaze  he saw him sign to his men that he had come upon that which he sought and he saw him pass out of sight toward the north and still korak sat like a graven image with a heart that bled in dumb misery  an hour later korak moved slowly away back into the jungle toward the west  he went listlessly with bent head and stooped shoulders like an old man who bore upon his back the weight of a great sorrow  baynes following his black guide battled his way through the dense underbrush riding stooped low over his horses neck or often he dismounted where the low branches swept too close to earth to permit him to remain in the saddle  the black was taking him the shortest way which was no way at all for a horseman and after the first days march the young englishman was forced to abandon his mount and follow his nimble guide entirely on foot  during the long hours of marching the hon morison had much time to devote to thought and as he pictured the probable fate of meriem at the hands of the swede his rage against the man became the greater but presently there came to him a realization of the fact that his own base plans had led the girl into this terrible predicament and that even had she escaped hanson she would have found but little better deserts awaiting her with him  there came too the realization that meriem was infinitely more precious to him than he had imagined  for the first time he commenced to compare her with other women of his acquaintancewomen of birth and positionand almost to his surprisehe discovered that the young arab girl suffered less than they by the comparison  and then from hating hanson he came to look upon himself with hate and loathingto see himself and his perfidious act in all their contemptible hideousness  thus in the crucible of shame amidst the white heat of naked truths the passion that the man had felt for the girl he had considered his social inferior was transmuted into love  and as he staggered on there burned within him beside his newborn love another great passionthe passion of hate urging him on to the consummation of revenge  a creature of ease and luxury he had never been subjected to the hardships and tortures which now were his constant companionship yet his clothing torn his flesh scratched and bleeding he urged the black to greater speed though with every dozen steps he himself fell from exhaustion  it was revenge which kept him goingthat and a feeling that in his suffering he was partially expiating the great wrong he had done the girl he lovedfor hope of saving her from the fate into which he had trapped her had never existed  too late  too late was the dismal accompaniment of thought to which he marched  too late  too late to save but not too late to avenge  that kept him up  only when it became too dark to see would he permit of a halt  a dozen times in the afternoon he had threatened the black with instant death when the tired guide insisted upon resting  the fellow was terrified he could not understand the remarkable change that had so suddenly come over the white man who had been afraid in the dark the night before he would have deserted this terrifying master had he had the opportunity but baynes guessed that some such thought might be in the others mind and so gave the fellow none  he kept close to him by day and slept touching him at night in the rude thorn boma they constructed as a slight protection against prowling carnivora  that the hon morison could sleep at all in the midst of the savage jungle was sufficient indication that he had changed considerably in the past twentyfour hours and that he could lie close beside a nonetoofragrant black man spoke of possibilities for democracy within him yet all undreamed of  morning found him stiff and lame and sore but none the less determined to push on in pursuit of hanson as rapidly as possible  with his rifle he brought down a buck at a ford in a small stream shortly after they broke camp breakfastless  begrudgingly he permitted a halt while they cooked and ate and then on again through the wilderness of trees and vines and underbrush  and in the meantime korak wandered slowly westward coming upon the trail of tantor the elephant whom he overtook browsing in the deep shade of the jungle  the apeman lonely and sorrowing was glad of the companionship of his huge friend  affectionately the sinuous trunk encircled him and he was swung to the mighty back where so often before he had lolled and dreamed the long afternoon away  far to the north the big bwana and his black warriors clung tenaciously to the trail of the fleeing safari that was luring them further and further from the girl they sought to save while back at the bungalow the woman who had loved meriem as though she had been her own waited impatiently and in sorrow for the return of the rescuing party and the girl she was positive her invincible lord and master would bring back with him     chapter 22   as meriem struggled with malbihn her hands pinioned to her sides by his brawny grip hope died within her  she did not utter a sound for she knew that there was none to come to her assistance and too the jungle training of her earlier life had taught her the futility of appeals for succor in the savage world of her upbringing  but as she fought to free herself one hand came in contact with the butt of malbihns revolver where it rested in the holster at his hip slowly he was dragging her toward the blankets and slowly her fingers encircled the coveted prize and drew it from its resting place  then as malbihn stood at the edge of the disordered pile of blankets meriem suddenly ceased to draw away from him and as quickly hurled her weight against him with the result that he was thrown backward his feet stumbled against the bedding and he was hurled to his back instinctively his hands flew out to save himself and at the same instant meriem leveled the revolver at his breast and pulled the trigger  but the hammer fell futilely upon an empty shell and malbihn was again upon his feet clutching at her  for a moment she eluded him and ran toward the entrance to the tent but at the very doorway his heavy hand fell upon her shoulder and dragged her back  wheeling upon him with the fury of a wounded lioness meriem grasped the long revolver by the barrel swung it high above her head and crashed it down full in malbihns face  with an oath of pain and rage the man staggered backward releasing his hold upon her and then sank unconscious to the ground  without a backward look meriem turned and fled into the open  several of the blacks saw her and tried to intercept her flight but the menace of the empty weapon kept them at a distance  and so she won beyond the encircling boma and disappeared into the jungle to the south  straight into the branches of a tree she went true to the arboreal instincts of the little mangani she had been and here she stripped off her riding skirt her shoes and her stockings for she knew that she had before her a journey and a flight which would not brook the burden of these garments  her riding breeches and jacket would have to serve as protection from cold and thorns nor would they hamper her over much but a skirt and shoes were impossible among the trees  she had not gone far before she commenced to realize how slight were her chances for survival without means of defense or a weapon to bring down meat  why had she not thought to strip the cartridge belt from malbihns waist before she had left his tent  with cartridges for the revolver she might hope to bag small game and to protect herself from all but the most ferocious of the enemies that would beset her way back to the beloved hearthstone of bwana and my dear  with the thought came determination to return and obtain the coveted ammunition  she realized that she was taking great chances of recapture but without means of defense and of obtaining meat she felt that she could never hope to reach safety  and so she turned her face back toward the camp from which she had but just escaped  she thought malbihn dead so terrific a blow had she dealt him and she hoped to find an opportunity after dark to enter the camp and search his tent for the cartridge belt but scarcely had she found a hiding place in a great tree at the edge of the boma where she could watch without danger of being discovered when she saw the swede emerge from his tent wiping blood from his face and hurling a volley of oaths and questions at his terrified followers  shortly after the entire camp set forth in search of her and when meriem was positive that all were gone she descended from her hiding place and ran quickly across the clearing to malbihns tent  a hasty survey of the interior revealed no ammunition but in one corner was a box in which were packed the swedes personal belongings that he had sent along by his headman to this westerly camp  meriem seized the receptacle as the possible container of extra ammunition  quickly she loosed the cords that held the canvas covering about the box and a moment later had raised the lid and was rummaging through the heterogeneous accumulation of odds and ends within  there were letters and papers and cuttings from old newspapers and among other things the photograph of a little girl upon the back of which was pasted a cutting from a paris dailya cutting that she could not read yellowed and dimmed by age and handlingbut something about the photograph of the little girl which was also reproduced in the newspaper cutting held her attention  where had she seen that picture before  and then quite suddenly it came to her that this was a picture of herself as she had been years and years before  where had it been taken  how had it come into the possession of this man  why had it been reproduced in a newspaper  what was the story that the faded type told of it  meriem was baffled by the puzzle that her search for ammunition had revealed  she stood gazing at the faded photograph for a time and then bethought herself of the ammunition for which she had come  turning again to the box she rummaged to the bottom and there in a corner she came upon a little box of cartridges  a single glance assured her that they were intended for the weapon she had thrust inside the band of her riding breeches and slipping them into her pocket she turned once more for an examination of the baffling likeness of herself that she held in her hand  as she stood thus in vain endeavor to fathom this inexplicable mystery the sound of voices broke upon her ears  instantly she was all alert they were coming closer  a second later she recognized the lurid profanity of the swede  malbihn her persecutor was returning meriem ran quickly to the opening of the tent and looked out  it was too late  she was fairly cornered  the white man and three of his black henchmen were coming straight across the clearing toward the tent  what was she to do  she slipped the photograph into her waist quickly she slipped a cartridge into each of the chambers of the revolver  then she backed toward the end of the tent keeping the entrance covered by her weapon  the man stopped outside and meriem could hear malbihn profanely issuing instructions  he was a long time about it and while he talked in his bellowing brutish voice the girl sought some avenue of escape  stooping she raised the bottom of the canvas and looked beneath and beyond  there was no one in sight upon that side  throwing herself upon her stomach she wormed beneath the tent wall just as malbihn with a final word to his men entered the tent  meriem heard him cross the floor and then she rose and stooping low ran to a native hut directly behind  once inside this she turned and glanced back  there was no one in sight  she had not been seen  and now from malbihns tent she heard a great cursing  the swede had discovered the rifling of his box  he was shouting to his men and as she heard them reply meriem darted from the hut and ran toward the edge of the boma furthest from malbihns tent  overhanging the boma at this point was a tree that had been too large in the eyes of the restloving blacks to cut down  so they had terminated the boma just short of it  meriem was thankful for whatever circumstance had resulted in the leaving of that particular tree where it was since it gave her the muchneeded avenue of escape which she might not otherwise have had  from her hiding place she saw malbihn again enter the jungle this time leaving a guard of three of his boys in the camp  he went toward the south and after he had disappeared meriem skirted the outside of the enclosure and made her way to the river  here lay the canoes that had been used in bringing the party from the opposite shore  they were unwieldy things for a lone girl to handle but there was no other way and she must cross the river  the landing place was in full view of the guard at the camp  to risk the crossing under their eyes would have meant undoubted capture  her only hope lay in waiting until darkness had fallen unless some fortuitous circumstance should arise before  for an hour she lay watching the guard one of whom seemed always in a position where he would immediately discover her should she attempt to launch one of the canoes  presently malbihn appeared coming out of the jungle hot and puffing he ran immediately to the river where the canoes lay and counted them it was evident that it had suddenly occurred to him that the girl must cross here if she wished to return to her protectors  the expression of relief on his face when he found that none of the canoes was gone was ample evidence of what was passing in his mind  he turned and spoke hurriedly to the head man who had followed him out of the jungle and with whom were several other blacks  following malbihns instructions they launched all the canoes but one malbihn called to the guards in the camp and a moment later the entire party had entered the boats and were paddling up stream  meriem watched them until a bend in the river directly above the camp hid them from her sight  they were gone  she was alone and they had left a canoe in which lay a paddle  she could scarce believe the good fortune that had come to her  to delay now would be suicidal to her hopes  quickly she ran from her hiding place and dropped to the ground  a dozen yards lay between her and the canoe  up stream beyond the bend malbihn ordered his canoes in to shore  he landed with his head man and crossed the little point slowly in search of a spot where he might watch the canoe he had left at the landing place  he was smiling in anticipation of the almost certain success of his stratagemsooner or later the girl would come back and attempt to cross the river in one of their canoes  it might be that the idea would not occur to her for some time  they might have to wait a day or two days but that she would come if she lived or was not captured by the men he had scouting the jungle for her malbihn was sure  that she would come so soon however he had not guessed and so when he topped the point and came again within sight of the river he saw that which drew an angry oath from his lipshis quarry already was half way across the river  turning he ran rapidly back to his boats the head man at his heels throwing themselves in malbihn urged his paddlers to their most powerful efforts  the canoes shot out into the stream and down with the current toward the fleeing quarry  she had almost completed the crossing when they came in sight of her  at the same instant she saw them and redoubled her efforts to reach the opposite shore before they should overtake her  two minutes start of them was all meriem cared for  once in the trees she knew that she could outdistance and elude them  her hopes were highthey could not overtake her nowshe had had too good a start of them  malbihn urging his men onward with a stream of hideous oaths and blows from his fists realized that the girl was again slipping from his clutches  the leading canoe in the bow of which he stood was yet a hundred yards behind the fleeing meriem when she ran the point of her craft beneath the overhanging trees on the shore of safety  malbihn screamed to her to halt  he seemed to have gone mad with rage at the realization that he could not overtake her and then he threw his rifle to his shoulder aimed carefully at the slim figure scrambling into the trees and fired  malbihn was an excellent shot  his misses at so short a distance were practically nonexistent nor would he have missed this time but for an accident occurring at the very instant that his finger tightened upon the triggeran accident to which meriem owed her lifethe providential presence of a waterlogged tree trunk one end of which was embedded in the mud of the river bottom and the other end of which floated just beneath the surface where the prow of malbihns canoe ran upon it as he fired  the slight deviation of the boats direction was sufficient to throw the muzzle of the rifle out of aim  the bullet whizzed harmlessly by meriems head and an instant later she had disappeared into the foliage of the tree  there was a smile on her lips as she dropped to the ground to cross a little clearing where once had stood a native village surrounded by its fields  the ruined huts still stood in crumbling decay  the rank vegetation of the jungle overgrew the cultivated ground  small trees already had sprung up in what had been the village street but desolation and loneliness hung like a pall above the scene  to meriem however it presented but a place denuded of large trees which she must cross quickly to regain the jungle upon the opposite side before malbihn should have landed  the deserted huts were to her all the better because they were desertedshe did not see the keen eyes watching her from a dozen points from tumbling doorways from behind tottering granaries  in utter unconsciousness of impending danger she started up the village street because it offered the clearest pathway to the jungle  a mile away toward the east fighting his way through the jungle along the trail taken by malbihn when he had brought meriem to his camp a man in torn khakifilthy haggard unkemptcame to a sudden stop as the report of malbihns rifle resounded faintly through the tangled forest  the black man just ahead of him stopped too  we are almost there bwana he said  there was awe and respect in his tone and manner  the white man nodded and motioned his ebon guide forward once more  it was the hon morison baynesthe fastidiousthe exquisite  his face and hands were scratched and smeared with dried blood from the wounds he had come by in thorn and thicket  his clothes were tatters  but through the blood and the dirt and the rags a new baynes shone fortha handsomer baynes than the dandy and the fop of yore  in the heart and soul of every son of woman lies the germ of manhood and honor  remorse for a scurvy act and an honorable desire to right the wrong he had done the woman he now knew he really loved had excited these germs to rapid growth in morison baynesand the metamorphosis had taken place  onward the two stumbled toward the point from which the single rifle shot had come  the black was unarmedbaynes fearing his loyalty had not dared trust him even to carry the rifle which the white man would have been glad to be relieved of many times upon the long march but now that they were approaching their goal and knowing as he did that hatred of malbihn burned hot in the black mans brain baynes handed him the rifle for he guessed that there would be fightinghe intended that there should for he had come to avenge  himself an excellent revolver shot would depend upon the smaller weapon at his side  as the two forged ahead toward their goal they were startled by a volley of shots ahead of them  then came a few scattering reports some savage yells and silence  baynes was frantic in his endeavors to advance more rapidly but there the jungle seemed a thousand times more tangled than before  a dozen times he tripped and fell  twice the black followed a blind trail and they were forced to retrace their steps but at last they came out into a little clearing near the big afia clearing that once held a thriving village but lay somber and desolate in decay and ruin  in the jungle vegetation that overgrew what had once been the main village street lay the body of a black man pierced through the heart with a bullet and still warm  baynes and his companion looked about in all directions but no sign of living being could they discover they stood in silence listening intently  what was that  voices and the dip of paddles out upon the river  baynes ran across the dead village toward the fringe of jungle upon the rivers brim  the black was at his side  together they forced their way through the screening foliage until they could obtain a view of the river and there almost to the other shore they saw malbihns canoes making rapidly for camp  the black recognized his companions immediately  how can we cross asked baynes  the black shook his head  there was no canoe and the crocodiles made it equivalent to suicide to enter the water in an attempt to swim across  just then the fellow chanced to glance downward  beneath him wedged among the branches of a tree lay the canoe in which meriem had escaped  the negro grasped baynes arm and pointed toward his find the hon morison could scarce repress a shout of exultation  quickly the two slid down the drooping branches into the boat  the black seized the paddle and baynes shoved them out from beneath the tree  a second later the canoe shot out upon the bosom of the river and headed toward the opposite shore and the camp of the swede  baynes squatted in the bow straining his eyes after the men pulling the other canoes upon the bank across from him  he saw malbihn step from the bow of the foremost of the little craft  he saw him turn and glance back across the river  he could see his start of surprise as his eyes fell upon the pursuing canoe and called the attention of his followers to it  then he stood waiting for there was but one canoe and two menlittle danger to him and his followers in that  malbihn was puzzled  who was this white man  he did not recognize him though baynes canoe was now in mid stream and the features of both its occupants plainly discernible to those on shore  one of malbihns blacks it was who first recognized his fellow black in the person of baynes companion then malbihn guessed who the white man must be though he could scarce believe his own reasoning  it seemed beyond the pale of wildest conjecture to suppose that the hon  morison baynes had followed him through the jungle with but a single companionand yet it was true beneath the dirt and dishevelment he recognized him at last and in the necessity of admitting that it was he malbihn was forced to recognize the incentive that had driven baynes the weakling and coward through the savage jungle upon his trail  the man had come to demand an accounting and to avenge  it seemed incredible and yet there could be no other explanation  malbihn shrugged  well others had sought malbihn for similar reasons in the course of a long and checkered career  he fingered his rifle and waited  now the canoe was within easy speaking distance of the shore  what do you want yelled malbihn raising his weapon threateningly  the hon morison baynes leaped to his feet  you damn you he shouted whipping out his revolver and firing almost simultaneously with the swede  as the two reports rang out malbihn dropped his rifle clutched frantically at his breast staggered fell first to his knees and then lunged upon his face  baynes stiffened  his head flew back spasmodically  for an instant he stood thus and then crumpled very gently into the bottom of the boat  the black paddler was at a loss as to what to do  if malbihn really were dead he could continue on to join his fellows without fear but should the swede only be wounded he would be safer upon the far shore therefore he hesitated holding the canoe in mid stream  he had come to have considerable respect for his new master and was not unmoved by his death  as he sat gazing at the crumpled body in the bow of the boat he saw it move  very feebly the man essayed to turn over  he still lived  the black moved forward and lifted him to a sitting position  he was standing in front of him his paddle in one hand asking baynes where he was hit when there was another shot from shore and the negro pitched headlong overboard his paddle still clutched in his dead fingersshot through the forehead  baynes turned weakly in the direction of the shore to see malbihn drawn up upon his elbows levelling his rifle at him  the englishman slid to the bottom of the canoe as a bullet whizzed above him  malbihn sore hit took longer in aiming nor was his aim as sure as formerly  with difficulty baynes turned himself over on his belly and grasping his revolver in his right hand drew himself up until he could look over the edge of the canoe  malbihn saw him instantly and fired but baynes did not flinch or duck with painstaking care he aimed at the target upon the shore from which he now was drifting with the current  his finger closed upon the triggerthere was a flash and a report and malbihns giant frame jerked to the impact of another bullet  but he was not yet dead  again he aimed and fired the bullet splintering the gunwale of the canoe close by baynes face  baynes fired again as his canoe drifted further down stream and malbihn answered from the shore where he lay in a pool of his own blood  and thus doggedly the two wounded men continued to carry on their weird duel until the winding african river had carried the hon  morison baynes out of sight around a wooded point     chapter 23   meriem had traversed half the length of the village street when a score of whiterobed negroes and halfcastes leaped out upon her from the dark interiors of surrounding huts  she turned to flee but heavy hands seized her and when she turned at last to plead with them her eyes fell upon the face of a tall grim old man glaring down upon her from beneath the folds of his burnous  at sight of him she staggered back in shocked and terrified surprise it was the sheik  instantly all the old fears and terrors of her childhood returned upon her  she stood trembling before this horrible old man as a murderer before the judge about to pass sentence of death upon him  she knew that the sheik recognized her  the years and the changed raiment had not altered her so much but what one who had known her features so well in childhood would know her now  so you have come back to your people eh snarled the sheik  come back begging for food and protection eh  let me go cried the girl  i ask nothing of you but that you let me go back to the big bwana  the big bwana almost screamed the sheik and then followed a stream of profane arabic invective against the white man whom all the transgressors of the jungle feared and hated  you would go back to the big bwana would you  so that is where you have been since you ran away from me is it  and who comes now across the river after youthe big bwana  the swede whom you once chased away from your country when he and his companion conspired with nbeeda to steal me from you replied meriem  the sheiks eyes blazed and he called his men to approach the shore and hide among the bushes that they might ambush and annihilate malbihn and his party but malbihn already had landed and crawling through the fringe of jungle was at that very moment looking with wide and incredulous eyes upon the scene being enacted in the street of the deserted village  he recognized the sheik the moment his eyes fell upon him  there were two men in the world that malbihn feared as he feared the devil  one was the big bwana and the other the sheik  a single glance he took at that gaunt familiar figure and then he turned tail and scurried back to his canoe calling his followers after him and so it happened that the party was well out in the stream before the sheik reached the shore and after a volley and a few parting shots that were returned from the canoes the arab called his men off and securing his prisoner set off toward the south  one of the bullets from malbihns force had struck a black standing in the village street where he had been left with another to guard meriem and his companions had left him where he had fallen after appropriating his apparel and belongings  his was the body that baynes had discovered when he had entered the village  the sheik and his party had been marching southward along the river when one of them dropping out of line to fetch water had seen meriem paddling desperately from the opposite shore  the fellow had called the sheiks attention to the strange sighta white woman alone in central africa and the old arab had hidden his men in the deserted village to capture her when she landed for thoughts of ransom were always in the mind of the sheik  more than once before had glittering gold filtered through his fingers from a similar source  it was easy money and the sheik had none too much easy money since the big bwana had so circumscribed the limits of his ancient domain that he dared not even steal ivory from natives within two hundred miles of the big bwanas douar  and when at last the woman had walked into the trap he had set for her and he had recognized her as the same little girl he had brutalized and maltreated years before his gratification had been huge  now he lost no time in establishing the old relations of father and daughter that had existed between them in the past  at the first opportunity he struck her a heavy blow across the face  he forced her to walk when he might have dismounted one of his men instead or had her carried on a horses rump  he seemed to revel in the discovery of new methods for torturing or humiliating her and among all his followers she found no single one to offer her sympathy or who dared defend her even had they had the desire to do so  a two days march brought them at last to the familiar scenes of her childhood and the first face upon which she set her eyes as she was driven through the gates into the strong stockade was that of the toothless hideous mabunu her one time nurse  it was as though all the years that had intervened were but a dream  had it not been for her clothing and the fact that she had grown in stature she might well have believed it so  all was there as she had left itthe new faces which supplanted some of the old were of the same bestial degraded type  there were a few young arabs who had joined the sheik since she had been away  otherwise all was the sameall but one  geeka was not there and she found herself missing geeka as though the ivoryheaded one had been a flesh and blood intimate and friend  she missed her ragged little confidante into whose deaf ears she had been wont to pour her many miseries and her occasional joysgeeka of the splinter limbs and the ratskin torsogeeka the disreputablegeeka the beloved  for a time the inhabitants of the sheiks village who had not been upon the march with him amused themselves by inspecting the strangely clad white girl whom some of them had known as a little child  mabunu pretended great joy at her return baring her toothless gums in a hideous grimace that was intended to be indicative of rejoicing  but meriem could but shudder as she recalled the cruelties of this terrible old hag in the years gone by  among the arabs who had come in her absence was a tall young fellow of twentya handsome sinister looking youthwho stared at her in open admiration until the sheik came and ordered him away and abdul kamak went scowling  at last their curiosity satisfied meriem was alone  as of old she was permitted the freedom of the village for the stockade was high and strong and the only gates were wellguarded by day and by night but as of old she cared not for the companionship of the cruel arabs and the degraded blacks who formed the following of the sheik and so as had been her wont in the sad days of her childhood she slunk down to an unfrequented corner of the enclosure where she had often played at housekeeping with her beloved geeka beneath the spreading branches of the great tree that had overhung the palisade but now the tree was gone and meriem guessed the reason  it was from this tree that korak had descended and struck down the sheik the day that he had rescued her from the life of misery and torture that had been her lot for so long that she could remember no other  there were low bushes growing within the stockade however and in the shade of these meriem sat down to think  a little glow of happiness warmed her heart as she recalled her first meeting with korak and then the long years that he had cared for and protected her with the solicitude and purity of an elder brother  for months korak had not so occupied her thoughts as he did today  he seemed closer and dearer now than ever he had before and she wondered that her heart had drifted so far from loyalty to his memory  and then came the image of the hon morison the exquisite and meriem was troubled  did she really love the flawless young englishman  she thought of the glories of london of which he had told her in such glowing language  she tried to picture herself admired and honored in the midst of the gayest society of the great capital  the pictures she drew were the pictures that the hon morison had drawn for her  they were alluring pictures but through them all the brawny halfnaked figure of the giant adonis of the jungle persisted in obtruding itself  meriem pressed her hand above her heart as she stifled a sigh and as she did so she felt the hard outlines of the photograph she had hidden there as she slunk from malbihns tent  now she drew it forth and commenced to reexamine it more carefully than she had had time to do before  she was sure that the baby face was hers  she studied every detail of the picture  half hidden in the lace of the dainty dress rested a chain and locket  meriem puckered her brows  what tantalizing halfmemories it awakened  could this flower of evident civilization be the little arab meriem daughter of the sheik  it was impossible and yet that locket  meriem knew it  she could not refute the conviction of her memory  she had seen that locket before and it had been hers  what strange mystery lay buried in her past  as she sat gazing at the picture she suddenly became aware that she was not alonethat someone was standing close behind hersome one who had approached her noiselessly  guiltily she thrust the picture back into her waist  a hand fell upon her shoulder  she was sure that it was the sheik and she awaited in dumb terror the blow that she knew would follow  no blow came and she looked upward over her shoulderinto the eyes of abdul kamak the young arab  i saw he said the picture that you have just hidden  it is you when you were a childa very young child  may i see it again  meriem drew away from him  i will give it back he said  i have heard of you and i know that you have no love for the sheik your father  neither have i  i will not betray you  let me see the picture  friendless among cruel enemies meriem clutched at the straw that abdul kamak held out to her  perhaps in him she might find the friend she needed  anyway he had seen the picture and if he was not a friend he could tell the sheik about it and it would be taken away from her  so she might as well grant his request and hope that he had spoken fairly and would deal fairly  she drew the photograph from its hiding place and handed it to him  abdul kamak examined it carefully comparing it feature by feature with the girl sitting on the ground looking up into his face  slowly he nodded his head  yes he said it is you but where was it taken  how does it happen that the sheiks daughter is clothed in the garments of the unbeliever  i do not know replied meriem  i never saw the picture until a couple of days ago when i found it in the tent of the swede malbihn  abdul kamak raised his eyebrows  he turned the picture over and as his eyes fell upon the old newspaper cutting they went wide  he could read french with difficulty it is true but he could read it  he had been to paris  he had spent six months there with a troupe of his desert fellows upon exhibition and he had improved his time learning many of the customs some of the language and most of the vices of his conquerors  now he put his learning to use  slowly laboriously he read the yellowed cutting  his eyes were no longer wide  instead they narrowed to two slits of cunning  when he had done he looked at the girl  you have read this he asked  it is french she replied and i do not read french  abdul kamak stood long in silence looking at the girl  she was very beautiful  he desired her as had many other men who had seen her  at last he dropped to one knee beside her  a wonderful idea had sprung to abdul kamaks mind  it was an idea that might be furthered if the girl were kept in ignorance of the contents of that newspaper cutting  it would certainly be doomed should she learn its contents  meriem he whispered never until today have my eyes beheld you yet at once they told my heart that it must ever be your servant  you do not know me but i ask that you trust me  i can help you  you hate the sheikso do i  let me take you away from him  come with me and we will go back to the great desert where my father is a sheik mightier than is yours  will you come  meriem sat in silence  she hated to wound the only one who had offered her protection and friendship but she did not want abdul kamaks love deceived by her silence the man seized her and strained her to him but meriem struggled to free herself  i do not love you she cried  oh please do not make me hate you you are the only one who has shown kindness toward me and i want to like you but i cannot love you  abdul kamak drew himself to his full height  you will learn to love me he said for i shall take you whether you will or no  you hate the sheik and so you will not tell him for if you do i will tell him of the picture  i hate the sheik and  you hate the sheik came a grim voice from behind them  both turned to see the sheik standing a few paces from them  abdul still held the picture in his hand  now he thrust it within his burnous  yes he said i hate the sheik and as he spoke he sprang toward the older man felled him with a blow and dashed on across the village to the line where his horse was picketed saddled and ready for abdul kamak had been about to ride forth to hunt when he had seen the stranger girl alone by the bushes  leaping into the saddle abdul kamak dashed for the village gates  the sheik momentarily stunned by the blow that had felled him now staggered to his feet shouting lustily to his followers to stop the escaped arab  a dozen blacks leaped forward to intercept the horseman only to be ridden down or brushed aside by the muzzle of abdul kamaks long musket which he lashed from side to side about him as he spurred on toward the gate  but here he must surely be intercepted  already the two blacks stationed there were pushing the unwieldy portals to up flew the barrel of the fugitives weapon  with reins flying loose and his horse at a mad gallop the son of the desert fired oncetwice and both the keepers of the gate dropped in their tracks  with a wild whoop of exultation twirling his musket high above his head and turning in his saddle to laugh back into the faces of his pursuers abdul kamak dashed out of the village of the sheik and was swallowed up by the jungle  foaming with rage the sheik ordered immediate pursuit and then strode rapidly back to where meriem sat huddled by the bushes where he had left her  the picture he cried  what picture did the dog speak of  where is it  give it to me at once  he took it replied meriem dully  what was it again demanded the sheik seizing the girl roughly by the hair and dragging her to her feet where he shook her venomously what was it a picture of  of me said meriem when i was a little girl  i stole it from malbihn the swedeit had printing on the back cut from an old newspaper  the sheik went white with rage  what said the printing he asked in a voice so low that she but barely caught his words  i do not know  it was in french and i cannot read french  the sheik seemed relieved  he almost smiled nor did he again strike meriem before he turned and strode away with the parting admonition that she speak never again to any other than mabunu and himself  and along the caravan trail galloped abdul kamak toward the north   as his canoe drifted out of sight and range of the wounded swede the hon morison sank weakly to its bottom where he lay for long hours in partial stupor  it was night before he fully regained consciousness  and then he lay for a long time looking up at the stars and trying to recollect where he was what accounted for the gently rocking motion of the thing upon which he lay and why the position of the stars changed so rapidly and miraculously  for a while he thought he was dreaming but when he would have moved to shake sleep from him the pain of his wound recalled to him the events that had led up to his present position  then it was that he realized that he was floating down a great african river in a native canoealone wounded and lost  painfully he dragged himself to a sitting position  he noticed that the wound pained him less than he had imagined it would  he felt of it gingerlyit had ceased to bleed  possibly it was but a flesh wound after all and nothing serious  if it totally incapacitated him even for a few days it would mean death for by that time he would be too weakened by hunger and pain to provide food for himself  from his own troubles his mind turned to meriems  that she had been with the swede at the time he had attempted to reach the fellows camp he naturally believed but he wondered what would become of her now even if hanson died of his wounds would meriem be any better off  she was in the power of equally villainous menbrutal savages of the lowest order  baynes buried his face in his hands and rocked back and forth as the hideous picture of her fate burned itself into his consciousness  and it was he who had brought this fate upon her  his wicked desire had snatched a pure and innocent girl from the protection of those who loved her to hurl her into the clutches of the bestial swede and his outcast following  and not until it had become too late had he realized the magnitude of the crime he himself had planned and contemplated  not until it had become too late had he realized that greater than his desire greater than his lust greater than any passion he had ever felt before was the newborn love that burned within his breast for the girl he would have ruined  the hon morison baynes did not fully realize the change that had taken place within him  had one suggested that he ever had been aught than the soul of honor and chivalry he would have taken umbrage forthwith he knew that he had done a vile thing when he had plotted to carry meriem away to london yet he excused it on the ground of his great passion for the girl having temporarily warped his moral standards by the intensity of its heat  but as a matter of fact a new baynes had been born  never again could this man be bent to dishonor by the intensity of a desire  his moral fiber had been strengthened by the mental suffering he had endured  his mind and his soul had been purged by sorrow and remorse  his one thought now was to atonewin to meriems side and lay down his life if necessary in her protection  his eyes sought the length of the canoe in search of the paddle for a determination had galvanized him to immediate action despite his weakness and his wound  but the paddle was gone  he turned his eyes toward the shore  dimly through the darkness of a moonless night he saw the awful blackness of the jungle yet it touched no responsive chord of terror within him now as it had done in the past  he did not even wonder that he was unafraid for his mind was entirely occupied with thoughts of anothers danger  drawing himself to his knees he leaned over the edge of the canoe and commenced to paddle vigorously with his open palm  though it tired and hurt him he kept assiduously at his self imposed labor for hours little by little the drifting canoe moved nearer and nearer the shore the hon morison could hear a lion roaring directly opposite him and so close that he felt he must be almost to the shore  he drew his rifle closer to his side but he did not cease to paddle  after what seemed to the tired man an eternity of time he felt the brush of branches against the canoe and heard the swirl of the water about them  a moment later he reached out and clutched a leafy limb again the lion roaredvery near it seemed now and baynes wondered if the brute could have been following along the shore waiting for him to land  he tested the strength of the limb to which he clung  it seemed strong enough to support a dozen men  then he reached down and lifted his rifle from the bottom of the canoe slipping the sling over his shoulder  again he tested the branch and then reaching upward as far as he could for a safe hold he drew himself painfully and slowly upward until his feet swung clear of the canoe which released floated silently from beneath him to be lost forever in the blackness of the dark shadows down stream  he had burned his bridges behind him  he must either climb aloft or drop back into the river but there had been no other way  he struggled to raise one leg over the limb but found himself scarce equal to the effort for he was very weak  for a time he hung there feeling his strength ebbing  he knew that he must gain the branch above at once or it would be too late  suddenly the lion roared almost in his ear  baynes glanced up  he saw two spots of flame a short distance from and above him  the lion was standing on the bank of the river glaring at him andwaiting for him well thought the hon morison let him wait  lions cant climb trees and if i get into this one i shall be safe enough from him  the young englishmans feet hung almost to the surface of the watercloser than he knew for all was pitch dark below as above him presently he heard a slight commotion in the river beneath him and something banged against one of his feet followed almost instantly by a sound that he felt he could not have mistakenthe click of great jaws snapping together  by george exclaimed the hon morison aloud  the beggar nearly got me and immediately he struggled again to climb higher and to comparative safety but with that final effort he knew that it was futile  hope that had survived persistently until now began to wane he felt his tired numbed fingers slipping from their holdhe was dropping back into the riverinto the jaws of the frightful death that awaited him there  and then he heard the leaves above him rustle to the movement of a creature among them  the branch to which he clung bent beneath an added weightand no light weight from the way it sagged but still baynes clung desperatelyhe would not give up voluntarily either to the death above or the death below  he felt a soft warm pad upon the fingers of one of his hands where they circled the branch to which he clung and then something reached down out of the blackness above and dragged him up among the branches of the tree     chapter 24   sometimes lolling upon tantors back sometimes roaming the jungle in solitude korak made his way slowly toward the west and south  he made but a few miles a day for he had a whole lifetime before him and no place in particular to go possibly he would have moved more rapidly but for the thought which continually haunted him that each mile he traversed carried him further and further away from meriemno longer his meriem as of yore it is true but still as dear to him as ever  thus he came upon the trail of the sheiks band as it traveled down river from the point where the sheik had captured meriem to his own stockaded village  korak pretty well knew who it was that had passed for there were few in the great jungle with whom he was not familiar though it had been years since he had come this far north  he had no particular business however with the old sheik and so he did not propose following himthe further from men he could stay the better pleased he would behe wished that he might never see a human face again  men always brought him sorrow and misery  the river suggested fishing and so he dawdled upon its shores catching fish after a fashion of his own devising and eating them raw  when night came he curled up in a great tree beside the streamthe one from which he had been fishing during the afternoonand was soon asleep numa roaring beneath him awoke him  he was about to call out in anger to his noisy neighbor when something else caught his attention he listened  was there something in the tree beside himself  yes he heard the noise of something below him trying to clamber upward presently he heard the click of a crocodiles jaws in the waters beneath and then low but distinct by george  the beggar nearly got me  the voice was familiar  korak glanced downward toward the speaker  outlined against the faint luminosity of the water he saw the figure of a man clinging to a lower branch of the tree  silently and swiftly the apeman clambered downward  he felt a hand beneath his foot  he reached down and clutched the figure beneath him and dragged it up among the branches it struggled weakly and struck at him but korak paid no more attention than tantor to an ant  he lugged his burden to the higher safety and greater comfort of a broad crotch and there he propped it in a sitting position against the bole of the tree  numa still was roaring beneath them doubtless in anger that he had been robbed of his prey  korak shouted down at him calling him in the language of the great apes old greeneyed eater of carrion brother of dango the hyena and other choice appellations of jungle opprobrium  the hon morison baynes listening felt assured that a gorilla had seized upon him  he felt for his revolver and as he was drawing it stealthily from its holster a voice asked in perfectly good english who are you  baynes started so that he nearly fell from the branch  my god he exclaimed  are you a man  what did you think i was asked korak  a gorilla replied baynes honestly  korak laughed  who are you he repeated  im an englishman by the name of baynes but who the devil are you asked the hon morison  they call me the killer replied korak giving the english translation of the name that akut had given him  and then after a pause during which the hon morison attempted to pierce the darkness and catch a glimpse of the features of the strange being into whose hands he had fallen you are the same whom i saw kissing the girl at the edge of the great plain to the east that time that the lion charged you  yes replied baynes  what are you doing here  the girl was stoleni am trying to rescue her  stolen  the word was shot out like a bullet from a gun  who stole her  the swede trader hanson replied baynes  where is he  baynes related to korak all that had transpired since he had come upon hansons camp  before he was done the first gray dawn had relieved the darkness  korak made the englishman comfortable in the tree  he filled his canteen from the river and fetched him fruits to eat  then he bid him goodbye  i am going to the swedes camp he announced  i will bring the girl back to you here  i shall go too then insisted baynes  it is my right and my duty for she was to have become my wife  korak winced  you are wounded  you could not make the trip he said  i can go much faster alone  go then replied baynes but i shall follow  it is my right and duty  as you will replied korak with a shrug  if the man wanted to be killed it was none of his affair  he wanted to kill him himself but for meriems sake he would not  if she loved him then he must do what he could to preserve him but he could not prevent his following him more than to advise him against it and this he did earnestly  and so korak set out rapidly toward the north and limping slowly and painfully along soon far to the rear came the tired and wounded baynes  korak had reached the river bank opposite malbihns camp before baynes had covered two miles  late in the afternoon the englishman was still plodding wearily along forced to stop often for rest when he heard the sound of the galloping feet of a horse behind him  instinctively he drew into the concealing foliage of the underbrush and a moment later a whiterobed arab dashed by  baynes did not hail the rider  he had heard of the nature of the arabs who penetrate thus far to the south and what he had heard had convinced him that a snake or a panther would as quickly befriend him as one of these villainous renegades from the northland  when abdul kamak had passed out of sight toward the north baynes resumed his weary march  a half hour later he was again surprised by the unmistakable sound of galloping horses  this time there were many once more he sought a hiding place but it chanced that he was crossing a clearing which offered little opportunity for concealment  he broke into a slow trotthe best that he could do in his weakened condition but it did not suffice to carry him to safety and before he reached the opposite side of the clearing a band of whiterobed horsemen dashed into view behind him  at sight of him they shouted in arabic which of course he could not understand and then they closed about him threatening and angry their questions were unintelligible to him and no more could they interpret his english  at last evidently out of patience the leader ordered two of his men to seize him which they lost no time in doing they disarmed him and ordered him to climb to the rump of one of the horses and then the two who had been detailed to guard him turned and rode back toward the south while the others continued their pursuit of abdul kamak  as korak came out upon the bank of the river across from which he could see the camp of malbihn he was at a loss as to how he was to cross  he could see men moving about among the huts inside the bomaevidently hanson was still there  korak did not know the true identity of meriems abductor  how was he to cross  not even he would dare the perils of the riveralmost certain death  for a moment he thought then wheeled and sped away into the jungle uttering a peculiar cry shrill and piercing  now and again he would halt to listen as though for an answer to his weird call then on again deeper and deeper into the wood  at last his listening ears were rewarded by the sound they cravedthe trumpeting of a bull elephant and a few moments later korak broke through the trees into the presence of tantor standing with upraised trunk waving his great ears  quick tantor shouted the apeman and the beast swung him to his head  hurry and the mighty pachyderm lumbered off through the jungle guided by kicking of naked heels against the sides of his head  toward the northwest korak guided his huge mount until they came out upon the river a mile or more above the swedes camp at a point where korak knew that there was an elephant ford  never pausing the apeman urged the beast into the river and with trunk held high tantor forged steadily toward the opposite bank  once an unwary crocodile attacked him but the sinuous trunk dove beneath the surface and grasping the amphibian about the middle dragged it to light and hurled it a hundred feet down stream  and so in safety they made the opposite shore korak perched high and dry above the turgid flood  then back toward the south tantor moved steadily relentlessly and with a swinging gait which took no heed of any obstacle other than the larger jungle trees  at times korak was forced to abandon the broad head and take to the trees above so close the branches raked the back of the elephant but at last they came to the edge of the clearing where lay the camp of the renegade swede nor even then did they hesitate or halt  the gate lay upon the east side of the camp facing the river  tantor and korak approached from the north  there was no gate there but what cared tantor or korak for gates  at a word from the ape man and raising his tender trunk high above the thorns tantor breasted the boma walking through it as though it had not existed  a dozen blacks squatted before their huts looked up at the noise of his approach  with sudden howls of terror and amazement they leaped to their feet and fled for the open gates  tantor would have pursued  he hated man and he thought that korak had come to hunt these but the ape man held him back guiding him toward a large canvas tent that rose in the center of the clearingthere should be the girl and her abductor  malbihn lay in a hammock beneath canopy before his tent  his wounds were painful and he had lost much blood  he was very weak  he looked up in surprise as he heard the screams of his men and saw them running toward the gate  and then from around the corner of his tent loomed a huge bulk and tantor the great tusker towered above him  malbihns boy feeling neither affection nor loyalty for his master broke and ran at the first glimpse of the beast and malbihn was left alone and helpless  the elephant stopped a couple of paces from the wounded mans hammock malbihn cowered moaning  he was too weak to escape  he could only lie there with staring eyes gazing in horror into the blood rimmed angry little orbs fixed upon him and await his death  then to his astonishment a man slid to the ground from the elephants back  almost at once malbihn recognized the strange figure as that of the creature who consorted with apes and baboonsthe white warrior of the jungle who had freed the king baboon and led the whole angry horde of hairy devils upon him and jenssen  malbihn cowered still lower  where is the girl demanded korak in english  what girl asked malbihn  there is no girl hereonly the women of my boys  is it one of them you want  the white girl replied korak  do not lie to meyou lured her from her friends  you have her  where is she  it was not i cried malbihn  it was an englishman who hired me to steal her  he wished to take her to london with him  she was willing to go  his name is baynes  go to him if you want to know where the girl is  i have just come from him said korak  he sent me to you  the girl is not with him  now stop your lying and tell me the truth  where is she  korak took a threatening step toward the swede  malbihn shrank from the anger in the others face  i will tell you he cried  do not harm me and i will tell you all that i know  i had the girl here but it was baynes who persuaded her to leave her friendshe had promised to marry her  he does not know who she is but i do and i know that there is a great reward for whoever takes her back to her people it was the only reward i wanted but she escaped and crossed the river in one of my canoes  i followed her but the sheik was there god knows how and he captured her and attacked me and drove me back  then came baynes angry because he had lost the girl and shot me  if you want her go to the sheik and ask him for hershe has passed as his daughter since childhood  she is not the sheiks daughter asked korak  she is not replied malbihn  who is she then asked korak  here malbihn saw his chance  possibly he could make use of his knowledge after allit might even buy back his life for him  he was not so credulous as to believe that this savage apeman would have any compunctions about slaying him  when you find her i will tell you he said if you will promise to spare my life and divide the reward with me  if you kill me you will never know for only the sheik knows and he will never tell  the girl herself is ignorant of her origin  if you have told me the truth i will spare you said korak  i shall go now to the sheiks village and if the girl is not there i shall return and slay you  as for the other information you have if the girl wants it when we have found her we will find a way to purchase it from you  the look in the killers eyes and his emphasis of the word purchase were none too reassuring to malbihn  evidently unless he found means to escape this devil would have both his secret and his life before he was done with him  he wished he would be gone and take his evileyed companion away with him  the swaying bulk towering high above him and the ugly little eyes of the elephant watching his every move made malbihn nervous  korak stepped into the swedes tent to assure himself that meriem was not hid there  as he disappeared from view tantor his eyes still fixed upon malbihn took a step nearer the man  an elephants eyesight is none too good but the great tusker evidently had harbored suspicions of this yellowbearded white man from the first  now he advanced his snakelike trunk toward the swede who shrank still deeper into his hammock  the sensitive member felt and smelled back and forth along the body of the terrified malbihn  tantor uttered a low rumbling sound  his little eyes blazed  at last he had recognized the creature who had killed his mate long years before  tantor the elephant never forgets and never forgives  malbihn saw in the demoniacal visage above him the murderous purpose of the beast  he shrieked aloud to korak  help help  the devil is going to kill me  korak ran from the tent just in time to see the enraged elephants trunk encircle the beasts victim and then hammock canopy and man were swung high over tantors head  korak leaped before the animal commanding him to put down his prey unharmed but as well might he have ordered the eternal river to reverse its course  tantor wheeled around like a cat hurled malbihn to the earth and kneeled upon him with the quickness of a cat  then he gored the prostrate thing through and through with his mighty tusks trumpeting and roaring in his rage and at last convinced that no slightest spark of life remained in the crushed and lacerated flesh he lifted the shapeless clay that had been sven malbihn far aloft and hurled the bloody mass still entangled in canopy and hammock over the boma and out into the jungle  korak stood looking sorrowfully on at the tragedy he gladly would have averted  he had no love for the swede in fact only hatred but he would have preserved the man for the sake of the secret he possessed now that secret was gone forever unless the sheik could be made to divulge it but in that possibility korak placed little faith  the apeman as unafraid of the mighty tantor as though he had not just witnessed his shocking murder of a human being signalled the beast to approach and lift him to its head and tantor came as he was bid docile as a kitten and hoisted the killer tenderly aloft  from the safety of their hiding places in the jungle malbihns boys had witnessed the killing of their master and now with wide frightened eyes they saw the strange white warrior mounted upon the head of his ferocious charger disappear into the jungle at the point from which he had emerged upon their terrified vision     chapter 25   the sheik glowered at the prisoner which his two men brought back to him from the north  he had sent the party after abdul kamak and he was wroth that instead of his erstwhile lieutenant they had sent back a wounded and useless englishman  why had they not dispatched him where they had found him  he was some penniless beggar of a trader who had wandered from his own district and became lost  he was worthless  the sheik scowled terribly upon him  who are you he asked in french  i am the hon morison baynes of london replied his prisoner  the title sounded promising and at once the wily old robber had visions of ransom  his intentions if not his attitude toward the prisoner underwent a changehe would investigate further  what were you doing poaching in my country growled he  i was not aware that you owned africa replied the hon morison  i was searching for a young woman who had been abducted from the home of a friend  the abductor wounded me and i drifted down river in a canoei was on my way back to his camp when your men seized me  a young woman asked the sheik  is that she and he pointed to his left over toward a clump of bushes near the stockade  baynes looked in the direction indicated and his eyes went wide for there sitting crosslegged upon the ground her back toward them was meriem  meriem he shouted starting toward her but one of his guards grasped his arm and jerked him back  the girl leaped to her feet and turned toward him as she heard her name  morison she cried  be still and stay where you are snapped the sheik and then to baynes  so you are the dog of a christian who stole my daughter from me  your daughter ejaculated baynes  she is your daughter  she is my daughter growled the arab and she is not for any unbeliever  you have earned death englishman but if you can pay for your life i will give it to you  baynes eyes were still wide at the unexpected sight of meriem here in the camp of the arab when he had thought her in hansons power  what had happened  how had she escaped the swede  had the arab taken her by force from him or had she escaped and come voluntarily back to the protection of the man who called her daughter  he would have given much for a word with her  if she was safe here he might only harm her by antagonizing the arab in an attempt to take her away and return her to her english friends  no longer did the hon morison harbor thoughts of luring the girl to london  well asked the sheik  oh exclaimed baynes i beg your pardoni was thinking of something else  why yes of course glad to pay im sure  how much do you think im worth  the sheik named a sum that was rather less exorbitant than the hon morison had anticipated  the latter nodded his head in token of his entire willingness to pay  he would have promised a sum far beyond his resources just as readily for he had no intention of paying anythinghis one reason for seeming to comply with the sheiks demands was that the wait for the coming of the ransom money would give him the time and the opportunity to free meriem if he found that she wished to be freed  the arabs statement that he was her father naturally raised the question in the hon  morisons mind as to precisely what the girls attitude toward escape might be  it seemed of course preposterous that this fair and beautiful young woman should prefer to remain in the filthy douar of an illiterate old arab rather than return to the comforts luxuries and congenial associations of the hospitable african bungalow from which the hon morison had tricked her  the man flushed at the thought of his duplicity which these recollections arousedthoughts which were interrupted by the sheik who instructed the hon morison to write a letter to the british consul at algiers dictating the exact phraseology of it with a fluency that indicated to his captive that this was not the first time the old rascal had had occasion to negotiate with english relatives for the ransom of a kinsman  baynes demurred when he saw that the letter was addressed to the consul at algiers saying that it would require the better part of a year to get the money back to him but the sheik would not listen to baynes plan to send a messenger directly to the nearest coast town and from there communicate with the nearest cable station sending the hon morisons request for funds straight to his own solicitors  no the sheik was cautious and wary  he knew his own plan had worked well in the past  in the other were too many untried elements  he was in no hurry for the moneyhe could wait a year or two years if necessary but it should not require over six months  he turned to one of the arabs who had been standing behind him and gave the fellow instructions in relation to the prisoner  baynes could not understand the words spoken in arabic but the jerk of the thumb toward him showed that he was the subject of conversation the arab addressed by the sheik bowed to his master and beckoned baynes to follow him  the englishman looked toward the sheik for confirmation  the latter nodded impatiently and the hon morison rose and followed his guide toward a native hut which lay close beside one of the outside goatskin tents  in the dark stifling interior his guard led him then stepped to the doorway and called to a couple of black boys squatting before their own huts  they came promptly and in accordance with the arabs instructions bound baynes wrists and ankles securely  the englishman objected strenuously but as neither the blacks nor the arab could understand a word he said his pleas were wasted  having bound him they left the hut  the hon morison lay for a long time contemplating the frightful future which awaited him during the long months which must intervene before his friends learned of his predicament and could get succor to him  now he hoped that they would send the ransomhe would gladly pay all that he was worth to be out of this hole  at first it had been his intention to cable his solicitors to send no money but to communicate with the british west african authorities and have an expedition sent to his aid  his patrician nose wrinkled in disgust as his nostrils were assailed by the awful stench of the hut  the nasty grasses upon which he lay exuded the effluvium of sweaty bodies of decayed animal matter and of offal  but worse was yet to come  he had lain in the uncomfortable position in which they had thrown him but for a few minutes when he became distinctly conscious of an acute itching sensation upon his hands his neck and scalp  he wriggled to a sitting posture horrified and disgusted  the itching rapidly extended to other parts of his bodyit was torture and his hands were bound securely at his back  he tugged and pulled at his bonds until he was exhausted but not entirely without hope for he was sure that he was working enough slack out of the knot to eventually permit of his withdrawing one of his hands  night came  they brought him neither food nor drink  he wondered if they expected him to live on nothing for a year  the bites of the vermin grew less annoying though not less numerous  the hon morison saw a ray of hope in this indication of future immunity through inoculation  he still worked weakly at his bonds and then the rats came  if the vermin were disgusting the rats were terrifying  they scurried over his body squealing and fighting  finally one commenced to chew at one of his ears  with an oath the hon morison struggled to a sitting posture  the rats retreated  he worked his legs beneath him and came to his knees and then by superhuman effort rose to his feet  there he stood reeling drunkenly dripping with cold sweat  god he muttered what have i done to deserve  he paused  what had he done  he thought of the girl in another tent in that accursed village  he was getting his deserts  he set his jaws firmly with the realization  he would never complain again  at that moment he became aware of voices raised angrily in the goatskin tent close beside the hut in which he lay  one of them was a womans  could it be meriems the language was probably arabiche could not understand a word of it but the tones were hers  he tried to think of some way of attracting her attention to his near presence  if she could remove his bonds they might escape togetherif she wished to escape  that thought bothered him  he was not sure of her status in the village  if she were the petted child of the powerful sheik then she would probably not care to escape  he must know definitely  at the bungalow he had often heard meriem sing god save the king as my dear accompanied her on the piano  raising his voice he now hummed the tune  immediately he heard meriems voice from the tent  she spoke rapidly  good bye morison she cried  if god is good i shall be dead before morning for if i still live i shall be worse than dead after tonight  then he heard an angry exclamation in a mans voice followed by the sounds of a scuffle  baynes went white with horror  he struggled frantically again with his bonds  they were giving  a moment later one hand was free  it was but the work of an instant then to loose the other  stooping he untied the rope from his ankles then he straightened and started for the hut doorway bent on reaching meriems side  as he stepped out into the night the figure of a huge black rose and barred his progress   when speed was required of him korak depended upon no other muscles than his own and so it was that the moment tantor had landed him safely upon the same side of the river as lay the village of the sheik the apeman deserted his bulky comrade and took to the trees in a rapid race toward the south and the spot where the swede had told him meriem might be  it was dark when he came to the palisade strengthened considerably since the day that he had rescued meriem from her pitiful life within its cruel confines  no longer did the giant tree spread its branches above the wooden rampart but ordinary manmade defenses were scarce considered obstacles by korak  loosening the rope at his waist he tossed the noose over one of the sharpened posts that composed the palisade  a moment later his eyes were above the level of the obstacle taking in all within their range beyond  there was no one in sight close by and korak drew himself to the top and dropped lightly to the ground within the enclosure  then he commenced his stealthy search of the village  first toward the arab tents he made his way sniffing and listening  he passed behind them searching for some sign of meriem  not even the wild arab curs heard his passage so silently he wenta shadow passing through shadows  the odor of tobacco told him that the arabs were smoking before their tents  the sound of laughter fell upon his ears and then from the opposite side of the village came the notes of a once familiar tune god save the king  korak halted in perplexity  who might it bethe tones were those of a man  he recalled the young englishman he had left on the river trail and who had disappeared before he returned a moment later there came to him a womans voice in replyit was meriems and the killer quickened into action slunk rapidly in the direction of these two voices  the evening meal over meriem had gone to her pallet in the womens quarters of the sheiks tent a little corner screened off in the rear by a couple of priceless persian rugs to form a partition  in these quarters she had dwelt with mabunu alone for the sheik had no wives nor were conditions altered now after the years of her absenceshe and mabunu were alone in the womens quarters  presently the sheik came and parted the rugs  he glared through the dim light of the interior  meriem he called  come hither  the girl arose and came into the front of the tent  there the light of a fire illuminated the interior  she saw ali ben kadin the sheiks half brother squatted upon a rug smoking  the sheik was standing the sheik and ali ben kadin had had the same father but ali ben kadins mother had been a slavea west coast negress  ali ben kadin was old and hideous and almost black  his nose and part of one cheek were eaten away by disease  he looked up and grinned as meriem entered  the sheik jerked his thumb toward ali ben kadin and addressed meriem  i am getting old he said i shall not live much longer  therefore i have given you to ali ben kadin my brother  that was all  ali ben kadin rose and came toward her  meriem shrank back horrified  the man seized her wrist  come he commanded and dragged her from the sheiks tent and to his own  after they had gone the sheik chuckled  when i send her north in a few months he soliloquized they will know the reward for slaying the son of the sister of amor ben khatour  and in ali ben kadins tent meriem pleaded and threatened but all to no avail  the hideous old halfcaste spoke soft words at first but when meriem loosed upon him the vials of her horror and loathing he became enraged and rushing upon her seized her in his arms  twice she tore away from him and in one of the intervals during which she managed to elude him she heard baynes voice humming the tune that she knew was meant for her ears  at her reply ali ben kadin rushed upon her once again  this time he dragged her back into the rear apartment of his tent where three negresses looked up in stolid indifference to the tragedy being enacted before them  as the hon morison saw his way blocked by the huge frame of the giant black his disappointment and rage filled him with a bestial fury that transformed him into a savage beast  with an oath he leaped upon the man before him the momentum of his body hurling the black to the ground  there they fought the black to draw his knife the white to choke the life from the black  baynes fingers shut off the cry for help that the other would have been glad to voice but presently the negro succeeded in drawing his weapon and an instant later baynes felt the sharp steel in his shoulder  again and again the weapon fell  the white man removed one hand from its choking grip upon the black throat  he felt around upon the ground beside him searching for some missile and at last his fingers touched a stone and closed upon it  raising it above his antagonists head the hon morison drove home a terrific blow instantly the black relaxedstunned  twice more baynes struck him then he leaped to his feet and ran for the goat skin tent from which he had heard the voice of meriem in distress  but before him was another  naked but for his leopard skin and his loin cloth korak the killer slunk into the shadows at the back of ali ben kadins tent  the halfcaste had just dragged meriem into the rear chamber as koraks sharp knife slit a six foot opening in the tent wall and korak tall and mighty sprang through upon the astonished visions of the inmates  meriem saw and recognized him the instant that he entered the apartment  her heart leaped in pride and joy at the sight of the noble figure for which it had hungered for so long  korak she cried  meriem  he uttered the single word as he hurled himself upon the astonished ali ben kadin  the three negresses leaped from their sleeping mats screaming  meriem tried to prevent them from escaping but before she could succeed the terrified blacks had darted through the hole in the tent wall made by koraks knife and were gone screaming through the village  the killers fingers closed once upon the throat of the hideous ali once his knife plunged into the putrid heartand ali ben kadin lay dead upon the floor of his tent  korak turned toward meriem and at the same moment a bloody and disheveled apparition leaped into the apartment  morison cried the girl  korak turned and looked at the new comer  he had been about to take meriem in his arms forgetful of all that might have transpired since last he had seen her  then the coming of the young englishman recalled the scene he had witnessed in the little clearing and a wave of misery swept over the ape man  already from without came the sounds of the alarm that the three negresses had started  men were running toward the tent of ali ben kadin  there was no time to be lost  quick cried korak turning toward baynes who had scarce yet realized whether he was facing a friend or foe  take her to the palisade following the rear of the tents  here is my rope  with it you can scale the wall and make your escape  but you korak cried meriem  i will remain replied the apeman  i have business with the sheik  meriem would have demurred but the killer seized them both by the shoulders and hustled them through the slit wall and out into the shadows beyond  now run for it he admonished and turned to meet and hold those who were pouring into the tent from the front  the apeman fought wellfought as he had never fought before but the odds were too great for victory though he won that which he most cravedtime for the englishman to escape with meriem  then he was overwhelmed by numbers and a few minutes later bound and guarded he was carried to the sheiks tent  the old men eyed him in silence for a long time  he was trying to fix in his own mind some form of torture that would gratify his rage and hatred toward this creature who twice had been the means of his losing possession of meriem  the killing of ali ben kadin caused him little angeralways had he hated the hideous son of his fathers hideous slave  the blow that this naked white warrior had once struck him added fuel to his rage  he could think of nothing adequate to the creatures offense  and as he sat there looking upon korak the silence was broken by the trumpeting of an elephant in the jungle beyond the palisade  a half smile touched koraks lips  he turned his head a trifle in the direction from which the sound had come and then there broke from his lips a low weird call  one of the blacks guarding him struck him across the mouth with the haft of his spear but none there knew the significance of his cry  in the jungle tantor cocked his ears as the sound of koraks voice fell upon them  he approached the palisade and lifting his trunk above it sniffed  then he placed his head against the wooden logs and pushed but the palisade was strong and only gave a little to the pressure  in the sheiks tent the sheik rose at last and pointing toward the bound captive turned to one of his lieutenants  burn him he commanded  at once  the stake is set  the guard pushed korak from the sheiks presence  they dragged him to the open space in the center of the village where a high stake was set in the ground  it had not been intended for burnings but offered a convenient place to tie up refractory slaves that they might be beatenofttimes until death relieved their agonies  to this stake they bound korak  then they brought brush and piled about him and the sheik came and stood by that he might watch the agonies of his victim  but korak did not wince even after they had fetched a brand and the flames had shot up among the dry tinder  once then he raised his voice in the low call that he had given in the sheiks tent and now from beyond the palisade came again the trumpeting of an elephant  old tantor had been pushing at the palisade in vain  the sound of koraks voice calling him and the scent of man his enemy filled the great beast with rage and resentment against the dumb barrier that held him back  he wheeled and shuffled back a dozen paces then he turned lifted his trunk and gave voice to a mighty roaring trumpetcall of anger lowered his head and charged like a huge battering ram of flesh and bone and muscle straight for the mighty barrier  the palisade sagged and splintered to the impact and through the breach rushed the infuriated bull  korak heard the sounds that the others heard and he interpreted them as the others did not  the flames were creeping closer to him when one of the blacks hearing a noise behind him turned to see the enormous bulk of tantor lumbering toward them  the man screamed and fled and then the bull elephant was among them tossing negroes and arabs to right and left as he tore through the flames he feared to the side of the comrade he loved  the sheik calling orders to his followers ran to his tent to get his rifle  tantor wrapped his trunk about the body of korak and the stake to which it was bound and tore it from the ground  the flames were searing his sensitive hidesensitive for all its thicknessso that in his frenzy to both rescue his friend and escape the hated fire he had all but crushed the life from the apeman  lifting his burden high above his head the giant beast wheeled and raced for the breach that he had just made in the palisade  the sheik rifle in hand rushed from his tent directly into the path of the maddened brute  he raised his weapon and fired once the bullet missed its mark and tantor was upon him crushing him beneath those gigantic feet as he raced over him as you and i might crush out the life of an ant that chanced to be in our pathway  and then bearing his burden carefully tantor the elephant entered the blackness of the jungle     chapter 26   meriem dazed by the unexpected sight of korak whom she had long given up as dead permitted herself to be led away by baynes  among the tents he guided her safely to the palisade and there following koraks instructions the englishman pitched a noose over the top of one of the upright logs that formed the barrier  with difficulty he reached the top and then lowered his hand to assist meriem to his side  come he whispered  we must hurry  and then as though she had awakened from a sleep meriem came to herself  back there fighting her enemies alone was korakher korak  her place was by his side fighting with him and for him  she glanced up at baynes  go she called  make your way back to bwana and bring help  my place is here  you can do no good remaining  get away while you can and bring the big bwana back with you  silently the hon morison baynes slid to the ground inside the palisade to meriems side  it was only for you that i left him he said nodding toward the tents they had just left  i knew that he could hold them longer than i and give you a chance to escape that i might not be able to have given you  it was i though who should have remained  i heard you call him korak and so i know now who he is  he befriended you  i would have wronged you  nodont interrupt  im going to tell you the truth now and let you know just what a beast i have been  i planned to take you to london as you know but i did not plan to marry you  yes shrink from mei deserve it  i deserve your contempt and loathing but i didnt know then what love was  since i have learned that i have learned something elsewhat a cad and what a coward i have been all my life  i looked down upon those whom i considered my social inferiors i did not think you good enough to bear my name  since hanson tricked me and took you for himself i have been through hell but it has made a man of me though too late  now i can come to you with an offer of honest love which will realize the honor of having such as you share my name with me  for a moment meriem was silent buried in thought  her first question seemed irrelevant  how did you happen to be in this village she asked  he told her all that had transpired since the black had told him of hansons duplicity  you say that you are a coward she said and yet you have done all this to save me  the courage that it must have taken to tell me the things that you told me but a moment since while courage of a different sort proves that you are no moral coward and the other proves that you are not a physical coward  i could not love a coward  you mean that you love me he gasped in astonishment taking a step toward her as though to gather her into his arms but she placed her hand against him and pushed him gently away as much as to say not yet  what she did mean she scarcely knew  she thought that she loved him of that there can be no question nor did she think that love for this young englishman was disloyalty to korak for her love for korak was undiminishedthe love of a sister for an indulgent brother  as they stood there for the moment of their conversation the sounds of tumult in the village subsided  they have killed him whispered meriem  the statement brought baynes to a realization of the cause of their return  wait here he said  i will go and see  if he is dead we can do him no good  if he lives i will do my best to free him  we will go together replied meriem  come  and she led the way back toward the tent in which they last had seen korak  as they went they were often forced to throw themselves to the ground in the shadow of a tent or hut for people were passing hurriedly to and fro nowthe whole village was aroused and moving about  the return to the tent of ali ben kadin took much longer than had their swift flight to the palisade  cautiously they crept to the slit that koraks knife had made in the rear wall  meriem peered withinthe rear apartment was empty  she crawled through the aperture baynes at her heels and then silently crossed the space to the rugs that partitioned the tent into two rooms  parting the hangings meriem looked into the front room it too was deserted  she crossed to the door of the tent and looked out  then she gave a little gasp of horror  baynes at her shoulder looked past her to the sight that had startled her and he too exclaimed but his was an oath of anger  a hundred feet away they saw korak bound to a stakethe brush piled about him already alight  the englishman pushed meriem to one side and started to run for the doomed man  what he could do in the face of scores of hostile blacks and arabs he did not stop to consider  at the same instant tantor broke through the palisade and charged the group in the face of the maddened beast the crowd turned and fled carrying baynes backward with them  in a moment it was all over and the elephant had disappeared with his prize but pandemonium reigned throughout the village  men women and children ran helter skelter for safety  curs fled yelping  the horses and camels and donkeys terrorized by the trumpeting of the pachyderm kicked and pulled at their tethers  a dozen or more broke loose and it was the galloping of these past him that brought a sudden idea into baynes head  he turned to search for meriem only to find her at his elbow  the horses he cried  if we can get a couple of them  filled with the idea meriem led him to the far end of the village  loosen two of them she said and lead them back into the shadows behind those huts  i know where there are saddles  i will bring them and the bridles and before he could stop her she was gone  baynes quickly untied two of the restive animals and led them to the point designated by meriem  here he waited impatiently for what seemed an hour but was in reality but a few minutes  then he saw the girl approaching beneath the burden of two saddles  quickly they placed these upon the horses  they could see by the light of the torture fire that still burned that the blacks and arabs were recovering from their panic  men were running about gathering in the loose stock and two or three were already leading their captives back to the end of the village where meriem and baynes were busy with the trappings of their mounts  now the girl flung herself into the saddle  hurry she whispered  we shall have to run for it  ride through the gap that tantor made and as she saw baynes swing his leg over the back of his horse she shook the reins free over her mounts neck with a lunge the nervous beast leaped forward  the shortest path led straight through the center of the village and this meriem took baynes was close behind her their horses running at full speed  so sudden and impetuous was their dash for escape that it carried them halfway across the village before the surprised inhabitants were aware of what was happening  then an arab recognized them and with a cry of alarm raised his rifle and fired  the shot was a signal for a volley and amid the rattle of musketry meriem and baynes leaped their flying mounts through the breach in the palisade and were gone up the wellworn trail toward the north  and korak  tantor carried him deep into the jungle nor paused until no sound from the distant village reached his keen ears  then he laid his burden gently down  korak struggled to free himself from his bonds but even his great strength was unable to cope with the many strands of hardknotted cord that bound him  while he lay there working and resting by turns the elephant stood guard above him nor was there jungle enemy with the hardihood to tempt the sudden death that lay in that mighty bulk  dawn came and still korak was no nearer freedom than before  he commenced to believe that he should die there of thirst and starvation with plenty all about him for he knew that tantor could not unloose the knots that held him  and while he struggled through the night with his bonds baynes and meriem were riding rapidly northward along the river  the girl had assured baynes that korak was safe in the jungle with tantor  it had not occurred to her that the apeman might not be able to burst his bonds  baynes had been wounded by a shot from the rifle of one of the arabs and the girl wanted to get him back to bwanas home where he could be properly cared for  then she said i shall get bwana to come with me and search for korak  he must come and live with us  all night they rode and the day was still young when they came suddenly upon a party hurrying southward  it was bwana himself and his sleek black warriors  at sight of baynes the big englishmans brows contracted in a scowl but he waited to hear meriems story before giving vent to the long anger in his breast  when she had finished he seemed to have forgotten baynes  his thoughts were occupied with another subject  you say that you found korak he asked  you really saw him  yes replied meriem as plainly as i see you and i want you to come with me bwana and help me find him again  did you see him  he turned toward the hon morison  yes sir replied baynes very plainly  what sort of appearing man is he continued bwana  about how old should you say  i should say he was an englishman about my own age replied baynes though he might be older  he is remarkably muscled and exceedingly tanned  his eyes and hair did you notice them  bwana spoke rapidly almost excitedly  it was meriem who answered him  koraks hair is black and his eyes are gray she said  bwana turned to his headman  take miss meriem and mr baynes home he said  i am going into the jungle  let me go with you bwana cried meriem  you are going to search for korak  let me go too  bwana turned sadly but firmly upon the girl  your place he said is beside the man you love  then he motioned to his headman to take his horse and commence the return journey to the farm  meriem slowly mounted the tired arab that had brought her from the village of the sheik  a litter was rigged for the now feverish baynes and the little cavalcade was soon slowly winding off along the river trail  bwana stood watching them until they were out of sight  not once had meriem turned her eyes backward  she rode with bowed head and drooping shoulders  bwana sighed  he loved the little arab girl as he might have loved an own daughter  he realized that baynes had redeemed himself and so he could interpose no objections now if meriem really loved the man but somehow some way bwana could not convince himself that the hon morison was worthy of his little meriem  slowly he turned toward a nearby tree  leaping upward he caught a lower branch and drew himself up among the branches  his movements were catlike and agile  high into the trees he made his way and there commenced to divest himself of his clothing from the game bag slung across one shoulder he drew a long strip of doeskin a neatly coiled rope and a wicked looking knife  the doeskin he fashioned into a loin cloth the rope he looped over one shoulder and the knife he thrust into the belt formed by his gee string  when he stood erect his head thrown back and his great chest expanded a grim smile touched his lips for a moment  his nostrils dilated as he sniffed the jungle odors  his gray eyes narrowed  he crouched and leaped to a lower limb and was away through the trees toward the southeast bearing away from the river  he moved swiftly stopping only occasionally to raise his voice in a weird and piercing scream and to listen for a moment after for a reply  he had traveled thus for several hours when ahead of him and a little to his left he heard far off in the jungle a faint responsethe cry of a bull ape answering his cry  his nerves tingled and his eyes lighted as the sound fell upon his ears  again he voiced his hideous call and sped forward in the new direction  korak finally becoming convinced that he must die if he remained where he was waiting for the succor that could not come spoke to tantor in the strange tongue that the great beast understood  he commanded the elephant to lift him and carry him toward the northeast  there recently korak had seen both white men and black  if he could come upon one of the latter it would be a simple matter to command tantor to capture the fellow and then korak could get him to release him from the stake  it was worth trying at leastbetter than lying there in the jungle until he died  as tantor bore him along through the forest korak called aloud now and then in the hope of attracting akuts band of anthropoids whose wanderings often brought them into their neighborhood  akut he thought might possibly be able to negotiate the knotshe had done so upon that other occasion when the russian had bound korak years before and akut to the south of him heard his calls faintly and came  there was another who heard them too  after bwana had left his party sending them back toward the farm meriem had ridden for a short distance with bowed head  what thoughts passed through that active brain who may say  presently she seemed to come to a decision  she called the headman to her side  i am going back with bwana she announced  the black shook his head  no he announced  bwana says i take you home  so i take you home  you refuse to let me go asked the girl  the black nodded and fell to the rear where he might better watch her meriem half smiled  presently her horse passed beneath a lowhanging branch and the black headman found himself gazing at the girls empty saddle  he ran forward to the tree into which she had disappeared  he could see nothing of her  he called but there was no response unless it might have been a low taunting laugh far to the right  he sent his men into the jungle to search for her but they came back empty handed after a while he resumed his march toward the farm for baynes by this time was delirious with fever  meriem raced straight back toward the point she imagined tantor would make fora point where she knew the elephants often gathered deep in the forest due east of the sheiks village  she moved silently and swiftly  from her mind she had expunged all thoughts other than that she must reach korak and bring him back with her  it was her place to do that  then too had come the tantalizing fear that all might not be well with him  she upbraided herself for not thinking of that beforeof letting her desire to get the wounded morison back to the bungalow blind her to the possibilities of koraks need for her  she had been traveling rapidly for several hours without rest when she heard ahead of her the familiar cry of a great ape calling to his kind  she did not reply only increased her speed until she almost flew  now there came to her sensitive nostrils the scent of tantor and she knew that she was on the right trail and close to him she sought  she did not call out because she wished to surprise him and presently she did breaking into sight of them as the great elephant shuffled ahead balancing the man and the heavy stake upon his head holding them there with his upcurled trunk  korak cried meriem from the foliage above him  instantly the bull swung about lowered his burden to the ground and trumpeting savagely prepared to defend his comrade  the apeman recognizing the girls voice felt a sudden lump in his throat  meriem he called back to her  happily the girl clambered to the ground and ran forward to release korak but tantor lowered his head ominously and trumpeted a warning  go back  go back cried korak  he will kill you  meriem paused  tantor she called to the huge brute  dont you remember me  i am little meriem  i used to ride on your broad back but the bull only rumbled in his throat and shook his tusks in angry defiance  then korak tried to placate him  tried to order him away that the girl might approach and release him but tantor would not go he saw in every human being other than korak an enemy  he thought the girl bent upon harming his friend and he would take no chances  for an hour the girl and the man tried to find some means whereby they might circumvent the beasts ill directed guardianship but all to no avail tantor stood his ground in grim determination to let no one approach korak  presently the man hit upon a scheme  pretend to go away he called to the girl  keep down wind from us so that tantor wont get your scent then follow us  after a while ill have him put me down and find some pretext for sending him away  while he is gone you can slip up and cut my bondshave you a knife  yes i have a knife she replied  ill go nowi think we may be able to fool him but dont be too suretantor invented cunning  korak smiled for he knew that the girl was right  presently she had disappeared  the elephant listened and raised his trunk to catch her scent  korak commanded him to raise him to his head once more and proceed upon their way  after a moments hesitation he did as he was bid  it was then that korak heard the distant call of an ape  akut he thought  good  tantor knew akut well  he would let him approach  raising his voice korak replied to the call of the ape but he let tantor move off with him through the jungle it would do no harm to try the other plan  they had come to a clearing and plainly korak smelled water  here was a good place and a good excuse  he ordered tantor to lay him down and go and fetch him water in his trunk  the big beast deposited him upon the grass in the center of the clearing then he stood with cocked ears and attentive trunk searching for the slightest indication of dangerthere seemed to be none and he moved away in the direction of the little brook that korak knew was some two or three hundred yards away  the apeman could scarce help smiling as he thought how cleverly he had tricked his friend but well as he knew tantor he little guessed the guile of his cunning brain  the animal ambled off across the clearing and disappeared in the jungle beyond in the direction of the stream but scarce had his great bulk been screened by the dense foliage than he wheeled about and came cautiously back to the edge of the clearing where he could see without being seen tantor by nature is suspicious  now he still feared the return of the she tarmangani who had attempted to attack his korak  he would just stand there for a moment and assure himself that all was well before he continued on toward the water  ah  it was well that he did there she was now dropping from the branches of a tree across the clearing and running swiftly toward the apeman  tantor waited  he would let her reach korak before he chargedthat would ensure that she had no chance of escape  his little eyes blazed savagely  his tail was elevated stiffly  he could scarce restrain a desire to trumpet forth his rage to the world  meriem was almost at koraks side when tantor saw the long knife in her hand and then he broke forth from the jungle bellowing horribly and charged down upon the frail girl     chapter 27   korak screamed commands to his huge protector in an effort to halt him but all to no avail  meriem raced toward the bordering trees with all the speed that lay in her swift little feet but tantor for all his huge bulk drove down upon her with the rapidity of an express train  korak lay where he could see the whole frightful tragedy  the cold sweat broke out upon his body  his heart seemed to have stopped its beating  meriem might reach the trees before tantor overtook her but even her agility would not carry her beyond the reach of that relentless trunkshe would be dragged down and tossed  korak could picture the whole frightful scene  then tantor would follow her up goring the frail little body with his relentless tusks or trampling it into an unrecognizable mass beneath his ponderous feet  he was almost upon her now  korak wanted to close his eyes but could not  his throat was dry and parched  never in all his savage existence had he suffered such blighting terrornever before had he known what terror meant  a dozen more strides and the brute would seize her  what was that  koraks eyes started from their sockets  a strange figure had leaped from the tree the shade of which meriem already had reachedleaped beyond the girl straight into the path of the charging elephant  it was a naked white giant  across his shoulder a coil of rope was looped  in the band of his gee string was a hunting knife  otherwise he was unarmed  with naked hands he faced the maddening tantor  a sharp command broke from the strangers lipsthe great beast halted in his tracksand meriem swung herself upward into the tree to safety  korak breathed a sigh of relief not unmixed with wonder  he fastened his eyes upon the face of meriems deliverer and as recognition slowly filtered into his understanding they went wide in incredulity and surprise  tantor still rumbling angrily stood swaying to and fro close before the giant white man  then the latter stepped straight beneath the upraised trunk and spoke a low word of command  the great beast ceased his muttering  the savage light died from his eyes and as the stranger stepped forward toward korak tantor trailed docilely at his heels  meriem was watching too and wondering  suddenly the man turned toward her as though recollecting her presence after a moment of forgetfulness  come  meriem he called and then she recognized him with a startled  bwana  quickly the girl dropped from the tree and ran to his side  tantor cocked a questioning eye at the white giant but receiving a warning word let meriem approach  together the two walked to where korak lay his eyes wide with wonder and filled with a pathetic appeal for forgiveness and mayhap a glad thankfulness for the miracle that had brought these two of all others to his side  jack cried the white giant kneeling at the apemans side  father came chokingly from the killers lips  thank god that it was you  no one else in all the jungle could have stopped tantor  quickly the man cut the bonds that held korak and as the youth leaped to his feet and threw his arms about his father the older man turned toward meriem  i thought he said sternly that i told you to return to the farm  korak was looking at them wonderingly  in his heart was a great yearning to take the girl in his arms but in time he remembered the otherthe dapper young english gentlemanand that he was but a savage uncouth apeman  meriem looked up pleadingly into bwanas eyes  you told me she said in a very small voice that my place was beside the man i loved and she turned her eyes toward korak all filled with the wonderful light that no other man had yet seen in them and that none other ever would  the killer started toward her with outstretched arms but suddenly he fell upon one knee before her instead and lifting her hand to his lips kissed it more reverently than he could have kissed the hand of his countrys queen  a rumble from tantor brought the three all jungle bred to instant alertness  tantor was looking toward the trees behind them and as their eyes followed his gaze the head and shoulders of a great ape appeared amidst the foliage  for a moment the creature eyed them and then from its throat rose a loud scream of recognition and of joy and a moment later the beast had leaped to the ground followed by a score of bulls like himself and was waddling toward them shouting in the primordial tongue of the anthropoid  tarzan has returned  tarzan lord of the jungle  it was akut and instantly he commenced leaping and bounding about the trio uttering hideous shrieks and mouthings that to any other human beings might have indicated the most ferocious rage but these three knew that the king of the apes was doing homage to a king greater than himself  in his wake leaped his shaggy bulls vying with one another as to which could spring the highest and which utter the most uncanny sounds  korak laid his hand affectionately upon his fathers shoulder  there is but one tarzan he said  there can never be another   two days later the three dropped from the trees on the edge of the plain across which they could see the smoke rising from the bungalow and the cook house chimneys  tarzan of the apes had regained his civilized clothing from the tree where he had hidden it and as korak refused to enter the presence of his mother in the savage halfraiment that he had worn so long and as meriem would not leave him for fear as she explained that he would change his mind and run off into the jungle again the father went on ahead to the bungalow for horses and clothes  my dear met him at the gate her eyes filled with questioning and sorrow for she saw that meriem was not with him  where is she she asked her voice trembling  muviri told me that she disobeyed your instructions and ran off into the jungle after you had left them  oh john i cannot bear to lose her too and lady greystoke broke down and wept as she pillowed her head upon the broad breast where so often before she had found comfort in the great tragedies of her life  lord greystoke raised her head and looked down into her eyes his own smiling and filled with the light of happiness  what is it john she cried  you have good newsdo not keep me waiting for it  i want to be quite sure that you can stand hearing the best news that ever came to either of us he said  joy never kills she cried  you have foundher  she could not bring herself to hope for the impossible  yes jane he said and his voice was husky with emotion i have found her andhim  where is he  where are they she demanded  out there at the edge of the jungle  he wouldnt come to you in his savage leopard skin and his nakednesshe sent me to fetch him civilized clothing  she clapped her hands in ecstasy and turned to run toward the bungalow  wait she cried over her shoulder  i have all his little suitsi have saved them all  i will bring one to you  tarzan laughed and called to her to stop  the only clothing on the place that will fit him he said is mineif it isnt too small for himyour little boy has grown jane  she laughed too she felt like laughing at everything or at nothing the world was all love and happiness and joy once morethe world that had been shrouded in the gloom of her great sorrow for so many years so great was her joy that for the moment she forgot the sad message that awaited meriem  she called to tarzan after he had ridden away to prepare her for it but he did not hear and rode on without knowing himself what the event was to which his wife referred  and so an hour later korak the killer rode home to his motherthe mother whose image had never faded in his boyish heartand found in her arms and her eyes the love and forgiveness that he plead for  and then the mother turned toward meriem an expression of pitying sorrow erasing the happiness from her eyes  my little girl she said in the midst of our happiness a great sorrow awaits youmr baynes did not survive his wound  the expression of sorrow in meriems eyes expressed only what she sincerely felt but it was not the sorrow of a woman bereft of her best beloved  i am sorry she said quite simply  he would have done me a great wrong but he amply atoned before he died  once i thought that i loved him  at first it was only fascination for a type that was new to methen it was respect for a brave man who had the moral courage to admit a sin and the physical courage to face death to right the wrong he had committed  but it was not love  i did not know what love was until i knew that korak lived and she turned toward the killer with a smile  lady greystoke looked quickly up into the eyes of her sonthe son who one day would be lord greystoke  no thought of the difference in the stations of the girl and her boy entered her mind  to her meriem was fit for a king  she only wanted to know that jack loved the little arab waif  the look in his eyes answered the question in her heart and she threw her arms about them both and kissed them each a dozen times  now she cried i shall really have a daughter  it was several weary marches to the nearest mission but they only waited at the farm a few days for rest and preparation for the great event before setting out upon the journey and after the marriage ceremony had been performed they kept on to the coast to take passage for england  those days were the most wonderful of meriems life  she had not dreamed even vaguely of the marvels that civilization held in store for her  the great ocean and the commodious steamship filled her with awe  the noise and bustle and confusion of the english railway station frightened her  if there was a goodsized tree at hand she confided to korak i know that i should run to the very top of it in terror of my life  and make faces and throw twigs at the engine he laughed back  poor old numa sighed the girl  what will he do without us  oh there are others to tease him my little mangani assured korak  the greystoke town house quite took meriems breath away but when strangers were about none might guess that she had not been to the manner born  they had been home but a week when lord greystoke received a message from his friend of many years darnot  it was in the form of a letter of introduction brought by one general armand jacot  lord greystoke recalled the name as who familiar with modern french history would not for jacot was in reality the prince de cadrenetthat intense republican who refused to use even by courtesy a title that had belonged to his family for four hundred years  there is no place for princes in a republic he was wont to say  lord greystoke received the hawknosed gray mustached soldier in his library and after a dozen words the two men had formed a mutual esteem that was to endure through life  i have come to you explained general jacot because our dear admiral tells me that there is no one in all the world who is more intimately acquainted with central africa than you  let me tell you my story from the beginning  many years ago my little daughter was stolen presumably by arabs while i was serving with the foreign legion in algeria  we did all that love and money and even government resources could do to discover her but all to no avail her picture was published in the leading papers of every large city in the world yet never did we find a man or woman who ever had seen her since the day she mysteriously disappeared  a week since there came to me in paris a swarthy arab who called himself abdul kamak  he said that he had found my daughter and could lead me to her  i took him at once to admiral darnot whom i knew had traveled some in central africa  the mans story led the admiral to believe that the place where the white girl the arab supposed to be my daughter was held in captivity was not far from your african estates and he advised that i come at once and call upon youthat you would know if such a girl were in your neighborhood  what proof did the arab bring that she was your daughter asked lord greystoke  none replied the other  that is why we thought best to consult you before organizing an expedition  the fellow had only an old photograph of her on the back of which was pasted a newspaper cutting describing her and offering a reward  we feared that having found this somewhere it had aroused his cupidity and led him to believe that in some way he could obtain the reward possibly by foisting upon us a white girl on the chance that so many years had elapsed that we would not be able to recognize an imposter as such  have you the photograph with you asked lord greystoke  the general drew an envelope from his pocket took a yellowed photograph from it and handed it to the englishman  tears dimmed the old warriors eyes as they fell again upon the pictured features of his lost daughter  lord greystoke examined the photograph for a moment  a queer expression entered his eyes  he touched a bell at his elbow and an instant later a footman entered  ask my sons wife if she will be so good as to come to the library he directed  the two men sat in silence  general jacot was too well bred to show in any way the chagrin and disappointment he felt in the summary manner in which lord greystoke had dismissed the subject of his call  as soon as the young lady had come and he had been presented he would make his departure  a moment later meriem entered  lord greystoke and general jacot rose and faced her  the englishman spoke no word of introductionhe wanted to mark the effect of the first sight of the girls face on the frenchman for he had a theorya heavenborn theory that had leaped into his mind the moment his eyes had rested on the baby face of jeanne jacot  general jacot took one look at meriem then he turned toward lord greystoke  how long have you known it he asked a trifle accusingly  since you showed me that photograph a moment ago replied the englishman  it is she said jacot shaking with suppressed emotion but she does not recognize meof course she could not  then he turned to meriem my child he said i am your  but she interrupted him with a quick glad cry as she ran toward him with outstretched arms  i know you  i know you she cried  oh now i remember and the old man folded her in his arms  jack clayton and his mother were summoned and when the story had been told them they were only glad that little meriem had found a father and a mother  and really you didnt marry an arab waif after all said meriem isnt it fine  you are fine replied the killer  i married my little meriem and i dont care for my part whether she is an arab or just a little tarmangani  she is neither my son said general armand jacot  she is a princess in her own right
