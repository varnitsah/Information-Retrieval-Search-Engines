77342754	the hand of ethelbertaa comedy in chapters by thomas hardy      vitae postscenia celantlucretius     preface   this somewhat frivolous narrative was produced as an interlude between stories of a more sober design and it was given the subtitle of a comedy to indicatethough not quite accuratelythe aim of the performance  a high degree of probability was not attempted in the arrangement of the incidents and there was expected of the reader a certain lightness of mood which should inform him with a goodnatured willingness to accept the production in the spirit in which it was offered  the characters themselves however were meant to be consistent and human  on its first appearance the novel suffered perhaps deservedly for what was involved in these intentionsfor its quality of unexpectedness in particularthat unforgivable sin in the critics sightthe immediate precursor of ethelberta having been a purely rural tale  moreover in its choice of medium and line of perspective it undertook a delicate task to excite interest in a dramaif such a dignified word may be used in the connectionwherein servants were as important as or more important than their masters wherein the drawingroom was sketched in many cases from the point of view of the servants hall  such a reversal of the social foreground has perhaps since grown more welcome and readers even of the finer crusted kind may now be disposed to pardon a writer for presenting the sons and daughters of mr and mrs chickerel as beings who come within the scope of a congenial regard  t h  december 1895     contents

country walk  by her look and carriage she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen but as a fact not generally known her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than of blood  she was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in a large house not his own and began life as a baby christened ethelberta after an infant of title who does not come into the story at all having merely furnished ethelbertas mother with a subject of contemplation  she became teacher in a school was praised by examiners admired by gentlemen not admired by gentlewomen was touched up with accomplishments by masters who were coaxed into painstaking by her many graces and entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof was stealthily married by the son  he a minor like herself died from a chill caught during the wedding tour and a few weeks later was followed into the grave by sir ralph petherwin his unforgiving father who had bequeathed his wealth to his wife absolutely  these calamities were a sufficient reason to lady petherwin for pardoning all concerned  she took by the hand the forlorn ethelbertawho seemed rather a detached bride than a widowand finished her education by placing her for two or three years in a boardingschool at bonn  latterly she had brought the girl to england to live under her roof as daughter and companion the condition attached being that ethelberta was never openly to recognize her relations for reasons which will hereafter appear  the elegant young lady as she had a full right to be called if she cared for the definition arrested all the local attention when she emerged into the summerevening light with that diademandsceptre bearingmany people for reasons of heredity discovering such graces only in those whose vestibules are lined with ancestral mail forgetting that a bear may be taught to dance  while this air of hers lasted even the inanimate objects in the street appeared to know that she was there but from a way she had of carelessly overthrowing her dignity by versatile moods one could not calculate upon its presence to a certainty when she was round corners or in little lanes which demanded no repression of animal spirits  well to be sure exclaimed a milkman regarding her  we should freeze in our beds if twere not for the sun and dang me if she isnt a pretty piece  a man could make a meal between them eyes and chineh hostler  odd nation dang my old sides if he couldnt  the speaker who had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke deposited them upon the edge of the pavement in front of the inn and straightened his back to an excruciating perpendicular  his remarks had been addressed to a rickety person wearing a waistcoat of that preternatural length from the top to the bottom button which prevails among men who have to do with horses  he was sweeping straws from the carriageway beneath the stone arch that formed a passage to the stables behind  never mind the cursing and swearing or somebody whos never out of hearing may clap yer name down in his black book said the hostler also pausing and lifting his eyes to the mullioned and transomed windows and moulded parapet above himnot to study them as features of ancient architecture but just to give as healthful a stretch to the eyes as his acquaintance had done to his back  michael a old man like you ought to think about other things and not be looking two ways at your time of life  pouncing upon young flesh like a carrion crowtis a vile thing in a old man  tis and yet tis not for tis a naterel taste said the milkman again surveying ethelberta who had now paused upon a bridge in full view to look down the river  now if a poor needy feller like myself could only catch her alone when shes dressed up to the nines for some grand party and carry her off to some lonely placesakes what a pot of jewels and goold things i warrant hed find about her  twould pay en for his trouble  i dont dispute the picter but tis sly and untimely to think such roguery  though ive had thoughts like it tis true about high womenlord forgive me fort  and that figure of fashion standing there is a widow woman so i hear  ladynot a penny less than lady  ay a thing of twentyone or thereabouts  a widow lady and twentyone  tis a backward age for a body whos so forward in her state of life  well be that as twill heres my showings for her age  she was about the figure of two or threeandtwenty when a got off the carriage last night tired out wi boaming about the country and nineteen this morning when she came downstairs after a sleep round the clock and a clanewashed face so i thought to myself twentyone i thought  and whats the young womans name make so bold hostler  ay and the house were all in a stoor with her and the old woman and their boxes and campkettles that they carry to wash in because hand basons baint big enough and i dont know what all and tother folk stopping here were no more than dirt thenceforard  i suppose theyve come out of some noble city a long way herefrom  and there was her hair up in buckle as if shed never seen a claycold man at all  however to cut a long story short all i know besides about em is that the name upon their luggage is lady petherwin and shes the widow of a city gentleman who was a man of valour in the lord mayors show  whos that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back come out of the door but now said the milkman nodding towards a figure of that description who had just emerged from the inn and trudged off in the direction taken by the ladynow out of sight  chap in the gaiters  chok it allwhy the father of that nobleman that you call chap in the gaiters used to be hand in glove with half the queens court  what dye tell o  that mans father was one of the mayor and corporation of sandbourne and was that familiar with men of money that hed slap em upon the shoulder as you or i or any other poor fool would the clerk of the parish  o whats my lordlins name make so bold then  ay the toppermost class nowadays have left off the use of wheels for the good of their constitutions so they traipse and walk for many years up foreign hills where you can see nothing but snow and fog till theres no more left to walk up and if they reach home alive and hant got too old and weared out they walk and see a little of their own parishes  so they tower about with a pack and a stick and a clane white pockethandkerchief over their hats just as you see hes got on his  hes been staying here a night and is off now again  young man young man i think to myself if your shoulders were bent like a bandy and your knees bowed out as mine be till there is not an inch of straight bone or gristle in ee th wouldstnt go

and what was this young widow ladys maiden name then hostler  folk have been peeping after her thats true but they dont seem to know much about her family  and while ive tended horses fifty year that other folk might straddle em here i be now not a penny the better  oftentimes when i see so many good things about i feel inclined to help myself in common justice to my pocket     work hard and be

againnight tee michael  and the hostler went on with his sweeping  night tee hostler i must move too said the milkman shouldering his yoke and walking off and there reached the inn in a gradual diminuendo as he receded up the street shaking his head convulsively more knowtom foolthan tom foolhohohohoho  the red lion as the inn or hotel was called which of late years had become the fashion among tourists because of the absence from its precincts of all that was fashionable and new stood near the middle of the town and formed a corner where in winter the winds whistled and assembled their forces previous to plunging helterskelter along the streets  in summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot convenient for such quiet characters as sojourned there to study the geology and beautiful natural features of the country round  the lady whose appearance had asserted a difference between herself and the anglebury people without too clearly showing what that difference was passed out of the town in a few moments and following the highway across meadows fed by the froom she crossed the railway and soon got into a lonely heath  she had been watching the base of a cloud as it closed down upon the line of a distant ridge like an upper upon a lower eyelid shutting in the gaze of the evening sun  she was about to return before dusk came on when she heard a commotion in the air immediately behind and above her head  the saunterer looked up and saw a wildduck flying along with the greatest violence just in its rear being another large bird which a countryman would have pronounced to be one of the biggest duckhawks that he had ever beheld  the hawk neared its intended victim and the duck screamed and redoubled its efforts  ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have made a little dog bark with delight and run after her object being if possible to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so small and unheardof  her stateliness went away and it could be forgiven for not remaining for her feet suddenly became as quick as fingers and she raced along over the uneven ground with such force of tread that being a woman slightly heavier than gossamer her patent heels punched little ds in the soil with unerring accuracy wherever it was bare crippled the heathertwigs where it was not and sucked the swampy places with a sound of quick kisses  her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an open place as that around her having at one point in the journey been so near that she could hear the whisk of the ducks feathers against the wind as it lifted and lowered its wings  when the bird seemed to be but a few yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards and after a level flight of a quarter of a minute vanish  the hawk swooped after and ethelberta now perceived a whitely shining oval of still water looking amid the swarthy level of the heath like a hole through to a nether sky  into this large pond which the duck had been making towards from the beginning of its precipitate flight it had dived out of sight  the excited and breathless runner was in a few moments close enough to see the disappointed hawk hovering and floating in the air as if waiting for the reappearance of its prey upon which grim pastime it was so intent that by creeping along softly she was enabled to get very near the edge of the pool and witness the conclusion of the episode  whenever the duck was under the necessity of showing its head to breathe the other bird would dart towards it invariably too late however for the diver was far too experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard family at this game to come up twice near the same spot unaccountably emerging from opposite sides of the pool in succession and bobbing again by the time its adversary reached each place so that at length the hawk gave up the contest and flew away a satanic moodiness being almost perceptible in the motion of its wings  the young lady now looked around her for the first time and began to perceive that she had run a long distancevery much further than she had originally intended to come  her eyes had been so long fixed upon the hawk as it soared against the bright and mottled field of sky that on regarding the heather and plain again it was as if she had returned to a halfforgotten region after an absence and the whole prospect was darkened to one uniform shade of approaching night  she began at once to retrace her steps but having been indiscriminately wheeling round the pond to get a good view of the performance and having followed no path thither she found the proper direction of her journey to be a matter of some uncertainty  surely she said to herself i faced the north at starting and yet on walking now with her back where her face had been set she did not approach any marks on the horizon which might seem to signify the town thus dubiously but with little real concern she walked on till the evening light began to turn to dusk and the shadows to darkness  presently in front of her ethelberta saw a white spot in the shade and it proved to be in some way attached to the head of a man who was coming towards her out of a slight depression in the ground  it was as yet too early in the evening to be afraid but it was too late to be altogether courageous and with balanced sensations ethelberta kept her eye sharply upon him as he rose by degrees into view  the peculiar arrangement of his hat and pugree soon struck her as being that she had casually noticed on a peg in one of the rooms of the red lion and when he came close she saw that his arms diminished to a peculiar smallness at their junction with his shoulders like those of a doll which was explained by their being girt round at that point with the straps of a knapsack that he carried behind him  encouraged by the probability that he like herself was staying or had been staying at the red lion she said can you tell me if this is the way back to anglebury  it is one way but the nearest is in this direction said the touristthe same who had been criticized by the two old men  at hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young ladys person stood still she stopped like a clock  when she could again fence with the perception which had caused all this she breathed  mr julian she exclaimed  the words were uttered in a way which would have told anybody in a moment that here lay something connected with the light of other days  ah mrs petherwinyes i am mr julianthough that can matter very little i should think after all these years and what has passed  no remark was returned to this rugged reply and he continued unconcernedly shall i put you in the pathit is just here  if you please  come with me then  she walked in silence at his heels not a word passing between them all the way the only noises which came from the two were the brushing of her dress and his gaiters against the heather or the smart rap of a stray flint against his boot  they had now reached a little knoll and he turned abruptly that is angleburyjust where you see those lights  the path down there is the one you must follow it leads round the hill yonder and directly into the town  thank you she murmured and found that he had never removed his eyes from her since speaking keeping them fixed with mathematical exactness upon one point in her face  she moved a little to go on her way he moved a little lessto go on his  goodnight said mr julian  the moment upon the very face of it was critical and yet it was one of those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite character as good or bad  thus much would have been obvious to any outsider it may have been doubly so to ethelberta for she gave back more than she had got replying goodbyeif you are going to say no more  then in struck mr julian what can i say  you are nothing to me    i could forgive a woman doing anything for spite except marrying for spite  the connection of that with our present meeting does not appear unless it refers to what you have done  it does not refer to me  i am not married you are  she did not contradict him as she might have done  christopher she said at last this is how it is you knew too much of me to respect me and too little to pity me  a half knowledge of anothers life mostly does injustice to the life half known  then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more i must do my best to know you less and elevate my opinion of your nature by forgetting what it consists in he said in a voice from which all feeling was polished away  if i did not know that bitterness had more to do with those words than judgment ishould bebitter too  you never knew half about me you only knew me as a governess you little think what my beginnings were  i have guessed  i have many times told myself that your early life was superior to your position when i first met you  i think i may say without presumption that i recognize a lady by birth when i see her even under reverses of an extreme kind  and certainly there is this to be said that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again  ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings  however we are wasting words he resumed cheerfully  it is better for us to part as we met and continue to be the strangers that we have become to each other  i owe you an apology for having been betrayed into more feeling than i had a right to show and let us part friends  good night mrs petherwin and success to you  we may meet again some day i hope  good night she said extending her hand  he touched it turned about and in a short time nothing remained of him but quick regular brushings against the heather in the deep broad shadow of the moor  ethelberta slowly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out  this meeting had surprised her in several ways  first there was the conjuncture itself but more than that was the fact that he had not parted from her with any of the tragic resentment that she had from time to time imagined for that scene if it ever occurred  yet there was really nothing wonderful in this it is part of the generous nature of a bachelor to be not indisposed to forgive a portionless sweetheart who by marrying elsewhere has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged to marry her himself  ethelberta would have been disappointed quite had there not been a comforting development of exasperation in the middle part of his talk but after all it formed a poor substitute for the loving hatred she had expected  when she reached the hotel the lamp over the door showed a face a little flushed but the agitation which at first had possessed her was gone to a mere nothing  in the hall she met a slender woman wearing a silk dress of that peculiar black which in sunlight proclaims itself to have once seen better days as a brown and days even better than those as a lavender green or blue  menlove said the lady did you notice if any gentleman observed and followed me when i left the hotel to go for a walk this evening  the ladysmaid thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage after lovers put a hand to her forehead to show that there was no mistake about her having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect and said at last you once told me maam if you recollect that when you were dressed i was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you were a doll i had just manufactured and sent round for sale  yes so i did  so i didnt see if anybody followed you this evening  then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train last night  o no maamhow could i said mrs menlovean exclamation which was more apposite than her mistress suspected considering that the speaker after retiring from duty had slipped down her dark skirt to reveal a light puffed and festooned one put on a hat and feather together with several pennyweights of metal in the form of rings brooches and earringsall in a time whilst one could count a hundredand enjoyed halfanhour of prime courtship by an honourable young waiter of the town who had proved constant as the magnet to the pole for the space of the day and a half that she had known him  going at once upstairs ethelberta ran down the passage and after some hesitation softly opened the door of the sittingroom in the best suite of apartments that the inn could boast of  in this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles with green shades  well knowing as it seemed who the intruder was she continued her occupation and her visitor advanced and stood beside the table  the old lady wore her spectacles low down her cheek her glance being depressed to about the slope of her straight white nose in order to look through them  her mouth was pursed up to almost a youthful shape as she formed the letters with her pen and a slight move of the lip accompanied every downstroke  there were two large antique rings on her forefinger against which the quill rubbed in moving backwards and forwards thereby causing a secondary noise rivalling the primary one of the nib upon the paper  mamma said the younger lady here i am at last  a writers mind in the midst of a sentence being like a ship at sea knowing no rest or comfort till safely piloted into the harbour of a full stop lady petherwin just replied with what in an occupied tone not rising to interrogation  after signing her name to the letter she raised her eyes  why how late you are ethelberta and how heated you look she said i have been quite alarmed about you  what do you say has happened  the great chief and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened was the accidental meeting with an old lover whom she had once quarrelled with and ethelbertas honesty would have delivered the tidings at once had not unfortunately all the rest of her attributes been dead against that act for the old ladys sake even more than for her own  i saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck she exclaimed innocently  and i ran after to see what the end of it would bemuch further than i had any idea of going  however the duck came to a pond and in running round it to see the end of the fight i could not remember which way i had come  mercy said her motherinlaw lifting her large eyelids heavy as windowshutters and spreading out her fingers like the horns of a snail you might have sunk up to your knees and got lost in that swampy placesuch a time of night too  what a tomboy you are  and how did you find your way home after all  o some man showed me the way and then i had no difficulty and after that i came along leisurely  i thought you had been running all the way you look so warm  it is a warm evening     yes and i have been thinking of old times as i walked along she said and how peoples positions in life alter have i not heard you say that while i was at bonn at school some family that we had known had their household broken up when the father died and that the children went away you didnt know where  do you mean the julians  yes that was the name  why of course you know it was the julians  young julian had a day or twos fancy for you one summer had he notjust after you came to us at the same time or just before it that my poor boy and you were so desperately attached to each other  o yes i recollect said ethelberta  and he had a sister i think  i wonder where they went to live after the family collapse  i do not know said lady petherwin taking up another sheet of paper i have a dim notion that the son who had been brought up to no profession became a teacher of music in some country townmusic having always been his hobby  but the facts are not very distinct in my memory  and she dipped her pen for another letter  ethelberta with a rather fallen countenance then left her motherin law and went where all ladies are supposed to go when they want to torment their minds in comfortto her own room  here she thoughtfully sat down awhile and some time later she rang for her maid  menlove she said without looking towards a rustle and half a footstep that had just come in at the door but leaning back in her chair and speaking towards the corner of the lookingglass will you go down and find out if any gentleman named julian has been staying in this house get to know it i mean menlove not by directly inquiring you have ways of getting to know things have you not  if the devoted george were here now he would help  george was nothing to me maam  james then  and i only had james for a week or ten days when i found he was a married man i encouraged his addresses very little indeed  if you had encouraged him heart and soul you couldnt have fumed more at the loss of him  but please to go and make that inquiry will you menlove  in a few minutes ethelbertas woman was back again  a gentleman of that name stayed here last night and left this afternoon  will you find out his address  now the ladysmaid had already been quickwitted enough to find out that and indeed all about him but it chanced that a fashionable illustrated weekly paper had just been sent from the booksellers and being in want of a little time to look it over before it reached her mistresss hands mrs menlove retired as if to go and ask the questionto stand meanwhile under the gaslamp in the passage inspecting the fascinating engravings  but as time will not wait for tirewomen a natural length of absence soon elapsed and she returned again and said  his address is upper street sandbourne  thank you that will do replied her mistress  the hour grew later and that dreamy period came round when ladies fancies that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day begin to assert themselves anew  at this time a good guess at ethelbertas thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes away  instead of reading entering notes in her diary or doing any ordinary thing she walked to and fro curled her pretty nether lip within her pretty upper one a great many times made a cradle of her locked fingers and paused with fixed eyes where the walls of the room set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but a picture within her mind     2 christophers housesandbourne townsandbourne moor   during the wet autumn of the same year the postman passed one morning as usual into a plain street that ran through the less fashionable portion of sandbourne a modern coast town and wateringplace not many miles from the ancient anglebury  he knocked at the door of a flatfaced brick house and it was opened by a slight thoughtful young man with his hat on just then coming out  the postman put into his hands a book packet addressed christopher julian esq  christopher took the package upstairs opened it with curiosity and discovered within a green volume of poems by an anonymous writer the titlepage bearing the inscription metres by e  the book was new though it was cut and it appeared to have been looked into  the young man after turning it over and wondering where it came from laid it on the table and went his way being in haste to fulfil his engagements for the day  in the evening on returning home from his occupations he sat himself down cosily to read the newlyarrived volume  the winds of this uncertain season were snarling in the chimneys and drops of rain spat themselves into the fire revealing plainly that the young mans room was not far enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist in the flue and revealing darkly a little more if that social ruleofthree inverse the higher in lodgings the lower in pocket were applicable here however the aspect of the room though homely was cheerful a somewhat contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted of waifs and strays from a former home the grimy faces of the old articles exercising a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of the new  an oval mirror of rococo workmanship and a heavy cabinetpiano with a cornice like that of an egyptian temple adjoined a harmonium of yesterday and a harp that was almost as new  printed music of the last century and manuscript music of the previous evening lay there in such quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a retreat which was indeed only saved from a chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that sometimes played with the lightness of breezes about the sewingmachine standing in a remote cornerif any corner could be called remote in a room so small  fire lights and shades from the shaking flames struck in a butterfly flutter on the underparts of the mantelshelf and upon the readers cheek as he sat  presently and all at once a much greater intentness pervaded his face he turned back again and read anew the subject that had arrested his eyes  he was a man whose countenance varied with his mood though it kept somewhat in the rear of that mood  he looked sad when he felt almost serene and only serene when he felt quite cheerful it is a habit people acquire who have had repressing experiences  a faint smile and flush now lightened his face and jumping up he opened the door and exclaimed faith will you come here for a moment  a prompt step was heard on the stairs and the young person addressed as faith entered the room  she was small in figure and bore less in the form of her features than in their shades when changing from expression to expression the evidence that she was his sister  faithi want your opinion  but stop read this first  he laid his finger upon a page in the book and placed it in her hand  the girl drew from her pocket a little greenleather sheath worn at the edges to whitybrown and out of that a pair of spectacles unconsciously looking round the room for a moment as she did so as if to ensure that no stranger saw her in the act of using them  here a weakness was uncovered at once it was a small pretty and natural one indeed as weaknesses go in the great world it might almost have been called a commendable trait  she then began to read without sitting down  these metres by e composed a collection of soft and marvellously musical rhymes of a nature known as the vers de societe  the lines presented a series of playful defences of the supposed strategy of womankind in fascination courtship and marriagethe whole teeming with ideas bright as mirrors and just as unsubstantial yet forming a brilliant argument to justify the ways of girls to men  the pervading characteristic of the mass was the means of forcing into notice by strangeness of contrast the single mournful poem that the book contained  it was placed at the very end and under the title of cancelled words formed a whimsical and rather affecting lovelament somewhat in the tone of many of sir thomas wyatts poems  this was the piece which had arrested christophers attention and had been pointed out by him to his sister faith  it is very touching she said looking up  what do you think i suspect about itthat the poem is addressed to me do you remember when father was alive and we were at solentsea that season about a governess who came there with a sir ralph petherwin and his wife people with a sickly little daughter and a grownup son  i never saw any of them  i think i remember your knowing something about a young man of that name  yes that was the family  well the governess there was a very attractive woman and somehow or other i got more interested in her than i ought to have done this is necessary to the history and we used to meet in romantic placesandand that kind of thing you know  the end of it was she jilted me and married the son  you were anxious to get away from solentsea  was i  then that was chiefly the reason  well i decided to think no more of her and i was helped to do it by the troubles that came upon us shortly afterwards it is a blessed arrangement that one does not feel a sentimental grief at all when additional grief comes in the shape of practical misfortune  however on the first afternoon of the little holiday i took for my walking tour last summer i came to anglebury and stayed about the neighbourhood for a day or two to see what it was like thinking we might settle there if this place failed us  the next evening i left and walked across the heath to flychettthats a village about five miles further onso as to be that distance on my way for next morning and while i was crossing the heath there i met this very woman we talked a little because we couldnt help ityou may imagine the kind of talk it wasand parted as coolly as we had met  now this strange book comes to me and i have a strong conviction that she is the writer of it for that poem sketches a similar sceneor rather suggests it and the tone generally seems the kind of thing she would writenot that she was a sad woman either  she seems to be a warmhearted impulsive woman to judge from these tender verses  people who print very warm words have sometimes very cold manners  i wonder if it is really her writing and if she has sent it to me  would it not be a singular thing for a married woman to do  though of courseshe removed her spectacles as if they hindered her from thinking and hid them under the timepiece till she should go on readingof course poets have morals and manners of their own and custom is no argument with them  i am sure i would not have sent it to a man for the world  i do not see any absolute harm in her sending it  perhaps she thinks that since it is all over we may as well die friends  if i were her husband i should have doubts about the dying  and all over may not be so plain to other people as it is to you  perhaps not  and when a man checks all a womans finer sentiments towards him by marrying her it is only natural that it should find a vent somewhere  however she probably does not know of my downfall since fathers death  i hardly think she would have cared to do it had she known that  i am assuming that it is ethelbertamrs petherwinwho sends it of course i am not sure  we must remember that when i knew her i was a gentleman at ease who had not the least notion that i should have to work for a living and not only so but should have first to invent a profession to work at out of my old tastes  kit you have made two mistakes in your thoughts of that lady  even though i dont know her i can show you that  now ill tell you the first is in thinking that a married lady would send the book with that poem in it without at any rate a slight doubt as to its propriety the second is in supposing that had she wished to do it she would have given the thing up because of our misfortunes  with a true woman the second reason would have had no effect had she once got over the first im a woman and thats why i know  christopher said nothing and turned over the poems        he lived by teaching music and in comparison with starving thrived though the wealthy might possibly have said that in comparison with thriving he starved  during this night he hummed airs in bed thought he would do for the ballad of the fair poetess what other musicians had done for the ballads of other fair poetesses and dreamed that she smiled on him as her prototype sappho smiled on phaon  the next morning before starting on his rounds a new circumstance induced him to direct his steps to the booksellers and ask a question  he had found on examining the wrapper of the volume that it was posted in his own town  no copy of the book has been sold by me the booksellers voice replied from far up the alpine height of the shopladder where he stood dusting stale volumes as was his habit of a morning before customers came  i have never heard of itprobably never shall and he shook out the duster so as to hit the delicate mean between stifling christopher and not stifling him  surely you dont live by your shop said christopher drawing back  the booksellers eyes rested on the speakers his face changed he came down and placed his hand on the lapel of christophers coat  sir he said country bookselling is a miserable impoverishing exasperating thing in these days  can you understand the rest  i can i forgive a starving man anything said christopher  you go a long way very suddenly said the book seller  half as much pity would have seemed better  however wait a moment  he looked into a list of new books and added the work you allude to was only published last week though mind you if it had been published last century i might not have sold a copy  although his time was precious christopher had now become so interested in the circumstance that the unseen sender was somebody breathing his own atmosphere possibly the very writer herselfthe book being too new to be knownthat he again passed through the blue shadow of the spire which stretched across the street today and went towards the postoffice animated by a bright intentionto ask the postmaster if he knew the handwriting in which the packet was addressed  now the postmaster was an acquaintance of christophers but as regarded putting that question to him there was a difficulty  everything turned upon whether the postmaster at the moment of asking would be in his under government manner or in the manner with which mere nature had endowed him  in the latter case his reply would be all that could be wished in the former a man who had sunk in society might as well put his tongue into a mousetrap as make an inquiry so obviously outside the pale of legality as was this  so he postponed his business for the present and refrained from entering till he passed by after dinner when pleasant malt liquor of that capacity for cheering which is expressed by four large letter xs marching in a row had refilled the globular trunk of the postmaster and neutralized some of the effects of officiality  the time was well chosen but the inquiry threatened to prove fruitless the postmaster had never to his knowledge seen the writing before  christopher was turning away when a clerk in the background looked up and stated that some young lady had brought a packet with such an address upon it into the office two days earlier to get it stamped  do you know her said christopher  i have seen her about the neighbourhood  she goes by every morning i think she comes into the town from beyond the common and returns again between four and five in the afternoon  what does she wear  a white wool jacket with zigzags of black braid  christopher left the postoffice and went his way  among his other pupils there were two who lived at some distance from sandbourneone of them in the direction indicated as that habitually taken by the young person and in the afternoon as he returned homeward christopher loitered and looked around  at first he could see nobody but when about a mile from the outskirts of the town he discerned a light spot ahead of him which actually turned out to be the jacket alluded to  in due time he met the wearer face to face she was not ethelberta petherwinquite a different sort of individual  he had long made up his mind that this would be the case yet he was in some indescribable way disappointed  of the two classes into which gentle young women naturally divide those who grow red at their weddings and those who grow pale the present one belonged to the former class  she was an aprilnatured pinkcheeked girl with eyes that would have made any jeweller in england think of his tradeone who evidently took her day in the daytime frequently caught the early worm and had little to do with yawns or candlelight  she came and passed him he fancied that her countenance changed  but one may fancy anything and the pair receded each from each without turning their heads  he could not speak to her plain and simple as she seemed  it is rarely that a man who can be entered and made to throb by the channel of his ears is not open to a similar attack through the channel of his eyesfor many doors will admit to one mansionallowance being made for the readier capacity of chosen and practised organs  hence the beauties concords and eloquences of the female form were never without their effect upon christopher a born musician artist poet seer mouthpiecewhichever a translator of natures oracles into simple speech may be called  the young girl who had gone by was fresh and pleasant moreover she was a sort of mysterious link between himself and the past which these things were vividly reviving in him  the following week christopher met her again  she had not much dignity he had not much reserve and the sudden resolution to have a holiday which sometimes impels a plump heart to rise up against a brain that overweights it was not to be resisted  he just lifted his hat and put the only question he could think of as a beginning have i the pleasure of addressing the author of a book of very melodious poems that was sent me the other day  the girls forefinger twirled rapidly the loop of braid that it had previously been twirling slowly and drawing in her breath she said no sir  the sender then  yes  she somehow presented herself as so insignificant by the combined effect of the manner and the words that christopher lowered his method of address to her level at once  ah he said such an atmosphere as the writer of metres by e seems to breathe would soon spoil cheeks that are fresh and round as ladyappleseh little girl  but are you disposed to tell me that writers name  by applying a general idea to a particular case a person with the best of intentions may find himself immediately landed in a quandary  in saying to the country girl before him what would have suited the mass of country lasses well enough christopher had offended her beyond the cure of compliment  i am not disposed to tell the writers name she replied with a dudgeon that was very great for one whose whole stock of it was a trifle and she passed on and left him standing alone  thus further conversation was checked but through having rearranged the hours of his country lessons christopher met her the next wednesday and the next friday and throughout the following weekno further words passing between them  for a while she went by very demurely apparently mindful of his offence  but effrontery is not proved to be part of a mans nature till he has been guilty of a second act the best of men may commit a first through accident or ignorancemay even be betrayed into it by overzeal for experiment  some such conclusion may or may not have been arrived at by the girl with the ladyapple cheeks at any rate after the lapse of another week a new spectacle presented itself her redness deepened whenever christopher passed her by and embarrassment pervaded her from the lowest stitch to the tip of her feather  she had little chance of escaping him by diverging from the road for a figure could be seen across the open ground to the distance of half a mile on either side  one day as he drew near as usual she met him as women meet a cloud of dustshe turned and looked backwards till he had passed  this would have been disconcerting but for one reason christopher was ceasing to notice her  he was a man who often when walking abroad and looking as it were at the scene before his eyes discerned successes and failures friends and relations episodes of childhood wedding feasts and funerals the landscape suffering greatly by these visions until it became no more than the patterned walltints about the paintings in a gallery something necessary to the tone yet not regarded  nothing but a special concentration of himself on externals could interrupt this habit and now that her appearance along the way had changed from a chance to a custom he began to lapse again into the old trick  he gazed once or twice at her form without seeing it he did not notice that she trembled  he sometimes read as he walked and book in hand he frequently approached her now  this went on till six weeks had passed from the time of their first encounter  latterly might have been once or twice heard when he had moved out of earshot a sound like a small gasping sigh but no arrangements were disturbed and christopher continued to keep down his eyes as persistently as a saint in a church window  the last day of his engagement had arrived and with it the last of his walks that way  on his final return he carried in his hand a bunch of flowers which had been presented to him at the countryhouse where his lessons were given  he was taking them home to his sister faith who prized the lingering blossoms of the seeding season  soon appeared as usual his fellowtraveller whereupon christopher looked down upon his nosegay  sweet simple girl he thought ill endeavour to make peace with her by means of these flowers before we part for good  when she came up he held them out to her and said will you allow me to present you with these  the bright colours of the nosegay instantly attracted the girls handperhaps before there had been time for thought to thoroughly construe the position for it happened that when her arm was stretched into the air she steadied it quickly and stood with the pose of a statuerigid with uncertainty  but it was too late to refuse christopher had put the nosegay within her fingers  whatever pleasant expression of thanks may have appeared in her eyes fell only on the bunch of flowers for during the whole transaction they reached to no higher level than that  to say that he was coming no more seemed scarcely necessary under the circumstances and wishing her good afternoon very heartily he passed on  he had learnt by this time her occupation which was that of pupilteacher at one of the schools in the town whither she walked daily from a village near  if he had not been poor and the little teacher humble christopher might possibly have been tempted to inquire more briskly about her and who knows how such a pursuit might have ended  but hard externals rule volatile sentiment and under these untoward influences the girl and the book and the truth about its author were matters upon which he could not afford to expend much time  all christopher did was to think now and then of the pretty innocent face and round deep eyes not once wondering if the mind which enlivened them ever thought of him     3 sandbourne moor continued   it was one of those hostile days of the year when chatterbox ladies remain miserably in their homes to save the carriage and harness when clerks wives hate living in lodgings when vehicles and people appear in the street with duplicates of themselves underfoot when bricklayers slaters and other outdoor journeymen sit in a shed and drink beer when ducks and drakes play with hilarious delight at their own family game or spread out one wing after another in the slower enjoyment of letting the delicious moisture penetrate to their innermost down  the smoke from the flues of sandbourne had barely strength enough to emerge into the drizzling rain and hung down the sides of each chimneypot like the streamer of a becalmed ship and a troop of rats might have rattled down the pipes from roof to basement with less noise than did the water that day  on the broad moor beyond the town where christophers meetings with the teacher had so regularly occurred were a stream and some large pools and beside one of these near some hatches and a weir stood a little square building not much larger inside than the lord mayors coach  it was known simply as the weir house  on this wet afternoon which was the one following the day of christophers last lesson over the plain a nearly invisible smoke came from the puny chimney of the hut  though the door was closed sounds of chatting and mirth fizzed from the interior and would have told anybody who had come nearwhich nobody didthat the usually empty shell was tenanted today  the scene within was a large fire in a fireplace to which the whole floor of the house was no more than a hearthstone  the occupants were two gentlemanly persons in shooting costume who had been traversing the moor for miles in search of wild duck and teal a waterman and a small spaniel  in the corner stood their guns and two or three wild mallards which represented the scanty product of their mornings labour the iridescent necks of the dead birds replying to every flicker of the fire the two sportsmen were smoking and their man was mostly occupying himself in poking and stirring the fire with a stick all three appeared to be pretty well wetted  one of the gentlemen by way of varying the not very exhilarating study of four brick walls within microscopic distance of his eye turned to a small square hole which admitted light and air to the hut and looked out upon the dreary prospect before him  the wide concave of cloud of the monotonous hue of dull pewter formed an unbroken hood over the level from horizon to horizon beneath it reflecting its wan lustre was the glazed highroad which stretched hedgeless and ditchless past a directingpost where another road joined it and on to the less regular ground beyond lying like a riband unrolled across the scene till it vanished over the furthermost undulation  beside the pools were occasional tall sheaves of flags and sedge and about the plain a few bushes these forming the only obstructions to a view otherwise unbroken  the sportsmans attention was attracted by a figure in a state of gradual enlargement as it approached along the road  i should think that if pleasure cant tempt a native out of doors to day business will never force him out he observed  there is for the first time somebody coming along the road  if business dont drag him out pleasurell never tempt en is more like our nater in these parts sir said the man who was looking into the fire  the conversation showed no vitality and down it dropped dead as before the man who was standing up continuing to gaze into the moisture  what had at first appeared as an epicene shape the decreasing space resolved into a cloaked female under an umbrella she now relaxed her pace till reaching the directingpost where the road branched into two she paused and looked about her  instead of coming further she slowly retraced her steps for about a hundred yards  thats an appointment said the first speaker as he removed the cigar from his lips and by the lords what a day and place for an appointment with a woman  whats an appointment inquired his friend a town young man with a tussaud complexion and wellpencilled brows half way up his forehead so that his upper eyelids appeared to possess the uncommon quality of tallness  look out here and youll see  by that directingpost where the two roads meet  as a man devoted to art ladywell who has had the honour of being hung higher up on the academy walls than any other living painter you should take out your sketchbook and dash off the scene  where nothing particular is going on one incident makes a drama and interested in that proportion the artsportsman puts up his eyeglass a form he adhered to before firing at game that had risen by which merciful arrangement the bird got safe off placed his face beside his companions and also peered through the opening  the young pupilteacherfor she was the object of their scrutinyreapproached the spot whereon she had been accustomed for the last many weeks of her journey home to meet christopher now for the first time missing and again she seemed reluctant to pass the handpost for that marked the point where the chance of seeing him ended  she glided backwards as before this time keeping her face still to the front as if trying to persuade the world at large and her own shamefacedness that she had not yet approached the place at all  query how long will she wait for him for it is a man to a certainty resumed the elder of the smokers at the end of several minutes of silence when full of vacillation and doubt she became lost to view behind some bushes  will she reappear  the smoking went on and up she came into open ground as before and walked by  i wonder who the girl is to come to such a place in this weather  there she is again said the young man called ladywell  some cottage lass not yet old enough to make the most of the value set on her by her follower small as that appears to be  now we may get an idea of the hour named by the fellow for the appointment for depend upon it the time when she first cameabout five minutes agowas the time he should have been there  it is now getting on towards fivehalf past four was doubtless the time mentioned  shes not come o purpose tis her way home from school every day said the waterman  an experiment on womans endurance and patience under neglect  two to one against her staying a quarter of an hour  the same odds against her not staying till five would be nearer probability  whats halfanhour to a girl in love  on a moorland in wet weather it is thirty perceptible minutes to any fireside man woman or beast in christendomminutes that can be felt like the egyptian plague of darkness  now little girl go home he is not worth it  twenty minutes passed and the girl returned miserably to the handpost still to wander back to her retreat behind the sedge and lead any chance comer from the opposite quarter to believe that she had not yet reached this ultimate point beyond which a meeting with christopher was impossible  now youll find that she means to wait the complete halfhour and then off she goes with a broken heart  all three now looked through the hole to test the truth of the prognostication  the hour of five completed itself on their watches the girl again came forward  and then the three in ambuscade could see her pull out her handkerchief and place it to her eyes  shes grieving now because he has not come  poor little woman what a brute he must be for a broken heart in a woman means a broken vow in a man as i infer from a thousand instances in experience romance and history  dont open the door till she is gone ladywell it will only disturb her  as they had guessed the pupilteacher hearing the distant townclock strike the hour gave way to her fancy no longer and launched into the diverging path  this lingering for christophers arrival had as is known been founded on nothing more of the nature of an assignation than lay in his regular walk along the plain at that time every monday wednesday and friday of the six previous weeks  it must be said that he was very far indeed from divining that his injudicious peaceoffering of the flowers had stirred into life such a wearing anxious hopeful despairing solicitude as this which had been latent for some time during his constant meetings with the little stranger  she vanished in the mist towards the left and the loiterers in the hut began to move and open the door remarking now then for wyndway house a change of clothes and a dinner     4 sandbourne pierroad to wyndwayballroom in wyndway house   the last light of a winter day had gone down behind the houses of sandbourne and night was shut close over all  christopher about eight oclock was standing at the end of the pier with his back towards the open sea whence the waves were pushing to the shore in frills and coils that were just rendered visible in all their bleak instability by the row of lights along the sides of the jetty the rapid motion landward of the wavetips producing upon his eye an apparent progress of the pier out to sea  this pierhead was a spot which christopher enjoyed visiting on such moaning and sighing nights as the present when the sportive and variegated throng that haunted the pier on autumn days was no longer there and he seemed alone with weather and the invincible sea  somebody came towards him along the deserted footway and rays from the nearest lamp streaked the face of his sister faith  o christopher i knew you were here she said eagerly  you are wanted theres a servant come from wyndway house for you  he is sent to ask if you can come immediately to play at a little dance they have resolved upon this eveningquite suddenly it seems  if you can come you must bring with you any assistant you can lay your hands upon at a moments notice he says  wyndway house why should the people send for me above all other musicians in the town  faith did not know  if you really decide to go she said as they walked homeward you might take me as your assistant  i should answer the purpose should i not kit since it is only a dance or two they seem to want  and your harp i suppose you mean  yes you might be competent to take a part  it cannot be a regular ball they would have had the quadrille band for anything of that sort  faithwell go  however let us see the man first and inquire particulars  reaching home christopher found at his door a horse and wagonette in charge of a manservant in livery who repeated what faith had told her brother  wyndway house was a wellknown countryseat three or four miles out of the town and the coachman mentioned that if they were going it would be well that they should get ready to start as soon as they conveniently could since he had been told to return by ten if possible christopher quickly prepared himself and put a new string or two into faiths harp by which time she also was dressed and wrapping up herself and her instrument safe from the night air away they drove at halfpast nine  is it a large party said christopher as they whizzed along  no sir it is what we call a dancethat is tis like a ball you know on a small scalea ball on a spurt that you never thought of till you had it  in short it grew out of a talk at dinner i believe and some of the young people present wanted a jig and didnt care to play themselves you know young ladies being an idle class of society at the best of times  weve a house full of sleeping company you understandbeen there a week some of emmost of em being mistresss relations  they probably found it a little dull  well yesit is rather dull for emchristmastime and all  as soon as it was proposed they were wild for sending posthaste for somebody or other to play to them  did they name me particularly said christopher  yes mr christopher julian she says  the gent whos turned music man i said  yes thats him says she  there were musicmen living nearer to your end of the town than i  yes but i know it was you particular though i dont think mistress thought anything about you at first  mr joycethats the butlersaid that your name was mentioned to our old party when he was in the room by a young lady staying with us and mistress says then the julians have had a downfall and the son has taken to music  then when dancing was talked of they said o lets have him by all means  was the young lady who first inquired for my family the same one who said lets have him by all means  o no but it was on account of her asking that the rest said they would like you to playat least thats as i had it from joyce  do you know that ladys name  mrs petherwin  ah  cold sir  o no  christopher did not like to question the man any further though what he had heard added new life to his previous curiosity and they drove along the way in silence faiths figure wrapped up to the top of her head cutting into the sky behind them like a sugarloaf  such gates as crossed the roads had been left open by the forethought of the coachman and passing the lodge they proceeded about halfamile along a private drive then ascended a rise and came in view of the front of the mansion punctured with windows that were now mostly lighted up  what is that said faith catching a glimpse of something that the carriagelamp showed on the face of one wall as they passed a marble bas relief of some battlepiece built into the stonework  thats the scene of the death of one of the squires forefatherscolonel sir martin jones who was killed at the moment of victory in the battle of salamancabut i havent been here long enough to know the rights of it  when i am in one of my meditations as i wait here with the carriage sometimes i think how many more get killed at the moment of victory than at the moment of defeat  this is the entrance for you sir  and he turned the corner and pulled up before a side door  they alighted and went in christopher shouldering faiths harp and she marching modestly behind with curlyeared musicbooks under her arm they were shown into the housestewards room and ushered thence along a badlylit passage and past a door within which a hum and laughter were audible  the door next to this was then opened for them and they entered        scarcely had faith or christopher either ever beheld a more shining scene than was presented by the saloon in which they now found themselves  coming direct from the gloomy park and led to the room by that back passage from the servants quarter the light from the chandelier and branches against the walls striking on gilding at all points quite dazzled their sight for a minute or two it caused faith to move forward with her eyes on the floor and filled christopher with an impulse to turn back again into some dusky corner where every thread of his not overnew dress suitrather motheaten through lack of feasts for airing itcould be counted less easily  he was soon seated before a grand piano and faith sat down under the shadow of her harp both being arranged on a dais within an alcove at one end of the room  a screen of ivy and holly had been constructed across the front of this recess for the games of the children on christmas eve and it still remained there a small creephole being left for entrance and exit  then the merry guests tumbled through doors at the further end and dancing began  the mingling of blackcoated men and bright ladies gave a charming appearance to the groups as seen by faith and her brother the whole spectacle deriving an unexpected novelty from the accident of reaching their eyes through interstices in the tracery of green leaves which added to the picture a softness that it would not otherwise have possessed  on the other hand the musicians having a much weaker light could hardly be discerned by the performers in the dance  the music was now rattling on and the ladies in their foamlike dresses were busily threading and spinning about the floor when faith casually looking up into her brothers face was surprised to see that a change had come over it  at the end of the quadrille he leant across to her before she had time to speak and said quietly shes here  who said faith for she had not heard the words of the coachman  ethelberta  which is she asked faith peeping through with the keenest interest  the one who has the skirts of her dress looped up with convolvulus flowersthe one with her hair fastened in a sort of venus knot behind she has just been dancing with that perfumed piece of a man they call mr ladywellit is he with the high eyebrows arched like a girls  he added with a wrinkled smile i cannot for my life see anybody answering to the character of husband to her for every man takes notice of her  they were interrupted by another dance being called for and then his fingers tapping about upon the keys as mechanically as fowls pecking at barleycorns christopher gave himself up with a curious and far from unalloyed pleasure to the occupation of watching ethelberta now again crossing the field of his vision like a returned comet whose characteristics were becoming purely historical  she was a plumparmed creature with a white round neck as firm as a fortaltogether a vigorous shape as refreshing to the eye as the green leaves through which he beheld her  she danced freely and with a zest that was apparently irrespective of partners  he had been waiting long to hear her speak and when at length her voice did reach his ears it was the revelation of a strange matter to find how great a thing that small event had become to him  he knew the old utterancerapid but not frequent an obstructive thought causing sometimes a sudden halt in the midst of a stream of words  but the features by which a cool observer would have singled her out from others in his memory when asking himself what she was like was a peculiar gaze into imaginary faraway distance when making a quiet remark to a partnernot with contracted eyes like a seafaring man but with an open full looka remark in which little words in a low tone were made to express a great deal as several single gentlemen afterwards found  the production of dancemusic when the criticizing stage among the dancers has passed and they have grown full of excitement and animal spirits does not require much concentration of thought in the producers thereof and desultory conversation accordingly went on between faith and her brother from time to time  kit she said on one occasion are you looking at the way in which the flowers are fastened to the leavestaking a mean advantage of being at the back of the tapestry  you cannot think how you stare at them  i was looking through themcertainly not at them  i have a feeling of being moved about like a puppet in the hands of a person who legally can be nothing to me  that charming woman with the shining bunch of hair and convolvuluses  yes it is through her that we are brought here and through her writing that poem cancelled words that the book was sent me and through the accidental renewal of acquaintance between us on anglebury heath that she wrote the poem  i was however at the moment you spoke thinking more particularly of the little teacher whom ethelberta must have commissioned to send the book to me and why that girl was chosen to do it  there may be a hundred reasons  kit i have never yet seen her look once this way  christopher had certainly not yet received look or gesture from her but his time came  it was while he was for a moment outside the recess and he caught her in the act  she became slightly confused turned aside and entered into conversation with a neighbour  it was only a look and yet what a look it was  one may say of a look that it is capable of division into as many species genera orders and classes as the animal world itself  christopher saw ethelberta petherwins performance in this kindthe wellknown spark of light upon the wellknown depths of mysteryand felt something going out of him which had gone out of him once before  thus continually beholding her and her companions in the giddy whirl the night wore on with the musicians last dances and more last dances being added till the intentions of the old on the matter were thrice exceeded in the interests of the young  watching the couples whirl and turn advance and recede as gently as spirits knot themselves like houseflies and part again and lullabied by the faint regular beat of their footsteps to the tune the players sank into the peculiar mesmeric quiet which comes over impressionable people who play for a great length of time in the midst of such scenes and at last the only noises that christopher took cognizance of were those of the exceptional kind breaking above the general sea of sounda casual smart rustle of silk a laugh a stumble the monosyllabic talk of those who happened to linger for a moment close to the leafy screenall coming to his ears like voices from those old times when he had mingled in similar scenes not as servant but as guest     5 at the windowthe road home   the dancing was over at last and the radiant company had left the room a long and weary night it had been for the two players though a stimulated interest had hindered physical exhaustion in one of them for a while  with tingling fingers and aching arms they came out of the alcove into the long and deserted apartment now pervaded by a dry haze  the lights had burnt low and faith and her brother were waiting by request till the wagonette was ready to take them home a breakfast being in course of preparation for them meanwhile  christopher had crossed the room to relieve his cramped limbs and now peeping through a crevice in the window curtains he said suddenly whos for a transformation scene  faith look here  he touched the blind up it flew and a gorgeous scene presented itself to her eyes  a huge inflamed sun was breasting the horizon of a wide sheet of sea which to her surprise and delight the mansion overlooked the brilliant disc fired all the waves that lay between it and the shore at the bottom of the grounds where the water tossed the ruddy light from one undulation to another in glares as large and clear as mirrors incessantly altering them destroying them and creating them again while further off they multiplied thickened and ran into one another like struggling armies till they met the fiery source of them all  o how wonderful it is said faith putting her hand on christophers arm  who knew that whilst we were all shut in here with our puny illumination such an exhibition as this was going on outside  how sorry and mean the grand and stately room looks now  christopher turned his back upon the window and there were the hitherto beaming candleflames shining no more radiantly than tarnished javelin heads while the snowwhite lengths of wax showed themselves clammy and cadaverous as the fingers of a corpse  the leaves and flowers which had appeared so very green and blooming by the artificial light were now seen to be faded and dusty  only the gilding of the room in some degree brought itself into keeping with the splendours outside stray darts of light seizing upon it and lengthening themselves out along fillet quirk arris and moulding till wasted away  it seems said faith as if all the people who were lately so merry here had died we ourselves look no more than ghosts  she turned up her weary face to her brothers which the incoming rays smote aslant making little furrows of every wrinkle thereon and shady ravines of every little furrow  you are very tired faith he said  such a heavy nights work has been almost too much for you  o i dont mind that said faith  but i could not have played so long by myself  we filled up one anothers gaps and there were plenty of them towards the morning but luckily people dont notice those things when the small hours draw on  what troubles me most said faith is not that i have worked but that you should be so situated as to need such miserable assistance as mine we are poor are we not kit  yes we know a little about poverty he replied  while thus lingering     in shadowy thoroughfares of thought  faith interrupted with i believe there is one of the dancers nowwhy i should have thought they had all gone to bed and wouldnt get up again for days  she indicated to him a figure on the lawn towards the left looking upon the same flashing scene as that they themselves beheld  it is your own particular one continued faith  yes i see the blue flowers under the edge of her cloak  and i see her squirrelcoloured hair said christopher  both stood looking at this apparition who once and only once thought fit to turn her head towards the front of the house they were gazing from  faith was one in whom the meditative somewhat overpowered the active faculties she went on with no abundance of love to theorize upon this gratuitously charming woman who striking freakishly into her brothers path seemed likely to do him no good in her sisterly estimation  ethelbertas bright and shapely form stood before her critic now smartened by the motes of sunlight from head to heel what faith would have given to see her so clearly within  without doubt she is already a lady of many romantic experiences she said dubiously  and on the way to many more said christopher  the tone was just of the kind which may be imagined of a sombre man who had been up all night piping that others might dance  faith parted her lips as if in consternation at possibilities ethelberta having already become an influence in christophers system might soon become morean indestructible fascinationto drag him about turn his soul inside out harrow him twist him and otherwise torment him according to the stereotyped form of such processes  they were interrupted by the opening of a door  a servant entered and came up to them  this is for you i believe sir he said  two guineas and he placed the money in christophers hand  some breakfast will be ready for you in a moment if you like to have it  would you wish it brought in here or will you come to the stewards room  yes we will come  and the man then began to extinguish the lights one by one  christopher dropped the two pounds and two shillings singly into his pocket and looking listlessly at the footman said can you tell me the address of that lady on the lawn  ah she has disappeared  she wore a dress with blue flowers said faith  and remarkable bright in her manner  o thats the young widow mrswhats that namei forget for the moment  widow said christopher the eyes of his understanding getting wonderfully clear and faith uttering a private ejaculation of thanks that after all no commandments were likely to be broken in this matter the lady i mean is quite a girlish sort of woman  yes yes so she isthats the one  coachman says she must have been born a widow for there is not time for her ever to have been made one however shes not quite such a chicken as all that  mrs petherwin thats the partys name  does she live here  no she is staying in the house visiting for a few days with her mother inlaw  they are a london family i dont know her address  is she a poetess  that i cannot say  she is very clever at verses but she dont lean over gates to see the sun and goes to church as regular as you or i so i should hardly be inclined to say that shes the complete thing  when shes up in one of her vagaries shell sit with the ladies and make up pretty things out of her head as fast as sticks abreaking  they will run off her tongue like cotton from a reel and if she can ever be got in the mind of telling a story she will bring it out that serious and awful that it makes your flesh creep upon your bones if shes only got to say that she walked out of one door into another shell tell it so that there seems something wonderful in it  tis a bother to start her so our people say behind her back but once set going the house is all alive with her  however it will soon be dull enough she and lady petherwin are off tomorrow for rookington where i believe they are going to stay over new years day  where do you say they are going inquired christopher as they followed the footman  rookington parkabout three miles out of sandbourne in the opposite direction to this  a widow christopher murmured  faith overheard him  that makes no difference to us does it she said wistfully  forty minutes later they were driving along an open road over a ridge which commanded a view of a small inlet below them the sands of this nook being sheltered by crumbling cliffs  here at once they saw in the full light of the sun two women standing side by side their faces directed over the sea  there she is again said faith  she has walked along the shore from the lawn where we saw her before  yes said the coachman shes a curious woman seemingly  shell talk to any poor body she meets  you see she had been out for a morning walk instead of going to bed and that is some queer mortal or other she has picked up with on her way  i wonder she does not prefer some rest faith observed  the road then dropped into a hollow and the women by the sea were no longer within view from the carriage which rapidly neared sandbourne with the two musicians     6 the shore by wyndway   the east gleamed upon ethelbertas squirrelcoloured hair as she said to her companion i have come picotee but not as you imagine from a nights sleep  we have actually been dancing till daylight at wyndway  then you should not have troubled to come  i could have borne the disappointment under such circumstances said the pupilteacher who wearing a dress not so familiar to christophers eyes as had been the little white jacket had not been recognized by him from the hill  you look so tired berta  i could not stay up all night for the world  one gets used to these things said ethelberta quietly  i should have been in bed certainly had i not particularly wished to use this opportunity of meeting you before you go home tomorrow  i could not have come to sandbourne today because we are leaving to return again to rookington  this is all that i wish you to take to motheronly a few little things which may be useful to her but you will see what it contains when you open it  she handed to picotee a small parcel  this is for yourself she went on giving a small packet besides  it will pay your fare home and back and leave you something to spare  thank you said picotee docilely  now picotee continued the elder let us talk for a few minutes before i go back we may not meet again for some time  she put her arm round the waist of picotee who did the same by ethelberta and thus interlaced they walked backwards and forwards upon the firm flat sand with the motion of one body animated by one will  well what did you think of my poems  i liked them but naturally i did not understand all the experience you describe  it is so different from mine  yet that made them more interesting to me  i thought i should so much like to mix in the same scenes but that of course is impossible  i am afraid it is  and you posted the book as i said  yes  she added hurriedly as if to change the subject i have told nobody that we are sisters or that you are known in any way to me or to mother or to any of us  i thought that would be best from what you said  yes perhaps it is best for the present  the box of clothes came safely and i find very little alteration will be necessary to make the dress do beautifully for me on sundays  it is quite newfashioned to me though i suppose it was oldfashioned to you o and berta will the title of lady petherwin descend to you when your motherinlaw dies  no of course not  she is only a knights widow and thats nothing  the lady of a knight looks as good on paper as the lady of a lord  yes  and in other places too sometimes  however about your journey home  be very careful and dont make any inquiries at the stations of anybody but officials  if any man wants to be friendly with you try to find out if it is from a genuine wish to assist you or from admiration of your fresh face  how shall i know which said picotee  ethelberta laughed  if heaven does not tell you at the moment i cannot she said  but humanity looks with a different eye from love and upon the whole it is most to be prized by all of us  i believe it ends oftener in marriage than do a lovers flying smiles  so that for this and other reasons love from a stranger is mostly worthless as a speculation and it is certainly dangerous as a game  well picotee has any one paid you real attentions yet  nothat is  there is something going on  only a wee bit  i thought so  there was a dishonesty about your dear eyes which has never been there before and lovemaking and dishonesty are inseparable as coupled hounds  up comes man and away goes innocence  are you going to tell me anything about him  i would rather not ethelberta because it is hardly anything  well be careful  and mind this never tell him what you feel  but then he will never know it  nor must he  he must think it only  the difference between his thinking and knowing is often the difference between your winning and losing  but general advice is not of much use and i cannot give more unless you tell more  what is his name  picotee did not reply  never mind keep your secret  however listen to this not a kissnot so much as the shadow hint or merest seedling of a kiss  there is no fear of it murmured picotee though not because of me  you see my dear picotee a lover is not a relative and he isnt quite a stranger but he may end in being either and the way to reduce him to whichever of the two you wish him to be is to treat him like the other men who come courting are just like bad cooks if you are kind to them instead of ascribing it to an exceptional courtesy on your part they instantly set it down to their own marvellous worth  but i ought to favour him just a little poor thing  just the smallest glimmer of a gleam  only a very little indeedso that it comes as a relief to his misery not as adding to his happiness  it is being too clever all this and we ought to be harmless as doves  ah picotee to continue harmless as a dove you must be wise as a serpent youll finday ten serpents for that matter  but if i cannot get at him how can i manage him in these ways you speak of  get at him  i suppose he gets at you in some way does he nottries to see you or to be near you  nothats just the pointhe doesnt do any such thing and theres the worry of it  well what a silly girl  then he is not your lover at all  perhaps hes not  but i am his at any ratetwice over  thats no use  supply the love for both sides  why its worse than furnishing money for both  you dont suppose a man will give his heart in exchange for a womans when he has already got hers for nothing thats not the way old adam does business at all  picotee sighed  have you got a young man too berta  a young man  a lover i meanthats what we call em down here  it is difficult to explain said ethelberta evasively  i knew one many years ago and i have seen him again andthat is all  according to my idea you have one but according to your own you have not he does not love you but you love himis that how it is  i have not quite considered how it is  do you love him  i have never seen a man i hate less  a great deal lies covered up there i expect  he was in that carriage which drove over the hill at the moment we met here  ahahsome great lord or another who has his day by candlelight and so on  i guess the style  somebody who no more knows how much bread is a loaf than i do the price of diamonds and pearls  i am afraid hes only a commoner as yet and not a very great one either  but surely you guess picotee  but ill set you an example of frankness by telling his name  my friend mr julian to whom you posted the book  such changes as he has seenfrom affluence to poverty  he and his sister have been playing dances all night at wyndwaywhat is the matter  only a pain  my dear picotee  i think ill sit down for a moment berta  whathave you overwalked yourself dear  yesand i got up very early you see  i hope you are not going to be ill child  you look as if you ought not to be here  o it is quite trifling  does not getting up in a hurry cause a sense of faintness sometimes  yes in people who are not strong  if we dont talk about being faint it will go off  faintness is such a queer thing that to think of it is to have it  let us talk as we were talking beforeabout your young man and other indifferent matters so as to divert my thoughts from fainting dear berta  i have always thought the book was to be forwarded to that gentleman because he was a connection of yours by marriage and he had asked for it  and so you have met thisthis mr julian and gone for walks with him in evenings i suppose just as young men and women do who are courting  no indeedwhat an absurd child you are said ethelberta  i knew him once and he is interesting a few little things like that make it all up  the love is all on one side as with me  o no no there is nothing like that  i am not attached to any one strictly speakingthough more strictly speaking i am not unattached  tis a delightful middle mind to be in  i know it for i was like it once but i had scarcely been so long enough to know where i was before i was gone past  you should have commanded yourself or drawn back entirely for let me tell you that at the beginning of caring for a manjust when you are suspended between thinking and feelingthere is a hairsbreadth of time at which the question of getting into love or not getting in is a matter of willquite a thing of choice  at the same time drawing back is a tame dance and the best of all is to stay balanced awhile  you do that well ill warrant  well no for what between continually wanting to love to escape the blank lives of those who do not and wanting not to love to keep out of the miseries of those who do i get foolishly warm and foolishly cold by turns  yesand i am like you as far as the foolishly goes  i wish we poor girls could contrive to bring a little wisdom into our love by way of a change  thats the very thing that leading minds in town have begun to do but there are difficulties  it is easy to love wisely but the rich man may not marry you and it is not very hard to reject wisely but the poor man doesnt care  altogether it is a precious problem  but shall we clamber out upon those shining blocks of rock and find some of the little yellow shells that are in the crevices  i have ten minutes longer and then i must go     7 the diningroom of a town housethe butlers pantry   a few weeks later there was a friendly dinnerparty at the house of a gentleman called doncastle who lived in a moderately fashionable square of west london  all the friends and relatives present were nice people who exhibited becoming signs of pleasure and gaiety at being there but as regards the vigour with which these emotions were expressed it may be stated that a slight laugh from far down the throat and a slight narrowing of the eye were equivalent as indices of the degree of mirth felt to a hahaha and a shaking of the shoulders among the minor traders of the kingdom and to a hohoho contorted features purple face and stamping foot among the gentlemen in corduroy and fustian who adorn the remoter provinces  the conversation was chiefly about a volume of musical tender and humorous rhapsodies lately issued to the world in the guise of verse which had been reviewed and talked about everywhere  this topic beginning as a private dialogue between a young painter named ladywell and the lady on his right hand had enlarged its ground by degrees as a subject will extend on those rare occasions when it happens to be one about which each person has thought something beforehand instead of as in the natural order of things one to which the oblivious listener replies mechanically with earnest features but with thoughts far away and so the whole table made the matter a thing to inquire or reply upon at once and isolated rills of other chat died out like a river in the sands  witty things and occasionally anacreontic and they have the originality which such a style must naturally possess when carried out by a feminine hand said ladywell  if it is a feminine hand said a man near  ladywell looked as if he sometimes knew secrets though he did not wish to boast  written i presume you mean in the anacreontic measure of three feet and a halfspondees and iambics said a gentleman in spectacles glancing round and giving emphasis to his inquiry by causing bland glares of a circular shape to proceed from his glasses towards the person interrogated  the company appeared willing to give consideration to the words of a man who knew such things as that and hung forward to listen  but ladywell stopped the whole current of affairs in that direction by saying  o no i was speaking rather of the matter and tone  in fact the seven days review said they were anacreontic you know and so they areany one may feel they are  the general look then implied a false encouragement and the man in spectacles looked down again being a nervous person who never had time to show his merits because he was so much occupied in hiding his faults  do you know the authoress mr neigh continued ladywell  cant say that i do he replied  neigh was a man who never disturbed the flesh upon his face except when he was obliged to do so and paused ten seconds where other people only paused one as he moved his chin in speaking motes of light from under the candleshade caught lost and caught again the outlying threads of his burnished beard  she will be famous some day and you ought at any rate to read her book  yes i ought i know  in fact some years ago i should have done it immediately because i had a reason for pushing on that way just then  ah what was that  well i thought of going in for westminster abbey myself at that time but a fellow has so much to do and  what a pity that you didnt follow it up  a man of your powers mr neigh  afterwards i found i was too steady for it and had too much of the respectable householder in me  besides so many other men are on the same tack and then i didnt care about it somehow  i dont understand high art and am utterly in the dark on what are the true laws of criticism a plain married lady who wore archaeological jewellery was saying at this time  but i know that i have derived an unusual amount of amusement from those verses and i am heartily thankful to e for them  i am afraid said a gentleman who was suffering from a bad shirtfront that an estimate which depends upon feeling in that way is not to be trusted as permanent opinion  the subject now flitted to the other end  somebody has it that when the heart flies out before the understanding it saves the judgment a world of pains came from a voice in that quarter  i for my part like something merry said an elderly woman whose face was bisected by the edge of a shadow which toned her forehead and eyelids to a livid neutral tint and left her cheeks and mouth like metal at a white heat in the uninterrupted light  i think the liveliness of those ballads as great a recommendation as any  after all enough misery is known to us by our experiences and those of our friends and what we see in the newspapers for all purposes of chastening without having gratuitous grief inflicted upon us  but you would not have wished that romeo and juliet should have ended happily or that othello should have discovered the perfidy of his ancient in time to prevent all fatal consequences  i am not afraid to go so far as that said the old lady  shakespeare is not everybody and i am sure that thousands of people who have seen those plays would have driven home more cheerfully afterwards if by some contrivance the characters could all have been joined together respectively  i uphold our anonymous author on the general ground of her levity  well it is an old and worn argumentthat about the inexpedience of tragedyand much may be said on both sides  it is not to be denied that the anonymous sapphos versesfor it seems that she is really a womanare clever  clever said ladywellthe young man who had been one of the shooting party at sandbournethey are marvellously brilliant  she is rather warm in her assumed character  thats a sign of her actual coldness she lets off her feeling in theoretic grooves and there is sure to be none left for practical ones whatever seems to be the most prominent vice or the most prominent virtue in anybodys writing is the one thing you are safest from in personal dealings with the writer  o i dont mean to call her warmth of feeling a vice or virtue exactly  i agree with you said neigh to the last speaker but one in tones as emphatic as they possibly could be without losing their proper character of indifference to the whole matter  warm sentiment of any sort whenever we have it disturbs us too much to leave us repose enough for writing it down  i am sure when i was at the ardent age said the mistress of the house in a tone of pleasantly agreeing with every one particularly those who were diametrically opposed to each other i could no more have printed such emotions and made them public than icould have helped privately feeling them  i wonder if she has gone through half she says  if so what an experience  o nonot at all likely said mr neigh  it is as risky to calculate peoples ways of living from their writings as their incomes from their way of living  she is as true to nature as fashion is false said the painter in his warmth becoming scarcely complimentary as sometimes happens with young persons  i dont think that she has written a word more than what every woman would deny feeling in a society where no woman says what she means or does what she says  and can any praise be greater than that  haha  capital  all her verses seem to me said a rather stupid person to be simply     trallalalallalala    trallalalallalalu    trallalalallalalalla    trallalalu  when you take away the music there is nothing left  yet she is plainly a woman of great culture  have you seen what the london light says about themone of the finest things i have ever read in the way of admiration continued ladywell paying no attention to the previous speaker  he lingered for a reply and then impulsively quoted several lines from the periodical he had named without aid or hesitation  good is it not added ladywell  they assented but in such an unqualified manner that half as much readiness would have meant more  but ladywell though not experienced enough to be quite free from enthusiasm was too experienced to mind indifference for more than a minute or two  when the ladies had withdrawn the young man went on  colonel staff said a funny thing to me yesterday about these very poems he asked me if i knew her and  her  why he knows that it is a lady all the time and we were only just now doubting whether the sex of the writer could be really what it seems  shame ladywell said his friend neigh  ah mr ladywell said another now we have found you out  you know her  nowi sayhaha continued the painter with a face expressing that he had not at all tried to be found out as the man possessing incomparably superior knowledge of the poetess  i beg pardon really but dont press me on the matter  upon my word the secret is not my own as i was saying the colonel said do you know herbut you dont care to hear  we shall be delighted  so the colonel said do you know her adding in a most comic way between u and e ladywell i believe there is a close affinitymeaning me you know by u  just like the colonelhahaha  the older men did not oblige ladywell a second time with any attempt at appreciation but a weird silence ensued during which the smile upon ladywells face became frozen to painful permanence  meaning by e you know the e of the poemshehheh he added  it was a very humorous incident certainly said his friend neigh at which there was a laughnot from anything connected with what he said but simply because it was the right thing to laugh when neigh meant you to do so  now dont neighyou are too hard upon me  but seriously two or three fellows were there when i said it and they all began laughingbut then the colonel said it in such a queer way you know  but you were asking me about her  well the fact is between ourselves i do know that she is a lady and i dont mind telling a word  but we would not for the world be the means of making you betray her confidencewould we jones  no indeed we would not  no no it is not that at allthis is really too badyou must listen just for a moment  ladywell dont betray anybody on our account  whoever the illustrious young lady may be she has seen a great deal of the world said mr doncastle blandly and puts her experience of the comedy of its emotions and of its method of showing them in a very vivid light  i heard a man say that the novelty with which the ideas are presented is more noticeable than the originality of the ideas themselves observed neigh  the woman has made a great talk about herself and i am quite weary of people asking of her condition place of abode has she a father has she a mother or dearer one yet than all other  i would have burlesque quotation put down by act of parliament and all who dabble in it placed with him who can cite scripture for his purposes said ladywell in retaliation  after a pause neigh remarked halfprivately to their host who was his uncle your butler chickerel is a very intelligent man as i have heard  yes he does very well said mr doncastle  but is he not avery extraordinary man  not to my knowledge said doncastle looking up surprised  why do you think that alfred  well perhaps it was not a matter to mention  he reads a great deal i dare say  i dont think so  i noticed how wonderfully his face kindled when we began talking about the poems during dinner  perhaps he is a poet himself in disguise  did you observe it  no  to the best of my belief he is a very trustworthy and honourable man  he has been with uslet me see how longfive months i think and he was fifteen years in his last place  it certainly is a new side to his character if he publicly showed any interest in the conversation whatever he might have felt  since the matter has been mentioned said mr jones i may say that i too noticed the singularity of it  if you had not said otherwise replied doncastle somewhat warmly i should have asserted him to be the last manservant in london to infringe such an elementary rule  if he did so this evening it is certainly for the first time and i sincerely hope that no annoyance was caused  o no nonot at allit might have been a mistake of mine said jones i should quite have forgotten the circumstance if mr neighs words had not brought it to my mind  it was really nothing to notice and i beg that you will not say a word to him about it on my account  he has a taste that way my dear uncle nothing more depend upon it said neigh  if i had such a man belonging to me i should only be too proud  certainly do not mention it  of course chickerel is chickerel mr doncastle rejoined  we all know what that means  and really on reflecting i do remember that he is of a literary turn of mindnot further by an inch than is commendable you know  i am quite aware as i glance down the papers and prints any morning that chickerels eyes have been over the ground before mine and that he generally forestalls the rest of us by a chapter or so in the last new book sent home but in these vicious days that particular weakness is really virtue just because it is not quite a vice  yes said mr jones the reflective man in spectacles positive virtues are getting moved off the stage negative ones are moved on to the place of positives we thank bare justice as we used only to thank generosity call a man honest who steals only by law and consider him a benefactor if he does not steal at all  hear hear said neigh  we will decide that chickerel is even a better trained fellow than if he had shown no interest at all in his face  the action being like those trifling irregularities in art at its vigorous periods which seemed designed to hide the unpleasant monotony of absolute symmetry said ladywell  on the other hand an affected want of training of that sort would be even a better disguise for an artful man than a perfectly impassible demeanour  he is two removes from discovery in a hidden scheme whilst a neutral face is only one  you quite alarm me by these subtle theories said mr doncastle laughing and the subject then became compounded with other matters till the speakers rose to rejoin the charming flock upstairs        in the basement story at this hour mr chickerel the butler who had formed the subject of discussion on the floor above was busily engaged in looking after his two subordinates as they bustled about in the operations of clearing away  he was a man of whom if the shape of certain bones and muscles of the face is ever to be taken as a guide to the character one might safely have predicated conscientiousness in the performance of duties a thorough knowledge of all that appertained to them a general desire to live on without troubling his mind about anything which did not concern him  any person interested in the matter would have assumed without hesitation that the estimate his employer had given of chickerel was a true onemore that not only would the butler under all ordinary circumstances resolutely prevent his face from showing curiosity in an unbecoming way but that with the soul of a true gentleman he would if necessary equivocate as readily as the noblest of his betters to remove any stain upon his honour in such trifles  hence it is apparent that if chickerels countenance really appeared as neigh had asserted full of curiosity with regard to the gossip that was going on the feelings which led to the exhibition must have been of a very unusual and irrepressible kind  his hair was of that peculiar bluishwhite which is to be observed when the oncoming years instead of singling out special locks of a mans head for operating against advance uniformly over the whole field and enfeeble the colour at all points before absolutely extinguishing it anywhere his nose was of the knotty shape in the gristle and earthward tendency in the flesh which is commonly said to carry sound judgment above it his eyes were thoughtful and his face was thina contour which if it at once abstracted from his features that cheerful assurance of singleminded honesty which adorns the exteriors of so many of his brethren might have raised a presumption in the minds of some beholders that perhaps in this case the quality might not be altogether wanting within  the coffee having been served to the people upstairs one of the footmen rushed into his bedroom on the lower floor and in a few minutes emerged again in the dress of a respectable clerk who had been born for better things with the trifling exceptions that he wore a lowcrowned hat and instead of knocking his heels on the pavement walked with a gait as delicate as a ladys  going out of the areadoor with a cigar in his mouth he mounted the steps hastily to keep an appointment round the cornerthe keeping of which as a private gentleman necessitated the change of the greater part of his clothes twice within a quarter of an hourthe limit of his time of absence  the other footman was upstairs and the butler finding that he had a few minutes to himself sat down at the table and wrote     my dear ethelbertai did not intend to write to you for some few    days to come but the way in which you have been talked about here    this evening makes me anxious to send a line or two at once though i    have very little time to spare as usual  we have just had a dinner    partyindeed the carriages have not yet been brought roundand the    talk at dinner was about your verses of course  the thing was    brought up by a young fellow named ladywelldo you know him  he is a    painter by profession but he has a pretty good private income beyond    what he gets by practising his line of business among the nobility    and that i expect is not little for he is well known and encouraged    because he is young and goodlooking and so forth  his family own a    good bit of land somewhere out aldbrickham way  however i am before    my story  from what they all said it is pretty clear that you are    thought a great deal of in fashionable society as a poetessbut    perhaps you know this as well as imoving in it as you do yourself    my dear     the ladies afterwards got very curious about your age so curious in    fact and so full of certainty that you were thirtyfive and a    blighted existence if an hour that i felt inclined to rap out there    and then and hang what came of it my daughter ladies was to my    own and her mothers certain knowledge only twentyone last birthday    and has as bright a heart as anybody in london  one of them actually    said that you must be fifty to have got such an experience  her guess    was a very shrewd one in the bottom of it however for it was    grounded upon the way you use those strange experiences of mine in the    society that i tell you of and dress them up as if they were yours    and as you see she hit off my own age to a year  i thought it was    very sharp of her to be so right although so wrong     i do not want to influence your plans in any way about things which    your school learning fits you to understand much better than i who    never had such opportunities but i think that if i were in your    place berta i would not let my name be known just yet for people    always want whats kept from them and dont value whats given  i am    not sure but i think that after the women had gone upstairs the    others turned their thoughts upon you again what they said about you    i dont know for if theres one thing i hate tis hanging about the    doors when the men begin to get moved by their wine which they did to    a large extent tonight and spoke very loud  they always do here    for old don is a hearty giver in his way  however as you see these    people from their own level now it is not much that i can tell you in    seeing them only from the under side though i see strange things    sometimes and of course        what great ones do the less will prattle of     as it says in that book of select pieces that you gave me     well my dear girl i hope you will prosper  one thing above all    others youll have to mind and it is that folk must continually    strain to advance in order to remain where they are and you    particularly  but as for trying too hard i wouldnt do it  much    lies in minding this that your best plan for lightness of heart is to    raise yourself a little higher than your old mates but not so high as    to be quite out of their reach  all human beings enjoy themselves    from the outside and so getting on a little has this good in it you    still keep in your old class where your feelings are and are    thoughtfully treated by this class while by getting on too much you    are sneered at by your new acquaintance who dont know the skill of    your rise and you are parted from and forgot by the old ones who do    whatever happens dont be too quick to feel  you will surely get    some hard blows when you are found out for if the great can find no    excuse for hitting with a mind theyll do it and say twas in fun    but you are young and healthy and youth and health are power  i wish    i could have a decent footman here with me but i suppose it is no use    trying  it is such men as these that provoke the contempt we get    well thank god a few years will see the end of me for i am growing    ashamed of my companyso different as they are to the servants of old    timesyour affectionate father             r chickerel     psdo not press lady petherwin any further to remove the rules on    which you live with her  she is quite right she cannot keep us and    to recognize us would do you no good nor us either  we are content    to see you secretly since it is best for you     8 christophers lodgingsthe grounds about rookington   meanwhile in the distant town of sandbourne christopher julian had recovered from the weariness produced by his labours at the wyndway eveningparty where ethelberta had been a star  instead of engaging his energies to clear encumbrances from the tangled way of his life he now set about reading the popular metres by e with more interest and assiduity than ever for though julian was a thinker by instinct he was a worker by effort only and the higher of these kinds being dependent upon the lower for its exhibition there was often a lamentable lack of evidence of his power in either  it is a provoking correlation and has conduced to the obscurity of many a genius  kit said his sister on reviving at the end of the bad headache which had followed the dance those poems seem to have increased in value with you  the lady lofty as she appears to be would be flattered if she only could know how much you study them  have you decided to thank her for them  now let us talk it overi like having a chat about such a pretty new subject  i would thank her in a moment if i were absolutely certain that she had anything to do with sending them or even writing them  i am not quite sure of that yet  how strange that a woman could bring herself to write those verses  not at all strangethey are natural outpourings  faith looked critically at the remoter caverns of the fire  why strange continued christopher  there is no harm in them  o nono harm  but i cannot explain to youunless you see it partly of your own accordthat to write them she must be rather a fast ladynot a bad fast lady a nice fast lady i mean of course  there i have said it now and i daresay you are vexed with me for your interest in her has deepened to what it originally was i think  i dont mean any absolute harm by fast kit  bold forward you mean i suppose  faith tried to hit upon a better definition which should meet all views and on failing to do so looked concerned at her brothers somewhat grieved appearance and said helplessly yes i suppose i do  my idea of her is quite the reverse  a poetess must intrinsically be sensitive or she could never feel but then frankness is a rhetorical necessity even with the most modest if their inspirations are to do any good in the world  you will for certain not be interested in something i was going to tell you which i thought would have pleased you immensely but it is not worth mentioning now  if you will not tell me never mind  but dont be crabbed kit  you know how interested i am in all your affairs  it is only that i have composed an air to one of the prettiest of her songs when tapers tallbut i am not sure about the power of it  this is how it beginsi threw it off in a few minutes after you had gone to bed  he went to the piano and lightly touched over an air the manuscript copy of which he placed in front of him and listened to hear her opinion having proved its value frequently for it was not that of a woman merely but impersonally human  though she was unknown to fame this was a great gift in faith since to have an unsexed judgment is as precious as to be an unsexed being is deplorable  it is very fair indeed said the sister scarcely moving her lips in her great attention  now again and again and again  how could you do it in the time  kit knew that she admired his performance passive assent was her usual praise and she seldom insisted vigorously upon any view of his compositions unless for purposes of emendation  i was thinking that as i cannot very well write to her i may as well send her this said christopher with lightened spirits voice to correspond and eyes likewise there can be no objection to it for such things are done continually  consider while i am gone faith  i shall be out this evening for an hour or two  when christopher left the house shortly after instead of going into the town on some errand as was customary whenever he went from home after dark he ascended a back street passed over the hills behind and walked at a brisk pace inland along the road to rookington park where as he had learnt ethelberta and lady petherwin were staying for a time the day or two which they spent at wyndway having formed a short break in the middle of this visit  the moon was shining tonight and christopher sped onwards over the pallid highroad as readily as he could have done at noonday  in threequarters of an hour he reached the park gates and entering now upon a tract which he had never before explored he went along more cautiously and with some uncertainty as to the precise direction that the road would take  a frosted expanse of even grass on which the shadow of his head appeared with an opal halo round it soon allowed the house to be discovered beyond the other portions of the park abounding with timber older and finer than that of any other spot in the neighbourhood  christopher withdrew into the shade and wheeled round to the front of the building that contained his old love  here he gazed and idled as many a man has done before himwondering which room the fair poetess occupied waiting till lights began to appear in the upper windowswhich they did as uncertainly as glowworms blinking up at eventideand warming with currents of revived feeling in perhaps the sweetest of all conditions  new love is brightest and long love is greatest but revived love is the tenderest thing known upon earth  occupied thus christopher was greatly surprised to see on casually glancing to one side another man standing close to the shadowy trunk of another tree in a similar attitude to his own gazing with arms folded as blankly at the windows of the house as christopher himself had been gazing  not willing to be discovered christopher stuck closer to his tree  while he waited thus the stranger began murmuring words in a slow soft voice  christopher listened till he heard the following     pale was the day and rayless love       that had an eve so dim  two wellknown lines from one of ethelbertas poems  jealousy is a familiar kind of heat which disfigures licks playfully clouds blackens and boils a man as a fire does a pot and on recognizing these pilferings from what he had grown to regard as his own treasury christophers fingers began to nestle with great vigour in the palms of his hands  three or four minutes passed when the unknown rival gave a last glance at the windows and walked away  christopher did not like the look of that walk at allthere was grace enough in it to suggest that his antagonist had no mean chance of finding favour in a womans eyes  a sigh too seemed to proceed from the strangers breast but as their distance apart was too great for any such sound to be heard by any possibility christopher set down that to imagination or to the brushing of the wind over the trees  the lighted windows went out one by one and all the house was in darkness  julian then walked off himself with a vigour that was spasmodic only and with much less brightness of mind than he had experienced on his journey hither  the stranger had gone another way and christopher saw no more of him  when he reached sandbourne faith was still sitting up  but i told you i was going to take a long walk he said  no christopher really you did not  how tired and sad you do lookthough i always know beforehand when you are in that state one of your feet has a drag about it as you pass along the pavement outside the window  yes i forgot that i did not tell you  he could not begin to describe his pilgrimage it was too silly a thing even for her to hear of  it does not matter at all about my staying up said faith assuringly that is if exercise benefits you  walking up and down the lane i suppose  no not walking up and down the lane  the turnpikeroad to rookington is pleasant  faith that is really where i have been  how came you to know  i only guessed  verses and an accidental meeting produce a special journey  ethelberta is a fine woman physically and mentally both  i wonder people do not talk about her twice as much as they do  then surely you are getting attached to her again  you think you discover in her more than anybody else does and love begins with a sense of superior discernment  no no  that is only nonsense he said hurriedly  however love her or love her not i can keep a corner of my heart for you faith  there is another brute after her too it seems  of course there is i expect there are many  her position in society is above ours so that it is an unwise course to go troubling yourself more about her  no  if a needy man must be so foolish as to fall in love it is best to do so where he cannot double his foolishness by marrying the woman  i dont like to hear you talk so slightingly of what poor father did  christopher fixed his attention on the supper  that night late as it was when faith was in bed and sleeping he sat before a sheet of music paper neatly copying his composition upon it  the manuscript was intended as an offering to ethelberta at the first convenient opportunity        well after all my trouble to find out about ethelberta here comes the clue unasked for said the musician to his sister a few days later  she turned and saw that he was reading the wessex reflector  what is it asked faith  the secret of the true authorship of the book is out at last and it is ethelberta of course  i am so glad to have it proved hers  but can we believe  o yes  just hear what our london correspondent says  it is one of the nicest bits of gossip that he has furnished us with for a long time  yes now read it do  the author of metres by e christopher began a book of which so much has been said and conjectured and one in fact that has been the chief talk for several weeks past of the literary circles to which i belong is a young lady who was a widow before she reached the age of eighteen and is now not far beyond her fourth lustrum  i was additionally informed by a friend whom i met yesterday on his way to the house of lords that her name is mrs petherwinchristian name ethelberta and that she resides with her motherinlaw at their house in exonbury crescent  she is moreover the daughter of the late bishop of silchester if report may be believed whose active benevolence as your readers know left his family in comparatively straitened circumstances at his death  the marriage was a secret one and much against the wish of her husbands friends who are wealthy people on all sides  the death of the bridegroom two or three weeks after the wedding led to a reconciliation and the young poetess was taken to the home which she still occupies devoted to the composition of such brilliant effusions as those the world has lately been favoured with from her pen  if you want to send her your music you can do so now said faith  i might have sent it before but i wanted to deliver it personally however it is all the same now i suppose whether i send it or not  i always knew that our destinies would lie apart though she was once temporarily under a cloud  her momentary inspiration to write that cancelled words was the worst possible omen for me  it showed that thinking me no longer useful as a practical chance she would make me ornamental as a poetical regret  but ill send the manuscript of the song  in the way of business as a composer only and you must say to yourself ethelberta as thou art but woman i dare but as widow i fear thee  notwithstanding christophers affected carelessness that evening saw a great deal of nicety bestowed upon the operation of wrapping up and sending off the song  he dropped it into the box and heard it fall and with the curious power which he possessed of setting his wisdom to watch any particular folly in himself that it could not hinder speculated as he walked on the result of this first tangible step of return to his old position as ethelbertas lover     9 a ladys drawingroomsethelbertas dressingroom   it was a house on the north side of hyde park between ten and eleven in the evening and several intelligent and courteous people had assembled there to enjoy themselves as far as it was possible to do so in a neutral wayall carefully keeping every variety of feeling in a state of solution in spite of any attempt such feelings made from time to time to crystallize on interesting subjects in hand  neigh who is that charming woman with her head built up in a novel way even for hair architecturethe one with her back towards us said a man whose coat fitted doubtfully to a friend whose coat fitted well  just going to ask for the same information said mr neigh determining the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal nicety by drawing its lower portion through his fingers  i have quite forgottencannot keep peoples names in my head at all nor could my father eithernor any of my familya very odd thing  but my old friend mrs napper knows for certain  and he turned to one of a small group of middleaged persons near who instead of skimming the surface of things in general like the rest of the company were going into the very depths of them  othat is the celebrated mrs petherwin the woman who makes rhymes and prints em said mrs napper in a detached sentence and then continued talking again to those on the other side of her  the two loungers went on with their observations of ethelbertas headdress which though not extraordinary or eccentric did certainly convey an idea of indefinable novelty  observers were sometimes half inclined to think that her cuts and modes were acquired by some secret communication with the mysterious clique which orders the livery of the fashionable world forand it affords a parallel to cases in which clever thinkers in other spheres arrive independently at one and the same conclusionethelbertas fashion often turned out to be the coming one  o is that the woman at last said neigh diminishing his broad general gaze at the room to a close criticism of ethelberta  the rhymes as mrs napper calls them are not to be despised said his companion  they are not quite virginibus puerisque and the writers opinions of life and society differ very materially from mine but i cannot help admiring her in the more reflective pieces the songs i dont care for  the method in which she handles curious subjects and at the same time impresses us with a full conviction of her modesty is very adroit and somewhat blinds us to the fact that no such poems were demanded of her at all  i have not read them said neigh secretly wrestling with his jaw to prevent a yawn but i suppose i must  the truth is that i never care much for reading what one ought to read i wish i did but i cannot help it  and no doubt you admire the lady immensely for writing them i dont  everybody is so talented nowadays that the only people i care to honour as deserving real distinction are those who remain in obscurity  i am myself hoping for a corner in some biographical dictionary when the time comes for those works only to contain lists of the exceptional individuals of whom nothing is known but that they lived and died  ahlisten  they are going to sing one of her songs said his friend looking towards a bustling movement in the neighbourhood of the piano  i believe that song when tapers tall has been set to music by three or four composers already  men of any note said neigh at last beaten by his yawn which courtesy nevertheless confined within his person to such an extent that only a few unimportant symptoms such as reduced eyes and a certain rectangular manner of mouth in speaking were visible  scarcely replied the other man  established writers of music do not expend their energies upon new verse until they find that such verse is likely to endure for should the poet be soon forgotten their labour is in some degree lost  artful dogswho would have thought it said neigh just as an exercise in words and they drew nearer to the piano less to become listeners to the singing than to be spectators of the scene in that quarter  but among some others the interest in the songs seemed to be very great and it was unanimously wished that the young lady who had practised the different pieces of music privately would sing some of them now in the order of their composers reputations  the musical persons in the room unconsciously resolved themselves into a committee of taste  one and another had been tried when at the end of the third a lady spoke to ethelberta  now mrs petherwin she said gracefully throwing back her face your opinion is by far the most valuable  in which of the cases do you consider the marriage of verse and tune to have been most successful  ethelberta finding these and other unexpected calls made upon herself came to the front without flinching  the sweetest and the best that i like by far she said is none of these  it is one which reached me by post only this morning from a place in wessex and is written by an unheardof man who lives somewhere down therea man who will be nevertheless heard a great deal of some day i hopethink  i have only practised it this afternoon but if ones own judgment is worth anything it is the best  let us have your favourite by all means said another friend of ethelbertas who was presentmrs doncastle  i am so sorry that i cannot oblige you since you wish to hear it replied the poetess regretfully but the music is at home  i had not received it when i lent the others to miss belmaine and it is only in manuscript like the rest  could it not be sent for suggested an enthusiast who knew that ethelberta lived only in the next street appealing by a look to her and then to the mistress of the house  certainly let us send for it said that lady  a footman was at once quietly despatched with precise directions as to where christophers sweet production might be found  whatis there going to be something interesting asked a young married friend of mrs napper who had returned to her original spot  yesthe best song she has written is to be sung in the best manner to the best air that has been composed for it  i should not wonder if she were going to sing it herself  did you know anything of mrs petherwin until her name leaked out in connection with these ballads  no but i think i recollect seeing her once before  she is one of those people who are known as one may say by subscription everybody knows a little till she is astonishingly well known altogether but nobody knows her entirely  she was the orphan child of some clergyman i believe lady petherwin her motherinlaw has been taking her about a great deal latterly  she has apparently a very good prospect  yes and it is through her being of that curious undefined character which interprets itself to each admirer as whatever he would like to have it  old men like her because she is so girlish youths because she is womanly wicked men because she is good in their eyes good men because she is wicked in theirs  she must be a very anomalous sort of woman at that rate  yes  like the british constitution she owes her success in practice to her inconsistencies in principle  these poems must have set her up  she appears to be quite the correct spectacle  happy mrs petherwin  the subject of their dialogue was engaged in a conversation with mrs belmaine upon the management of householdsa theme provoked by a discussion that was in progress in the pages of some periodical of the time  mrs belmaine was very full of the argument and went on from point to point till she came to servants  the face of ethelberta showed caution at once  i consider that lady plamby pets her servants by far too much said mrs belmaine  o you do not know her  well she is a woman with theories and she lends her maids and men books of the wrong kind for their station and sends them to picture exhibitions which they dont in the least understandall for the improvement of their taste and morals and nobody knows what besides  it only makes them dissatisfied  the face of ethelberta showed venturesomeness  yes and dreadfully ambitious she said  yes indeed  what a turn the times have taken  people of that sort push on and get into business and get great warehouses until at last without ancestors or family or name or estate  or the merest scrap of heirloom or family jewel  or heirlooms or family jewels they are thought as much of as if their forefathers had glided unobtrusively through the peerage  ever since the first edition  yes  mrs belmaine who really sprang from a good old family had been going to say for the last seven hundred years but fancying from ethelbertas addendum that she might not date back more than a trifling century or so adopted the suggestion with her usual wellknown courtesy and blushed down to her locket at the thought of the mistake that she might have made  this sensitiveness was a trait in her character which gave great gratification to her husband and indeed to all who knew her  and have you any theory on the vexed question of servantgovernment continued mrs belmaine smiling  but nothe subject is of far too practical a nature for one of your bent of course  o noit is not at all too practical  i have thought of the matter often said ethelberta  i think the best plan would be for somebody to write a pamphlet the shortest way with the servants just as there was once written a terribly stinging one the shortest way with the dissenters which had a great effect  i have always understood that that was written by a dissenter as a satire upon the church  ahso it was but the example will do to illustrate my meaning  quite soi understandso it will said mrs belmaine with clouded faculties  meanwhile christophers music had arrived  an accomplished gentleman who had every musical talent except that of creation scanned the notes carefully from top to bottom and sat down to accompany the singer  there was no lady present of sufficient confidence or skill to venture into a song she had never seen before and the only one who had seen it was ethelberta herself she did not deny having practised it the greater part of the afternoon and was very willing to sing it now if anybody would derive pleasure from the performance  then she began and the sweetness of her singing was such that even the most unsympathetic honoured her by looking as if they would be willing to listen to every note the song contained if it were not quite so much trouble to do so  some were so interested that instead of continuing their conversation they remained in silent consideration of how they would continue it when she had finished while the particularly civil people arranged their countenances into every attentive form that the mind could devise  one emotional gentleman looked at the corner of a chair as if till that moment such an object had never crossed his vision before the movement of his finger to the imagined tune was for a deaf old clergyman a perfect mine of interest whilst a young man from the country was powerless to put an end to an enchanted gaze at nothing at all in the exact middle of the room before him  neigh and the general phalanx of cool men and celebrated club yawners were so much affected that they raised their chronic look of great objection to things to an expression of scarcely any objection at all  what makes it so interesting said mrs doncastle to ethelberta when the song was over and she had retired from the focus of the company is that it is played from the composers own copy which has never met the public eye or any other than his own before today  and i see that he has actually sketched in the lines by hand instead of having ruled paperjust as the great old composers used to do  you must have been as pleased to get it fresh from the stocks like that as he probably was pleased to get your thanks  ethelberta became reflective  she had not thanked christopher moreover she had decided after some consideration that she ought not to thank him  what new thoughts were suggested by that remark of mrs doncastles and what new inclination resulted from the public presentation of his tune and her words as parts of one organic whole are best explained by describing her doings at a later hour when having left her friends somewhat early she had reached home and retired from public view for that evening  ethelberta went to her room sent away the maid who did double duty for herself and lady petherwin walked in circles about the carpet till the fire had grown haggard and cavernous sighed took a sheet of paper and wrote     dear mr juliani have said i would not write i have said it    twice but discretion under some circumstances is only another name    for unkindness  before thanking you for your sweet gift let me tell    you in a few words of something which may materially change an aspect    of affairs under which i appear to you to deserve it     with regard to my history and origin you are altogether mistaken and    how can i tell whether your bitterness at my previous silence on those    points may not cause you to withdraw your act of courtesy now  but    the gratification of having at last been honest with you may    compensate even for the loss of your respect     the matter is a small one to tell after all  what will you say on    learning that i am not the troddendown lady by birth that you have    supposed me  that my father is not dead as you probably imagine    that he is working for his living as one among a peculiarly    stigmatized and ridiculed multitude     had he been a brawny cottager carpenter mason blacksmith well    digger navvy treefellerany effective and manly trade in short a    worker in which can stand up in the face of the noblest and daintiest    and bare his gnarled arms and say with a consciousness of superior    power look at a real man i should have been able to show you    antecedents which if not intensely romantic are not altogether    antagonistic to romance  but the present fashion of associating with    one particular class everything that is ludicrous and bombastic    overpowers me when i think of it in relation to myself and your known    sensitiveness  when the wellborn poetess of good report melts into       having got thus far a fainthearted look which had begun to show itself several sentences earlier became pronounced  she threw the writing into the dull fire poked and stirred it till a red inflammation crept over the sheet and then started anew     dear mr juliannot knowing your present rank as composerwhether    on the very brink of fame or as yet a long way offi cannot decide    what form of expression my earnest acknowledgments should take  let    me simply say in one short phrase i thank you infinitely     i am no musician and my opinion on music may not be worth much yet    i know what i like as everybody says but i do not use the words as a    form to cover a hopeless blank on all connected with the subject and    this sweet air i love  you must have glided like a breeze about    meseen into a heart not worthy of scrutiny jotted down words that    cannot justify attentionbefore you could have apotheosized the song    in so exquisite a manner  my gratitude took the form of wretchedness    when on hearing the effect of the ballad in public this evening i    thought that i had not power to withhold a reply which might do us    both more harm than good  then i said away with all emotioni wish    the world was drained dry of iti will take no notice when a lady    whispered at my elbow to the effect that of course i had expressed my    gratification to you  i ought first to have mentioned that your    creation has been played tonight to full drawingrooms and the    original tones cooled the artificial air like a fountain almost     i prophesy great things of you  perhaps at the time when we are    each but a row of bones in our individual graves your genius will be    remembered while my mere cleverness will have been long forgotten     butyou must allow a woman of experience to say thisthe undoubted    power that you possess will do you socially no good unless you mix    with it the ingredient of ambitiona quality in which i fear you are    very deficient  it is in the hope of stimulating you to a better    opinion of yourself that i write this letter     probably i shall never meet you again  not that i think    circumstances to be particularly powerful to prevent such a meeting    rather it is that i shall energetically avoid it  there can be no    such thing as strong friendship between a man and a woman not of one    family     more than that there must not be and this is why we will not meet    you see that i do not mince matters at all but it is hypocrisy to    avoid touching upon a subject which all men and women in our position    inevitably think of no matter what they say  some women might have    written distantly and wept at the repression of their real feeling    but it is better to be more frank and keep a dry eyeyours    ethelberta  her feet felt cold and her heart weak as she directed the letter and she was overpowered with weariness  but murmuring if i let it stay till the morning i shall not send it and a man may be lost to fame because of a womans squeamishnessit shall go she partially dressed herself wrapped a large cloak around her descended the stairs and went out to the pillarbox at the corner leaving the door not quite close  no gust of wind had realized her misgivings that it might be blown shut on her return and she reentered as softly as she had emerged  it will be seen that ethelberta had said nothing about her family after all     10 lady petherwins house   the next day old lady petherwin who had not accompanied ethelberta the night before came into the morningroom with a newspaper in her hand  what does this mean ethelberta she inquired in tones from which every shade of human expressiveness was extracted by some awful and imminent mood that lay behind  she was pointing to a paragraph under the heading of literary notes which contained in a few words the announcement of ethelbertas authorship that had more circumstantially appeared in the wessex reflector  it means what it says said ethelberta quietly  then it is true  yes  i must apologize for having kept it such a secret from you  it was not done in the spirit that you may imagine it was merely to avoid disturbing your mind that i did it so privately  but surely you have not written every one of those ribald verses  ethelberta looked inclined to exclaim most vehemently against this but what she actually did say was ribaldwhat do you mean by that  i dont think that you are aware what ribald means  i am not sure that i am  as regards some words as well as some persons the less you are acquainted with them the more it is to your credit  i dont quite deserve this lady petherwin  really one would imagine that women wrote their books during those dreams in which people have no moral sense to see how improper some even virtuous ladies become when they get into print  i might have done a much more unnatural thing than write those poems and perhaps i might have done a much better thing and got less praise but thats the worlds fault not mine  you might have left them unwritten and shown more fidelity  fidelity it is more a matter of humour than principle  what has fidelity to do with it  fidelity to my dear boys memory  it would be difficult to show that because i have written socalled tender and gay verse i feel tender and gay  it is too often assumed that a persons fancy is a persons real mind  i believe that in the majority of cases one is fond of imagining the direct opposite of ones principles in sheer effort after something fresh and free at any rate some of the lightest of those rhymes were composed between the deepest fits of dismals i have ever known  however i did expect that you might judge in the way you have judged and that was my chief reason for not telling you what i had done  you dont deny that you tried to escape from recollections you ought to have cherished  there is only one thing that women of your sort are as ready to do as to take a mans name and that is drop his memory  dear lady petherwindont be so unreasonable as to blame a live person for living  no womans head is so small as to be filled for life by a memory of a few months  four years have passed since i last saw my boy husband  we were mere children see how i have altered since in mind substance and outlinei have even grown half an inch taller since his death  two years will exhaust the regrets of widows who have long been faithful wives and ought i not to show a little new life when my husband died in the honeymoon  no  accepting the protection of your husbands mother was in effect an avowal that you rejected the idea of being a widow to prolong the idea of being a wife and the sin against your conventional state thus assumed is almost as bad as would have been a sin against the married state itself  if you had gone off when he died saying thank heaven i am free you would at any rate have shown some real honesty  i should have been more virtuous by being more unfeeling  that often happens  i have taken to you and made a great deal of yougiven you the inestimable advantages of foreign travel and good society to enlarge your mind  in short i have been like a naomi to you in everything and i maintain that writing these poems saps the foundation of it all  i do own that you have been a very good naomi to me thus far but ruth was quite a fast widow in comparison with me and yet naomi never blamed her  you are unfortunate in your illustration  but it is dreadfully flippant of me to answer you like this for you have been kind  but why will you provoke me  yes you are flippant ethelberta  you are too much given to that sort of thing  well i dont know how the secret of my name has leaked out and i am not ribald or anything you say said ethelberta with a sigh  then you own you do not feel so ardent as you seem in your book  i do own it  and that you are sorry your name has been published in connection with it  i am  and you think the verses may tend to misrepresent your character as a gay and rapturous one when it is not  i do fear it  then of course you will suppress the poems instantly  that is the only way in which you can regain the position you have hitherto held with me  ethelberta said nothing and the dull winter atmosphere had far from light enough in it to show by her face what she might be thinking  well said lady petherwin  i did not expect such a command as that said ethelberta  i have been obedient for four years and would continue sobut i cannot suppress the poems  they are not mine now to suppress  you must get them into your hands  money will do it i suppose  yes i suppose it woulda thousand pounds  very well the money shall be forthcoming said lady petherwin after a pause  you had better sit down and write about it at once  i cannot do it said ethelberta and i will not  i dont wish them to be suppressed  i am not ashamed of them there is nothing to be ashamed of in them and i shall not take any steps in the matter  then you are an ungrateful woman and wanting in natural affection for the dead  considering your birth  thats an intolerable  lady petherwin crashed out of the room in a wind of indignation and went upstairs and heard no more  adjoining her chamber was a smaller one called her study and on reaching this she unlocked a cabinet took out a small deedbox removed from it a folded packet unfolded it crumpled it up and turning round suddenly flung it into the fire  then she stood and beheld it eaten away word after word by the flames testamentall that freeholdheirs and assigns appearing occasionally for a moment only to disappear for ever  nearly half the document had turned into a glossy black when the lady clasped her hands  what have i done she exclaimed  springing to the tongs she seized with them the portion of the writing yet unconsumed and dragged it out of the fire  ethelberta appeared at the door  quick ethelberta said lady petherwin  help me to put this out  and the two women went trampling wildly upon the document and smothering it with a corner of the hearthrug  what is it said ethelberta  my will said lady petherwin  i have kept it by me lately for i have wished to look over it at leisure  good heavens said ethelberta  and i was just coming in to tell you that i would always cling to you and never desert you illuse me how you might  such an affectionate remark sounds curious at such a time said lady petherwin sinking down in a chair at the end of the struggle  but cried ethelberta you dont suppose  selfishness my dear has given me such crooked looks that i can see it round a corner  if you mean that what is yours to give may not be mine to take it would be as well to name it in an impersonal way if you must name it at all said the daughterinlaw with wet eyelids  god knows i had no selfish thought in saying that  i came upstairs to ask you to forgive me and knew nothing about the will  but every explanation distorts it all the more  we two have got all awry dearit cannot be concealedawryawry  ah who shall set us right again  however now i must send for mr chancerlyno i am going out on other business and i will call upon him  there dont spoil your eyes you may have to sell them  she rang the bell and ordered the carriage and halfanhour later lady petherwins coachman drove his mistress up to the door of her lawyers office in lincolns inn fields     11 sandbourne and its neighbourhoodsome london streets   while this was going on in town christopher at his lodgings in sandbourne had been thrown into rare old visions and dreams by the appearance of ethelbertas letter  flattered and encouraged to ambition as well as to love by her inspiriting sermon he put off now the last remnant of cynical doubt upon the genuineness of his old mistress and once and for all set down as disloyal a belief he had latterly acquired that come woo me woo me for i am like enough to consent was all a young woman had to tell  all the reasoning of political and social economists would not have convinced christopher that he had a better chance in london than in sandbourne of making a decent income by reasonable and likely labour but a belief in a far more improbable proposition impetuously expressed warmed him with the idea that he might become famous there  the greater is frequently more readily credited than the less and an argument which will not convince on a matter of halfpence appears unanswerable when applied to questions of glory and honour  the regulation wet towel and strong coffee of the ambitious and intellectual student floated before him in visions but it was with a sense of relief that he remembered that music in spite of its drawbacks as a means of sustenance was a profession happily unencumbered with those excruciating preliminaries to greatness  christopher talked about the new move to his sister and he was vexed that her hopefulness was not roused to quite the pitch of his own  as with others of his sort his too general habit of accepting the most clouded possibility that chances offered was only transcended by his readiness to kindle with a fitful excitement now and then  faith was much more equable  if you were not the most melancholy man god ever created she said kindly looking at his vague deep eyes and thin face which was but a few degrees too refined and poetical to escape the epithet of lanternjawed from any one who had quarrelled with him you would not mind my coolness about this  it is a good thing of course to go i have always fancied that we were mistaken in coming here mediocrity stamped london fetches more than talent marked provincial but i cannot feel so enthusiastic  still if we are to go we may as well go by enthusiasm as by calculation it is a sensation pleasanter to the nerves and leads to just as good a result when there is only one result possible  very well said faith  i will not depress you  if i had to describe you i should say you were a child in your impulses and an old man in your reflections  have you considered when we shall start  yes  what have you thought  that we may very well leave the place in six weeks if we wish  we really may  yes  and what is more we will        christopher and faith arrived in london on an afternoon at the end of winter and beheld from one of the river bridges snowwhite scrolls of steam from the tall chimneys of lambeth rising against the livid sky behind as if drawn in chalk on toned cardboard  the first thing he did that evening when settled in their apartments near the british museum before applying himself to the beginning of the means by which success in life might be attained was to go out in the direction of ethelbertas door leaving faith unpacking the things and sniffing extraordinary smokesmells which she discovered in all nooks and crannies of the rooms  it was some satisfaction to see ethelbertas house although the single feature in which it differed from the other houses in the crescent was that no lamp shone from the fanlight over the entrancea speciality which if he cared for omens was hardly encouraging  fearing to linger near lest he might be detected christopher stole a glimpse at the door and at the steps imagined what a trifle of the depression worn in each step her feet had tended to produce and strolled home again  feeling that his reasons for calling just now were scarcely sufficient he went next day about the business that had brought him to town which referred to a situation as organist in a large church in the northwest district  the post was half ensured already and he intended to make of it the nucleus of a professional occupation and income  then he sat down to think of the preliminary steps towards publishing the song that had so pleased her and had also as far as he could understand from her letter hit the popular taste very successfully a fact which however little it may say for the virtues of the song as a composition was a great recommendation to it as a property  christopher was delighted to perceive that out of this position he could frame an admissible if not an unimpeachable reason for calling upon ethelberta  he determined to do so at once and obtain the required permission by word of mouth  he was greatly surprised when the front of the house appeared in view on this spring afternoon to see what a white and sightless aspect pervaded all the windows  he came close the eyeball blankness was caused by all the shutters and blinds being shut tight from top to bottom  possibly this had been the case for some timehe could not tell  in one of the windows was a card bearing the announcement this house to be let furnished  here was a merciless clash between fancy and fact regretting now his faintheartedness in not letting her know beforehand by some means that he was about to make a new start in the world and coming to dwell near her christopher rang the bell to make inquiries  a gloomy caretaker appeared after a while and the young man asked whither the ladies had gone to live  he was beyond measure depressed to learn that they were in the south of francearles the man thought the place was calledthe time of their return to town being very uncertain though one thing was clear they meant to miss the forthcoming london season altogether  as christophers hope to see her again had brought a resolve to do so so now resolve led to dogged patience  instead of attempting anything by letter he decided to wait and he waited well occupying himself in publishing a march and a morning and evening service in e flat  some fourpart songs too engaged his attention when the heavier duties of the day were overthese duties being the giving of lessons in harmony and counterpoint in which he was aided by the introductions of a man well known in the musical world who had been acquainted with young julian as a promising amateur long before he adopted music as the staff of his pilgrimage  it was the end of summer when he again tried his fortune at the house in exonbury crescent  scarcely calculating upon finding her at this stagnant time of the town year and only hoping for information julian was surprised and excited to see the shutters open and the house wearing altogether a living look its neighbours having decidedly died off meanwhile  the family here said a footman in answer to his inquiry are only temporary tenants of the house  it is not lady petherwins people  do you know the petherwins present address  underground sir for the old lady  she died some time ago in switzerland and was buried there i believe  and mrs petherwinthe young lady said christopher starting  we are not acquainted personally with the family the man replied  my master has only taken the house for a few months whilst extensive alterations are being made in his own on the other side of the park which he goes to look after every day  if you want any further information about lady petherwin mrs petherwin will probably give it  i can let you have her address  ah yes thank you said christopher  the footman handed him one of some cards which appeared to have been left for the purpose  julian though tremblingly anxious to know where ethelberta was did not look at it till he could take a cool survey in private  the address was arrowthorne lodge upper wessex  dear me said christopher to himself not far from melchester and not dreadfully far from sandbourne     12 arrowthorne park and lodge   summer was just over when christopher julian found himself rattling along in the train to sandbourne on some trifling business appertaining to his late fathers affairs which would afford him an excuse for calling at arrowthorne about the song of hers that he wished to produce  he alighted in the afternoon at a little station some twenty miles short of sandbourne and leaving his portmanteau behind him there decided to walk across the fields obtain if possible the interview with the lady and return then to the station to finish the journey to sandbourne which he could thus reach at a convenient hour in the evening and if he chose take leave of again the next day  it was an afternoon which had a fungous smell out of doors all being sunless and stagnant overhead and around  the various species of trees had begun to assume the more distinctive colours of their decline and where there had been one pervasive green were now twenty greenish yellows the air in the vistas between them being half opaque with blue exhalation  christopher in his walk overtook a countryman and inquired if the path they were following would lead him to arrowthorne lodge  twill take ee into arrthorne park the man replied  but you wont come anigh the lodge unless you bear round to the left as might be  mrs petherwin lives there i believe  no sir  leastwise unless shes but lately come  i have never heard of such a woman  she may possibly be only visiting there  ah perhaps thats the shape ot  well now you tell ot i have seen a strange face thereabouts once or twice lately  a young goodlooking maid enough seemingly  yes shes considered a very handsome lady  ive heard the woodmen say now that you tell ot that they meet her every now and then just at the closing in of the day as they come home along with their nitches of sticks ay stalking about under the trees by herselfa tall black martel so longlegged and awfullike that youd think twas the old feller himself acoming they say  now a woman must be a queer body to my thinking to roam about by night so lonesome and that  ay now that you tell ot there is such a woman but a never have showed in the parish sure i never thought who the body wasno not once about her nor where a was living and thatnot i till you spoke well there sir thats arrthorne lodge do you see they three elms he pointed across the glade towards some confused foliage a long way off  i am not sure about the sort of tree you mean said christopher i see a number of trees with edges shaped like edges of clouds  ay ay they be oaks i mean the elms to the left hand  but a man can hardly tell oaks from elms at that distance my good fellow  that a can very wellleastwise if hes got the sense  well i think i see what you mean said christopher  what next  when you get there you bear away smart to norwest and youll come straight as a line to the lodge  how the deuce am i to know which is northwest in a strange place with no sun to tell me  what not know norwest  well i should think a boy could never live and grow up to be a man without knowing the four quarters  i knowed em when i was a mossel of a chiel  we be no great scholars here thats true but there isnt a tomrig or jackstraw in these parts that dont know where they lie as well as i  now ive lived man and boy these eightandsixty years and never met a man in my life afore who hadnt learnt such a common thing as the four quarters  christopher parted from his companion and soon reached a stile clambering over which he entered a park  here he threaded his way and rounding a clump of aged trees the young man came in view of a light and elegant countryhouse in the halftimbered gothic style of the late revival apparently only a few years old  surprised at finding himself so near christophers heart fluttered unmanageably till he had taken an abstract view of his position and in impatience at his want of nerve adopted a sombre train of reasoning to convince himself that far from indulgence in the passion of love bringing bliss it was a folly leading to grief and disquietcertainly one which would do him no good  cooled down by this he stepped into the drive and went up to the house  is mrs petherwin at home he said modestly  who did you say sir  he repeated the name  dont know the person  the lady may be a visitori call on business  she is not visiting in this house sir  is not this arrowthorne lodge  certainly not  then where is arrowthorne lodge please  well it is nearly a mile from here  under the trees by the highroad if you go across by that footpath it will bring you out quicker than by following the bend of the drive  christopher wondered how he could have managed to get into the wrong park but setting it down to his ignorance of the difference between oak and elm he immediately retraced his steps passing across the park again through the gate at the end of the drive and into the turnpike road  no other gate park or country seat of any description was within view  can you tell me the way to arrowthorne lodge he inquired of the first person he met who was a little girl  you are just coming away from it sir said she  ill show you i am going that way  they walked along together  getting abreast the entrance of the park he had just emerged from the child said there it is sir i live there too  christopher with a dazed countenance looked towards a cottage which stood nestling in the shrubbery and ivy like a mushroom among grass  is that arrowthorne lodge he repeated  yes and if you go up the drive you come to arrowthorne house  arrowthorne lodgewhere mrs petherwin lives i mean  yes  she lives there along wi mother and we  but she dont want anybody to know it sir cause shes celebrate and twouldnt do at all  christopher said no more and the little girl became interested in the products of the bank and ditch by the wayside  he left her pushed open the heavy gate and tapped at the lodge door  the latch was lifted  does mrs petherwin he began and determined that there should be no mistake repeated does mrs ethelberta petherwin the poetess live here turning full upon the person who opened the door  she does sir said a faltering voice and he found himself face to face with the pupilteacher of sandbourne     13 the lodge continuedthe copse behind   this is indeed a surprise iam glad to see you christopher stammered with a wiredrawn radically different smile from the one he had intendeda smile not without a tinge of ghastliness  yesi am home for the holidays said the blushing maiden and after a critical pause she added if you wish to speak to my sister she is in the plantation with the children  o nono thank younot necessary at all said christopher in haste i only wish for an interview with a lady called mrs petherwin  yes mrs petherwinmy sister said picotee  she is in the plantation  that little path will take you to her in five minutes  the amazed christopher persuaded himself that this discovery was very delightful and went on persuading so long that at last he felt it to be so  unable like many other people to enjoy being satirized in words because of the irritation it caused him as aimedat victim he sometimes had philosophy enough to appreciate a satire of circumstance because nobody intended it  pursuing the path indicated he found himself in a thicket of scrubby undergrowth which covered an area enclosed from the park proper by a decaying fence  the boughs were so tangled that he was obliged to screen his face with his hands to escape the risk of having his eyes filliped out by the twigs that impeded his progress  thus slowly advancing his ear caught between the rustles the tones of a voice in earnest declamation and pushing round in that direction he beheld through some beech boughs an open space about ten yards in diameter floored at the bottom with deep beds of curled old leaves and cushions of furry moss  in the middle of this natural theatre was the stump of a tree that had been felled by a saw and upon the flat stool thus formed stood ethelberta whom christopher had not beheld since the ball at wyndway house  round her leaning against branches or prostrate on the ground were five or six individuals  two were young mechanicsone of them evidently a carpenter  then there was a boy about thirteen and two or three younger children  ethelbertas appearance answered as fully as ever to that of an english lady skilfully perfected in manner carriage look and accent and the incongruity of her present position among lives which had had many of natures beauties stamped out of them and few of the beauties of art stamped in brought him as a second feeling a pride in her that almost equalled his first sentiment of surprise  christophers attention was meanwhile attracted from the constitution of the group to the words of the speaker in the centre of itwords to which her auditors were listening with still attention  it appeared to christopher that ethelberta had lately been undergoing some very extraordinary experiences  what the beginning of them had been he could not in the least understand but the portion she was describing came distinctly to his ears and he wondered more and more  he came forward till he like myself was about twenty yards from the edge  i instinctively grasped my useless stiletto  how i longed for the assistance which a little earlier i had so much despised  reaching the block or boulder upon which i had been sitting he clasped his arms around from behind his hands closed upon the empty seat and he jumped up with an oath  this method of attack told me a new thing with wretched distinctness he had as i suppose discovered my sex male attire was to serve my turn no longer  the next instant indeed made it clear for he exclaimed you dont escape me masquerading madam or some such words and came on  my only hope was that in his excitement he might forget to notice where the grass terminated near the edge of the cliff though this could be easily felt by a careful walker to make my own feeling more distinct on this point i hastily bared my feet  the listeners moistened their lips ethelberta took breath and then went on to describe the scene that ensued a dreadful variation on the game of blindmans buff being the words by which she characterized it  ethelbertas manner had become so impassioned at this point that the lips of her audience parted the children clung to their elders and christopher could control himself no longer  he thrust aside the boughs and broke in upon the group  for heavens sake ethelberta he exclaimed with great excitement where did you meet with such a terrible experience as that  the children shrieked as if they thought that the interruption was in some way the catastrophe of the events in course of narration  every one started up the two young mechanics stared and one of them inquired in return whats the matter friend  christopher had not yet made reply when ethelberta stepped from her pedestal down upon the crackling carpet of deep leaves  mr julian said she in a serene voice turning upon him eyes of such a disputable stage of colour between brown and grey as would have commended itself to a gallant duellist of the last century as a point on which it was absolutely necessary to take some friends life or other but the calmness was artificially done and the astonishment that did not appear in ethelbertas tones was expressed by her gaze  christopher was not in a mood to draw fine distinctions between recognized and unrecognized organs of speech  he replied to the eyes  i own that your surprise is natural he said with an anxious look into her face as if he wished to get beyond this interpolated scene to something more congenial and understood  but my concern at such a history of yourself since i last saw you is even more natural than your surprise at my manner of breaking in  that history would justify any conduct in one who hears it  yes indeed  if it were true added ethelberta smiling  but it is as false as she could name nothing notoriously false without raising an image of what was disagreeable and she continued in a better manner the story i was telling is entirely a fiction which i am getting up for a particular purposevery different from what appears at present  i am sorry there was such a misunderstanding christopher stammered looking upon the ground uncertain and ashamed  yet i am not either for i am very glad you have not undergone such trials of course  but the fact is ibeing in the neighbourhoodi ventured to call on a matter of business relating to a poem which i had the pleasure of setting to music at the beginning of the year  ethelberta was only a little less ill at ease than christopher showed himself to be by this way of talking  will you walk slowly on she said gently to the two young men and take the children with you this gentleman wishes to speak to me on business  the biggest young man caught up a little one under his arm and plunged amid the boughs another little one lingered behind for a few moments to look shyly at christopher with an oblique manner of hiding her mouth against her shoulder and her eyes behind her pinafore  then she vanished the boy and the second young man followed and ethelberta and christopher stood within the woodbound circle alone  i hope i have caused no inconvenience by interrupting the proceedings said christopher softly but i so very much wished to see you  did you indeedreally wish to see me she said gladly  never mind inconvenience then it is a word which seems shallow in meaning under the circumstances  i surely must say that a visit is to my advantage must i not  i am not as i was you see and may receive as advantages what i used to consider as troubles  has your life really changed so much  it has changed  but what i first meant was that an interesting visitor at a wrong time is better than a stupid one at a right time  i had been behind the trees for some minutes looking at you and thinking of you but what you were doing rather interrupted my first meditation  i had thought of a meeting in which we should continue our intercourse at the point at which it was broken off years ago as if the omitted part had not existed at all but something i cannot tell what has upset all that feeling and  i can soon tell you the meaning of my extraordinary performance ethelberta broke in quickly and with a little trepidation  my mother inlaw lady petherwin is dead and she has left me nothing but her house and furniture in londonmore than i deserve but less than she had distinctly led me to expect and so i am somewhat in a corner  it is always so  not always i think  but this is how it happened  lady petherwin was very capricious when she was not foolishly kind she was unjustly harsh a great many are like it never thinking what a good thing it would be instead of going on tacking from side to side between favour and cruelty to keep to a mean line of common justice  and so we quarrelled and she being absolute mistress of all her wealth destroyed her will that was in my favour and made another leaving me nothing but the fagend of the lease of the townhouse and the furniture in it  then when we were abroad she turned to me again forgave everything and becoming ill afterwards wrote a letter to the brother to whom she had left the bulk of her property stating that i was to have twentythousand of the one hundredthousand pounds she had bequeathed to himas in the original willdoing this by letter in case anything should happen to her before a new will could be considered drawn and signed and trusting to his honour quite that he would obey her expressed wish should she die abroad well she did die in the full persuasion that i was provided for but her brother as i secretly expected all the time refused to be morally bound by a document which had no legal value and the result is that he has everything except of course the furniture and the lease  it would have been enough to break the heart of a person who had calculated upon getting a fortune which i never did for i felt always like an intruder and a bondswoman and had wished myself out of the petherwin family a hundred times with my crust of bread and liberty  for one thing i was always forbidden to see my relatives and it pained me much  now i am going to move for myself and consider that i have a good chance of success in what i may undertake because of an indifference i feel about succeeding which gives the necessary coolness that any great task requires  i presume you mean to write more poems  i cannotthat is i can write no more that satisfy me  to blossom into rhyme on the sparkling pleasures of life you must be under the influence of those pleasures and i am at present quite removed from themsurrounded by gaunt realities of a very different description  then try the mournful  trade upon your sufferings many do and thrive  it is no use to say thatno use at all  i cannot write a line of verse  and yet the others flowed from my heart like a stream  but nothing is so easy as to seem clever when you have money  except to seem stupid when you have none said christopher looking at the dead leaves  ethelberta allowed herself to linger on that thought for a few seconds and continued then the question arose what was i to do  i felt that to write prose would be an uncongenial occupation and altogether a poor prospect for a woman like me  finally i have decided to appear in public  not on the stage  certainly not on the stage  there is no novelty in a poor lady turning actress and novelty is what i want  ordinary powers exhibited in a new way effect as much as extraordinary powers exhibited in an old way  yesso they do  and extraordinary powers and a new way too would be irresistible  i dont calculate upon both  i had written a prose story by request when it was found that i had grown utterly inane over verse  it was written in the first person and the style was modelled after de foes the night before sending it off when i had already packed it up i was reading about the professional storytellers of eastern countries who devoted their lives to the telling of tales  i unfastened the manuscript and retained it convinced that i should do better by telling the story  well thought of exclaimed christopher looking into her face  there is a way for everybody to live if they can only find it out  it occurred to me she continued blushing slightly that tales of the weird kind were made to be told not written  the action of a teller is wanted to give due effect to all stories of incident and i hope that a time will come when as of old instead of an unsocial reading of fiction at home alone people will meet together cordially and sit at the feet of a professed romancer  i am going to tell my tales before a london public  as a child i had a considerable power in arresting the attention of other children by recounting adventures which had never happened and men and women are but children enlarged a little  look at this  she drew from her pocket a folded paper shook it abroad and disclosed a rough draft of an announcement to the effect that mrs petherwin professed storyteller would devote an evening to that ancient form of the romancers art at a wellknown fashionable hall in london  now you see she continued the meaning of what you observed going on here that you heard was one of three tales i am preparing with a view of selecting the best  as a reserved one i have the tale of my own lifeto be played as a last card  it was a private rehearsal before my brothers and sistersnot with any view of obtaining their criticism but that i might become accustomed to my own voice in the presence of listeners  if i only had had half your enterprise what i might have done in the world  now did you ever consider what a power de foes manner would have if practised by word of mouth  indeed it is a style which suits itself infinitely better to telling than to writing abounding as it does in colloquialisms that are somewhat out of place on paper in these days but have a wonderful power in making a narrative seem real  and so in short i am going to talk de foe on a subject of my own  well  the last word had been given tenderly with a longdrawn sweetness and was caused by a look that christopher was bending upon her at the moment in which he revealed that he was thinking less of the subject she was so eagerly and hopefully descanting upon than upon her aspect in explaining it  it is a fault of manner particularly common among men newly imported into the society of bright and beautiful women and we will hope that springing as it does from no unworthy source it is as soon forgiven in the general world as it was here  i was only following a thought said christophera thought of how i used to know you and then lost sight of you and then discovered you famous and how we are here under these sad autumn trees and nobody in sight  i think it must be teatime she said suddenly  tea is a great meal with us hereyou will join us will you not  and ethelberta began to make for herself a passage through the boughs  another rustle was heard a little way off and one of the children appeared  emmeline wants to know please if the gentleman that come to see ee will stay to tea because if so shes agoing to put in another spoonful for him and a bit of best green  o georginahow candid  yes put in some best green  before christopher could say any more to her they were emerging by the corner of the cottage and one of the brothers drew near them  mr julian youll bide and have a cup of tea wi us he inquired of christopher  an old friend of yours is he not mrs petherwin  dan and i be going back to sandbourne tonight and we can walk with ee as far as the station  i shall be delighted said christopher and they all entered the cottage  the evening had grown clearer by this time the sun was peeping out just previous to departure and sent gold wires of light across the glades and into the windows throwing a pattern of the diamond quarries and outlines of the geraniums in pots against the opposite wall  one end of the room was polygonal such a shape being dictated by the exterior design in this part the windows were placed as at the east end of continental churches  thus from the combined effects of the ecclesiastical lancet lights and the apsidal shape of the room it occurred to christopher that the sisters were all a delightful set of pretty saints exhibiting themselves in a lady chapel and backed up by unkempt major prophets as represented by the forms of their big brothers  christopher sat down to tea as invited squeezing himself in between two children whose names were almost as long as their persons and whose tin cups discoursed primitive music by means of spoons rattled inside them until they were filled  the tea proceeded pleasantly notwithstanding that the cake being a little burnt tasted on the outside like the latter plums in snapdragon  christopher never could meet the eye of picotee who continued in a wild state of flushing all the time fixing her looks upon the sugarbasin except when she glanced out of the window to see how the evening was going on and speaking no word at all unless it was to correct a small sister of somewhat crude manners as regards filling the mouth which picotee did in a whisper and a gentle inclination of her mouth to the little ones ear and a still deeper blush than before  their visitor next noticed that an additional cupandsaucer and plate made their appearance occasionally at the table were silently replenished and then carried off by one of the children to an inner apartment  our mother is bedridden said ethelberta noticing christophers look at the proceeding  emmeline attends to the household except when picotee is at home and joey attends to the gate but our mothers affliction is a very unfortunate thing for the poor children  we are thinking of a plan of living which will i hope be more convenient than this is but we have not yet decided what to do  at this minute a carriage and pair of horses became visible through one of the angular windows of the apse in the act of turning in from the highway towards the park gate  the boy who answered to the name of joey sprang up from the table with the promptness of a jackinthebox and ran out at the door  everybody turned as the carriage passed through the gate which joey held open putting his other hand where the brim of his hat would have been if he had worn one and lapsing into a careless boy again the instant that the vehicle had gone by  theres a tremendous large dinnerparty at the house tonight said emmeline methodically looking at the equipage over the edge of her teacup without leaving off sipping  that was lord mountclere  hes a wicked old man they say  lord mountclere said ethelberta musingly  i used to know some friends of his  in what way is he wicked  i dont know said emmeline with simplicity  i suppose it is because he breaks the commandments  but i wonder how a big rich lord can want to steal anything  emmelines thoughts of breaking commandments instinctively fell upon the eighth as being in her ideas the only case wherein the gain could be considered as at all worth the hazard  ethelberta said nothing but christopher thought that a shade of depression passed over her  hook back the gate joey shouted emmeline when the carriage had proceeded up the drive  theres more to come  joey did as ordered and by the time he got indoors another carriage turned in from the public roada onehorse brougham this time  i know who that is thats mr ladywell said emmeline in the same matteroffact tone  hes been here afore hes a distant relation of the squires and he once gave me sixpence for picking up his gloves  what shall i live to see murmured the poetess under her breath nearly dropping her teacup in an involuntary trepidation from which she made it a point of dignity to recover in a moment  christophers eyes at that exhibition from ethelberta entered her own like a pair of lances  picotee seeing christophers quick look of jealousy became involved in her turn and grew pale as a lily in her endeavours to conceal the complications to which it gave birth in her poor little breast likewise  you judge me very wrongly said ethelberta in answer to christophers hasty look of resentment  in supposing mr ladywell to be a great friend of yours said christopher who had in some indescribable way suddenly assumed a right to ethelberta as his old property  yes for i hardly know him and certainly do not value him  after this there was something in the mutual look of the two though their words had been private which did not tend to remove the anguish of fragile picotee  christopher assured that ethelbertas embarrassment had been caused by nothing more than the sense of her odd social subsidence recovered more bliss than he had lost and regarded calmly the profile of young ladywell between the two windows of his brougham as it passed the open cottage door bearing him along unconscious as the dead of the nearness of his beloved one and of the sad buffoonery that fate fortune and the guardian angels had been playing with ethelberta of late  he recognized the face as that of the young man whom he had encountered when watching ethelbertas window from rookington park  perhaps you remember seeing him at the christmas dance at wyndway she inquired  he is a goodnatured fellow  afterwards he sent me that portfolio of sketches you see in the corner  he might possibly do something in the world as a painter if he were obliged to work at the art for his bread which he is not  she added with bitter pleasantry in bare mercy to his selfrespect i must remain unseen here  it impressed christopher to perceive how under the estrangement which arose from differences of education surroundings experience and talent the sympathies of close relationship were perceptible in ethelbertas bearing towards her brothers and sisters  at a remark upon some simple pleasure wherein she had not participated because absent and occupied by far more comprehensive interests a gloom as of banishment would cross her face and dim it for awhile showing that the free habits and enthusiasms of country life had still their charm with her in the face of the subtler gratifications of abridged bodices candlelight and no feelings in particular which prevailed in town  perhaps the one condition which could work up into a permanent feeling the passing revival of his fancy for a woman whose chief attribute he had supposed to be sprightliness was added now by the romantic ubiquity of station that attached to her  a discovery which might have grated on the senses of a man wedded to conventionality was a positive pleasure to one whose faith in society had departed with his own social ruin  the room began to darken whereupon christopher arose to leave and the brothers sol and dan offered to accompany him     14 a turnpike road   we be thinking of coming to london ourselves soon said sol a carpenter and joiner by trade as he walked along at christophers left hand  theres so much more chance for a man up the country  now if you was me how should you set about getting a job sir  what can you do said christopher  well i am a very good staircase hand and i have been called neat at sashframes and i can knock together doors and shutters very well and i can do a little at the cabinetmaking  i dont mind framing a roof neither if the rest be busy and i am always ready to fill up my time at planing floorboards by the foot  and i can mix and lay flat tints said dan who was a house painter and pick out mouldings and grain in every kind of wood you can mentionoak maple walnut satinwood cherrytree  you can both do too much to stand the least chance of being allowed to do anything in a city where limitation is all the rule in labour  to have any success sol you must be a man who can thoroughly look at a door to see what ought to be done to it but as to looking at a window thats not your line or a person who to the remotest particular understands turning a screw but who does not profess any knowledge of how to drive a nail  dan must know how to paint blue to a marvel but must be quite in the dark about painting green  if you stick to some such principle of specialty as this you may get employment in london  hahaha said dan striking at a stone in the road with the stout green hazel he carried  a wink is as good as a nod thankeewell mind all that now  if we do come said sol we shall not mix up with mrs petherwin at all  o indeed  o no  perhaps you think it odd that we call her mrs petherwin but thats by agreement as safer and better than berta because we be such rough chaps you see and shes so lofty  twould demean her to claim kin wi her in londontwo journeymen like we that know nothing besides our trades  not at all said christopher by way of chiming in in the friendliest manner  she would be pleased to see any straightforward honest man and brother i should think notwithstanding that she has moved in other society for a time  ah you dont know berta said dan looking as if he did  howin what way do you mean said christopher uneasily  so loftyso very lofty  isnt she sol  why shell never stir out from mothers till after dark and then her day begins and shell traipse about under the trees and never go into the highroad so that nobody in the way of gentlepeople shall run up against her and know her living in such a little small hut after biding in a big mansionplace there we dont find fault wi her about it we like her just the same though she dont speak to us in the street for a feller must be a fool to make a piece of work about a womans pride when tis his own sister and hang upon her and bother her when he knows tis for her good that he should not  yes her life has been quare enough  i hope she enjoys it but for my part i like plain sailing  none of your ups and downs for me there i suppose twas her nater to want to look into the world a bit  father and mother kept berta to school you understand sir explained the more thoughtful sol because she was such a quick child and they always had a notion of making a governess of her  sums  if you said to that child berta levenpencethreefarthings a day how much a year she would tell ee in three seconds out of her own little head  and that hard sum about the herrings she had done afore she was nine  true she had said dan  and we all know that to do that is to do something thats no nonsense  what is the sum christopher inquired  whatnot know the sum about the herrings said dan spreading his gaze all over christopher in amazement  never heard of it said christopher  why down in these parts just as you try a mans soul by the ten commandments you try his head by that there sumhey sol  ay that we do  a herring and a half for threehalfpence how many can ye get for levenpence thats the feller and a mortal teaser he is i assure ee our parson whos not altogether without sense o week days said one afternoon if cunning can be found in the multiplication table at all chickerel tis in connection with that sum  well berta was so clever in arithmetic that she was asked to teach summing at miss courtleys and there she got to like foreign tongues more than ciphering and at last she hated ciphering and took to books entirely  mother and we were very proud of her at that time not that we be stuckup people at allbe we sol  not at all nobody can say that we be that though theres more of it in the country than there should be by all account  youd be surprised to see how vain the girls about here be getting little rascals why they wont curtsey to the loftiest lady in the land no not if you were to pay em to do it  now the men be different  any man will touch his hat for a pint of beer  but then of course theres some difference between the two  touching your hat is a good deal less to do than bending your knees as berta used to say when she was blowed up for not doing it  she was always one of the independent sortyou never seed such a maid as she was  now picotee was quite the other way  has picotee left sandbourne entirely  o no she is home for the holidays  well mr julian our road parts from yours just here unless you walk into the next town along with us but i suppose you get across to this station and go by rail  i am obliged to go that way for my portmanteau said christopher or i should have been pleased to walk further  shall i see you in sandbourne tomorrow  i hope so  well no  tis hardly likely that you will see ushardly  we know how unpleasant it is for a high sort of man to have rough chaps like us hailing him so we think it best not to meet youthank you all the same so if you should run up against us in the street we should be just as well pleased by your taking no notice if you wouldnt mind  twill save so much awkwardnessbeing in our working clothes  tis always the plan that mrs petherwin and we agree to act upon and we find it best for both  i hope you take our meaning right and as no offence mr julian  and do you do the same with picotee  o lord notisnt a bit of use to try  thats the worst of picoteetheres no getting rid of her  the more in the rough we be the more shell stick to us and if we say she shant come shell bide and fret about it till we be forced to let her  christopher laughed and promised on condition that they would retract the statement about their not being proud and then he wished his friends goodnight     15 an inner room at the lodge   at the lodge at this time a discussion of some importance was in progress  the scene was mrs chickerels bedroom to which unfortunately she was confined by some spinal complaint and here she now appeared as an interesting woman of fiveandforty properly dressed as far as visible and propped up in a bed covered with a quilt which presented a field of little squares in many tints looking altogether like a birdseye view of a market garden  mrs chickerel had been nurse in a noblemans family until her marriage and after that she played the part of wife and mother upon the whole affectionately and well  among her minor differences with her husband had been one about the naming of the children a matter that was at last compromised by an agreement under which the choice of the girls names became her prerogative and that of the boys her husbands who limited his field of selection to strict historical precedent as a setoff to mrs chickerels tendency to stray into the regions of romance  the only grownup daughters at home ethelberta and picotee with their brother joey were sitting near her the two youngest children georgina and myrtle who had been strutting in and out of the room and otherwise endeavouring to walk talk and speak like the gentleman just gone away were packed off to bed  emmeline of that transitional age which causes its exponent to look wistfully at the sitters when romping and at the rompers when sitting uncertain whether her position in the household is that of child or woman was idling in a corner  the two absent brothers and two absent sisterseldest members of the familycompleted the round ten whom mrs chickerel with thoughtless readiness had presented to a crowded world to cost ethelberta many wakeful hours at night while she revolved schemes how they might be decently maintained  i still think ethelberta was saying that the plan i first proposed is the best  i am convinced that it will not do to attempt to keep on the lodge  if we are all together in town i can look after you much better than when you are far away from me down here  shall we not interfere with youyour plans for keeping up your connections inquired her mother glancing up towards ethelberta by lifting the flesh of her forehead instead of troubling to raise her face altogether  not nearly so much as by staying here  but said picotee if you let lodgings wont the gentlemen and ladies know it  i have thought of that said ethelberta and this is how i shall manage  in the first place if mother is there the lodgings can be let in her name all bills will be receipted by her and all tradesmens orders will be given as from herself  then we will take no english lodgers at all we will advertise the rooms only in continental newspapers as suitable for a french or german gentleman or two and by this means there will be little danger of my acquaintance discovering that my house is not entirely a private one or of any lodger being a friend of my acquaintance  i have thought over every possible way of combining the dignified social position i must maintain to make my story telling attractive with my absolute lack of money and i can see no better one  then if gwendoline is to be your cook she must soon give notice at her present place  yes  everything depends upon gwendoline and cornelia  but there is time enough for them to give noticechristmas will be soon enough  if they cannot or will not come as cook and housemaid i am afraid the plan will break down  a vital condition is that i do not have a soul in the house beyond the lodgers who is not one of my own relations  when we have put joey into buttons he will do very well to attend to the door  but spose said joey after a glassy look at his future appearance in the position alluded to that any of your gentlepeople come to see ye and when i opens the door and lets em in a swinging big lodger stalks downstairs  what will em think  up will go their eyeglasses at one another till they glares each other into holes  my gracious  the one who calls will only think that another visitor is leaving joey but i shall have no visitors or very few  i shall let it be well known among my late friends that my mother is an invalid and that on this account we receive none but the most intimate friends  these intimate friends not existing we receive nobody at all  except sol and dan if they get a job in london  theyll have to call upon us at the back door wont they berta said joey  they must go down the area steps  but they will not mind that they like the idea  and father too must he go down the steps  he may come whichever way he likes  he will be glad enough to have us near at any price  i know that he is not at all happy at leaving you down here and he away in london  you remember that he has only taken the situation at mr doncastles on the supposition that you all come to town as soon as he can see an opening for getting you there and as nothing of the sort has offered itself to him this will be the very thing  of course if i succeed wonderfully well in my schemes for story tellings readings of my ballads and poems lectures on the art of versification and what not we need have no lodgers and then we shall all be living a happy familyall taking our share in keeping the establishment going  except poor me sighed the mother  my dear mother you will be necessary as a steadying powera flywheel in short to the concern  i wish that father could live there too  hell never give up his present way of lifeit has grown to be a part of his nature  poor man he never feels at home except in somebody elses house and is nervous and quite a stranger in his own  sich is the fatal effects of service  o mother dont said ethelberta tenderly but with her teeth on edge and picotee curled up her toes fearing that her mother was going to moralize  well what i mean is that your father would not like to live upon your earnings and so forth  but in town we shall be near himthats one comfort certainly  and i shall not be wanted at all said picotee in a melancholy tone  it is much better to stay where you are her mother said  you will come and spend the holidays with us of course as you do now  i should like to live in london best murmured picotee her head sinking mournfully to one side  i hate being in sandbourne now  nonsense said ethelberta severely  we are all contriving how to live most comfortably and it is by far the best thing for you to stay at the school  you used to be happy enough there  picotee sighed and said no more     16 a large public hall   it was the second week in february parliament had just met and ethelberta appeared for the first time before an audience in london  there was some novelty in the species of entertainment that the active young woman had proposed to herself and this doubtless had due effect in collecting the body of strangers that greeted her entry over and above those friends who came to listen to her as a matter of course  men and women who had become totally indifferent to new actresses new readers and new singers once more felt the freshness of curiosity as they considered the promise of the announcement  but the chief inducement to attend lay in the fact that here was to be seen in the flesh a woman with whom the tongue of rumour had been busy in many romantic waysa woman who whatever else might be doubted had certainly produced a volume of verses which had been the talk of the many who had read them and of the many more who had not for several consecutive weeks  what was her story to be  persons interested in the inquirya small proportion it may be owned of the whole london public and chiefly young menanswered this question for themselves by assuming that it would take the form of some pungent and gratifying revelation of the innermost events of her own life from which her gushing lines had sprung as an inevitable consequence and which being once known would cause such musical poesy to appear no longer wonderful  the front part of the room was well filled rows of listeners showing themselves like a drilledin crop of which not a seed has failed  they were listeners of the right sort a majority having noses of the prominent and dignified type which when viewed in oblique perspective ranged as regularly as bowwindows at a watering place  ethelbertas plan was to tell her pretended history and adventures while sitting in a chairas if she were at her own fireside surrounded by a circle of friends  by this touch of domesticity a great appearance of truth and naturalness was given though really the attitude was at first more difficult to maintain satisfactorily than any one wherein stricter formality should be observed  she gently began her subject as if scarcely knowing whether a throng were near her or not and in her fear of seeming artificial spoke too low  this defect however she soon corrected and ultimately went on in a charmingly colloquial manner  what ethelberta relied upon soon became evident  it was not upon the intrinsic merits of her story as a piece of construction but upon her method of telling it  whatever defects the tale possessedand they were not a fewit had as delivered by her the one preeminent merit of seeming like truth  a modern critic has well observed of de foe that he had the most amazing talent on record for telling lies and ethelberta in wishing her fiction to appear like a real narrative of personal adventure did wisely to make de foe her model  his is a style even better adapted for speaking than for writing and the peculiarities of diction which he adopts to give verisimilitude to his narratives acquired enormous additional force when exhibited as vivavoce mannerisms  and although these artifices were not perhaps slavishly copied from that master of feigning they would undoubtedly have reminded her hearers of him had they not mostly been drawn from an easeful section in society which is especially characterized by the mental condition of knowing nothing about any author a week after they have read him  the few there who did remember de foe were impressed by a fancy that his words greeted them anew in a winged auricular form instead of by the weaker channels of print and eyesight  the reader may imagine what an effect this well studied method must have produced when intensified by a clear living voice animated action and the brilliant and expressive eye of a handsome womanattributes which of themselves almost compelled belief when she reached the most telling passages instead of adding exaggerated action and sound ethelberta would lapse to a whisper and a sustained stillness which were more striking than gesticulation  all that could be done by art was there and if inspiration was wanting nobody missed it  it was in performing this feat that ethelberta seemed first to discover in herself the full power of that selfcommand which further onward in her career more and more impressed her as a singular possession until at last she was tempted to make of it many fantastic uses leading to results that affected more households than her own  a talent for demureness under difficulties without the coldbloodedness which renders such a bearing natural and easy a face and hand reigning unmoved outside a heart by nature turbulent as a wave is a constitutional arrangement much to be desired by people in general yet had ethelberta been framed with less of that gift in her her life might have been more comfortable as an experience and brighter as an example though perhaps duller as a story  ladywell how came this mrs petherwin to think of such a queer trick as telling romances after doing so well as a poet said a man in the stalls to his friend who had been gazing at the storyteller with a rapt face  whatdont you knoweverybody did i thought said the painter  a mistake  indeed i should not have come here at all had i not heard the subject mentioned by accident yesterday at greys and then i remembered her to be the same woman i had met at some placebelmaines i think it waslast year when i thought her just getting on for handsome and clever not to put it too strongly  ah naturally you would not know much replied ladywell in an eager whisper  perhaps i am judging others by myself a little more thanbut as you have heard she is an acquaintance of mine  i know her very well and in fact i originally suggested the scheme to her as a pleasant way of adding to her fame  depend upon it dear mrs petherwin i said during a pause in one of our dances together some time ago any public appearance of yours would be successful beyond description  o i had no idea that you knew her so well  then it is quite through you that she has adopted this course  well not entirelyi could not say entirely  she said that some day perhaps she might do such a thing and in short i reduced her vague ideas to form  i should not mind knowing her betteri must get you to throw us together in some way said neigh with some interest  i had no idea that you were such an old friend  you could do it i suppose  really i am afraidhahhahmay not have the opportunity of obliging you  i met her at wyndway you know where she was visiting with lady petherwin  it was some time ago and i cannot say that i have ever met her since  or before said neigh  wellno i never did  ladywell if i had half your power of going to your imagination for facts i would be the greatest painter in england  now neighthats too badbut with regard to this matter i do speak with some interest said ladywell with a pleased sense of himself  in love with hersmitten downdone for  now now  however several other fellows chaff me about her  it was only yesterday that jones said  do you know why she cares to do this sort of thing  merely a desire for fame i suppose  i should think she has fame enough already  that i can express no opinion upon  i am thinking of getting her permission to use her face in a subject i am preparing  it is a fine face for canvas  glorious contourglorious  ah here she is again for the second part  dream on young fellow  youll make a rare couple said neigh with a flavour of superciliousness unheeded by his occupied companion  further back in the room were a pair of faces whose keen interest in the performance contrasted much with the languidly permissive air of those in front  when the ten minutes break occurred christopher was the first of the two to speak  well what do you think of her faith he said shifting restlessly on his seat  i like the quiet parts of the tale best i think replied the sister but of course i am not a good judge of these things  how still the people are at times  i continually take my eyes from her to look at the listeners  did you notice the fat old lady in the second row with her cloak a little thrown back  she was absolutely unconscious and stayed with her face up and lips parted like a little child of six  she well may the thing is a triumph  that fellow ladywell is here i believeyes it is he busily talking to the man on his right  if i were a woman i would rather go donkeydriving than stick myself up there for gaping fops to quiz and say what they like about  but she had no choice poor thing for it was that or nothing with her  faith who had secret doubts about the absolute necessity of ethelbertas appearance in public said with remote meanings perhaps it is not altogether a severe punishment to her to be looked at by welldressed men  suppose she feels it as a blessing instead of an affliction  she is a different sort of woman faith and so you would say if you knew her  of course it is natural for you to criticize her severely just now and i dont wish to defend her  i think you do a little kit  no i am indifferent about it all  perhaps it would have been better for me if i had never seen her and possibly it might have been better for her if she had never seen me  she has a heart and the heart is a troublesome encumbrance when great things have to be done  i wish you knew her i am sure you would like each other  o yes said faith in a voice of rather weak conviction  but as we live in such a plain way it would be hardly desirable at present        ethelberta being regarded in common with the latest conjurer spirit medium aeronaut giant dwarf or monarch as a new sensation she was duly criticized in the morning papers and even obtained a notice in some of the weekly reviews  a handsome woman said one of these may have her own reasons for causing the flesh of the london public to creep upon its bones by her undoubtedly remarkable narrative powers but we question if much good can result from such a form of entertainment  nevertheless some praise is due  we have had the novelwriter among us for some time and the novel reader has occasionally appeared on our platforms but we believe that this is the first instance on record of a noveltellerone that is to say who relates professedly as fiction a romantic tale which has never been printedthe whole owing its chief interest to the method whereby the teller identifies herself with the leading character in the story  another observed when once we get away from the magic influence of the storytellers eye and tongue we perceive how improbable even impossible is the tissue of events to which we have been listening with so great a sense of reality and we feel almost angry with ourselves at having been the victims of such utter illusion  mrs petherwins personal appearance is decidedly in her favour said another  she affects no unconsciousness of the fact that form and feature are no mean vehicles of persuasion and she uses the powers of each to the utmost  there spreads upon her face when in repose an air of innocence which is charmingly belied by the subtlety we discover beneath it when she begins her tale and this amusing discrepancy between her physical presentment and the inner woman is further illustrated by the misgiving which seizes us on her entrance that so impressionable a lady will never bear up in the face of so trying an audience     the combinations of incident which mrs petherwin persuades her hearers that she has passed through are not a little marvellous and if what is rumoured be true that the tales are to a great extent based upon her own experiences she has proved herself to be no less daring in adventure than facile in her power of describing it     17 ethelbertas house   after such successes as these christopher could not forego the seductive intention of calling upon the poetess and romancer at her now established town residence in exonbury crescent  one wintry afternoon he reached the doornow for the third timeand gave a knock which had in it every tender refinement that could be thrown into the somewhat antagonistic vehicle of noise  turning his face down the street he waited restlessly on the step  there was a strange light in the atmosphere the glass of the streetlamps the varnished back of a passing cab a milkwomans cans and a row of churchwindows glared in his eyes like newrubbed copper and on looking the other way he beheld a bloody sun hanging among the chimneys at the upper end as a dangerlamp to warn him off  by this time the door was opened and before him stood ethelbertas young brother joey thickly populated with little buttons the remainder of him consisting of invisible green  ah joseph said christopher instantly recognizing the boy  what are you here in office  is your  joey lifted his forefinger and spread his mouth in a genial manner as if to signify particular friendliness mingled with general caution  yes sir mrs petherwin is my mistress  ill see if she is at home sir he replied raising his shoulders and winking a wink of strategic meanings by way of finishall which signs showed if evidence were wanted how effectually this pleasant young page understood though quite fresh from wessex the duties of his peculiar position  mr julian was shown to the drawingroom and there he found ethelberta alone  she gave him a hand so cool and still that christopher much as he desired the contact was literally ashamed to let her see and feel his own trembling with unmanageable excess of feeling  it was always so always had been so always would be so at these meetings of theirs she was immeasurably the strongest and the deepeyed young man fancied in the chagrin which the perception of this difference always bred in him that she triumphed in her superior control  yet it was only in little things that their sexes were thus reversed christopher would receive quite a shock if a little dog barked at his heels and be totally unmoved when in danger of his life  certainly the most selfpossessed woman in the world under pressure of the incongruity between their last meeting and the present one might have shown more embarrassment than ethelberta showed on greeting him to day  christopher was only a man in believing that the shyness which she did evince was chiefly the result of personal interest  she might or might not have been said to blushperhaps the stealthy change upon her face was too slow an operation to deserve that name but though pale when he called the end of ten minutes saw her colour high and wide  she soon set him at his ease and seemed to relax a longsustained tension as she talked to him of her arrangements hopes and fears  and how do you like london society said ethelberta  pretty well as far as i have seen it to the surface of its front door  you will find nothing to be alarmed at if you get inside  o noof course notexcept my own shortcomings said the modest musician  london society is made up of much more refined people than society anywhere else  thats a very prevalent opinion and it is nowhere half so prevalent as in london society itself  however come and see my houseunless you think it a trouble to look over a house  no i should like it very much  the decorations tended towards the artistic gymnastics prevalent in some quarters at the present day  upon a general flat tint of ducksegg green appeared quaint patterns of conventional foliage and birds done in bright auburn several shades nearer to redbreastred than was ethelbertas hair which was thus thrust further towards brown by such juxtapositiona possible reason for the choice of tint  upon the glazed tiles within the chimneypiece were the forms of owls bats snakes frogs mice spiders in their webs moles and other objects of aversion and darkness shaped in black and burnt in after the approved fashion  my brothers sol and dan did most of the actual work said ethelberta though i drew the outlines and designed the tiles round the fire  the flowers mice and spiders are done very simply you know you only press a real flower mouse or spider out flat under a piece of glass and then copy it adding a little more emaciation and angularity at pleasure  in that at pleasure is where all the art lies said he  well yesthat is the case said ethelberta thoughtfully and preceding him upstairs she threw open a door on one of the floors disclosing dan in person engaged upon a similar treatment of this floor also  sol appeared bulging from the door of a closet a little further on where he was fixing some shelves and both wore workmens blouses  at once coming down from the short ladder he was standing upon dan shook christophers hand with some velocity  we do a little at a time you see he said because colonel down below and mrs petherwins visitors shant smell the turpentine  we be pushing on today to get it out of the way said sol also coming forward and greeting their visitor but more reluctantly than his brother had done  now ill tell ye whatyou two he added after an uneasy pause turning from christopher to ethelberta and back again in great earnestness youd better not bide here talking to we rough ones you know for folks might find out that theres something closer between us than workmen and employer and employers friend  so berta and mr julian if youll go on and take no more notice o us in case of visitors it would be wiserelse perhaps if we should be found out intimate with ye and bring down your gentility youll blame us for it i get as nervous as a cat when i think i may be the cause of any disgrace to ye  dont be so silly sol said ethelberta laughing  ah thats all very well said sol with an unbelieving smile but if we baint company for you out of doors you baint company for we withinnot that i find fault with ye or mind it and shant take anything for painting your house nor will dan neither any more for thatno not a penny in fact we are glad to do it for ee  at the same time you keep to your class and well keep to ours  and so good afternoon berta when you like to go and the same to you mr julian dan is that your mind  i can but own it said dan  the two brothers then turned their backs upon their visitors and went on working and ethelberta and her lover left the room  my brothers you perceive said she represent the respectable british workman in his entirety and a touchy individual he is i assure you on points of dignity after imbibing a few town ideas from his leaders  they are painfully offhand with me absolutely refusing to be intimate from a mistaken notion that i am ashamed of their dress and manners which of course is absurd  which of course is absurd said christopher  of course it is absurd she repeated with warmth and looking keenly at him  but finding no harm in his face she continued as before yet all the time they will do anything under the sun that they think will advance my interests  in our hearts we are one  all they ask me to do is to leave them to themselves and therefore i do so  now would you like to see some more of your acquaintance  she introduced him to a large attic where he found himself in the society of two or three persons considerably below the middle height whose manners were of that gushing kind sometimes called continental their ages ranging from five years to eight  these were the youngest children presided over by emmeline as professor of letters capital and small  i am giving them the rudiments of education here said ethelberta but i foresee several difficulties in the way of keeping them here which i must get over as best i can  one trouble is that they dont get enough air and exercise  is mrs chickerel living here as well christopher ventured to inquire when they were downstairs again  yes but confined to her room as usual i regret to say  two more sisters of mine whom you have never seen at all are also here  they are older than any of the rest of us and had broadly speaking no education at all poor girls  the eldest gwendoline is my cook and cornelia is my housemaid  i suffer much sadness and almost misery sometimes in reflecting that here are we ten brothers and sisters born of one father and mother who might have mixed together and shared all in the same scenes and been properly happy if it were not for the strange accidents that have split us up into sections as you see cutting me off from them without the compensation of joining me to any others  they are all true as steel in keeping the secret of our kin certainly but that brings little joy though some satisfaction perhaps  you might be less despondent i think  the taletelling has been one of the successes of the season  yes i might but i may observe that you scarcely set the example of blitheness  ahthats not because i dont recognize the pleasure of being here  it is from a more general cause simply an underfeeling i have that at the most propitious moment the distance to the possibility of sorrow is so short that a mans spirits must not rise higher than mere cheerfulness out of bare respect to his insight        as long as skies are blue and fields are green       evening must usher night night urge the morrow    month follow month with woe and year wake year to sorrow  ethelberta bowed uncertainly the remark might refer to her past conduct or it might not  my great cause of uneasiness is the children she presently said as a new page of matter  it is my duty at all risk and all sacrifice of sentiment to educate and provide for them  the grown up ones older than myself i cannot help much but the little ones i can  i keep my two french lodgers for the sake of them  the lodgers of course dont know the relationship between yourself and the rest of the people in the house  o nonor will they ever  my mother is supposed to let the ground and first floors to mea strange ladyas she does the second and third floors to them  still i may be discovered  wellif you are  let me be  life is a battle they say but it is only so in the sense that a game of chess is a battlethere is no seriousness in it it may be put an end to at any inconvenient moment by owning yourself beaten with a careless haha and sweeping your pieces into the box experimentally i care to succeed in society but at the bottom of my heart i dont care  for that very reason you are likely to do it  my idea is make ambition your business and indifference your relaxation and you will fail but make indifference your business and ambition your relaxation and you will succeed  so impish are the ways of the gods  i hope that you at any rate will succeed she said at the end of a silence  i never canif success means getting what one wants  why should you not get that  it has been forbidden to me  her complexion changed just enough to show that she knew what he meant if you were as bold as you are subtle you would take a more cheerful view of the matter she said with a look signifying innermost things  i will instantly  shall i test the truth of my cheerful view by a word of question  i deny that you are capable of taking that view and until you prove that you are no question is allowed she said laughing and still warmer in the face and neck  nothing but melancholy gentle melancholy now as in old times when there was nothing to cause it  ahyou only tease  you will not throw aside that bitter medicine of distrust for the world  you have grown so used to it that you take it as food as some invalids do their mixtures  ethelberta you have my heartmy whole heart  you have had it ever since i first saw you  now you understand me and no pretending that you dont mind this second time  i understood you long ago you have not understood me  you are mysterious he said lightly and perhaps if i disentangle your mystery i shall find it to coverindifference  i hope it doesfor your sake  how can you say so she exclaimed reproachfully  yet i wish it did tooi wish it did cover indifferencefor yours  but you have all of me that you care to have and may keep it for life if you wish to  listen surely there was a knock at the door  let us go inside the room i am always uneasy when anybody comes lest any awkward discovery should be made by a visitor of my miserable contrivances for keeping up the establishment  joey met them before they had left the landing  please berta he whispered mr ladywell has called and ive showed him into the liberry  you know berta this is how it was you know i thought you and mr julian were in the drawingroom and wouldnt want him to see ye together and so i asked him to step into the liberry a minute  you must improve your way of speaking she said with quick embarrassment whether at the mention of ladywells name before julian or at the way joey coupled herself with christopher was quite uncertain will you excuse me for a few moments she said turning to christopher pray sit down i shall not be long  and she glided downstairs  they had been standing just by the drawingroom door and christopher turned back into the room with no very satisfactory countenance  it was very odd he thought that she should go down to ladywell in that mysterious manner when he might have been admitted to where they were talking without any trouble at all  what could ladywell have to say as an acquaintance calling upon her for a few minutes that he was not to hear  indeed if it came to that what right had ladywell to call upon her at all even though she were a widow and to some extent chartered to live in a way which might be considered a trifle free if indulged in by other young women  this was the first time that he himself had ventured into her house on that very accounta doubt whether it was quite proper to call considering her youth and the fertility of her position as ground for scandal  but no sooner did he arrive than here was ladywell blundering in and since this conjunction had occurred on his first visit the chances were that ladywell came very often  julian walked up and down the room every moment expanding itself to a minute in his impatience at the delay and vexation at the cause  after scrutinizing for the fifth time every object on the walls as if afflicted with microscopic closeness of sight his hands under his coattails and his person jigging up and down upon his toes he heard her coming up the stairs  when she entered the apartment her appearance was decidedly that of a person subsiding after some little excitement  i did not calculate upon being so long she said sweetly at the same time throwing back her face and smiling  but iwas longer than i expected  it seemed rather long said christopher gloomily but i dont mind it  i am glad of that said ethelberta  as you asked me to stay i was very pleased to do so and always should be but i think that now i will wish you goodbye  you are not vexed with me she said looking quite into his face  mr ladywell is nobody you know  nobody  well he is not much i mean  the case is that i am sitting to him for a subject in which my face is to be usedotherwise than as a portraitand he called about it  may i say said christopher that if you want yourself painted you are illadvised not to let it be done by a man who knows how to use the brush a little  o he can paint said ethelberta rather warmly  his last picture was excellent i think  it was greatly talked about  i imagined you to say that he was a mere nobody  yes buthow provoking you arenobody i mean to talk to  he is a true artist nevertheless  christopher made no reply  the warm understanding between them had quite ended now and there was no fanning it up again  sudden tiffs had been the constant misfortune of their courtship in days gone by had been the remote cause of her marriage to another and the familiar shadows seemed to be rising again to cloud them with the same persistency as ever christopher went downstairs with wellbehaved moodiness and left the house forthwith  the postman came to the door at the same time  ethelberta opened a letter from picoteenow at sandbourne again and stooping to the firelight she began to read     my dear ethelbertai have tried to like staying at sandbourne    because you wished it but i cant endure the town at all dear berta    everything is so wretched and dull  o i only wish you knew how    dismal it is here and how much i would give to come to london  i    cannot help thinking that i could do better in town  you see i    should be close to you and should have the benefit of your    experience  i would not mind what i did for a living could i be there    where you all are  it is so like banishment to be here  if i could    not get a pupilteachership in some london school and i believe i    could by advertising i could stay with you and be governess to    georgina and myrtle for i am sure you cannot spare time enough to    teach them as they ought to be taught and emmeline is not old enough    to have any command over them  i could also assist at your    dressmaking and you must require a great deal of that to be done if    you continue to appear in public  mr long read in the papers the    account of your first evening and afterwards i heard two ladies of    our committee talking about it but of course not one of them knew my    personal interest in the discussion  now will you ethelberta think    if i may not come do theres a dear sister  i will do anything you    set me about if i may only comeyour ever affectionate    picotee  great powers abovewhat worries do beset me cried ethelberta jumping up  what can possess the child so suddenlyshe used to like sandbourne well enough  she sat down and hastily scribbled the following reply     my dear picoteethere is only a little time to spare before the post    goes but i will try to answer your letter at once  whatever is the    reason of this extraordinary dislike to sandbourne  it is a nice    healthy place and you are likely to do much better than either of our    elder sisters if you follow straight on in the path you have chosen    of course if such good fortune should attend me that i get rich by my    contrivances of public storytelling and so on i shall share    everything with you and the rest of us in which case you shall not    work at all  but although i have been unexpectedly successful so    far this is problematical and it would be rash to calculate upon all    of us being able to live or even us seven girls only upon the    fortune i am going to make that way  so though i dont mean to be    harsh i must impress upon you the necessity of going on as you are    going just at present  i know the place must be dull but we must all    put up with dulness sometimes  you being next to me in age must aid    me as well as you can in doing something for the younger ones and if    anybody at all comes and lives here otherwise than as a servant it    must be our fatherwho will not however at present hear of such a    thing when i mention it to him  do think of all this picotee and    bear up  perhaps we shall all be happy and united some day  joey is    waiting to run to the postoffice with this at once  all are well    sol and dan have nearly finished the repairs and decorations of my    housebut i will tell you of that another timeyour affectionate    sister                 berta     18 near sandbournelondon streetsethelbertas   when this letter reached its destination the next morning picotee in her overanxiety could not bring herself to read it in anybodys presence and put it in her pocket till she was on her walk across the moor  she still lived at the cottage out of the town though at some inconvenience to herself in order to teach at a small village nightschool whilst still carrying on her larger occupation of pupilteacher in sandbourne  so she walked and read and was soon in tears  moreover when she thought of what ethelberta would have replied had that keen sister known the wildness of her true reason in wishing to go she shuddered with misery  to wish to get near a man only because he had been kind to her and had admired her pretty face and had given her flowers to nourish a passion all the more because of its hopeless impracticability were things to dream of not to tell  picotee was quite an unreasoning animal  her sister arranged situations for her told her how to conduct herself in them how to make up anew in unobtrusive shapes the valuable wearing apparel she sent from time to timeso as to provoke neither exasperation in the little gentry nor superciliousness in the great ethelberta did everything for her in short and picotee obeyed orders with the abstracted ease of mind which people show who have their thinking done for them and put out their troubles as they do their washing  she was quite willing not to be clever herself since it was unnecessary while she had a muchadmired sister who was clever enough for two people and to spare  this arrangement by which she gained an untroubled existence in exchange for freedom of will had worked very pleasantly for picotee until the anomaly of falling in love on her own account created a jar in the machinery  then she began to know how wearing were miserable days and how much more wearing were miserable nights  she pictured christopher in london calling upon her dignified sister for ethelberta innocently mentioned his name sometimes in writing and imagined over and over again the mutual signs of warm feeling between them  and now picotee resolved upon a noble course  like juliet she had been troubled with a consciousness that perhaps her love for christopher was a trifle forward and unmaidenly even though she had determined never to let him or anybody in the whole world know of it  to set herself to pray that she might have strength to see him without a pang the lover of her sister who deserved him so much more than herself would be a grand penance and corrective  after uttering petitions to this effect for several days she still felt very bad indeed in the psychological difficulty of striving for what in her soul she did not desire rather worse if anything  at last weary of walking the old road and never meeting him and blank in a general powerlessness she wrote the letter to ethelberta which was only the last one of a series that had previously been written and torn up  now this hope had been whirled away like thistledown and the case was grievous enough to distract a greater stoic than picotee  the end of it was that she left the school on insufficient notice gave up her cottage home on the pleatrue in the letterthat she was going to join a relative in london and went off thither by a morning train leaving her things packed ready to be sent on when she should write for them  picotee arrived in town late on a cold february afternoon bearing a small bag in her hand  she crossed westminster bridge on foot just after dusk and saw a luminous haze hanging over each welllighted street as it withdrew into distance behind the nearer houses showing its direction as a train of morning mist shows the course of a distant stream when the stream itself is hidden  the lights along the riverside towards charing cross sent an inverted palisade of gleaming swords down into the shaking water and the pavement ticked to the touch of pedestrians feet most of whom tripped along as if walking only to practise a favourite quick step and held handkerchiefs to their mouths to strain off the river mist from their lungs  she inquired her way to exonbury crescent and between five and six oclock reached her sisters door  two or three minutes were passed in accumulating resolution sufficient to ring the bell which when at last she did was not performed in a way at all calculated to make the young man joey hasten to the door  after the lapse of a certain time he did however find leisure to stroll and see what the caller might want out of curiosity to know who there could be in london afraid to ring a bell twice  joeys delight exceeded even his surprise the ruling maxim of his life being the more the merrier under all circumstances  the beaming young man was about to run off and announce her upstairs and downstairs left and right when picotee called him hastily to her  in the hall her quick young eye had caught sight of an umbrella with a peculiar horn handlean umbrella she had been accustomed to meet on sandbourne moor on many happy afternoons  christopher was evidently in the house  joey she said as if she were ready to faint dont tell berta i am come  she has company has she not  o noonly mr julian said the brother  hes quite one of the family  never mindcant i go down into the kitchen with you she inquired there had been bliss and misery mingled in those tidings and she scarcely knew for a moment which way they affected her  what she did know was that she had run her dear fox to earth and a sense of satisfaction at that feat prevented her just now from counting the cost of the performance  does mr julian come to see her very often said she  o yeshes always acominga regular bore to me  a regular what  boreah i forgot you dont know our town words  however come along  they passed by the doors on tiptoe and their mother upstairs being according to joeys account in the midst of a nap picotee was unwilling to disturb her so they went down at once to the kitchen when forward rushed gwendoline the cook flourishing her floury hands and cornelia the housemaid dancing over her brush and these having welcomed and made picotee comfortable who should ring the areabell and be admitted down the steps but sol and dan  the workmanbrothers their days duties being over had called to see their relations first as usual going home to their lodgings in marylebone and making themselves as spruce as bridegrooms according to the rules of their newlyacquired town experience  for the london mechanic is only nine hours a mechanic though the country mechanic works eats drinks and sleeps a mechanic throughout the whole twentyfour  god bless my soulpicotee said dan standing fixed  welli say this is splendid haha  picoteewhat brought you here said sol expanding the circumference of his face in satisfaction  well come alongnever mind so long as you be here  picotee explained circumstances as well as she could without stating them and after a general conversation of a few minutes sol interrupted withanybody upstairs with mrs petherwin  mr julian was there just now said joey but he may be gone  berta always lets him slip out how he can the form of ringing me up not being necessary with him  wait a minuteill see  joseph vanished up the stairs and the question whether christopher were gone or not being an uninteresting one to the majority the talking went on upon other matters  when joey crept down again a minute later picotee was sitting aloof and silent and he accordingly singled her out to speak to  such a lark picotee he whispered  bertas acourting of her young man  would you like to see how they carries on a bit  dearly i should said picotee the pupils of her eyes dilating  joey conducted her to the top of the basement stairs and told her to listen  within a few yards of them was the morningroom door now standing ajar and an intermittent flirtation in soft male and female tones could be heard going on inside  picotees lips parted at thus learning the condition of things and she leant against the stairnewel  my  whats the matter said joey  if this is london i dont like it at all moaned picotee  welli never see such a girlfainting all over the stairs for nothing in the world  oit will soon be goneit isit is only indigestion  indigestion  much you simple country people can know about that  you should see what devils of indigestions we get in high lifeeating normous great dinners and suppers that require clever physicians to carry em off or else theyd carry us off with gout next day and waking in the morning with such a splitting headache and dry throat and inward cusses about human nature that you feel all the world like some great lord  however now lets go down again  no no no said the unhappy maiden imploringly  hark  they listened again  the voices of the musician and poetess had changed there was a decided frigidity in their tonethen came a louder expressionthen a silence  you neednt be afeard said joey  they wont fight bless you they busts out quarrelling like this times and times when theyve been over friendly but it soon gets straight with em again  there was now a quick walk across the room and joey and his sister drew down their heads out of sight  then the room door was slammed quick footsteps went along the hall the front door closed just as loudly and christophers tread passed into nothing along the pavement  thats rather a wuss one than they mostly have but lord tis nothing at all  i dont much like biding here listening said picotee  o tis how we do all over the west end said joey  tis yer ignorance of town life that makes it seem a good deal to ee  you cant make much boast about town life for you havent left off talking just as they do down in wessex  well i own to thatwhats fair is fair and tis a true charge but if i talk the wessex way tisnt for want of knowing better tis because my staunch nater makes me bide faithful to our old ancient institutions youd soon own twasnt ignorance in me if you knowed what large quantities of noblemen i gets mixed up with every day  in fact tis thoughted here and there that i shall do very well in the world  well let us go down said picotee  everything seems so overpowering here  o youll get broke in soon enough  i felt just the same when i first entered into society  do you think berta will be angry with me  how does she treat you  well i cant complain  you see shes my own flesh and blood and what can i say  but in secret truth the wages is terrible low and barely pays for the tobacco i consooms  o joey you wicked boy  if mother only knew that you smoked  i dont mind the wickedness so much as the smell  and mrs petherwin has got such a nose for a fellows clothes  tis one of the greatest knots in servicethe smoke question  tis thoughted that we shall make a great stir about it in the mansions of the nobility soon  how much more you know of life than i doyou only fourteen and me seventeen  yes thats true  you see age is nothingtis opportunity  and even i cant boast for many a younger man knows more  but dont smoke joeytheres a dear  what can i do  society hev its rules and if a person wishes to keep himself up he must do as the world do  we be all fashions slaveas much a slave as the meanest in the land  they got downstairs again and when the dinner of the french lady and gentleman had been sent up and cleared away and also ethelbertas evening tea which she formed into a genuine meal making a dinner of luncheon when nobody was there to give less trouble to her servantsisters they all sat round the fire  then the rustle of a dress was heard on the staircase and squirrelhaired ethelberta appeared in person  it was her custom thus to come down every spare evening to teach joey and her sisters something or othermostly french which she spoke fluently but the cook and housemaid showed more ambition than intelligence in acquiring that tongue though joey learnt it readily enough  there was consternation in the camp for a moment or two on account of poor picotee ethelberta being not without firmness in matters of discipline  her eye instantly lighted upon her disobedient sister now looking twice as disobedient as she really was  o you are here picotee  i am glad to see you said the mistress of the house quietly  this was altogether to picotees surprise for she had expected a round rating at least in her freshness hardly being aware that this reserve of feeling was an acquired habit of ethelbertas and that civility stood in town for as much vexation as a tantrum represented in wessex  picotee lamely explained her outward reasons for coming and soon began to find that ethelbertas opinions on the matter would not be known by the tones of her voice  but innocent picotee was as wily as a religionist in sly elusions of the letter whilst infringing the spirit of a dictum and by talking very softly and earnestly about the wondrous good she could do by remaining in the house as governess to the children and playing the part of ladysmaid to her sister at show times she so far coaxed ethelberta out of her intentions that she almost accepted the plan as a good one  it was agreed that for the present at any rate picotee should remain  then a visit was made to mrs chickerels room where the remainder of the evening was passed and harmony reigned in the household     19 ethelbertas drawingroom   picotees heart was fitfully glad  she was near the man who had enlarged her capacity from girls to womans a little note or two of young feeling to a whole diapason and though nearness was perhaps not in itself a great reason for felicity when viewed beside the complete realization of all that a woman can desire in such circumstances it was much in comparison with the outer darkness of the previous time  it became evident to all the family that some misunderstanding had arisen between ethelberta and mr julian  what picotee hoped in the centre of her heart as to the issue of the affair it would be too complex a thing to say  if christopher became cold towards her sister he would not come to the house if he continued to come it would really be as ethelbertas loveraltogether a pretty game of perpetual check for picotee  he did not make his appearance for several days  picotee being a presentable girl and decidedly finernatured than her sisters below stairs was allowed to sit occasionally with ethelberta in the afternoon when the teaching of the little ones had been done for the day and thus she had an opportunity of observing ethelbertas emotional condition with reference to christopher which picotee did with an interest that the elder sister was very far from suspecting  at first ethelberta seemed blithe enough without him  one more day went and he did not come and then her manner was that of apathy  another day passed and from fanciful elevations of the eyebrow and long breathings it became apparent that ethelberta had decidedly passed the indifferent stage and was getting seriously out of sorts about him  next morning she looked all hope  he did not come that day either and ethelberta began to look pale with fear  why dont you go out said picotee timidly  i can hardly tell i have been expecting some one  when she comes i must run up to mother at once must i not said clever picotee  it is not a lady said ethelberta blandly  she came then and stood by picotee and looked musingly out of the window  i may as well tell you perhaps she continued  it is mr julian  he isi supposemy lover in plain english  ah said picotee  whom i am not going to marry until he gets rich  ahhow strange  if i had himsuch a lover i meani would marry him if he continued poor  i dont doubt it picotee just as you come to london without caring about consequences or would do any other crazy thing and not mind in the least what came of it  but somebody in the family must take a practical view of affairs or we should all go to the dogs  picotee recovered from the snubbing which she felt that she deserved and charged gallantly by saying with delicate showings of indifference do you love this mr whatshisname of yours  mr julian  o hes a very gentlemanly man  that is except when he is rude and illuses me and will not come and apologize  if i had hima lover i would ask him to come if i wanted him to  ethelberta did not give her mind to this remark but drawing a long breath said with a pouting laugh which presaged unreality the idea of his getting indifferent now  i have been intending to keep him on until i got tired of his attentions and then put an end to them by marrying him but here is he before he has hardly declared himself forgetting my existence as much as if he had vowed to love and cherish me for life  tis an unnatural inversion of the manners of society  when did you first get to care for him dear berta  owhen i had seen him once or twice  goodnesshow quick you were  yesif i am in the mind for loving i am not to be hindered by shortness of acquaintanceship  nor i neither sighed picotee  nor any other woman  we dont need to know a man well in order to love him  thats only necessary when we want to leave off  o bertayou dont believe that  if a woman did not invariably form an opinion of her choice before she has half seen him and love him before she has half formed an opinion there would be no tears and pining in the whole feminine world and poets would starve for want of a topic  i dont believe it do you say  ah well we shall see  picotee did not know what to say to this and ethelberta left the room to see about her duties as public storyteller in which capacity she had undertaken to appear again this very evening     20 the neighbourhood of the hallthe road home   london was illuminated by the broad full moon  the pavements looked white as if mantled with snow ordinary houses were sublimated to the rank of public buildings public buildings to palaces and the faces of women walking the streets to those of calendared saints and guardianangels by the pure bleaching light from the sky  in the quiet little street where opened the private door of the hall chosen by ethelberta for her storytelling a brougham was waiting  the time was about eleven oclock and presently a lady came out from the building the moonbeams forthwith flooding her face which they showed to be that of the storyteller herself  she hastened across to the carriage when a second thought arrested her motion telling the manservant and a woman inside the brougham to wait for her she wrapped up her features and glided round to the front of the house where she paused to observe the carriages and cabs driving up to receive the fashionable crowd stepping down from the doors  standing here in the throng which her own talent and ingenuity had drawn together she appeared to enjoy herself by listening for a minute or two to the names of several persons of more or less distinction as they were called out and then regarded attentively the faces of others of lesser degree to scrutinize the latter was as the event proved the real object of the journey from round the corner  when nearly every one had left the doors she turned back disappointed  ethelberta had been fancying that her alienated lover christopher was in the back rows tonight but as far as could now be observed the hopeful supposition was a false one  when she got round to the back again a man came forward  it was ladywell whom she had spoken to already that evening  allow me to bring you your notebook mrs petherwin i think you had forgotten it he said  i assure you that nobody has handled it but myself  ethelberta thanked him and took the book  i use it to look into between the parts in case my memory should fail me she explained  i remember that i did lay it down now you remind me  ladywell had apparently more to say and moved by her side towards the carriage but she declined the arm he offered and said not another word till he went on haltingly  your triumph tonight was very great and it was as much a triumph to me as to you i cannot express my feelingi cannot say half that i would if i might only  thank you much said ethelberta with dignity  thank you for bringing my book but i must go home now  i know that you will see that it is not necessary for us to be talking here  yesyou are quite right said the repressed young painter struck by her seriousness  blame me i ought to have known better  but perhaps a manwell i will say ita lover without indiscretion is no lover at all  circumspection and devotion are a contradiction in terms  i saw that and hoped that i might speak without real harm  you calculated how to be uncalculating and are natural by art she said with the slightest accent of sarcasm  but pray do not attend me furtherit is not at all necessary or desirable  my maid is in the carriage  she bowed turned and entered the vehicle seating herself beside picotee  it was harsh said ladywell to himself as he looked after the retreating carriage  i was a fool but it was harsh  yet what man on earth likes a woman to show too great a readiness at first  she is right she would be nothing without repulse  and he moved away in an opposite direction  what man was that said picotee as they drove along  oa mere mr ladywell a painter of good family to whom i have been sitting for what he calls an idealization  he is a dreadful simpleton  why did you choose him  i did not he chose me  but his silliness of behaviour is a hopeful sign for the picture  i have seldom known a man cunning with his brush who was not simple with his tongue or indeed any skill in particular that was not allied to general stupidity  your own skill is not like that is it berta  in menin men  i dont mean in women  how childish you are  the slight depression at finding that christopher was not present which had followed ethelbertas public triumph that evening was covered over if not removed by ladywells declaration and she reached home serene in spirit  that she had not the slightest notion of accepting the impulsive painter made little difference a lovers arguments being apt to affect a ladys mood as much by measure as by weight  a useless declaration like a rare china teacup with a hole in it has its ornamental value in enlarging a collection  no sooner had they entered the house than mr julians card was discovered and joey informed them that he had come particularly to speak with ethelberta quite forgetting that it was her evening for taletelling  this was real delight for between her excitements ethelberta had been seriously sickhearted at the horrible possibility of his never calling again  but alas for christopher  there being nothing like a dead silence for getting ones offhand sweetheart into a corner there is nothing like prematurely ending it for getting into that corner ones self  now wont i punish him for daring to stay away so long she exclaimed as soon as she got upstairs  it is as bad to show constancy in your manners as fickleness in your heart at such a time as this  but i thought honesty was the best policy said picotee  so it is for the mans purpose  but dont you go believing in sayings picotee they are all made by men for their own advantages  women who use public proverbs as a guide through events are those who have not ingenuity enough to make private ones as each event occurs  she sat down and rapidly wrote a line to mr julian     exonbury crescent     i return from mayfair hall to find you have called  you will i    know be good enough to forgive my saying what seems an unfriendly    thing when i assure you that the circumstances of my peculiar    situation make it desirable if not necessary  it is that i beg you    not to give me the pleasure of a visit from you for some little time    for unhappily the frequency of your kind calls has been noticed and i    am now in fear that we may be talked aboutinvidiouslyto the injury    of us both  the town or a section of it has turned its bullseye    upon me with a brightness which i did not in the least anticipate and    you will i am sure perceive how indispensable it is that i should be    circumspectyours sincerely     e petherwin     21 a streetneighs roomschristophers rooms   as soon as ethelberta had driven off from the hall ladywell turned back again and passing the front entrance overtook his acquaintance mr neigh who had been one of the last to emerge  the two were going in the same direction and they walked a short distance together  has anything serious happened said neigh noticing an abstraction in his companion  you dont seem in your usual mood tonight  o it is only that affair between us said ladywell  affair  between you and whom  her and myself of course  it will be in every fellows mouth now i suppose  butnot anything between yourself and mrs petherwin  a mere nothing  but surely you started neigh when you suspected it just this moment  noyou merely fancied that  did she not speak well tonight  you were in the room i believe  yes i just turned in for halfanhour it seems that everybody does so i thought i must  but i had no idea that you were feeble that way  it is very kind of you neighupon my word it isvery kind and of course i appreciate the delicacy whichwhich  whats kind  i mean your wellintentioned plan for making me believe that nothing is known of this  but stories will of course get wind and if our attachment has made more noise in the world than i intended it should and causes any public interest whyhahait must  there is some little romance in it perhaps and people will talk of matters of that sort between individuals of any reputelittle as that is with one of the pair  of course they willof course  you are a rising man remember whom some day the world will delight to honour  thank you for that neigh  thank you sincerely  not at all  it is merely justice to say it and one must he generous to deserve thanks  hahathats very nicely put and undeserved i am sure  and yet i need a word of that sort sometimes  genius is proverbially modest  pray dont neighi dont deserve it indeed  of course it is well meant in you to recognize any slight powers but i dont deserve it certainly my selfassurance was never too great  tis the misfortune of all children of art that they should be so dependent upon any scraps of praise they can pick up to help them along  and when that child gets so deep in love that you can only see the whites of his eyes  ahnow neighdont i say  but why did  why did i love her  yes why did you love her  ah if i could only turn selfvivisector and watch the operation of my heart i should know  my dear fellow you must be very bad indeed to talk like that  a poet himself couldnt be cleaner gone  now dont chaff neigh do anything but dont chaff  you know that i am the easiest man in the world for taking it at most times  but i cant stand it now i dont feel up to it  a glimpse of paradise and then perdition  what would you do neigh  she has refused you then  wellnot positively refused me but it is so near it that a dull man couldnt tell the difference  i hardly can myself  how do you really stand with her said neigh with an anxiety illconcealed  off and onneither one thing nor the other  i was determined to make an effort the last time she sat to me and so i met her quite coolly and spoke only of technicalities with a forced smileyou know that way of mine for drawing people out eh neigh  quite quite  a forced smile as much as to say i am obliged to entertain you but as a mere model for art purposes  but the deuce a bit did she care  and then i frequently looked to see what time it was as the end of the sitting drew nearrather a rude thing to do as a rule  of course  but that was your finesse  hahacapital  yet why not struggle against such slavery  it is regularly pulling you down  whats a womans beauty after all  well you may say so  a thing easier to feel than define murmured ladywell  but its no use neighi cant help it as long as she repulses me so exquisitely  if she would only care for me a little i might get to trouble less about her  and love her no more than one ordinarily does a girl by the time one gets irrevocably engaged to her  but i suppose she keeps you back so thoroughly that you carry on the old adoration with as much vigour as if it were a new fancy every time  partly yes and partly no  its very true and its not true  tis to be hoped she wont hate you outright for then you would absolutely die of idolizing her  dont neighstill theres some truth in itsuch is the perversity of our hearts  fancy marrying such a woman  we should feel as eternally united to her after years and years of marriage as to a dear new angel met at last nights dance  exactlyjust what i should have said  but did i hear you say we neigh  you didnt say we should feel  say weyesof courseputting myself in your place just in the way of speaking you know  of course of course but one is such a fool at these times that one seems to detect rivalry in every trumpery sound  were you never a little touched  not i  my heart is in the happy position of a country which has no history or debt  i suppose i should rejoice to hear it said ladywell  but the consciousness of a fellowsufferer being in just such another hole is such a relief always and softens the sense of ones folly so very much  theres less christianity in that sentiment than in your confessing to it old fellow  i know the truth of it nevertheless and thats why married men advise others to marry  were all the world tied up the pleasantly tied ones would be equivalent to those at present free  but what if your fellowsufferer is not only in another such a hole but in the same one  no neighnever  dont trifle with a friend who  that is refused like yourself as well as in love  ah thanks thanks  it suddenly occurred to me that we might be dead against one another as rivals and a friendship of many longdays be snapped like alike a reed  nonoonly a jest said neigh with a strangely accelerated speech lovemaking is an ornamental pursuit that matteroffact fellows like me are quite unfit for  a man must have courted at least halfadozen women before hes a match for one and since triumph lies so far ahead i shall keep out of the contest altogether  your life would be pleasanter if you were engaged  it is a nice thing after all  it is  the worst of it would be that when the time came for breaking it off a fellow might get into an action for breachwomen are so fond of that sort of thing now and i hate loveaffairs that dont end peaceably  but end it by peaceably marrying my dear fellow  it would seem so singular  besides i have a horror of antiquity and you see as long as a man keeps single he belongs in a measure to the rising generation however old he may be but as soon as he marries and has children he belongs to the last generation however young he may be old joness son is a deal younger than young browns father though they are both the same age  at any rate honest courtship cures a man of many evils he had no power to stem before  by substituting an incurable matrimony  ahtwo persons must have a mind for that before it can happen said ladywell sorrowfully shaking his head  i think youll find that if one has a mind for it it will be quite sufficient  but here we are at my rooms  come in for halfanhour  not tonight thanks  they parted and neigh went in  when he got upstairs he murmured in his deepest chest note o lords that i should come to this  but i shall never be such a fool as to marry her  what a flat that poor young devil was not to discover that we were tarred with the same brush  o the deuce the deuce he continued walking about the room as if passionately stamping but not quite doing it because another man had rooms below  neigh drew from his pocketbook an envelope embossed with the name of a fashionable photographer and out of this pulled a portrait of the lady who had in fact enslaved his secret self equally with his frank young friend the painter  after contemplating it awhile with a face of cynical adoration he murmured shaking his head ah my lady if you only knew this i should be snapped up like a snail  not a minutes peace for me till i had married you  i wonder if i shalli wonder  neigh was a man of fiveandthirtyladywells senior by ten years and being of a phlegmatic temperament he had glided thus far through the period of eligibility with impunity  he knew as well as any man how far he could go with a woman and yet keep clear of having to meet her in church without her bonnet but it is doubtful if his mind that night were less disturbed with the question how to guide himself out of the natural course which his passion for ethelberta might tempt him into than was ladywells by his ardent wish to secure her        about the time at which neigh and ladywell parted company christopher julian was entering his little place in bloomsbury  the quaint figure of faith in her bonnet and cloak was kneeling on the hearthrug endeavouring to stir a dull fire into a bright one  whatfaith you have never been out alone he said  faiths soft quickshutting eyes looked unutterable things and she replied i have been to hear mrs petherwins storytelling again  and walked all the way home through the streets at this time of night i suppose  well nobody molested me either going or coming back  faith i gave you strict orders not to go into the streets after two oclock in the day and now here you are taking no notice of what i say at all  the truth is kit i wanted to see with my spectacles what this woman was really like and i went without them last time  i slipped in behind and nobody saw me  i dont think much of her after what i have seen tonight said christopher moodily recurring to a previous thought  why what is the matter  i thought i would call on her this afternoon but when i got there i found she had left early for the performance  so in the evening when i thought it would be all over i went to the private door of the hall to speak to her as she came out and ask her flatly a question or two which i was fool enough to think i must ask her before i went to bed  just as i was drawing near she came out and instead of getting into the brougham that was waiting for her she went round the corner  when she came back a man met her and gave her something and they stayed talking together two or three minutes  the meeting may certainly not have been intentional on her part but she has no business to be going on so coolly whenwhenin fact i have come to the conclusion that a womans affection is not worth having  the only feeling which has any dignity or permanence or worth is family affection between close bloodrelations  and yet you snub me sometimes mr kit  and for the matter of that you snub me  still you know what i meantheres none of that offandon humbug between us  if we grumble with one another we are united just the same if we dont write when we are parted we are just the same when we meetthere has been some rational reason for silence but as for lovers and sweethearts there is nothing worth a rush in what they feel  faith said nothing in reply to this  the opinions she had formed upon the wisdom of her brothers pursuit of ethelberta would have come just then with an ill grace  it must however have been evident to christopher had he not been too preoccupied for observation that faiths impressions of ethelberta were not quite favourable as regarded her womanhood notwithstanding that she greatly admired her talents     22 ethelbertas house   ethelberta came indoors one day from the university boatrace and sat down without speaking beside picotee as if lost in thought  did you enjoy the sight said picotee  i scarcely know  we couldnt see at all from mrs belmaines carriage so two of usvery rashlyagreed to get out and be rowed across to the other side where the people were quite few  but when the boatman had us in the middle of the river he declared he couldnt land us on the other side because of the barges so there we were in a dreadful statetossed up and down like corks upon great waves made by steamers till i made up my mind for a drowning  well at last we got back again but couldnt reach the carriage for the crowd and i dont know what we should have done if a gentleman hadnt comesent by mrs belmaine who was in a great fright about us then he was introduced to me andi wonder how it will end  was there anything so wonderful in the beginning then  yes  one of the coolest and most practised men in london was illmannered towards me from sheer absence of mindand could there be higher flattery  when a man of that sort does not give you the politeness you deserve it means that in his heart he is rebelling against another feeling which his pride suggests that you do not deserve o i forgot to say that he is a mr neigh a nephew of mr doncastles who lives at ease about piccadilly and pall mall and has a few acres somewherebut i dont know much of him  the worst of my position now is that i excite this superficial interest in many people and a deep friendship in nobody  if what all my supporters feel could be collected into the hearts of two or three they would love me better than they love themselves but now it pervades all and operates in none  but it must operate in this gentleman  well yesjust for the present  but men in town have so many contrivances for getting out of love that you cant calculate upon keeping them in for two days together  however it is all the same to me  theres onlybut let that be  what is there only said picotee coaxingly  only one man murmured ethelberta in much lower tones  i mean whose wife i should care to be and the very qualities i like in him will i fear prevent his ever being in a position to ask me  is he the man you punished the week before last by forbidding him to come  perhaps he is but he does not want civility from me  where theres much feeling theres little ceremony  it certainly seems that he does not want civility from you to make him attentive to you said picotee stifling a sigh for here is a letter in his handwriting i believe  you might have given it to me at once said ethelberta opening the envelope hastily  it contained very few sentences they were to the effect that christopher had received her letter forbidding him to call that he had therefore at first resolved not to call or even see her more since he had become such a shadow in her path  still as it was always best to do nothing hastily he had on second thoughts decided to ask her to grant him a last special favour and see him again just once for a few minutes only that afternoon in which he might at least say farewell to avoid all possibility of compromising her in anybodys eyes he would call at halfpast six when other callers were likely to be gone knowing that from the peculiar constitution of the household the hour would not interfere with her arrangements  there being no time for an answer he would assume that she would see him and keep the engagement the request being one which could not rationally be objected to  thereread it said ethelberta with glad displeasure  did you ever hear such audacity  fixing a time so soon that i cannot reply and thus making capital out of a pretended necessity when it is really an arbitrary arrangement of his own  thats real rebellionforcing himself into my house when i said strictly he was not to come and then that it cannot rationally be objected toi dont like his rationally  where theres much love theres little ceremony didnt you say just now observed innocent picotee  and where theres little love no ceremony at all  these manners of his are dreadful and i believe he will never improve  it makes you care not a bit about him does it not berta said picotee hopefully  i dont answer for that said ethelberta  i feel as many others do that a want of ceremony which is produced by abstraction of mind is no defect in a poet or musician fatal as it may be to an ordinary man  mighty me you soon forgive him  picotee dont you be so quick to speak  before i have finished how do you know what i am going to say  ill never tell you anything again if you take me up so  of course i am going to punish him at once and make him remember that i am a lady even if i do like him a little  how do you mean to punish him said picotee with interest  by writing and telling him that on no account is he to come  but there is not time for a letter  that doesnt matter  it will show him that i did not mean him to come  at hearing the very merciful nature of the punishment picotee sighed without replying and ethelberta despatched her note  the hour of appointment drew near and ethelberta showed symptoms of unrest  six oclock struck and passed  she walked here and there for nothing and it was plain that a dread was filling her her letter might accidentally have had in addition to the moral effect which she had intended the practical effect which she did not intend by arriving before instead of after his purposed visit to her thereby stopping him in spite of all her care  how long are letters going to bloomsbury she said suddenly  two hours joey tells me replied picotee who had already inquired on her own private account  there exclaimed ethelberta petulantly  how i dislike a man to misrepresent things  he said there was not time for a reply  perhaps he didnt know said picotee in angel tones and so it happens all right and he has got it and he will not come after all  they waited and waited but christopher did not appear that night the true case being that his declaration about insufficient time for a reply was merely an ingenious suggestion to her not to be so cruel as to forbid him  he was far from suspecting when the letter of denial did reach himabout an hour before the time of appointmentthat it was sent by a refinement of art of which the real intention was futility and that but for his own misstatement it would have been carefully delayed  the next day another letter came from the musician decidedly short and to the point  the irate lover stated that he would not be made a fool of any longer under any circumstances he meant to come that selfsame afternoon and should decidedly expect her to see him  i will not see him said ethelberta  why did he not call last night  because you told him not to said picotee  good gracious as if a womans words are to be translated as literally as homer  surely he is aware that more often than not no is said to a mans importunities because it is traditionally the correct modest reply and for nothing else in the world  if all men took words as superficially as he does we should die of decorum in shoals  ah berta how could you write a letter that you did not mean should be obeyed  i did in a measure mean it although i could have shown christian forgiveness if it had not been  never mind i will not see him  ill plague my heart for the credit of my sex  to ensure the fulfilment of this resolve ethelberta determined to give way to a headache that she was beginning to be aware of go to her room disorganize her dress and ruin her hair by lying down so putting it out of her power to descend and meet christopher on any momentary impulse  picotee sat in the room with her reading or pretending to read and ethelberta pretended to sleep  christophers knock came up the stairs and with it the end of the farce  ill tell you what said ethelberta in the prompt and broadlyawake tone of one who had been concentrated on the expectation of that sound for a length of time it was a mistake in me to do this  joey will be sure to make a muddle of it  joey was heard coming up the stairs  picotee opened the door and said with an anxiety transcending ethelbertas well  o will you tell mrs petherwin that mr julian says hell wait  you were not to ask him to wait said ethelberta within  i know that said joey and i didnt  hes doing that out of his own head  then let mr julian wait by all means said ethelberta  allow him to wait if he likes but tell him it is uncertain if i shall be able to come down  joey then retired and the two sisters remained in silence  i wonder if hes gone ethelberta said at the end of a long time  i thought you were asleep said picotee  shall we ask joey  i have not heard the door close  joey was summoned and after a leisurely ascent interspersed by various gymnastic performances over the handrail here and there appeared again  hes there jest the same he dont seem to be in no hurry at all said joey  what is he doing inquired picotee solicitously  o only looking at his watch sometimes and humming tunes and playing ratatattat upon the table  he says he dont mind waiting a bit  you must have made a mistake in the message said ethelberta within  well no  i am correct as a jineral thing  i jest said perhaps you would be engaged all the evening and perhaps you wouldnt  when joey had again retired and they had waited another ten minutes ethelberta said picotee do you go down and speak a few words to him  i am determined he shall not see me  you know him a little you remember when he came to the lodge  what must i say to him  ethelberta paused before replying  try to find out ifif he is much grieved at not seeing me and saygive him to understand that i will forgive him picotee  very well  and picotee  yes  if he says he must see mei think i will get up  but only if he says must you remember that  picotee departed on her errand  she paused on the staircase trembling and thinking between the thrills how very far would have been the conduct of her poor slighted self from proud recalcitration had mr julians gentle request been addressed to her instead of to ethelberta and she went some way in the painful discovery of how much more tantalizing it was to watch an envied situation that was held by another than to be out of sight of it altogether  here was christopher waiting to bestow love and ethelberta not going down to receive it a commodity unequalled in value by any other in the whole wide world was being wantonly wasted within that very house  if she could only have stood tonight as the beloved ethelberta and not as the despised picotee how different would be this going down  thus she went along red and pale moving in her cheeks as in the northern lights at their strongest time  meanwhile christopher had sat waiting minute by minute till the evening shades grew browner and the fire sank low  joey finding himself not particularly wanted upon the premises after the second inquiry had slipped out to witness a nigger performance round the corner and julian began to think himself forgotten by all the household  the perception gradually cooled his emotions and enabled him to hold his hat quite steadily  when picotee gently thrust open the door she was surprised to find the room in darkness the fire gone completely out and the form of christopher only visible by a faint patch of light which coming from a lamp on the opposite side of the way and falling upon the mirror was thrown as a pale nebulosity upon his shoulder  picotee was too flurried at sight of the familiar outline to know what to do and instead of going or calling for a light she mechanically advanced into the room christopher did not turn or move in any way and then she perceived that he had begun to doze in his chair  instantly with the precipitancy of the timorous she said mr julian and touched him on the shouldermurmuring then o i beg pardon ii will get a light  christophers consciousness returned and his first act before rising was to exclaim in a confused manner ahyou have comethank you berta then impulsively to seize her hand as it hung beside his head and kiss it passionately  he stood up still holding her fingers  picotee gasped out something but was completely deprived of articulate utterance and in another moment being unable to control herself at this sort of first meeting with the man she had gone through fire and water to be near and more particularly by the overpowering kiss upon her hand burst into hysterical sobbing  julian in his inability to imagine so much emotionor at least the exhibition of itin ethelberta gently drew picotee further forward by the hand he held and utilized the solitary spot of light from the mirror by making it fall upon her face recognizing the childish features he at once with an exclamation dropped her hand and started back  being in point of fact a complete bundle of nerves and nothing else his thin figure shook like a harpstring in painful excitement at a contretemps which would scarcely have quickened the pulse of an ordinary man  poor picotee feeling herself in the wind of a civil d started back also sobbing more than ever  it was a little too much that the first result of his discovery of the mistake should be absolute repulse  she leant against the mantelpiece when julian much bewildered at her superfluity of emotion assisted her to a seat in sheer humanity  but christopher was by no means pleased when he again thought round the circle of circumstances  how could you allow such an absurd thing to happen he said in a stern though trembling voice  you knew i might mistake  i had no idea you were in the house i thought you were miles away at sandbourne or somewhere  but i see it is just done for a joke haha  this made picotee rather worse still  oooo she replied in the tone of pouring from a bottle  what shall i doooo  it isnot done for ajoke at alllll  not done for a joke  then never minddont cry picotee  what was it done for i wonder  picotee mistaking the purport of his inquiry imagined him to refer to her arrival in the house quite forgetting in her guilty sense of having come on his account that he would have no right or thought of asking questions about a natural visit to a sister and she said when youwent away fromsandbourne iii didnt know what to do and then i ran away and came here and then ethelbertawas angry with me but she says i may stay but she doesnt know that i know you and how we used to meet along the road every morningand i am afraid to tell hero what shall i do  never mind it said christopher a sense of the true state of her case dawning upon him with unpleasant distinctness and bringing some irritation at his awkward position though it was impossible to be long angry with a girl who had not reasoning foresight enough to perceive that doubtful pleasure and certain pain must be the result of any meeting whilst hearts were at cross purposes in this way  where is your sister he asked  she wouldnt come down unless she must said picotee  you have vexed her and she has a headache besides that and i came instead  so that i mightnt be wasted altogether  well its a strange business between the three of us  i have heard of onesided love and reciprocal love and all sorts but this is my first experience of a concatenated affection  you follow me i follow ethelberta and she followsheaven knows who  mr ladywell said the mortified picotee  good god if i didnt think so said christopher feeling to the soles of his feet like a man in a legitimate drama  no no no said the frightened girl hastily  i am not sure it is mr ladywell  thats altogether a mistake of mine  ah yes you want to screen her said christopher with a withering smile at the spot of light  very sisterly doubtless but none of that will do for me  i am too old a bird by farby very far  now are you sure she does not love ladywell  yes  well perhaps i blame her wrongly  she may have some little good faitha woman has here and there  how do you know she does not love ladywell  because she would prefer mr neigh to him any day  ha  no noyou mistake sirshe doesnt love either at allethelberta doesnt  i meant that she cannot love mr ladywell because he stands lower in her opinion than mr neigh and him she certainly does not care for  she only loves you  if you only knew how true she is you wouldnt be so suspicious about her and i wish i had not come hereyes i do  i cannot tell what to think of it  perhaps i dont know much of this world after all or what girls will do  but you dont excuse her to me picotee  before this time picotee had been simulating haste in getting a light but in her dread of appearing visibly to christophers eyes and showing him the precise condition of her tearstained face she put it off moment after moment and stirred the fire in hope that the faint illumination thus produced would be sufficient to save her from the charge of stupid conduct as entertainer  fluttering about on the horns of this dilemma she was greatly relieved when christopher who read her difficulty and the general painfulness of the situation said that since ethelberta was really suffering from a headache he would not wish to disturb her till tomorrow and went off downstairs and into the street without further ceremony  meanwhile other things had happened upstairs  no sooner had picotee left her sisters room than ethelberta thought it would after all have been much better if she had gone down herself to speak to this admirably persistent lover  was she not drifting somewhat into the character of coquette even if her ground of offencea word of christophers about somebody elses mean parentage which was spoken in utter forgetfulness of her own position but had wounded her to the quick neverthelesswas to some extent a tenable one  she knew what facilities in suffering christopher always showed how a touch to other people was a blow to him a blow to them his deep wound although he took such pains to look stolid and unconcerned under those inflictions and tried to smile as if he had no feelings whatever  it would be more generous to go down to him and be kind  she jumped up with that alertness which comes so spontaneously at those sweet bright times when desire and duty run hand in hand  she hastily set her hair and dress in ordernot such matchless order as she could have wished them to be in but time was preciousand descended the stairs  when on the point of pushing open the drawingroom door which wanted about an inch of being closed she was astounded to discover that the room was in total darkness and still more to hear picotee sobbing inside  to retreat again was the only action she was capable of at that moment the clash between this picture and the anticipated scene of picotee and christopher sitting in frigid propriety at opposite sides of a welllighted room was too great  she flitted upstairs again with the least possible rustle and flung herself down on the couch as before panting with excitement at the new knowledge that had come to her  there was only one possible construction to be put upon this in ethelbertas rapid mind and that approximated to the true one  she had known for some time that picotee once had a lover or something akin to it and that he had disappointed her in a way which had never been told no stranger save in the capacity of the one beloved could wound a woman sufficiently to make her weep and it followed that christopher was the man of picotees choice  as ethelberta recalled the conversations conclusion after conclusion came like pulsations in an aching head  o how did it happen and who is to blame she exclaimed  i cannot doubt his faith and i cannot doubt hers and yet how can i keep doubting them both  it was characteristic of ethelbertas jealous motherly guard over her young sisters that amid these contending inquiries her foremost feeling was less one of hope for her own love than of championship for picotees     23 ethelbertas house continued   picotee was heard on the stairs ethelberta covered her face  is he waiting she said faintly on finding that picotee did not begin to speak  no he is gone said picotee  ah why is that came quickly from under the handkerchief  he has forgotten methats what it is  o no he has not said picotee just as bitterly  ethelberta had far too much heroism to let much in this strain escape her though her sister was prepared to go any lengths in the same  i suppose continued ethelberta in the quiet way of one who had only a headache the matter with her that he remembered you after the meeting at anglebury  yes he remembered me  did you tell me you had seen him before that time  i had seen him at sandbourne  i dont think i told you  at whose house did you meet him  at nobodys  i only saw him sometimes replied picotee in great distress  ethelberta though of all women most miserable was brimming with compassion for the throbbing girl so nearly related to her in whom she continually saw her own weak points without the counterpoise of her strong ones  but it was necessary to repress herself awhile the intended ways of her life were blocked and broken up by this jar of interests and she wanted time to ponder new plans  picotee i would rather be alone now if you dont mind she said  you need not leave me any light it makes my eyes ache i think  picotee left the room  but ethelberta had not long been alone and in darkness when somebody gently opened the door and entered without a candle  berta said the soft voice of picotee again may i come in  o yes said ethelberta  has everything gone right with the house this evening  yes and gwendoline went out just now to buy a few things and she is going to call round upon father when he has got his dinner cleared away  i hope she will not stay and talk to the other servants  some day she will let drop something or other before father can stop her  o berta said picotee close beside her  she was kneeling in front of the couch and now flinging her arm across ethelbertas shoulder and shaking violently she pressed her forehead against her sisters temple and breathed out upon her cheek  i came in again to tell you something which i ought to have told you just now and i have come to say it at once because i am afraid i shant be able to tomorrow  mr julian was the young man i spoke to you of a long time ago and i should have told you all about him but you said he was your young man too andand i didnt know what to do then because i thought it was wrong in me to love your young man and berta he didnt mean me to love him at all but i did it myself though i did not want to do it either it would come to me  and i didnt know he belonged to you when i began it or i would not have let him meet me at all no i wouldnt  meet you you dont mean to say he used to meet you whispered ethelberta  yes said picotee but he could not help it  we used to meet on the road and there was no other road unless i had gone ever so far round but it is worse than that berta  that was why i couldnt bide in sandbourne andand ran away to you up here it was not because i wanted to see you berta but because ii wanted  yes yes i know said ethelberta hurriedly  and then when i went downstairs he mistook me for you for a moment and that causeda confusion  o well it does not much matter said ethelberta kissing picotee soothingly  you ought not of course to have come to london in such a manner but since you have come we will make the best of it  perhaps it may end happily for you and for him  who knows  then dont you want him berta  o no not at all  whatand dont you really want him berta repeated picotee starting up  i would much rather he paid his addresses to you  he is not the sort of man i should wish tothink it best to marry even if i were to marry which i have no intention of doing at present  he calls to see me because we are old friends but his calls do not mean anything more than that he takes an interest in me  it is not at all likely that i shall see him again and i certainly never shall see him unless you are present  that will be very nice  yes  and you will be always distant towards him and go to leave the room when he comes when i will call you back but suppose we continue this tomorrow  i can tell you better then what to do  when picotee had left her the second time ethelberta turned over upon her breast and shook in convulsive sobs which had little relationship with tears  this abandonment ended as suddenly as it had begunnot lasting more than a minute and a half altogetherand she got up in an unconsidered and unusual impulse to seek relief from the stinging sarcasm of this eventthe unhappy love of picoteeby mentioning something of it to another member of the family her eldest sister gwendoline who was a woman full of sympathy  ethelberta descended to the kitchen it being now about ten oclock  the room was empty gwendoline not having yet returned and cornelia being busy about her own affairs upstairs  the french family had gone to the theatre and the house on that account was very quiet tonight ethelberta sat down in the dismal place without turning up the gas and in a few minutes admitted gwendoline  the roundfaced country cook floundered in untying her bonnet as she came laying it down on a chair and talking at the same time  such a place as this london is to be sure she exclaimed turning on the gas till it whistled  i wish i was down in wessex again  lordamercy berta i didnt see it was you  i thought it was cornelia  as i was saying i thought that after biding in this underground cellar all the week making up messes for them french folk and never pleasing em and never shall because i dont understand that line i thought i would go out and see father you know  is he very well said ethelberta  yes and he is going to call round when he has time  well as i was a coming homealong i thought please the lord ill have some chippols for supper just for a plain trate and i went round to the late greengrocers for em and do you know they sweared me down that they hadnt got such things as chippols in the shop and had never heard of em in their lives  at last i said why how can you tell me such a brazen storyhere they be heaps of em  it made me so vexed that i came away there and then and wouldnt have oneno not at a gift  they call them young onions here said ethelberta quietly you must always remember that  but gwendoline i wanted  ethelberta felt sick at heart and stopped  she had come down on the wings of an impulse to unfold her trouble about picotee to her hardheaded and much older sister less for advice than to get some heart ease by interchange of words but alas she could proceed no further  the wretched homeliness of gwendolines mind seemed at this particular juncture to be absolutely intolerable and ethelberta was suddenly convinced that to involve gwendoline in any such discussion would simply be increasing her own burden and adding worse confusion to her sisters already confused existence  what were you going to say said the honest and unsuspecting gwendoline  i will put it off until tomorrow ethelberta murmured gloomily i have a bad headache and i am afraid i cannot stay with you after all  as she ascended the stairs ethelberta ached with an added pain not much less than the primary one which had brought her down  it was that old sense of disloyalty to her class and kin by feeling as she felt now which caused the pain and there was no escaping it  gwendoline would have gone to the ends of the earth for her she could not confide a thought to gwendoline  if she only knew of that unworthy feeling of mine how she would grieve said ethelberta miserably  she next went up to the servants bedrooms and to where cornelia slept on ethelbertas entrance cornelia looked up from a perfect wonder of a bonnet which she held in her hands  at sight of ethelberta the look of keen interest in her work changed to one of gaiety  i am so gladi was just coming down cornelia said in a whisper whenever they spoke as relations in this house it was in whispers  now how do you think this bonnet will do  may i come down and see how i look in your big glass  she clapped the bonnet upon her head  wont it do beautiful for sunday afternoon  it looks very attractive as far as i can see by this light said ethelberta  but is it not rather too brilliant in colourblue and red together like that  remember as i often tell you people in town never wear such bright contrasts as they do in the country  o berta said cornelia in a deprecating tone dont object  if theres one thing i do glory in it is a nice flareup about my head o sundaysof course if the familys not in mourning i mean  but seeing that ethelberta did not smile she turned the subject and added docilely did you come up for me to do anything  i will put off finishing my bonnet if i am wanted  i was going to talk to you about family matters and picotee said ethelberta  but as you are busy and i have a headache i will put it off till tomorrow  cornelia seemed decidedly relieved for family matters were far from attractive at the best of times and ethelberta went down to the next floor and entered her mothers room  after a short conversation mrs chickerel said you say you want to ask me something  yes but nothing of importance mother  i was thinking about picotee and what would be the best thing to do  ah well you may berta  i am so uneasy about this life you have led us into and full of fear that your plans may break down if they do whatever will become of us  i know you are doing your best but i cannot help thinking that the coming to london and living with you was wild and rash and not well weighed afore we set about it  you should have counted the cost first and not advised it  if you break down and we are all discovered living so queer and unnatural right in the heart of the aristocracy we should be the laughingstock of the country it would kill me and ruin us allutterly ruin us  o mother i know all that so well exclaimed ethelberta tears of anguish filling her eyes  dont depress me more than i depress myself by such fears or you will bring about the very thing we strive to avoid my only chance is in keeping in good spirits and why dont you try to help me a little by taking a brighter view of things  i know i ought to my dear girl but i cannot  i do so wish that i never let you tempt me and the children away from the lodge  i cannot think why i allowed myself to be so persuadedcannot think  you are not to blameit is i  i am much older than you and ought to have known better than listen to such a scheme  this undertaking seems too bigthe bills frighten me  i have never been used to such wild adventure and i cant sleep at night for fear that your taletelling will go wrong and we shall all be exposed and shamed  a storyteller seems such an impossible castleintheair sort of a trade for getting a living byi cannot think how ever you came to dream of such an unheardof thing  but it is not a castle in the air and it does get a living said ethelberta her lip quivering  well yes while it is just a new thing but i am afraid it cannot lastthats what i fear  people will find you out as one of a family of servants and their pride will be stung at having gone to hear your romancing then they will go no more and what will happen to us and the poor little ones  we must all scatter again  if we could get as we were once i wouldnt mind that  but we shall have lost our character as simple country folk who know nothing which are the only class of poor people that squires will give any help to and i much doubt if the girls would get places after such a discoveryit would be so awkward and unheardof  well all i can say is replied ethelberta that i will do my best all that i have is theirs and yours as much as mine and these arrangements are simply on their account  i dont like my relations being my servants but if they did not work for me they would have to work for others and my service is much lighter and pleasanter than any other ladys would be for them so the advantages are worth the risk  if i stood alone i would go and hide my head in any hole and care no more about the world and its ways  i wish i was well out of it and at the bottom of a quiet graveanybody might have the world for me then  but dont let me disturb you longer it is getting late  ethelberta then wished her mother goodnight and went away  to attempt confidences on such an ethereal matter as love was now absurd her hermit spirit was doomed to dwell apart as usual and she applied herself to deep thinking without aid and alone  not only was there picotees misery to disperse it became imperative to consider how best to overpass a more general catastrophe     24 ethelbertas house continuedthe british museum   mrs chickerel in deploring the risks of their present speculative mode of life was far from imagining that signs of the foul future so much dreaded were actually apparent to ethelberta at the time the lament was spoken  hence the daughters uncommon sensitiveness to prophecy  it was as if a deadreckoner poring over his chart should predict breakers ahead to one who already beheld them  that her storytelling would prove so attractive ethelberta had not ventured to expect for a moment that having once proved attractive there should be any fallingoff until such time had elapsed as would enable her to harvest some solid fruit was equally a surprise  future expectations are often based without hesitation upon one happy accident when the only similar condition remaining to subsequent sets of circumstances is that the same person forms the centre of them  her situation was so peculiar and so unlike that of most public people that there was hardly an argument explaining this triumphant opening which could be used in forecasting the close unless indeed more strategy were employed in the conduct of the campaign than ethelberta seemed to show at present  there was no denying that she commanded less attention than at first the audience had lessened and judging by appearances might soon be expected to be decidedly thin  in excessive lowness of spirit ethelberta translated these signs with the bias that a lingering echo of her mothers dismal words naturally induced reading them as conclusive evidence that her adventure had been chimerical in its birth  yet it was very far less conclusive than she supposed  public interest might without doubt have been renewed after a due interval some of the falling off being only an accident of the season  her novelties had been hailed with pleasure the rather that their freshness tickled than that their intrinsic merit was appreciated and like many inexperienced dispensers of a unique charm ethelberta by bestowing too liberally and too frequently was destroying the very element upon which its popularity depended  her entertainment had been good in its conception and partly good in its execution yet her success had but little to do with that goodness  indeed what might be called its badness in a histrionic sensethat is her look sometimes of being out of place the sight of a beautiful woman on a platform revealing tender airs of domesticity which showed her to belong by character to a quiet drawingroomhad been primarily an attractive feature  but alas custom was staling this by improving her up to the mark of an utter impersonator thereby eradicating the pretty abashments of a poetess out of her sphere and more than one wellwisher who observed ethelberta from afar feared that it might some day come to be said of her that she had     enfeoffed herself to popularity    that being daily swallowed by mens eyes    they surfeited with honey and began    to loathe the taste of sweetness whereof a little    more than a little is by much too much  but this in its extremity was not quite yet  we discover her one day a little after this time sitting before a table strewed with accounts and bills from different tradesmen of the neighbourhood which she examined with a pale face collecting their totals on a blank sheet  picotee came into the room but ethelberta took no notice whatever of her  the younger sister who subsisted on scraps of notice and favour like a dependent animal even if these were only an occasional glance of the eye could not help saying at last berta how silent you are  i dont think you know i am in the room  i did not observe you said ethelberta  i am very much engaged these bills have to be paid  what and cannot we pay them said picotee in vague alarm  o yes i can pay them  the question is how long shall i be able to do it  that is sad and we are going on so nicely too  it is not true that you have really decided to leave off storytelling now the people dont crowd to hear it as they did  i think i shall leave off  and begin again next year  that is very doubtful  ill tell you what you might do said picotee her face kindling with a sense of great originality  you might travel about to country towns and tell your story splendidly  a man in my position might perhaps do it with impunity but i could not without losing ground in other domains  a woman may drive to mayfair from her house in exonbury crescent and speak from a platform there and be supposed to do it as an original way of amusing herself but when it comes to starring in the provinces she establishes herself as a woman of a different breed and habit  i wish i were a man  i would give up this house advertise it to be let furnished and sally forth with confidence but i am driven to think of other ways to manage than that  picotee fell into a conjectural look but could not guess  the way of marriage said ethelberta  otherwise perhaps the poetess may live to become what dryden called himself when he got old and poora rentcharge on providence      yes i must try that way she continued with a sarcasm towards people out of hearing  i must buy a peerage for one thing and a baronetage and a house of commons and a landed gentry and learn what people are about me  i must go to doctors commons and read up wills of the parents of any likely gudgeons i may know  i must get a herald to invent an escutcheon of my family and throw a genealogical tree into the bargain in consideration of my taking a few secondhand heirlooms of a pawnbroking friend of his  i must get up sham ancestors and find out some notorious name to start my pedigree from  it does not matter what his character was either villain or martyr will do provided that he lived five hundred years ago  it would be considered far more creditable to make good my descent from satan in the age when he went to and fro on the earth than from a ministering angel under victoria  but berta you are not going to marry any stranger who may turn up said picotee who had creeping sensations of dread when ethelberta talked like this  i had no such intention  but having once put my hand to the plough how shall i turn back  you might marry mr ladywell said picotee who preferred to look at things in the concrete  yes marry him villainously in cold blood without a moment to prepare himself  ah you wont  i am not so sure about that  i have brought mother and the children to town against her judgment and against my fathers they gave way to my opinion as to one who from superior education has larger knowledge of the world than they  i must prove my promises even if heaven should fall upon me for it or what a miserable future will theirs be  we must not be poor in london  poverty in the country is a sadness but poverty in town is a horror  there is something not without grandeur in the thought of starvation on an open mountain or in a wide wood and your bones lying there to bleach in the pure sun and rain but a back garret in a rookery and the other starvers in the room insisting on keeping the window shutanything to deliver us from that  how gloomy you can be berta  it will never be so dreadful  why i can take in plain sewing and you can do translations and mother can knit stockings and so on  how much longer will this house be yours  two years  if i keep it longer than that i shall have to pay rent at the rate of three hundred a year  the petherwin estate provides me with it till then which will be the end of lady petherwins term  i see it and you ought to marry before the house is gone if you mean to marry high murmured picotee in an inadequate voice as one confronted by a world so tragic that any hope of her assisting therein was out of the question  it was not long after this exposition of the family affairs that christopher called upon them but picotee was not present having gone to think of superhuman work on the spur of ethelbertas awakening talk there was something new in the way in which ethelberta received the announcement of his name passion had to do with it so had circumspection the latter most for the first time since their reunion  i am going to leave this part of england said christopher after a few gentle preliminaries  i was one of the applicants for the post of assistantorganist at melchester cathedral when it became vacant and i find i am likely to be chosen through the interest of one of my fathers friends  i congratulate you  no ethelberta it is not worth that  i did not originally mean to follow this course at all but events seemed to point to it in the absence of a better  i too am compelled to follow a course i did not originally mean to take  after saying no more for a few moments she added in a tone of sudden openness a richer tincture creeping up her cheek i want to put a question to you boldlynot exactly a questiona thought  have you considered whether the relations between us which have lately prevailed areare the best for youand for me  i know what you mean said christopher hastily anticipating all that she might be going to say and i am glad you have given me the opportunity of speaking upon that subject  it has been very good and considerate in you to allow me to share your society so frequently as you have done since i have been in town and to think of you as an object to exist for and strive for  but i ought to have remembered that since you have nobody at your side to look after your interests it behoved me to be doubly careful  in short ethelberta i am not in a position to marry nor can i discern when i shall be and i feel it would be an injustice to ask you to be bound in any way to one lower and less talented than you  you cannot from what you say think it desirable that the engagement should continue  i have no right to ask you to be my betrothed without having a near prospect of making you my wife  i dont mind saying this straight outi have no fear that you will doubt my love thank heaven you know what that is well enough  however as things are i wish you to know that i cannot conscientiously put in a claim upon your attention  a second meaning was written in christophers look though he scarcely uttered it  a woman so delicately poised upon the social globe could not in honour be asked to wait for a lover who was unable to set bounds to the waiting period  yet he had privily dreamed of an approach to that positionan unreserved ideally perfect declaration from ethelberta that time and practical issues were nothing to her that she would stand as fast without material hopes as with them that love was to be an end with her henceforth having utterly ceased to be a means  therefore this surreptitious hope of his founded on no reasonable expectation was like a guilty thing surprised when ethelberta answered with a predominance of judgment over passion still greater than before  it is unspeakably generous in you to put it all before me so nicely christopher  i think infinitely more of you for being so unreserved especially since i too have been thinking much on the indefiniteness of the days to come  we are not numbered among the blest few who can afford to trifle with the time  yet to agree to anything like a positive parting will be quite unnecessary  you did not mean that did you for it is harsh if you did  ethelberta smiled kindly as she said this as much as to say that she was far from really upbraiding him  let it be only that we will see each other less  we will bear one another in mind as deeply attached friends if not as definite lovers and keep up friendly remembrances of a sort which come what may will never have to be ended by any painful process termed breaking off  different persons different natures and it may be that marriage would not be the most favourable atmosphere for our old affection to prolong itself in  when do you leave london  the disconnected query seemed to be subjoined to disperse the crude effect of what had gone before  i hardly know murmured christopher  i suppose i shall not call here again  whilst they were silent somebody entered the room softly and they turned to discover picotee  come here picotee said ethelberta  picotee came with an abashed bearing to where the other two were standing and looked down steadfastly  mr julian is going away she continued with determined firmness  he will not see us again for a long time  and ethelberta added in a lower tone though still in the unflinching manner of one who had set herself to say a thing and would say ithe is not to be definitely engaged to me any longer  we are not thinking of marrying you know picotee  it is best that we should not  perhaps it is said christopher hurriedly taking up his hat  let me now wish you goodbye and of course you will always know where i am and how to find me  it was a tender time  he inclined forward that ethelberta might give him her hand which she did whereupon their eyes met  mastered by an impelling instinct she had not reckoned with ethelberta presented her cheek  christopher kissed it faintly  tears were in ethelbertas eyes now and she was heartfull of many emotions  placing her arm round picotees waist who had never lifted her eyes from the carpet she drew the slight girl forward and whispered quickly to himkiss her too she is my sister and i am yours  it seemed all right and natural to their respective moods and the tone of the moment that free old wessex manners should prevail and christopher stooped and dropped upon picotees cheek likewise such a farewell kiss as he had imprinted upon ethelbertas  care for us both equally said ethelberta  i will said christopher scarcely knowing what he said  when he had reached the door of the room he looked back and saw the two sisters standing as he had left them and equally tearful  ethelberta at once said in a last futile struggle against letting him go altogether and with thoughts of her sisters heart  i think that picotee might correspond with faith dont you mr julian  my sister would much like to do so said he  and you would like it too would you not picotee  o yes she replied  and i can tell them all about you  then it shall be so if miss julian will  she spoke in a settled way as if something intended had been set in train and christopher having promised for his sister he went out of the house with a parting smile of misgiving  he could scarcely believe as he walked along that those late words yet hanging in his ears had really been spoken that still visible scene enacted  he could not even recollect for a minute or two how the final result had been produced  did he himself first enter upon the longlooming theme or did she  christopher had been so nervously alive to the urgency of setting before the hardstriving woman a clear outline of himself his surroundings and his fears that he fancied the main impulse to this consummation had been his notwithstanding that a faint initiative had come from ethelberta  all had completed itself quickly unceremoniously and easily  ethelberta had let him go a second time yet on foregoing mornings and evenings when contemplating the necessity of some such explanation it had seemed that nothing less than atlantean force could overpower their mutual gravitation towards each other  on his reaching home faith was not in the house and in the restless state which demands something to talk at the musician went off to find her well knowing her haunt at this time of the day  he entered the spiked and gilded gateway of the museum hard by turned to the wing devoted to sculptures and descended to a particular basement room which was lined with basreliefs from nineveh  the place was cool silent and soothing it was empty save of a little figure in black that was standing with its face to the wall in an innermost nook  this spot was faiths own temple here among these deserted antiques faith was always happy  christopher looked on at her for some time before she noticed him and dimly perceived how vastly differed her homely suit and unstudied contourpainfully unstudied to fastidious eyesfrom ethelbertas wellarranged draperies even from picotees clever bits of ribbon by which she made herself look pretty out of nothing at all  yet this negligence was his sisters essence without it she would have been a spoilt product  she had no outer world and her rusty black was as appropriate to faiths unseen courses as were ethelbertas correct lights and shades to her more prominent career  look kit said faith as soon as she knew who was approaching  this is a thing i never learnt before this person is really sennacherib sitting on his throne and these with fluted beards and hair like plough furrows and fingers with no bones in them are his warriorsreally carved at the time you know  only just think that this is not imagined of assyria but done in assyrian times by assyrian hands  dont you feel as if you were actually in nineveh that as we now walk between these slabs so walked ninevites between them once  yes     faith it is all over  ethelberta and i have parted  indeed  and so my plan is to think of verses in the bible about sennacherib and his doings which resemble these this verse for instance i remember now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took them  and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish and so on  well there it actually is you see theres sennacherib and theres lachish  is it not glorious to think that this is a picture done at the time of those very events  yes  we did not quarrel this time ethelberta and i  if i may so put it it is worse than quarrelling  we felt it was no use going on any longer and socome faith hear what i say or else tell me that you wont hear and that i may as well save my breath  yes i will really listen she said fluttering her eyelids in her concern at having been so abstracted and excluding sennacherib there and then from christophers affairs by the first settlement of her features to a presentday aspect and her eyes upon his face  you said you had seen ethelberta  yes and what did she say  was there ever anybody so provoking  why i have just told you  yes yes i remember now  you have parted  the subject is too large for me to know all at once what i think of it and you must give me time kit  speaking of ethelberta reminds me of what i have done  i just looked into the academy this morningi thought i would surprise you by telling you about it  and what do you think i saw  ethelbertain the picture painted by mr ladywell  it is never hung said he feeling that they were at one as to a topic at last  yes  and the subject is an elizabethan knight parting from a lady of the same periodthe words explaining the picture being     farewell thou art too dear for my possessing    and like enough thou knowst thy estimate  the lady is ethelberta to the shade of a hairher living face and the knight is  not ladywell  i think so i am not sure  no wonder i am dismissed  and yet she hates him  well come along faith  women allow strange liberties in these days     25 the royal academythe farnfield estate   ethelberta was a firm believer in the kindly effects of artistic education upon the masses  she held that defilement of mind often arose from ignorance of eye and her philanthropy being by the simple force of her situation of that sort which lingers in the neighbourhood of home she concentrated her efforts in this kind upon sol and dan  accordingly the academy exhibition having now just opened she ordered the brothers to appear in their best clothes at the entrance to burlington house just after noontide on the saturday of the first week this being the only day and hour at which they could attend without losing a half and therefore it was necessary to put up with the inconvenience of arriving at a crowded and enervating time  when ethelberta was set down in the quadrangle she perceived the faithful pair big as the zamzummims of old time standing like sentinels in the particular corner that she had named to them for sol and dan would as soon have attempted petty larceny as broken faith with their admired lady sister ethelberta  they welcomed her with a painfully lavish exhibition of large new gloves and chests covered with broad triangular areas of padded blue silk occupying the position that the shirtfront had occupied in earlier days and supposed to be lineally descended from the tie of a neckerchief  the dress of their sister for today was exactly that of a respectable workmans relative who had no particular ambition in the matter of fashiona black stuff gown a plain bonnet to match  a veil she wore for obvious reasons her face was getting well known in london and it had already appeared at the private view in an uncovered state when it was scrutinized more than the paintings around  but now homely and useful labour was her purpose  catalogue in hand she took the two brothers through the galleries teaching them in whispers as they walked and occasionally correcting themfirst for too reverential a bearing towards the welldressed crowd among whom they persisted in walking with their hats in their hands and with the contrite bearing of meek people in church and secondly for a tendency which they too often showed towards straying from the contemplation of the pictures as art to indulge in curious speculations on the intrinsic nature of the delineated subject the gilding of the frames the construction of the skylights overhead or admiration for the bracelets lockets and lofty eloquence of persons around them  now said ethelberta in a warning whisper we are coming near the picture which was partly painted from myself  and dan when you see it dont you exclaim hullo or thats berta to a t or anything at all it would not matter were it not dangerous for me to be noticed here to day  i see several people who would recognize me on the least provocation  not a word said dan  dont you be afeard about that  i feel that i baint upon my own ground today and wouldnt do anything to cause an upset drown me if i would  would you sol  in this temper they all pressed forward and ethelberta could not but be gratified at the reception of ladywells picture though it was accorded by critics not very profound  it was an operation of some minutes to get exactly opposite and when side by side the three stood there they overheard the immediate reason of the pressure  farewell thou art too dear for my possessing had been lengthily discoursed upon that morning by the coryphaeus of popular opinion and the spirit having once been poured out sons and daughters could prophesy  but in truth ladywells work if not emphatically original was happily centred on a middle stratum of taste and apart from this adventitious help commanded and deserved to command a wide area of appreciation  while they were standing here in the very heart of the throng ethelbertas ears were arrested by two male voices behind her whose words formed a novel contrast to those of the other speakers around  some men you see with extravagant expectations of themselves coolly get them gratified while others hope rationally and are disappointed luck thats what it is  and the more easily a man takes life the more persistently does luck follow him  of course because if hes industrious he does not want lucks assistance  natural laws will help him instead  well if it is true that ladywell has painted a good picture he has done it by an exhaustive process  he has painted every possible bad one till nothing more of that sort is left for him  you know what ladys face served as the original to this i suppose  mrs petherwins i hear  yes mrs alfred neigh thats to be  what that elusive fellow caught at last  so it appears but she herself is hardly so well secured as yet it seems though he takes the uncertainty as coolly as possible  i knew nothing about it till he introduced the subject as we were standing here on monday and said in an offhand way i mean to marry that lady  i asked him how  easily he said i will have her if there are a hundred at her heels  you will understand that this was quite in confidence  of course of course  then there was a slight laugh and the companions proceeded to other gossip  ethelberta calm and compressed in manner sidled along to extricate herself not daring to turn round and dan and sol followed till they were all clear of the spot  the brothers who had heard the words equally well with ethelberta made no remark to her upon them assuming that they referred to some peculiar system of courtship adopted in high life with which they had rightly no concern  ethelberta ostensibly continued her business of tutoring the young workmen just as before though every emotion in her had been put on the alert by this discovery  she had known that neigh admired her yet his presumption in uttering such a remark as he was reported to have uttered confidentially or otherwise nearly took away her breath  perhaps it was not altogether disagreeable to have her breath so taken away  i mean to marry that lady  she whispered the words to herself twenty times in the course of the afternoon  sol and dan were left considerably longer to their private perceptions of the false and true in art than they had been earlier in the day  when she reached home ethelberta was still far removed in her reflections and it was noticed afterwards that about this time in her career her openness of manner entirely deserted her  she mostly was silent as to her thoughts and she wore an air of unusual stillness  it was the silence and stillness of a starry sky where all is force and motion  this deep undecipherable habit sometimes suggested though it did not reveal ethelbertas busy brain to her sisters and they said to one another i cannot think whats coming to berta she is not so nice as she used to be  the evening under notice was passed desultorily enough after the discovery of neighs selfassured statement  among other things that she did after dark while still musingly examining the probabilities of the report turning out true was to wander to the large attic where the children slept a frequent habit of hers at night to learn if they were snug and comfortable  they were talking now from bed to bed the person under discussion being herself  herself seemed everywhere today  i know that she is a fairy myrtle was insisting because she must be to have such pretty things in her house and wear silk dresses such as mother and we and picotee havent got and have money to give us whenever we want it  emmeline says perhaps she knows the fairys godmother and is not a fairy herself because berta is too tall for a real fairy  she must be one for when there was a notch burnt in the hem of my pretty blue frock she said it should be gone in the morning if i would go to bed and not cry and in the morning it was gone and all nice and straight as new  ethelberta was recalling to mind how she had sat up and repaired the damage alluded to by cutting off half an inch of the skirt all round and hemming it anew when the breathing of the children became regular and they fell asleep  here were bright little minds ready for a training which without money and influence she could never give them  the wisdom which knowledge brings and the power which wisdom may bring she had always assumed would be theirs in her dreams for their social elevation by what means were these things to be ensured to them if her skill in breadwinning should fail her  would not a wellcontrived marriage be of service  she covered and tucked in one more closely lifted another upon the pillow and straightened the soft limbs to an easy position then sat down by the window and looked out at the flashing stars  thoughts of neighs audacious statement returned again upon ethelberta  he had said that he meant to marry her  of what standing was the man who had uttered such an intention respecting one to whom a politic marriage had become almost a necessity of existence  she had often heard neigh speak indefinitely of some estatemy little place he had called itwhich he had purchased no very long time ago all she knew was that its name was farnfield that it lay thirty or forty miles out of london in a southwesterly direction a railway station in the district bearing the same name so that there was probably a village or small town adjoining  whether the dignity of this landed property was that of domain farmstead allotment or gardenplot ethelberta had not the slightest conception  she was almost certain that neigh never lived there but that might signify nothing  the exact size and value of the estate would she mused be curious interesting and almost necessary information to her who must become mistress of it were she to allow him to carry out his singularly cool and crude if tender intention moreover its importance would afford a very good random sample of his worldly substance throughout from which alone after all could the true spirit and worth and seriousness of his words be apprehended impecuniosity may revel in unqualified vows and brim over with confessions as blithely as a bird of may but such careless pleasures are not for the solvent whose very dreams are negotiable and are expressed with due care accordingly  that neigh had used the words she had far more than primafacie appearances for believing  neighs own conduct towards her though peculiar rather than devoted found in these words alone a reasonable key  but supposing the estate to be such a verbal hallucination as for instance hers had been at arrowthorne when her poor unprogressive hopelessly impracticable christopher came there to visit her and was so wonderfully undeceived about her social standing what a fiasco and what a cuckoocry would his utterances about marriage seem then  christopher had often told her of his expectations from arrowthorne lodge and of the blunders that had resulted in consequence  had not ethelbertas affection for christopher partaken less of lovers passion than of old established tutelary tenderness she might have been reminded by this reflection of the transcendent fidelity he had shown under that trialas severe a trial considering the abnormal almost morbid development of the passion for position in presentday society as can be prepared for men who move in the ordinary unheroic channels of life  by the following evening the consideration of this possibility that neighs position might furnish scope for such a disillusive discovery by herself as hers had afforded to christopher decoyed ethelberta into a curious little scheme  she was piqued into a practical undertaking by the man who could say to his friend with such sangfroid i mean to marry that lady  merely telling picotee to prepare for an evening excursion of which she was to talk to no one ethelberta made ready likewise and they left the house in a cab about halfanhour before sunset and drove to the waterloo station  with the decline and departure of the sun a fog gathered itself out of the low meadowland that bordered the railway as they went along towards the west stretching over it like a placid lake till at the end of the journey the mist became generally pervasive though not dense  avoiding observation as much as they conveniently could the two sisters walked from the long wooden shed which formed the station here into the rheumy air and along the road to the open country  picotee occasionally questioned ethelberta on the object of the strange journey she did not question closely being satisfied that in such sure hands as ethelbertas she was safe  deeming it unwise to make any inquiry just yet beyond the simple one of the way to farnfield ethelberta led her companion along a newlyfenced road across a heath  in due time they came to an ornamental gate with a curved sweep of wall on each side signifying the entrance to some enclosed property or other  ethelberta being quite free from any digested plan for encouraging neigh in his resolve to wive was startled to find a hope in her that this very respectable beginning before their eyes was the entrance to the farnfield property that she hoped it was nevertheless unquestionable  just beyond lay a turnpikehouse where was dimly visible a woman in the act of putting up a shutter to the front window  compelled by this time to come to special questions ethelberta instructed picotee to ask of this person if the place they had just passed was the entrance to farnfield park  the woman replied that it was  directly she had gone indoors ethelberta turned back again towards the park gate  what have we come for berta said picotee as she turned also  ill tell you some day replied her sister  it was now much past eight oclock and from the nature of the evening dusk  the last stopping uptrain was about ten so that halfanhour could well be afforded for looking round  ethelberta went to the gate which was found to be fastened by a chain and padlock  ah the london season she murmured  there was a wicket at the side and they entered  an avenue of young fir trees three or four feet in height extended from the gate into the mist and down this they walked  the drive was not in very good order and the two women were frequently obliged to walk on the grass to avoid the rough stones in the carriageway  the double line of young firs now abruptly terminated and the road swept lower bending to the right immediately in front being a large lake calm and silent as a second sky  they could hear from somewhere on the margin the purl of a weir and around were clumps of shrubs araucarias and deodars being the commonest  ethelberta could not resist being charmed with the repose of the spot and hastened on with curiosity to reach the other side of the pool where by every law of manorial topography the mansion would be situate the fog concealed all objects beyond a distance of twenty yards or thereabouts but it was nearly full moon and though the orb was hidden a pale diffused light enabled them to see objects in the foreground reaching the other side of the lake the drive enlarged itself most legitimately to a large oval as for a sweep before a door a pile of rockwork standing in the midst  but where should have been the front door of a mansion was simply a rough rail fence about four feet high  they drew near and looked over  in the enclosure and on the site of the imaginary house was an extraordinary group  it consisted of numerous horses in the last stage of decrepitude the animals being such mere skeletons that at first ethelberta hardly recognized them to be horses at all they seemed rather to be specimens of some attenuated heraldic animal scarcely thick enough through the body to throw a shadow or enlarged castings of the firedog of past times  these poor creatures were endeavouring to make a meal from herbage so trodden and thin that scarcely a wholesome blade remained the little that there was consisted of the sourer sorts common on such sandy soils mingled with tufts of heather and sprouting ferns  why have we come here dear berta said picotee shuddering  i hardly know said ethelberta  adjoining this enclosure was another and smaller one formed of high boarding within which appeared to be some sheds and outhouses ethelberta looked through the crevices and saw that in the midst of the yard stood trunks of trees as if they were growing with branches also extending but these were sawn off at the points where they began to be flexible no twigs or boughs remaining  each torso was not unlike a huge hatstand and suspended to the pegs and prongs were lumps of some substance which at first she did not recognize they proved to be a chronological sequel to the previous scene  horses skulls ribs quarters legs and other joints were hung thereon the whole forming a huge openair larder emitting not too sweet a smell  but what stygian sound was this  there had arisen at the moment upon the mute and sleepy air a varied howling from a hundred tongues  it had burst from a spot close at handa low wooden building by a stream which fed the lakeand reverberated for miles  no further explanation was required  we are close to a kennel of hounds said ethelberta as picotee held tightly to her arm  they cannot get out so you need not fear  they have a horrid way of suddenly beginning thus at different hours of the night for no apparent reason though perhaps they hear us  these poor horses are waiting to be killed for their food  the experience altogether from its intense melancholy was very depressing almost appalling to the two lone young women and they quickly retraced their footsteps  the pleasant lake the purl of the weir the rudimentary lawns shrubberies and avenue had changed their character quite  ethelberta fancied at that moment that she could not have married neigh even had she loved him so horrid did his belongings appear to be  but for many other reasons she had been gradually feeling within this hour that she would not go out of her way at a beck from a man whose interest was so unimpassioned  thinking no more of him as a possible husband she ceased to be afraid to make inquiries about the peculiarities of his possessions  in the high road they came on a local man resting from wheeling a wheelbarrow and ethelberta asked him with the air of a countrywoman who owned the estate across the road  the man owning that is one of the name of neigh said the native wiping his face  tis a family that have made a very large fortune by the knacker business and tanning though they be only sleeping partners in it now and live like lords  mr neigh was going to pull down the old huts here and improve the place and build a mansionin short he went so far as to have the grounds planted and the roads marked out and the fishpond made and the place christened farnfield park but he did no more  i shall never have a wife he said so why should i want a house to put her in  hes a terrible hater of women i hear particularly the lower class  indeed  yes and since then he has let half the land to the honourable mr mountclere a brother of lord mountcleres  mr mountclere wanted the spot for a kennel and as the land is too poor and sandy for cropping mr neigh let him have it  tis his hounds that you hear howling  they passed on  berta why did we come down here said picotee  to see the nakedness of the land  it was a whim only and as it will end in nothing it is not worth while for me to make further explanation  it was with a curious sense of renunciation that ethelberta went homeward  neigh was handsome grimnatured rather wicked and an indifferentist and these attractions interested her as a woman  but the news of this evening suggested to ethelberta that herself and neigh were too nearly cattle of one colour for a confession on the matter of lineage to be well received by him and without confidence of every sort on the nature of her situation she was determined to contract no union at all the sympathy of unlikeness might lead the scion of some family hollow and fungous with antiquity and as yet unmarked by a mesalliance to be won over by her story but the antipathy of resemblance would be ineradicable     26 ethelbertas drawingroom   while ethelberta during the next few days was dismissing that evening journey from her consideration as an incident altogether foreign to the organized course of her existence the hidden fruit thereof was rounding to maturity in a species unforeseen  inferences unassailable as processes are nevertheless to be suspected from the almost certain deficiency of particulars on some side or other the truth in relation to neighs supposed frigidity was brought before her at the end of the following week when dan and sol had taken picotee cornelia and the young children to kew for the afternoon  early that morning hours before it was necessary there had been such a chatter of preparation in the house as was seldom heard there  sunday hats and bonnets had been retrimmed with such cunning that it would have taken a milliners apprentice at least to discover that any thread in them was not quite new  there was an anxious peep through the blind at the sky at daybreak by georgina and myrtle and the perplexity of these rural children was great at the weathersigns of the town where atmospheric effects had nothing to do with clouds and fair days and foul came apparently quite by chance  punctually at the hour appointed two friendly human shadows descended across the kitchen window followed by sol and dan much to the relief of the childrens apprehensions that they might forget the day  the brothers were by this time acquiring something of the airs and manners of london workmen they were less spontaneous and more comparative less genial but smarter in obedience to the usual law by which the emotion that takes the form of humour in country workmen becomes transmuted to irony among the same order in town  but the fixed and dogged fidelity to one another under apparent coolness by which this family was distinguished remained unshaken in these members as in all the rest leading them to select the children as companions in their holiday in preference to casual acquaintance  at last they were ready and departed and ethelberta after chatting with her mother awhile proceeded to her personal duties  the house was very silent that day gwendoline and joey being the only ones left below stairs  ethelberta was wishing that she had thrown off her state and gone to kew to have an hour of childhood over again in a romp with the others when she was startled by the announcement of a male visitornone other than mr neigh  ethelbertas attitude on receipt of this information sufficiently expressed a revived sense that the incidence of mr neigh on her path might have a meaning after all  neigh had certainly said he was going to marry her and now here he was come to her housejust as if he meant to do it forthwith  she had mentally discarded him yet she felt a shock which was scarcely painful and a dread which was almost exhilarating her flying visit to farnfield she thought little of at this moment  from the fact that the mind prefers imaginings to recapitulation conjecture to history ethelberta had dwelt more upon neighs possible plans and anticipations than upon the incidents of her evening journey and the former assumed a more distinct shape in her minds eye than anything on the visible side of the curtain  neigh was perhaps not quite so placidly nonchalant as in ordinary still he was by far the most trying visitor that ethelberta had lately faced and she could not get above the stagenot a very high one for the mistress of a houseof feeling her personality to be inconveniently in the way of his eyes  he had somewhat the bearing of a man who was going to do without any fuss what gushing people would call a philanthropic action  i have been intending to write a line to you said neigh but i felt that i could not be sure of writing my meaning in a way which might please you  i am not bright at a letternever was  the question i mean is one that i hope you will be disposed to answer favourably even though i may show the awkwardness of a fellowperson who has never put such a question before  will you give me a word of encouragementjust a hope that i may not be unacceptable as a husband to you  your talents are very great and of course i know that i have nothing at all in that way still people are happy together sometimes in spite of such things  will you say yes and settle it now  i was not expecting you had come upon such an errand as this said she looking up a little but mostly looking down  i cannot say what you wish mr neigh  perhaps i have been too sudden and presumptuous  yes i know i have been that  however directly i saw you i felt that nobody ever came so near my idea of what is desirable in a lady and it occurred to me that only one obstacle should stand in the way of the natural results which obstacle would be your refusal  in common kindness consider  i daresay i am judged to be a man of inattentive habitsi know thats what you think of me but under your influence i should be very different so pray do not let your dislike to little matters influence you  i would not indeed  but believe me there can be no discussion of marriage between us said ethelberta decisively  if thats the case i may as well say no more  to burden you with my regrets would be out of place i suppose said neigh looking calmly out of the window  apart from personal feeling there are considerations which would prevent what you contemplated she murmured  my affairs are too lengthy intricate and unpleasant for me to explain to anybody at present  and that would be a necessary first step  not at all  i cannot think that preliminary to be necessary at all  i would put my lawyer in communication with yours and we would leave the rest to them i believe that is the proper way  you could say anything in confidence to your familyman and you could inquire through him anything you might wish to know about myabout me  all you would need to say to myself are just the two little wordsi will in the church here at the end of the crescent  i am sorry to pain you mr neighso sorry said ethelberta  but i cannot say them  she was rather distressed that despite her discouraging words he still went on with his purpose as if he imagined what she so distinctly said to be no bar but rather a stimulant usual under the circumstances  it does not matter about paining me said neigh  dont take that into consideration at all  but i did not expect you to leave me so entirely without helpto refuse me absolutely as far as words goafter what you did  if it had not been for that i should never have ventured to call  i might otherwise have supposed your interest to be fixed in another quarter but your acting in that manner encouraged me to think you could listen to a word  what do you allude to said ethelberta  how have i acted  neigh appeared reluctant to go any further but the allusion soon became sufficiently clear  i wish my little place at farnfield had been worthier of you he said brusquely  however thats a matter of time only  it is useless to build a house there yet  i wish i had known that you would be looking over it at that time of the evening  a single word when we were talking about it the other day that you were going to be in the neighbourhood would have been sufficient  nothing could have given me so much delight as to have driven you round  he knew that she had been to farnfield that knowledge was what had inspired him to call upon her today  ethelberta breathed a sort of exclamation not right out but stealthily like a parsons damn  her face did not change since a face must be said not to change while it preserves the same pleasant lines in the mobile parts as before but anybody who has preserved his pleasant lines under the halfminutes peer of the invidious camera and found what a wizened starched kind of thing they stiffen to towards the end of the time will understand the tendency of ethelbertas lovely features now  yes i walked round said ethelberta faintly  neigh was decidedly master of the position at last but he spoke as if he did not value that  his knowledge had furnished him with grounds for calling upon her and he hastened to undeceive her from supposing that he could think ill of any motive of hers which gave him those desirable grounds  i supposed you by that to give some little thought to me occasionally he resumed in the same slow and orderly tone  how could i help thinking so  it was your doing that which encouraged me  now was it not naturali put it to you  ethelberta was almost exasperated at perceiving the awful extent to which she had compromised herself with this man by her impulsive visit  lightly and philosophically as he seemed to take itas a thing in short which every woman would do by nature unless hindered by difficultiesit was no trifle to her as long as he was ignorant of her justification and this she determined that he should know at once at all hazards  it was through you in the first place that i did look into your grounds she said excitedly  it was your presumption that caused me to go there  i should not have thought of such a thing else  if you had not said what you did say i never should have thought of you or farnfield eitherfarnfield might have been in kamtschatka for all i cared  i hope sincerely that i never said anything to disturb you  yes you didnot to me but to somebody said ethelberta with her eyes overfull of retained tears  what have i said to somebody that can be in the least objectionable to you inquired neigh with much concern  you saidyou said you meant to marry mejust as if i had no voice in the matter  and that annoyed me and made me go there out of curiosity  neigh changed colour a little  well i did say it i own that i said it he replied at last  probably he knew enough of her nature not to feel long disconcerted by her disclosure however she might have become possessed of the information  the explanation was certainly a great excuse to her curiosity but if ethelberta had tried she could not have given him a better ground for making light of her objections to his suit i felt that i must marry you that we were predestined to marry ages ago and i feel it still he continued with listless ardour  you seem to regret your interest in farnfield but to me it is a charm and has been ever since i heard of it  if you only knew all she said helplessly showing without perceiving it an unnecessary humility in the remark since there was no more reason just then that she should go into details about her life than that he should about his  but melancholy and mistaken thoughts of herself as a counterfeit had brought her to this  i do not wish to know more said neigh  and would you marry any woman offhand without being thoroughly acquainted with her circumstances she said looking at him curiously and with a little admiration for his unconscionably phlegmatic treatment of her motives in going to farnfield had a not unbecoming daring about it in ethelbertas eye  i would marry a woman offhand when that woman is you  i would make you mine this moment did i dare or to speak with absolute accuracy within twentyfour hours  do assent to it dear mrs petherwin and let me be sure of you for ever  ill drive to doctors commons this minute and meet you tomorrow morning at nine in the church just below  it is a simple impulse but i would adhere to it in the coolest moment  shall it be arranged in that way instead of our waiting through the ordinary routine of preparation  i am not a youth now but i can see the bliss of such an act as that and the contemptible nature of methodical proceedings beside it  he had taken her hand  ethelberta gave it a subtle movement backwards to imply that he was not to retain the prize and said one whose inner life is almost unknown to you and whom you have scarcely seen except at other peoples houses  we know each other far better than we may think at first said neigh we are not people to love in a hurry and i have not done so in this case  as for worldly circumstances the most important items in a marriage contract are the persons themselves and as far as i am concerned if i get a lady fair and wise i care for nothing further  i know you are beautiful for all london owns it i know you are talented for i have read your poetry and heard your romances and i know you are politic and discreet  for i have examined your property said she with a weak smile  neigh bowed  and what more can i wish to know  come shall it be  certainly not tomorrow  i would be entirely in your hands in that matter  i will not urge you to be precipitatei could not expect you to be ready yet  my suddenness perhaps offended you but having thought deeply of this bright possibility i was apt to forget the forbearance that one ought to show at first in mentioning it  if i have done wrong forgive me  i will think of that said ethelberta with a cooler manner  but seriously all these words are nothing to the purpose  i must remark that i prize your friendship but it is not for me to marry now  you have convinced me of your goodness of heart and freedom from unworthy suspicions let that be enough  the best way in which i in my turn can convince you of my goodness of heart is by asking you to see me in private no more  and do you refuse to think of me as   why do you treat me like that after all said neigh surprised at this want of harmony with his principle that one convert to matrimony could always find a second ready made  i cannot explain i cannot explain said she impatiently  i would and i would notexplain i mean not marry  i dont love anybody and i have no heart left for beginning  it is only honest in me to tell you that i am interested in watching another mans career though that is not to the point either for no close relationship with him is contemplated but i do not wish to speak of this any more  do not press me to it  certainly i will not said neigh seeing that she was distressed and sorrowful  but do consider me and my wishes i have a right to ask it for it is only asking a continuance of what you have already begun to do tomorrow i believe i shall have the happiness of seeing you again  she did not say no and long after the door had closed upon him she remained fixed in thought  how can he be blamed for his manner she said after knowing what i did  ethelberta as she sat felt herself much less a petherwin than a chickerel much less a poetess richly freighted with fancy than an adventuress with a nebulous prospect  neigh was one of the few men whose presence seemed to attenuate her dignity in some mysterious way to its very least proportions and that act of espial which had so quickly and inexplicably come to his knowledge helped his influence still more  she knew little of the nature of the town bachelor there were opaque depths in him which her thoughts had never definitely plumbed  notwithstanding her exaltation to the atmosphere of the petherwin family ethelberta was very far from having the thoroughbred london womans knowledge of sets grades coteries cliques forms glosses and niceties particularly on the masculine side  setting the years from her infancy to her first look into town against those linking that epoch with the present the former period covered not only the greater time but contained the mass of her most vivid impressions of life and its ways  but in recognizing her ignorance of the ratio between words to women and deeds to women in the ethical code of the bachelor of the club she forgot that human nature in the gross differs little with situation and that a gift which if the germs were lacking no amount of training in clubs and coteries could supply was motherwit like her own     27 mrs belmainescripplegate church   neighs remark that he believed he should see ethelberta again the next day referred to a contemplated pilgrimage of an unusual sort which had been arranged for that day by mrs belmaine upon the ground of an incidental suggestion of ethelbertas  one afternoon in the week previous they had been chatting over tea at the house of the former lady neigh being present as a casual caller when the conversation was directed upon milton by somebody opening a volume of the poets works that lay on a table near     milton thou shouldst be living at this hour    england hath need of thee  said mrs belmaine with the degree of flippancy which is considered correct for immortal verse the bible god etc in these days  and ethelberta replied lit up by a quick remembrance it is a good time to talk of milton for i have been much impressed by reading the life and i have decided to go and see his tomb  could we not all go  we ought to quicken our memories of the great and of where they lie by such a visit occasionally  we ought said mrs belmaine  and why shouldnt we continued ethelberta with interest  to westminster abbey said mr belmaine a common man of thirty younger than his wife who had lately come into the room  no to where he lies comparatively alonecripplegate church  i always thought that milton was buried in poets corner said mr belmaine  so did i said neigh but i have such an indifferent head for places that my thinking goes for nothing  well it would be a pretty thing to do said mrs belmaine and instructive to all of us  if mrs petherwin would like to go i should we can take you in the carriage and call round for mrs doncastle on our way and set you both down again coming back  that would be excellent said ethelberta  there is nowhere i like going to so much as the depths of the city  the absurd narrowness of worldrenowned streets is so surprisingso crooked and shady as they are too and full of the quaint smells of old cupboards and cellars  walking through one of them reminds me of being at the bottom of some crevasse or gorge the proper surface of the globe being the tops of the houses  you will come to take care of us john  and you mr neigh would like to come  we will tell mr ladywell that he may join us if he cares to said mrs belmaine  o yes said her husband quietly and neigh said he should like nothing better after a faint aspect of apprehension at the remoteness of the idea from the daily track of his thoughts  mr belmaine observing this and mistaking it for an indication that neigh had been dragged into the party against his will by his overhasty wife arranged that neigh should go independently and meet them there at the hour named if he chose to do so to give him an opportunity of staying away  ethelberta also was by this time doubting if she had not been too eager with her proposal  to go on such a sentimental errand might be thought by her friends to be simply troublesome their adherence having been given only in the regular course of complaisance  she was still comparatively an outsider here her life with lady petherwin having been passed chiefly in alternations between english wateringplaces and continental towns  however it was too late now to muse on this and it may be added that from first to last ethelberta never discovered from the belmaines whether her proposal had been an infliction or a charm so perfectly were they practised in sustaining that complete divorce between thinking and saying which is the hallmark of high civilization  but however she might doubt the belmaines she had no doubt as to neighs true sentiments the time had come when he notwithstanding his air of being oppressed by almost every lively invention of town and country for charming griefs to rest would not be at all oppressed by a quiet visit to the purlieus of st giless cripplegate since she was the originator and was going herself  it was a bright hopeinspiring afternoon in this midmay time when the carriage containing mr and mrs belmaine mrs doncastle and ethelberta crept along the encumbered streets towards barbican till turning out of that thoroughfare into redcross street they beheld the bold shape of the old tower they sought clothed in every neutral shade standing clear against the sky dusky and grim in its upper stage and hoary grey below where every corner of every stone was completely rounded off by the waves of wind and storm  all people were busy here our visitors seemed to be the only idle persons the city contained and there was no dissonancethere never isbetween antiquity and such beehive industry for pure industry in failing to observe its own existence and aspect partakes of the unobtrusive nature of material things  this intramural stir was a flywheel transparent by excessive motion through which milton and his day could be seen as if nothing intervened  had there been ostensibly harmonious accessories a crowd of observing people in search of the poetical conscious of the place and the scene what a discord would have arisen there  but everybody passed by miltons grave except ethelberta and her friends and for the moment the citys less invidious conduct appeared to her more respectful as a practice than her own  but she was brought out of this rumination by the halt at the church door and completely reminded of the present by finding the church open and neighthe till yesterday unimpassioned neighwaiting in the vestibule to receive them just as if he lived there  ladywell had not arrived  it was a long time before ethelberta could get back to milton again for neigh was continuing to impend over her future more and more visibly  the objects along the journey had distracted her mind from him but the moment now was as a direct renewal and prolongation of the declarationtime yesterday and as if in furtherance of the conclusion of the episode  they all alighted and went in the coachman being told to take the carriage to a quiet nook further on and return in halfanhour  mrs belmaine and her carriage some years before had accidentally got jammed crosswise in cheapside through the clumsiness of the man in turning up a side street blocking that great artery of the civilized world for the space of a minute and a half when they were pounced upon by halfadozen policemen and forced to back ignominiously up a little slit between the houses where they did not mean to go amid the shouts of the hindered drivers and it was her nervous recollection of that event which caused mrs belmaine to be so precise in her directions now  by the time that they were grouped around the tomb the visit had assumed a much more solemn complexion than any one among them had anticipated ashamed of the influence that she discovered neigh to be exercising over her and opposing it steadily ethelberta drew from her pocket a small edition of milton and proposed that she should read a few lines from paradise lost  the responsibility of producing a successful afternoon was upon her shoulders she was moreover the only one present who could properly manage blank verse and this was sufficient to justify the proposal  she stood with her head against the marble slab just below the bust and began a selected piece neigh standing a few yards off on her right looking into his hat in order to listen accurately mr and mrs belmaine and mrs doncastle seating themselves in a pew directly facing the monument  the ripe warm colours of afternoon came in upon them from the west upon the sallow piers and arches and the infinitely deep brown pews beneath the aisle over ethelbertas head being in misty shade through which glowed a lurid light from a darkstained window behind  the sentences fell from her lips in a rhythmical cadence one by one and she could be fancied a priestess of him before whose image she stood when with a vivid suggestiveness she delivered here not many yards from the central moneymill of the world yet out from the very tomb of their author the passage containing the words           mammon led them on    mammon the least erected spirit that fell    from heaven  when she finished reading ethelberta left the monument and then each one present strayed independently about the building ethelberta turning to the left along the passage to the south door  neighfrom whose usually apathetic face and eyes there had proceeded a secret smouldering light as he listened and regarded herfollowed in the same direction and vanished at her heels into the churchyard whither she had now gone  mr and mrs belmaine exchanged glances and instead of following the pair they went with mrs doncastle into the vestry to inquire of the person in charge for the register of the marriage of oliver cromwell which was solemnized here  the church was now quite empty and its stillness was as a vacuum into which an occasional noise from the street overflowed and became rarefied away to nothing  something like five minutes had passed when a hansom stopped outside the door and ladywell entered the porch  he stood still and looking inquiringly round for a minute or two sat down in one of the high pews as if under the impression that the others had not yet arrived  while he sat here neigh reappeared at the south door opposite and came slowly in  ladywell in rising to go to him saw that neighs attention was engrossed by something he held in his hand  it was his pocketbook and neigh was looking at a few loose flowerpetals which had been placed between the pages  when ladywell came forward neigh looked up started and closed the book quickly so that some of the petals fluttered to the ground between the two men  they were striped red and white and appeared to be leaves of the harlequin rose  ah here you are ladywell he said recovering himself  we had given you up my aunt said that you would not care to come  they are all in the vestry  how it came to pass that neigh designated those in the vestry as all when there was one in the churchyard was a thing that he himself could hardly have explained so much more had it to do with instinct than with calculation  never mind themdont interrupt them said ladywell  the plain truth is that i have been very greatly disturbed in mind and i could not appear earlier by reason of it  i had some doubt about coming at all  i am sorry to hear that  neighi may as well tell you and have done with it  i have found that a lady of my acquaintance has two strings to her bow or i am very much in error  whatmrs petherwin said neigh uneasily  but i thought thatthat fancy was over with you long ago  even your acquaintance with her was at an end i thought  in a measure it is at an end  but let me tell you that what you call a fancy has been anything but a fancy with me to be over like a spring shower  to speak plainly neigh i consider myself badly used by that woman damn badly used  badly used said neigh mechanically and wondering all the time if ladywell had been informed that ethelberta was to be one of the party to day  well i ought not to talk like that said ladywell adopting a lighter tone  all is fair in courtship i suppose now as ever  indeed i mean to put a good face upon it if i am beaten i am  but it is very provoking after supposing matters to be going on smoothly to find out that you are quite mistaken  i told you you were quite mistaken in supposing she cared for you  that is just the point i was not mistaken in said ladywell warmly she did care for me and i stood as well with her as any man could stand until this fellow came whoever he is  i sometimes feel so disturbed about it that i have a good mind to call upon her and ask his name wouldnt you neigh  will you accompany me  i would in a moment but but i strongly advise you not to go said neigh earnestly  it would be rash you know and rather unmannerly and would only hurt your feelings  well i am always ready to yield to a friends arguments     a sneaking scamp thats what he is  why does he not show himself  dont you really know who he is said neigh in a pronounced and exceptional tone on purpose to give ladywell a chance of suspecting for the position was getting awkward  but ladywell was blind as bartimeus in that direction so well had indifference to ethelbertas charms been feigned by neigh until he thought seriously of marrying her  yet unfortunately for the interests of calmness ladywell was less blind with his outward eye  in his reflections his glance had lingered again upon the pocketbook which neigh still held in his hand and upon the two or three roseleaves on the floor until he said idly superimposing humorousness upon misery as men in love can  roseleaves neigh  i thought you did not care for flowers  what makes you amuse yourself with such sentimental objects as those only fit for women or painters like me  if i had not observed you with my own eyes i should have said that you were about the last man in the world to care for things of that sort  whatever makes you keep roseleaves in your pocketbook  the best reason on earth said neigh  a woman gave them to me  that proves nothing unless she is a great deal to you said ladywell with the experienced air of a man who whatever his inferiority in years to neigh was far beyond him in knowledge of that sort by virtue of his recent trials  she is a great deal to me  if i did not know you to be such a confirmed misogynist i should say that this is a serious matter  it is serious said neigh quietly  the probability is that i shall marry the woman who gave me these  anyhow i have asked her the question and she has not altogether said no  i am glad to hear it neigh said ladywell heartily  i am glad to hear that your star is higher than mine  before neigh could make further reply ladywell was attracted by the glow of green sunlight reflected through the south door by the grass of the churchyard now in all its spring freshness and luxuriance  he bent his steps thither followed anxiously by neigh  i had no idea there was such a lovely green spot in the city ladywell continued passing out  trees too planted in the manner of an orchard what a charming place  the place was truly charming just at that date  the untainted leaves of the lime and plane trees and the newlysprung grass had in the sun a brilliancy of beauty that was brought into extraordinary prominence by the sable soil showing here and there and the charcoaled stems and trunks out of which the leaves budded they seemed an importation not a produce and their delicacy such as would perish in a day  what is this round tower ladywell said again walking towards the iron grey bastion partly covered with ivy and virginia creeper which stood obtruding into the enclosure  o didnt you know that was here  thats a piece of the old city wall said neigh looking furtively around at the same time  behind the bastion the churchyard ran into a long narrow strip grassed like the other part but completely hidden from it by the cylinder of ragged masonry  on rounding this projection ladywell beheld within a few feet of him a lady whom he knew too well  mrs petherwin here exclaimed he proving how ignorant he had been of the composition of the party he was to meet and accounting at the same time for his laxity in attending it  i forgot to tell you said neigh awkwardly behind him that mrs petherwin was to come with us  ethelbertas look was somewhat blushful and agitated as if from some late transaction she appeared to have been secluding herself there till she should have recovered her equanimity  however she came up to him and said i did not see you before this moment we had been thinking you would not come  while these words were being prettily spoken ladywells face became pale as death  on ethelbertas bosom were the stem and green calyx of a rose almost all its flower having disappeared  it had been a harlequin rose for two or three of its striped leaves remained to tell the tale  she could not help noticing his fixed gaze and she said quickly yes i have lost my pretty rose this may as well go now and she plucked the stem from its fastening in her dress and flung it away  poor ladywell turned round to meet mr and mrs belmaine whose voices were beginning to be heard just within the church door leaving neigh and ethelberta together  it was a graceful act of young ladywells that in the midst of his own pain at the strange tale the roseleaves suggestedneighs rivalry ethelbertas mutability his own defeathe was not regardless of the intense embarrassment which might have been caused had he remained  the two were silent at first and it was evident that ethelbertas mood was one of anger at something that had gone before  she turned aside from him to follow the others when neigh spoke in a tone somewhat bitter and somewhat stern  whatgoing like that  after being compromised together why dont you close with me  ladywell knows all i had already told him that the rose leaves were given me by my intended wife  we seem to him to be practising deceptions all of a piece and what folly it is to play off so  as to what i did that i ask your forgiveness for  ethelberta looked upon the ground and maintained a compressed lip  neigh resumed if i showed more feeling than you care for i insist that it was not more than was natural under the circumstances if not quite proper  opinions may differ but my experience goes to prove that conventional squeamishness at such times as these is more talked and written about than practised  plain behaviour must be expected when marriage is the question  nevertheless i do sayand i cannot say morethat i am sincerely sorry to have offended you by exceeding my privileges  i will never do so again  dont say privileges  you have none  i am sorry that i thought otherwise and that others will think so too ladywell is at any rate bent on thinking so     it might have been made known to him in a gentle waybut god disposes  there is nothing to make knowni dont understand said ethelberta going from him  by this time ladywell had walked round the gravel walks with the two other ladies and mr belmaine and they were all turning to come back again  the young painter had deputed his voice to reply to their remarks but his understanding continued poring upon other things  when he came up to ethelberta his agitation had left him she too was free from constraint while neigh was some distance off carefully examining nothing in particular in an old fragment of wall  the little party was now united again as to its persons though in spirit far otherwise  they went through the church in general talk ladywell sad but serene and ethelberta keeping farremoved both from him and from neigh  she had at this juncture entered upon that sphinxlike stage of existence in which contrary to her earlier manner she signified to no one of her ways plans or sensations and spoke little on any subject at all  there were occasional smiles now which came only from the face and speeches from the lips merely  the journey home was performed as they had come ladywell not accepting the seat in neighs cab which was phlegmatically offered him  mrs doncastles acquaintance with ethelberta had been slight until this day but the afternoons proceeding had much impressed the matron with her younger friend  before they parted she said with the sort of affability which is meant to signify the beginning of permanent friendship a friend of my husbands lord mountclere has been anxious for some time to meet you  he is a great admirer of the poems and more still of the storytelling invention and your power in it  he has been present many times at the mayfair hall to hear you  when will you dine with us to meet him  i know you will like him  will thursday be convenient  ethelberta stood for a moment reflecting and reflecting hoped that mrs doncastle had not noticed her momentary perplexity  crises were becoming as common with her as blackberries and she had foreseen this one a long time  it was not that she was to meet lord mountclere for he was only a name and a distant profile to her it was that her father would necessarily be present at the meeting in the most anomalous position that human nature could endure  however having often proved in her disjointed experience that the shortest way out of a difficulty lies straight through it ethelberta decided to dine at the doncastles and as she murmured that she should have great pleasure in meeting any friend of theirs set about contriving how the encounter with her dearest relative might be made safe and unsuspected  she bade them adieu blithely but the thoughts engendered by the invitation stood before her as sorrowful and rayless ghosts which could not be laid  often at such conjunctures as these when the futility of her great undertaking was more than usually manifest did ethelberta long like a tired child for the conclusion of the whole matter when her work should be over and the evening come when she might draw her boat upon the shore and in some thymy nook await eternal night with a placid mind     28 ethelbertasmr chickerels room   the question of neigh or no neigh had reached a pitch of insistence which no longer permitted of dallying even by a popular beauty  his character was becoming defined to ethelberta as something very differently composed from that of her first imagining  she had set him down to be a man whose external in excitability owed nothing to selfrepression but stood as the natural surface of the mass within  neighs urban torpor she said might have been in the first instance produced by art but were it thus it had gone so far as to permeate him  this had been disproved first surprisingly by his reported statement wondrously in the second place by his call upon her and sudden proposal thirdly to a degree simply astounding by what had occurred in the city that day  for neigh before the fervour had subsided which was produced in him by her look and general power while reading paradise lost found himself alone with her in a nook outside the church and there had almost demanded her promise to be his wife  she had replied by asking for time and idly offering him the petals of her rose that had shed themselves in her hand  neigh in taking them pressed her fingers more warmly than she thought she had given him warrant for which offended her  it was certainly a very momentary affair and when it was over seemed to surprise himself almost as much as it had vexed her but it had reminded her of one truth which she was in danger of forgetting  the town gentleman was not half so far removed from sol and dan and the hardhanded order in general in his passions as in his philosophy  he still continued to be the male of his species and when the heart was hot with a dream pall mall had much the same aspect as wessex  well she had not accepted him yet indeed for the moment they were in a pet with one another  yet that might soon be cleared off and then recurred the perpetual question would the advantage that might accrue to her people by her marriage be worth the sacrifice  one palliative feature must be remembered when we survey the matrimonial ponderings of the poetess and romancer  what she contemplated was not meanly to ensnare a husband just to provide incomes for her and her family but to find some man she might respect who would maintain her in such a stage of comfort as should by setting her mind free from temporal anxiety enable her to further organize her talent and provide incomes for them herself  plenty of saleable originality was left in her as yet but it was getting crushed under the rubbish of her necessities  she was not sure that neigh would stand the test of her revelations  it would be possible to lead him to marry her without revealing anythingthe events of the last few days had shown her thatyet ethelbertas honesty shrank from the safe course of holding her tongue  it might be pleasant to many a modern gentleman to find himself allied with a lady none of whose ancestors had ever pandered to a court lost an army taken a bribe oppressed a community or broken a bank but the added disclosure that in avoiding these stains her kindred had worked and continued to work with their hands for bread might lead such an one to consider that the novelty was dearly purchased  ethelberta was upon the whole dissatisfied with her progress thus far she had planned many things and fulfilled few  had her father been by this time provided for and made independent of the world as she had thought he might be not only would her course with regard to neigh be quite clear but the impending awkwardness of dining with her father behind her chair could not have occurred  true that was a small matter beside her regret for his own sake that he was still in harness and a mere change of occupation would be but a tribute to a fastidiousness which he did not himself share  she had frequently tried to think of a vocation for him that would have a more dignified sound and be less dangerously close to her own path the post of caretaker at some provincial library country stationer registrar of births and deaths and many others had been discussed and dismissed in face of the unmanageable fact that her father was serenely happy and comfortable as a butler looking with dread at any hint of change short of perfect retirement  since then she could not offer him this retirement what right had she to interfere with his mode of life at all  in no other social groove on earth would he thrive as he throve in his present one to which he had been accustomed from boyhood and where the remuneration was actually greater than in professions ten times as stately in name  for the rest too ethelberta had indulged in hopes the high education of the younger ones being the chief of these darling wishes  picotee wanted looking to badly enough  sol and dan required no material help they had quickly obtained good places of work under a pimlico builder for though the brothers scarcely showed as yet the lightfingered deftness of london artizans the want was in a measure compensated by their painstaking and employers are far from despising country hands who bring with them strength industry and a desire to please  but their sister had other lines laid down for them than those of level progress to start them some day as masters instead of men was a longcherished wish of ethelbertas  thus she had quite enough machinery in her hands to keep decently going even were she to marry a man who would take a kindly view of her peculiar situation and afford her opportunities of strengthening her powers for her kindreds good  but what would be the result if eighteen months hencethe date at which her occupation of the house in exonbury crescent came to an endshe were still a widow with no accumulated capital her platform talents grown homely and stunted through narrow living and her tender vein of poesy completely dispersed by it  to calmly relinquish the struggle at that point would have been the act of a stoic but not of a woman particularly when she considered the children the hopes of her mother for them and her own conditionthough this was leastunder the ironical cheers which would greet a slip back into the mire  it here becomes necessary to turn for a moment to master joey chickerel ethelbertas troublesome page and brother  the face of this juvenile was that of a graecoroman satyr to the furthest degree of completeness viewed in front the outer line of his upper lip rose in a double arch nearly to his little round nostrils giving an expression of a jollity so delicious to himself as to compel a perpetual drawing in of his breath during halflaughs his lips parted in the middle and remained closed at the corners which were small round pits like his nostrils the same form being repeated as dimples a little further back upon his cheek  the opening for each eye formed a sparkling crescent both upper and under lid having the convexity upwards  but during some few days preceding the dinnerparty at the doncastles all this changed  the luxuriant curves departed a compressed lineality was to be observed everywhere the pupils of his eyes seemed flattened and the carriage of his head was limp and sideways  this was a feature so remarkable and new in him that picotee noticed it and was lifted from the melancholy current of her own affairs in contemplating his  well whats the matter said picotee  onothing said joey  nothing  how can you say so  the worlds a holler mockerythats what i say  yes so it is to some but not to you said picotee sighing  dont talk argument picotee  i only hope youll never feel what i feel now  if it wasnt for my juties here i know what id do id list thats what id do  but having my position to fill here as the only responsible manservant in the house i cant leave  has anybody been beating you  beating  do i look like a person who gets beatings  no it is a madness said joey putting his hand upon his chest  the case is i am in love  o joey a boy no bigger than you are said picotee reprovingly  her personal interest in the passion however provoked her to inquire in the next breath who is it  do tell joey  no bigger than i  what hev bigness to do with it  thats just like your oldfashioned notions  bigness is no more wanted in courting nowadays than in soldiering or smoking or any other duty of man  husbands is rare and a promising courter who means business will fetch his price in these times big or small i assure ye  i might have been engaged a dozen times over as far as the bigness goes  you should see what a miserable little fellow my rival is afore you talk like that  now you know ive got a rival perhaps youll own there must be something in it  yes that seems like the real thing  but who is the young woman  well i dont mind telling you picotee  it is mrs doncastles new maid  i called to see father last night and had supper there and you should have seen how lovely she wereeating sparrowgrass sideways as if she were born to it  but of course theres a rivalthere always isi might have known that and i will crush him  but mrs doncastles new maidif that was she i caught a glimpse of the other dayis ever so much older than youa dozen years  whats that to a man in love  poohi wish you would leave me picotee i wants to be alone  a short time after this picotee was in the company of ethelberta and she took occasion to mention joeys attachment  ethelberta grew exceedingly angry directly she heard of it  what a fearful nuisance that boy is becoming she said  does father know anything of this  i think not said picotee  o no he cannot he would not allow any such thing to go on she is so much older than joey  i should think he wouldnt allow it  the fact is i must be more strict about this growing friendliness between you all and the doncastle servants  there shall be absolutely no intimacy or visiting of any sort when father wants to see any of you he must come here unless there is a most serious reason for your calling upon him  some disclosure or reference to me otherwise than as your mistress will certainly be made else and then i am ruined  i will speak to father myself about joeys absurd nonsense this evening  i am going to see him on another matter and ethelberta sighed  i am to dine there on thursday she added  to dine there berta  well that is a strange thing  why father will be close to you  yes said ethelberta quietly  how i should like to see you sitting at a grand dinnertable among lordly dishes and shining people and father about the room unnoticed berta i have never seen a dinnerparty in my life and father said that i should some day he promised me long ago  how will he be able to carry out that my dear child said ethelberta drawing her sister gently to her side  father says that for an hour and a half the guests are quite fixed in the diningroom and as unlikely to move as if they were trees planted round the table  do let me go and see you berta picotee added coaxingly  i would give anything to see how you look in the midst of elegant people talking and laughing and you my own sister all the time and me looking on like pussinthecorner  ethelberta could hardly resist the entreaty in spite of her recent resolution  we will leave that to be considered when i come home tonight she said  i must hear what father says  after dark the same evening a woman dressed in plain black and wearing a hood went to the servants entrance of mr doncastles house and inquired for mr chickerel  ethelberta found him in a room by himself and on entering she closed the door behind her and unwrapped her face  can you sit with me a few minutes father she said  yes for a quarter of an hour or so said the butler  has anything happened  i thought it might be picotee  no  alls well yet  but i thought it best to see you upon one or two matters which are harassing me a little just now  the first is that stupid boy joey has got entangled in some way with the ladysmaid at this house a ridiculous affair it must be by all account but it is too serious for me to treat lightly  she will worm everything out of him and a pretty business it will be then  god bless my soul why the woman is old enough to be his mother  i have never heard a sound of it till now  what do you propose to do  i have hardly thought i cannot tell at all  but we will consider that after i have done  the next thing is i am to dine here thursdaythat is tomorrow  you going to dine here are you said her father in surprise  dear me thats news  we have a dinnerparty tomorrow but i was not aware that you knew our people  i have accepted the invitation said ethelberta  but if you think i had better stay away i will get out of it by some means  heavens what does that meanwill anybody come in she added rapidly pulling up her hood and jumping from the seat as the loud tones of a bell clanged forth in startling proximity  o noit is all safe said her father  it is the area doornothing to do with me  about the dinner i dont see why you may not come  of course you will take no notice of me nor shall i of you  it is to be rather a large party  lord whatshisname is coming and several good people  yes he is coming to meet me it appears  but father she said more softly and slowly how wrong it will be for me to come so close to you and never recognize you  i dont like it  i wish you could have given up service by this time it would have been so much less painful for us all round  i thought we might have been able to manage it somehow  nonsense nonsense said mr chickerel crossly  there is not the least reason why i should give up  i want to save a little money first if you dont like me as i am you must keep away from me  dont be uneasy about my comfort i am right enough thank god  i can mind myself for many a year yet  ethelberta looked at him with tears in her eyes but she did not speak she never could help crying when she met her father here  i have been in service now for more than sevenandthirty years her father went on  it is an honourable calling and why should you maintain me because you can earn a few pounds by your gifts and an old woman left you her house and a few sticks of furniture  if she had left you any money it would have been a different thing but as you have to work for every penny you get i cannot think of it  suppose i should agree to come and live with you and then you should be ill or such like and i no longer able to help myself  o no ill stick where i am for here i am safe as to food and shelter at any rate  surely ethelberta it is only right that i who ought to keep you all should at least keep your mother and myself  as to our position that we cannot help and i dont mind that you are unable to own me  i wish i could own youall of you  well you chose your course my dear and you must abide by it  having put your hand to the plough it will be foolish to turn back  it would i suppose  yet i wish i could get a living by some simple humble occupation and drop the name of petherwin and be berta chickerel again and live in a green cottage as we used to do when i was small  i am miserable to a pitiable degree sometimes and sink into regrets that i ever fell into such a groove as this  i dont like covert deeds such as coming here tonight and many are necessary with me from time to time there is something without which splendid energies are a drug and that is a cold heart  there is another thing necessary to energy toothe power of distinguishing your visions from your reasonable forecasts when looking into the future so as to allow your energy to lay hold of the forecasts only  i begin to have a fear that mother is right when she implies that i undertook to carry out visions and all  but ten of us are so many to cope with  if god almighty had only killed off threequarters of us when we were little a body might have done something for the rest but as we are it is hopeless  there is no use in your going into high doctrine like that said chickerel  as i said before you chose your course  you have begun to fly high and you had better keep there  and to do that there is only one waythat is to do it surely so that i have some groundwork to enable me to keep up to the mark in my profession  that way is marriage  marriage  who are you going to marry  god knows  perhaps lord mountclere  stranger things have happened  yes so they have though not many wretcheder things  i would sooner see you in your grave ethelberta than lord mountcleres wife or the wife of anybody like him great as the honour would be  of course that was only something to say i dont know the man even  i know his valet  however marry who you may i hope youll be happy my dear girl  you would be still more divided from us in that event but when your mother and i are dead it will make little difference  ethelberta placed her hand upon his shoulder and smiled cheerfully now father dont despond  all will be well and we shall see no such misfortune as that for many a year  leave all to me  i am a rare hand at contrivances  you are indeed berta  it seems to me quite wonderful that we should be living so near together and nobody suspect the relationship because of the precautions you have taken  yet the precautions were rather lady petherwins than mine as you know consider how she kept me abroad  my marriage being so secret made it easy to cut off all traces unless anybody had made it a special business to search for them  that people should suspect as yet would be by far the more wonderful thing of the two  but we must for one thing have no visiting between our girls and the servants here or they soon will suspect  ethelberta then laid down a few laws on the subject and explaining the other details of her visit told her father soon that she must leave him  he took her along the passage and into the area  they were standing at the bottom of the steps saying a few parting words about picotees visit to see the dinner when a female figure appeared by the railing above slipped in at the gate and flew down the steps past the father and daughter  at the moment of passing she whispered breathlessly to him is that you mr chickerel  yes said the butler  she tossed into his arms a quantity of wearing apparel and adding please take them upstairs for mei am late rushed into the house  good heavens what does that mean said ethelberta holding her fathers arm in her uneasiness  thats the new ladysmaid just come in from an evening walkthat young scamps sweetheart if what you tell me is true  i dont yet know what her character is but she runs neck and neck with time closer than any woman i ever met  she stays out at night like this till the last moment and often throws off her dashing courtingclothes in this way as she runs down the steps to save a journey to the top of the house to her room before going to mrs doncastles who is in fact at this minute waiting for her  only look here  chickerel gathered up a hat decked with feathers and flowers a parasol and a light muslin trainskirt out of the pocket of the latter tumbling some long golden tresses of hair  what an extraordinary woman said ethelberta  a perfect cinderella the idea of joey getting desperate about a woman like that no doubt she has just come in from meeting him  no doubta blockhead  thats his taste is it  ill soon see if i cant cure his taste if it inclines towards mrs menlove  mrs what  menlove thats her name  she came about a fortnight ago  and is that menlovewhat shall we do exclaimed ethelberta  the idea of the boy singling out herwhy it is ruin to him to me and to us all  she hastily explained to her father that menlove had been lady petherwins maid and her own at some time before the death of her mother inlaw that she had only stayed with them through a three months tour because of her flightiness and hence had learnt nothing of ethelbertas history and probably had never thought at all about it  but nevertheless they were as well acquainted as a lady and her maid well could be in the time  like all such doubtful characters continued ethelberta she was one of the cleverest and lightesthanded women we ever had about us  when she first came my hair was getting quite weak but by brushing it every day in a peculiar manner and treating it as only she knew how she brought it into splendid condition  well this is the devil to pay upon my life said mr chickerel with a miserable gaze at the bundle of clothes and the general situation at the same time  unfortunately for her friendship i have snubbed her two or three times already for i dont care about her manner  you know she has a way of trading on a mans sense of honour till it puts him into an awkward position  she is perfectly well aware that whatever scrape i find her out in i shall not have the conscience to report her because i am a man and she is a defenceless woman and so she takes advantage of ones feeling by making me or either of the menservants her bottleholder as you see she has done now  this is all simply dreadful said ethelberta  joey is shrewd and trustworthy but in the hands of such a woman as that  i suppose she did not recognize me  there was no chance of that in the dark  well i cannot do anything in it said she  i cannot manage joey at all  i will see if i can said mr chickerel  courting at his age indeedwhat shall we hear next  chickerel then accompanied his daughter along the street till an empty cab passed them and putting her into it he returned to the house again     29 ethelbertas dressingroommr doncastles house   the dressing of ethelberta for the dinnerparty was an undertaking into which picotee threw her whole skill as tirewoman  her energies were brisker that day than they had been at any time since the julians first made preparations for departure from town for a letter had come to her from faith telling of their arrival at the old cathedral city which was found to suit their inclinations and habits infinitely better than london and that she would like picotee to visit them there some day picotee felt and so probably felt the writer of the letter that such a visit would not be very practicable just now but it was a pleasant idea and for fastening dreams upon was better than nothing  such musings were encouraged also by ethelbertas remarks as the dressing went on  we will have a change soon she said we will go out of town for a few days  it will do good in many ways  i am getting so alarmed about the health of the children their faces are becoming so white and thin and pinched that an old acquaintance would hardly know them and they were so plump when they came  you are looking as pale as a ghost and i daresay i am too  a week or two at knollsea will see us right  o how charming said picotee gladly  knollsea was a village on the coast not very far from melchester the new home of christopher not very far that is to say in the eye of a sweetheart but seeing that there was as the crow flies a stretch of thirtyfive miles between the two places and that more than onethird the distance was without a railway an elderly gentleman might have considered their situations somewhat remote from each other  why have you chosen knollsea inquired picotee  because of aunts letter from rouenhave you seen it  i did not read it through  she wants us to get a copy of the register of her baptism and she is not absolutely certain which of the parishes in and about knollsea they were living in when she was born  mother being a year younger cannot tell of course  first i thought of writing to the clergyman of each parish but that would be troublesome and might reveal the secret of my birth but if we go down there for a few days and take some lodgings we shall be able to find out all about it at leisure  gwendoline and joey can attend to mother and the people downstairs especially as father will look in every evening until he goes out of town to see if they are getting on properly  it will be such a weight off my soul to slip away from acquaintances here  will it  yes  at the same time i ought not to speak so for they have been very kind  i wish we could go to rouen afterwards aunt repeats her invitation as usual  however there is time enough to think of that  ethelberta was dressed at last and beholding the lonely look of poor picotee when about to leave the room she could not help having a sympathetic feeling that it was rather hard for her sister to be denied so small an enjoyment as a menial peep at a feast when she herself was to sit down to it as guest  if you still want to go and see the procession downstairs you may do so she said reluctantly provided that you take care of your tongue when you come in contact with menlove and adhere to fathers instructions as to how long you may stay  it may be in the highest degree unwise but never mind go  then ethelberta departed for the scene of action just at the hour of the suns lowest decline when it was fading away yellow and mild as candle light and when upper windows facing northwest reflected to persons in the street dissolving views of tawny cloud with brazen edges the original picture of the same being hidden from sight by soiled walls and slaty slopes  before entering the presence of host and hostess ethelberta contrived to exchange a few words with her father  in excellent time he whispered full of paternal pride at the superb audacity of her situation here in relation to his  about half of them are come  mr neigh  not yet hes coming  lord mountclere  yes  he came absurdly early ten minutes before anybody else so that mrs d could hardly get on her bracelets and things soon enough to scramble downstairs and receive him and hes as nervous as a boy  keep up your spirits dear and dont mind me  i will father  and let picotee see me at dinner if you can  she is very anxious to look at me  she will be here directly  and ethelberta having been announced joined the chamberful of assembled guests among whom for the present we lose sight of her        meanwhile the evening outside the house was deepening in tone and the lamps began to blink up  her sister having departed picotee hastily arrayed herself in a little black jacket and chip hat and tripped across the park to the same point  chickerel had directed a maidservant known as jane to receive his humbler daughter and make her comfortable and that friendly person who spoke as if she had known picotee fiveandtwenty years took her to the housekeepers room where the visitor deposited her jacket and hat and rested awhile  a quickeyed lighthaired slightbuilt woman came in when jane had gone  are you miss chickerel she said to picotee  yes said picotee guessing that this was menlove and fearing her a little  jane tells me that you have come to visit your father and would like to look at the company going to dinner  well they are not much to see you know but such as they are you are welcome to the sight of  come along with me  i think i would rather wait for father if you will excuse me please  your father is busy now it is no use for you to think of saying anything to him  picotee followed her guide up a back staircase to the height of several flights and then crossing a landing they descended to the upper part of the front stairs  now look over the balustrade and you will see them all in a minute said mrs menlove  o you need not be timid you can look out as far as you like  we are all independent here no slavery for us it is not as it is in the country where servants are considered to be of different blood and bone from their employers and to have no eyes for anything but their work  here they are coming  picotee then had the pleasure of looking down upon a series of human crownssome black some white some strangely built upon some smooth and shiningdescending the staircase in disordered column and great discomfort their owners trying to talk but breaking off in the midst of syllables to look to their footing  the young girls eyes had not drooped over the handrail more than a few moments when she softly exclaimed there she is there she is  how lovely she looks does she not  who said mrs menlove  picotee recollected herself and hastily drew in her impulses  my dear mistress she said blandly  that is she on mr doncastles arm  and look who is that funny old man the elderly lady is helping downstairs  he is our honoured guest lord mountclere  mrs doncastle will have him all through the dinner and after that he will devote himself to mrs petherwin your dear mistress  he keeps looking towards her now and no doubt thinks it a nuisance that she is not with him  well it is useless to stay here  come a little furtherwell follow them  menlove began to lead the way downstairs but picotee held back  wont they see us she said  no  and if they do it doesnt matter  mrs doncastle would not object in the least to the daughter of her respected head man being accidentally seen in the hall  they descended to the bottom and stood in the hall  o theres father whispered picotee with childlike gladness as chickerel became visible to her by the door  the butler nodded to his daughter and became again engrossed in his duties  i wish i could see hermy mistressagain said picotee  you seem mightily concerned about your mistress said menlove  do you want to see if you have dressed her properly  yes partly and i like her too  she is very kind to me  you will have a chance of seeing her soon  when the door is nicely open you can look in for a moment  i must leave you now for a few minutes but i will come again  menlove departed and picotee stood waiting  she wondered how ethelberta was getting on and whether she enjoyed herself as much as it seemed her duty to do in such a superbly hospitable place  picotee then turned her attention to the hall every article of furniture therein appearing worthy of scrutiny to her unaccustomed eyes  here she walked and looked about for a long time till an excellent opportunity offered itself of seeing how affairs progressed in the diningroom  through the partlyopened door there became visible a sideboard which first attracted her attention by its richness  it was indeed a noticeable example of modern artworkmanship in being exceptionally large with curious ebony mouldings at different stages and while the heavy cupboard doors at the bottom were enriched with inlays of paler wood other panels were decorated with tiles as if the massive composition had been erected on the spot as part of the solid building however it was on a space higher up that picotees eyes and thoughts were fixed  in the great mirror above the middle ledge she could see reflected the upper part of the diningroom and this suggested to her that she might see ethelberta and the other guests reflected in the same way by standing on a chair which quick as thought she did  to picotees dazed young vision her beautiful sister appeared as the chief figure of a glorious pleasureparliament of both sexes surrounded by whole regiments of candles grouped here and there about the room  she and her companions were seated before a large flowerbed or small hanging garden fixed at about the level of the elbow the attention of all being concentrated rather upon the uninteresting margin of the bed and upon each other than on the beautiful natural objects growing in the middle as it seemed to picotee  in the ripple of conversation ethelbertas clear voice could occasionally be heard and her young sister could see that her eyes were bright and her face beaming as if divers social wants and looming penuriousness had never been within her experience  mr doncastle was quite absorbed in what she was saying  so was the queer old man whom menlove had called lord mountclere  the dashing widow looks very well does she not said a person at picotees elbow  it was her conductor menlove now returned again whom picotee had quite forgotten  she will do some damage here tonight you will find continued menlove how long have you been with her  o a long timei mean rather a short time stammered picotee  i know her well enough  i was her maid once or rather her motherin laws but that was long before you knew her  i did not by any means find her so lovable as you seem to think her when i had to do with her at close quarters  an awful flirtawful  dont you find her so  i dont know  if you dont yet you will know  but come down from your perchthe diningroom door will not be open again for some timeand i will show you about the rooms upstairs  this is a larger house than mrs petherwins as you see  just come and look at the drawingrooms  wishing much to get rid of menlove yet fearing to offend her picotee followed upstairs  dinner was almost over by this time and when they entered the front drawingroom a young manservant and maid were there rekindling the lights  now lets have a game of catandmice said the maidservant cheerily theres plenty of time before they come up  agreed said menlove promptly  you will play will you not miss chickerel  no indeed said picotee aghast  never mind then you look on  away then ran the housemaid and menlove and the young footman started at their heels  round the room over the furniture under the furniture through the furniture out of one window along the balcony in at another window again round the roomso they glided with the swiftness of swallows and the noiselessness of ghosts  then the housemaid drew a jewsharp from her pocket and struck up a lively waltz sotto voce  the footman seized menlove who appeared nothing loth and began spinning gently round the room with her to the time of the fascinating measure     which fashion hails from countesses to queens    and maids and valets dance behind the scenes  picotee who had been accustomed to unceiled country cottages all her life wherein the scamper of a mouse is heard distinctly from floor to floor exclaimed in a terrified whisper at viewing all this theyll hear you underneath theyll hear you and we shall all be ruined  not at all came from the cautious dancers  these are some of the best built houses in londondouble floors filled in with material that will deaden any row you like to make and we make none  but come and have a turn yourself miss chickerel  the young man relinquished menlove and on the spur of the moment seized picotee  picotee flounced away from him in indignation backing into a corner with ruffled feathers like a pullet trying to appear a hen  how dare you touch me she said with rounded eyes  ill tell somebody downstairs of you wholl soon see about it  what a baby shell tell her father  no i shant somebody you are all afraid of thats who ill tell  nonsense said menlove he meant no harm  playtime was now getting short and further antics being dangerous on that account the performers retired again downstairs picotee of necessity following  her nerves were screwed up to the highest pitch of uneasiness by the grotesque habits of these men and maids who were quite unlike the country servants she had known and resembled nothing so much as pixies elves or gnomes peeping up upon human beings from their shady haunts underground sometimes for good sometimes for illsometimes doing heavy work sometimes none teasing and worrying with impish laughter half suppressed and vanishing directly mortal eyes were bent on them  separate and distinct from overt existence under the sun this life could hardly be without its distinctive pleasures all of them being more or less pervaded by thrills and titillations from games of hazard and the perpetual risk of sensational surprises  long before this time picotee had begun to be anxious to get home again but menlove seemed particularly to desire her company and pressed her to sit awhile telling her young friend by way of entertainment of various extraordinary love adventures in which she had figured as heroine when travelling on the continent  these stories had one and all a remarkable likeness in a certain pointmenlove was always unwilling to love the adorer and the adorer was always unwilling to live afterwards on account of it  hahaha in mens voices was heard from the distant diningroom as the two women went on talking  and then continued menlove there was that duel i was the cause of between the courier and the french valet  dear me what a trouble that was yet i could do nothing to prevent it  this courier was a very handsome manthey are handsome sometimes  yes they are  my aunt married one  did she  where do they live  they keep an hotel at rouen murmured picotee in doubt whether this should have been told or not  well he used to follow me to the english church every sunday regularly and i was so determined not to give my hand where my heart could never be that i slipped out at the other door while he stood expecting me by the one i entered  here i met m pierre when as ill luck would have it the other came round the corner and seeing me talking to the valet he challenged him at once  hahaha was heard again afar  did they fight said picotee  yes i believe they did  we left nice the next day but i heard some time after of a duel not many miles off and although i could not get hold of the names i make no doubt it was between those two gentlemen  i never knew which of them fell poor fellow whichever it was  hahahahahaha came from the diningroom  whatever are those boozy men laughing at i wonder said menlove  they are always so noisy when the ladies have gone upstairs  upon my soul ill run up and find out  no no dont entreated picotee putting her hand on her entertainers arm  it seems wrong it is no concern of ours  wrong be hangedanything on an impulse said mrs menlove skipping across the room and out of the door which stood open as did others in the house the evening being sultry and oppressive  picotee waited in her seat until it occurred to her that she could escape the ladysmaid by going off into her fathers pantry in her absence  but before this had been put into effect menlove appeared again  such fun as they are having up there she said  somebody asked mr neigh to tell a story which he had told at some previous time but he was very reluctant to do so and pretended he could not recollect it  well then the other mani could not distinguish him by his voicebegan telling it to prompt mr neighs memory and as far as i could understand it was about some lady who thought mr neigh was in love with her and to find whether he was worth accepting or not she went with her maid at night to see his estate and wandered about and got lost and was frightened and i dont know what besides  then mr neigh laughed too and said he liked such common sense in a woman  no names were mentioned but i fancy from the awkwardness of mr neigh at being compelled to tell it that the lady is one of those in the drawingroom i should like to know which it was  i knowhave heard something about it said picotee blushing with anger  it was nothing at all like that  i wonder mr neigh had the audacity ever to talk of the matter and to misrepresent it so greatly  tell all about it do said menlove  o no said picotee  i promised not to say a word  it is your mistress i expect  you may think what you like but the lady is anything but a mistress of mine  the flighty menlove pressed her to tell the whole story but finding this useless the subject was changed  presently her father came in and taking no notice of menlove told his daughter that she had been called for  picotee very readily put on her things and on going outside found joey awaiting her  mr chickerel followed closely with sharp glances from the corner of his eye and it was plain from joeys nervous manner of lingering in the shadows of the area doorway instead of entering the house that the butler had in some way set himself to prevent all communion between the fair ladysmaid and his son for that evening at least  he watched picotee and her brother off the premises and the pair went on their way towards exonbury crescent very few words passing between them picotees thoughts had turned to the proposed visit to knollsea and joey was sulky under disappointment and the blank of thwarted purposes     30 on the housetop   picotee are you asleep ethelberta whispered softly at dawn the next morning by the halfopened door of her sisters bedroom  no i keep waking it is so warm  so do i  suppose we get up and see the sun rise  the east is filling with flame  yes i should like it said picotee  the restlessness which had brought ethelberta hither in slippers and dressinggown at such an early hour owed its origin to another cause than the warmth of the weather but of that she did not speak as yet picotees room was an attic with windows in the roofa chamber dismal enough at all times and very shadowy now  while picotee was wrapping up ethelberta placed a chair under the window and mounting upon this they stepped outside and seated themselves within the parapet  the air was as clear and fresh as on a mountain side sparrows chattered and birds of a species unsuspected at later hours could be heard singing in the park hard by while here and there on ridges and flats a cat might be seen going calmly home from the devilries of the night to resume the amiabilities of the day  i am so sorry i was asleep when you reached home said picotee  i was so anxious to tell you something i heard of and to know what you did but my eyes would shut try as i might and then i tried no longer  did you see me at all berta  never once  i had an impression that you were there  i fancied you were from fathers carefully vacuous look whenever i glanced at his face but were you careful about what you said and did you see menlove  i felt all the time that i had done wrong in letting you come the gratification to you was not worth the risk to me  i saw her and talked to her  but i am certain she suspected nothing  i enjoyed myself very much and there was no risk at all  i am glad it is no worse news  however you must not go there again upon that point i am determined  it was a good thing i did go all the same  ill tell you why when you have told me what happened to you  nothing of importance happened to me  i expect you got to know the lord you were to meet  o yeslord mountclere  and its dreadful how fond he is of youquite ridiculously taken up with youi saw that well enough  such an old man too i wouldnt have him for the world  dont jump at conclusions so absurdly picotee  why wouldnt you have him for the world  because he is old enough to be my grandfather and yours too  indeed he is not he is only middleaged  o berta  sixtyfive at least  he may or may not be that and if he is it is not old  he is so entertaining that one forgets all about age in connection with him  he laughs like thisheeheehee  picotee introduced as much antiquity into her face as she could by screwing it up and suiting the action to the word  this very odd thing occurred said ethelberta to get picotee off the track of lord mountcleres peculiarities as it seemed  i was saying to mr neigh that we were going to knollsea for a time feeling that he would not be likely to know anything about such an outoftheway place when lord mountclere who was near said i shall be at enckworth court in a few days probably at the time you are at knollsea  the imperial archaeological association holds its meetings in that part of wessex this season and corvsgate castle near knollsea is one of the places on our list  then he hoped i should be able to attend  did you ever hear anything so strange  now i should like to attend very much not on lord mountcleres account but because such gatherings are interesting and i have never been to one yet there is this to be considered would it be right for me to go without a friend to such a place  another point is that we shall live in menagerie style at knollsea for the sake of the children and we must do it economically in case we accept aunt charlottes invitation to rouen hence if he or his friends find us out there it will be awkward for me  so the alternative is knollsea or some other place for us  let it be knollsea now we have once settled it said picotee anxiously  i have mentioned to faith julian that we shall be there  mentioned it already  you must have written instantly  i had a few minutes to spare and i thought i might as well write  very well we will stick to knollsea said ethelberta half in doubt yesotherwise it will be difficult to see about aunts baptismal certificate  we will hope nobody will take the trouble to pry into our household     and now picotee i want to ask you somethingsomething very serious  how would you like me to marry mr neigh  ethelberta could not help laughing with a faint shyness as she asked the question under the searching east ray  he has asked me to marry him she continued and i want to know what you would say to such an arrangement  i dont mean to imply that the event is certain to take place but as a mere supposition what do you say to it picotee ethelberta was far from putting this matter before picotee for advice or opinion but like all people who have an innate dislike to holeandcorner policy she felt compelled to speak of it to some one  i should not like him for you at all said picotee vehemently  i would rather you had mr ladywell  o dont name him  i wouldnt have mr neigh at any price nevertheless  it is about him that i was going to tell you  picotee proceeded to relate menloves account of the story of ethelbertas escapade which had been dragged from neigh the previous evening by the friend to whom he had related it before he was so enamoured of ethelberta as to regard that performance as a positive virtue in her  nobody was told or even suspected who the lady of the anecdote was picotee concluded but i knew instantly of course and i think it very unfortunate that we ever went to that dreadful ghostly estate of his berta  ethelbertas face heated with mortification  she had no fear that neigh had told names or other particulars which might lead to her identification by any friend of his and she could make allowance for bursts of confidence but there remained the awkward fact that he himself knew her to be the heroine of the episode  what annoyed her most was that neigh could ever have looked upon her indiscretion as a humorous incident which he certainly must have done at some time or other to account for his telling it  had he been angry with her or sneered at her for going she could have forgiven him but to see her manoeuvre in the light of a joke to use it as illustrating his grim theory of womankind and neither to like nor to dislike her the more for it from first to last this was to treat her with a cynicism which was intolerable  that neighs use of the incident as a stock anecdote ceased long before he had decided to ask her to marry him she had no doubt but it showed that his love for her was of that sort in which passion makes war upon judgment and prevails in spite of will  moreover he might have been speaking ironically when he alluded to the act as a virtue in a woman which seemed the more likely when she remembered his cool bearing towards her in the drawingroom  possibly it was an antipathetic reaction induced by the renewed recollection of her proceeding  i will never marry mr neigh she said with decision  that shall settle it  you need not think over any such contingency picotee  he is one of those horrid men who love with their eyes the remainder part of him objecting all the time to the feeling and even if his objections prove the weaker and the man marries his general nature conquers again by the time the wedding trip is over so that the woman is miserable at last and had better not have had him at all  that applies still more to lord mountclere to my thinking  i never saw anything like the look of his eyes upon you  o no noyou understand nothing if you say that  but one thing be sure of there is no marriage likely to take place between myself and mr neigh  i have longed for a sound reason for disliking him and now i have got it  well we will talk no more of thislet us think of the nice little pleasure we have in storeour stay at knollsea  there we will be as free as the wind  and when we are down there i can drive across to corvsgate castle if i wish to attend the imperial association meeting and nobody will know where i came from  knollsea is not more than five miles from the castle i think  picotee was by this time beginning to yawn and ethelberta did not feel nearly so wakeful as she had felt halfanhour earlier  tall and swarthy columns of smoke were now soaring up from the kitchen chimneys around spreading horizontally when at a great height and forming a roof of haze which was turning the sun to a copper colour and by degrees spoiling the sweetness of the new atmosphere that had rolled in from the country during the night giving it the usual city smell  the resolve to make this rising the beginning of a long and busy day which should set them beforehand with the rest of the world weakened with their growing weariness and an impulse to lie down just for a quarter of an hour before dressing ended in a sound sleep that did not relinquish its hold upon them till late in the forenoon     31 knollseaa lofty downa ruined castle   knollsea was a seaside village lying snug within two headlands as between a finger and thumb  everybody in the parish who was not a boatman was a quarrier unless he were the gentleman who owned half the property and had been a quarryman or the other gentleman who owned the other half and had been to sea  the knowledge of the inhabitants was of the same special sort as their pursuits  the quarrymen in white fustian understood practical geology the laws and accidents of dips faults and cleavage far better than the ways of the world and mammon the seafaring men in guernsey frocks had a clearer notion of alexandria constantinople the cape and the indies than of any inland town in their own country  this for them consisted of a busy portion the channel where they lived and laboured and a dull portion the vague unexplored miles of interior at the back of the ports which they seldom thought of  some wives of the village it is true had learned to let lodgings and others to keep shops  the doors of these latter places were formed of an upper hatch usually kept open and a lower hatch with a bell attached usually kept shut  whenever a stranger went in he would hear a whispering of astonishment from a back room after which a woman came forward looking suspiciously at him as an intruder and advancing slowly enough to allow her mouth to get clear of the meal she was partaking of meanwhile the people in the back room would stop their knives and forks in absorbed curiosity as to the reason of the strangers entry who by this time feels ashamed of his unwarrantable intrusion into this hermits cell and thinks he must take his hat off  the woman is quite alarmed at seeing that he is not one of the fifteen native women and children who patronize her and nervously puts her hand to the side of her face which she carries slanting  the visitor finds himself saying what he wants in an apologetic tone when the woman tells him that they did keep that article once but do not now that nobody does and probably never will again and as he turns away she looks relieved that the dilemma of having to provide for a stranger has passed off with no worse mishap than disappointing him  a cottage which stood on a high slope above this townlet and its bay resounded one morning with the notes of a merry company  ethelberta had managed to find room for herself and her young relations in the house of one of the boatmen whose wife attended upon them all  captain flower the husband assisted her in the dinner preparations when he slipped about the house as lightly as a girl and spoke of himself as cooks mate the house was so small that the sailors rich voice developed by shouting in high winds during a twenty years experience in the coasting trade could be heard coming from the kitchen between the chirpings of the children in the parlour  the furniture of this apartment consisted mostly of the painting of a fullrigged ship done by a man whom the captain had specially selected for the purpose because he had been seven andtwenty years at sea before touching a brush and thereby offered a sufficient guarantee that he understood how to paint a vessel properly  before this picture sat ethelberta in a light linen dress and with tightlyknotted hairnow again berta chickerel as of oldserving out breakfast to the rest of the party and sometimes lifting her eyes to the outlook from the window which presented a happy combination of grange scenery with marine  upon the irregular slope between the house and the quay was an orchard of aged trees wherein every apple ripening on the boughs presented its rubicund side towards the cottage because that building chanced to lie upwards in the same direction as the sun  under the trees were a few cape sheep and over them the stone chimneys of the village below outside these lay the tanned sails of a ketch or smack and the violet waters of the bay seamed and creased by breezes insufficient to raise waves beyond all a curved wall of cliff terminating in a promontory which was flanked by tall and shining obelisks of chalk rising sheer from the trembling blue race beneath  by one sitting in the room that commanded this prospect a white butterfly among the appletrees might be mistaken for the sails of a yacht far away on the sea and in the evening when the light was dim what seemed like a fly crawling upon the windowpane would turn out to be a boat in the bay  when breakfast was over ethelberta sat leaning on the windowsill considering her movements for the day  it was the time fixed for the meeting of the imperial association at corvsgate castle the celebrated ruin five miles off and the meeting had some fascinations for her  for one thing she had never been present at a gathering of the kind although what was left in any shape from the past was her constant interest because it recalled her to herself and fortified her mind persons waging a harassing social fight are apt in the interest of the combat to forget the smallness of the end in view and the hints that perishing historical remnants afforded her of the attenuating effects of time even upon great struggles corrected the apparent scale of her own she was reminded that in a strife for such a ludicrously small object as the entry of drawingrooms winning equally with losing is below the zero of the true philosophers concern  there could never be a more excellent reason than this for going to view the meagre stumps remaining from flourishing bygone centuries and it had weight with ethelberta this very day but it would be difficult to state the whole composition of her motive  the approaching meeting had been one of the great themes at mr doncastles dinnerparty and lord mountclere on learning that she was to be at knollsea had recommended her attendance at some if not all of the meetings as a desirable and exhilarating change after her laborious seasons work in town  it was pleasant to have won her way so far in high places that her health of body and mind should be thus consideredpleasant less as personal gratification than that it casually reflected a proof of her good judgment in a course which everybody among her kindred had condemned by calling a foolhardy undertaking  and she might go without the restraint of ceremony unconventionalityalmost eccentricitywas de rigueur for one who had been first heard of as a poetess from whose red lips magic romance had since trilled for weeks to crowds of listeners as from a perennial spring  so ethelberta went after a considerable pondering how to get there without the needless sacrifice either of dignity or cash  it would be inconsiderate to the children to spend a pound on a brougham when as much as she could spare was wanted for their holiday  it was almost too far too walk  she had however decided to walk when she met a boy with a donkey who offered to lend it to her for three shillings  the animal was rather sadlooking but ethelberta found she could sit upon the pad without discomfort  considering that she might pull up some distance short of the castle and leave the ass at a cottage before joining her fourwheeled friends she struck the bargain and rode on her way  this was first by a path on the shore where the tide dragged huskily up and down the shingle without disturbing it and thence up the steep crest of land opposite whereon she lingered awhile to let the ass breathe  on one of the spires of chalk into which the hill here had been split was perched a cormorant silent and motionless with wings spread out to dry in the sun after his mornings fishing their white surface shining like mail  retiring without disturbing him and turning to the left along the lofty ridge which ran inland the country on each side lay beneath her like a map domains behind domains parishes by the score harbours fir woods and little inland seas mixing curiously together  thence she ambled along through a huge cemetery of barrows containing human dust from prehistoric times  standing on the top of a giants grave in this antique land ethelberta lifted her eyes to behold two sorts of weather pervading nature at the same time  far below on the right hand it was a fine day and the silver sunbeams lighted up a manyarmed inland sea which stretched round an island with firtrees and gorse and amid brilliant crimson heaths wherein white paths and roads occasionally met the eye in dashes and zigzags like flashes of lightning  outside where the broad channel appeared a berylline and opalized variegation of ripples currents deeps and shallows lay as fair under the sun as a new jerusalem the shores being of gleaming sand  upon the radiant heather bees and butterflies were busy she knew and the birds on that side were just beginning their autumn songs  on the left quite up to her position was dark and cloudy weather shading a valley of heavy greens and browns which at its further side rose to meet the sea in tall cliffs suggesting even here at their back how terrible were their aspects seaward in a growling southwest gale here grassed hills rose like knuckles gloved in dark olive and little plantations between them formed a still deeper and sadder monochrome  a zinc sky met a leaden sea on this hand the low wind groaned and whined and not a bird sang  the ridge along which ethelberta rode divided these two climates like a wall it soon became apparent that they were wrestling for mastery immediately in her pathway  the issue long remained doubtful and this being an imaginative hour with her she watched as typical of her own fortunes how the front of battle swayednow to the west flooding her with sun now to the east covering her with shade then the wind moved round to the north a blue hole appeared in the overhanging cloud at about the place of the north star and the sunlight spread on both sides of her  the towers of the notable ruin to be visited rose out of the furthermost shoulder of the upland as she advanced its site being the slope and crest of a smoothly nibbled mount at the toe of the ridge she had followed  when observing the previous uncertainty of the weather on this side ethelberta had been led to doubt if the meeting would be held here today and she was now strengthened in her opinion that it would not by the total absence of human figures amid the ruins though the time of appointment was past  this disposed of another question which had perplexed her where to find a stable for the ass during the meeting for she had scarcely liked the idea of facing the whole body of lords and gentlemen upon the animals back  she now decided to retain her seat ride round the ruin and go home again without troubling further about the movements of the association or acquaintance with the members composing it  accordingly ethelberta crossed the bridge over the moat and rode under the first archway into the outer ward  as she had expected not a soul was here  the arrowslits portcullisgrooves and staircases met her eye as familiar friends for in her childhood she had once paid a visit to the spot  ascending the green incline and through another arch into the second ward she still pressed on till at last the ass was unable to clamber an inch further  here she dismounted and tying him to a stone which projected like a fang from a raw edge of wall performed the remainder of the ascent on foot  once among the towers above she became so interested in the windy corridors mildewed dungeons and the tribe of daws peering invidiously upon her from overhead that she forgot the flight of time  nearly threequarters of an hour passed before she came out from the immense walls and looked from an opening to the front over the wide expanse of the outer ward by which she had ascended  ethelberta was taken aback to see there a file of shining carriages which had arrived during her seclusion in the keep  from these began to burst a miscellany of manycoloured draperies blue buff pied and black they united into one and crept up the incline like a cloud which then parted into fragments dived into old doorways and lost substance behind projecting piles  recognizing in this the ladies and gentlemen of the meeting her first thought was how to escape for she was suddenly overcome with dread to meet them all singlehanded as she stood  she drew back and hurried round to the side as the laughter and voices of the assembly began to be audible and more than ever vexed that she could not have fallen in with them in some unobtrusive way ethelberta found that they were immediately beneath her  venturing to peep forward again what was her mortification at finding them gathered in a ring round no object of interest belonging to the ruin but round her faithful beast who had loosened himself in some way from the stone and stood in the middle of a plat of grass placidly regarding them  being now in the teeth of the association there was nothing to do but to go on since if she did not the next few steps of their advance would disclose her  she made the best of it and began to descend in the broad view of the assembly from the midst of which proceeded a laughheehee hee  ethelberta knew that lord mountclere was there  the poor thing has strayed from its owner said one lady as they all stood eyeing the apparition of the ass  it may belong to some of the villagers said the president in a historical voice and it may be appropriate to mention that many were kept here in olden times they were largely used as beasts of burden in victualling the castle previous to the last siege in the year sixteen hundred and fortyfive  it is very weary and has come a long way i think said a lady adding in an imaginative tone the humble creature looks so aged and is so quaintly saddled that we may suppose it to be only an animated relic of the same date as the other remains  by this time lord mountclere had noticed ethelbertas presence and straightening himself to ten years younger he lifted his hat in answer to her smile and came up jauntily  it was a good time now to see what the viscount was really like  he appeared to be about sixtyfive and the dignified aspect which he wore to a gazer at a distance became depreciated to jocund slyness upon nearer view when the small type could be read between the leading lines  then it could be seen that his upper lip dropped to a point in the middle as if impressing silence upon his too demonstrative lower one  his right and left profiles were different one corner of his mouth being more compressed than the other producing a deep line thence downwards to the side of his chin  each eyebrow rose obliquely outwards and upwards and was thus far above the little eye shining with the clearness of a pond that has just been able to weather the heats of summer  below this was a preternaturally fat jowl which by thrusting against cheeks and chin caused the arch old mouth to be almost buried at the corners  a few words of greeting passed and ethelberta told him how she was fearing to meet them all united and primed with their mornings knowledge as they appeared to be  well we have not done much yet said lord mountclere  as for myself i have given no thought at all to our days work  i had not forgotten your promise to attend if you could possibly drive across andheehee heei have frequently looked towards the hill where the road descends     will you now permit me to introduce some of my partyas many of them as you care to know by name  i think they would all like to speak to you  ethelberta then found herself nominally made known to ten or a dozen ladies and gentlemen who had wished for special acquaintance with her she stood there as all women stand who have made themselves remarkable by their originality or devotion to any singular cause as a person freed of her hampering and inconvenient sex and by virtue of her popularity unfettered from the conventionalities of manner prescribed by custom for household womankind  the charter to move abroad unchaperoned which society for good reasons grants only to women of three sortsthe famous the ministering and the improperethelberta was in a fair way to make splendid use of instead of walking in protected lanes she experienced that luxury of isolation which normally is enjoyed by men alone in conjunction with the attention naturally bestowed on a woman young and fair  among the presentations were mr and mrs tynn member and members mainspring for north wessex sir cyril and lady blandsbury lady jane joy and the honourable edgar mountclere the viscounts brother  there also hovered near her the learned doctor yore mr small a profound writer who never printed his works the reverend mr brook rector the very reverend dr taylor dean and the undoubtedly reverend mr tinkleton nonconformist who had slipped into the fold by chance  these and others looked with interest at ethelberta the old county fathers hard as at a questionable town phenomenon the county sons tenderly as at a pretty creature and the county daughters with great admiration as at a lady reported by their mammas to be no better than she should be  it will be seen that ethelberta was the sort of woman that wellrooted local people might like to look at on such a free and friendly occasion as an archaeological meeting where to gratify a pleasant whim the picturesque form of acquaintance is for the nonce preferred to the useful the spirits being so brisk as to swerve from strict attention to the select and sequent gifts of heaven blood and acres to consider for an idle moment the subversive mephistophelian endowment brains  our progress in the survey of the castle has not been far as yet lord mountclere resumed indeed we have only just arrived the weather this morning being so unsettled  when you came up we were engaged in a preliminary study of the poor animal you see there how it could have got up here we cannot understand  he pointed as he spoke to the donkey which had brought ethelberta thither whereupon she was silent and gazed at her untoward beast as if she had never before beheld him  the ass looked at ethelberta as though he would say why dont you own me after safely bringing you over those weary hills  but the pride and emulation which had made her what she was would not permit her as the most lovely woman there to take upon her own shoulders the ridicule that had already been cast upon the ass  had he been young and gaily caparisoned she might have done it but his age the clumsy trappings of rustic make and his needy woful look of hard servitude were too much to endure  many come and picnic here she said serenely and the animal may have been left till they return from some walk  true said lord mountclere without the slightest suspicion of the truth  the humble ass hung his head in his usual manner and it demanded little fancy from ethelberta to imagine that he despised her  and then her mind flew back to her history and extraction to her fatherperhaps at that moment inventing a private platepowder in an underground pantryand with a groan at her inconsistency in being ashamed of the ass she said in her heart my god what a thing am i  they then all moved on to another part of the castle the viscount busying himself round and round her person like the head scraper at a pig killing and as they went indiscriminately mingled jesting lightly or talking in earnest she beheld ahead of her the form of neigh among the rest  now there could only be one reason on earth for neighs presenceher remark that she might attendfor neigh took no more interest in antiquities than in the back of the moon  ethelberta was a little flurried perhaps he had come to scold her or to treat her badly in that indefinable way of his by which he could make a woman feel as nothing without any direct act at all  she was afraid of him and determining to shun him was thankful that lord mountclere was near to take off the edge of neighs manner towards her if he approached  do you know in what part of the ruins the lecture is to be given she said to the viscount  wherever you like he replied gallantly  do you propose a place and i will get dr yore to adopt it  say shall it be here or where they are standing  how could ethelberta refrain from exercising a little power when it was put into her hands in this way  let it be here she said if it makes no difference to the meeting  it shall be said lord mountclere  and then the lively old nobleman skipped like a roe to the president and to dr yore who was to read the paper on the castle and they soon appeared coming back to where the viscounts party and ethelberta were beginning to seat themselves  the bulk of the company followed and dr yore began  he must have had a countenance of leatheras indeed from his colour he appeared to haveto stand unmoved in his position and read and look up to give explanations without a change of muscle under the dozens of bright eyes that were there converged upon him like the sticks of a fan from the ladies who sat round him in a semicircle upon the grass however he went on calmly and the women sheltered themselves from the heat with their umbrellas and sunshades their ears lulled by the hum of insects and by the drone of the doctors voice  the reader buzzed on with the history of the castle tracing its development from a mound with a few earthworks to its condition in norman times he related monkish marvels connected with the spot its resistance under matilda to stephen its probable shape while a residence of king john and the sad story of the damsel of brittany sister of his victim arthur who was confined here in company with the two daughters of alexander king of scotland  he went on to recount the confinement of edward ii herein previous to his murder at berkeley the gay doings in the reign of elizabeth and so downward through time to the final overthrow of the stern old pile  as he proceeded the lecturer pointed with his finger at the various features appertaining to the date of his story which he told with splendid vigour when he had warmed to his work till his narrative particularly in the conjectural and romantic parts where it became coloured rather by the speakers imagination than by the pigments of history gathered together the wandering thoughts of all  it was easy for him then to meet those fair concentred eyes when the sunshades were thrown back and complexions forgotten in the interest of the history the doctors face was then no longer criticized as a rugged boulder a dried fig an oak carving or a walnut shell but became blotted out like a mountain top in a shining haze by the nebulous pictures conjured by his tale  then the lecture ended and questions were asked and individuals of the company wandered at will the light dresses of the ladies sweeping over the hot grass and brushing up thistledown which had hitherto lain quiescent so that it rose in a flight from the skirts of each like a comets tail  some of lord mountcleres party including himself and ethelberta wandered now into a cool dungeon partly open to the air overhead where long arms of ivy hung between their eyes and the white sky  while they were here lady jane joy and some other friends of the viscount told ethelberta that they were probably coming on to knollsea  she instantly perceived that getting into close quarters in that way might be very inconvenient considering the youngsters she had under her charge and straightway decided upon a point that she had debated for several daysa visit to her aunt in normandy  in london it had been a mere thought but the channel had looked so tempting from its brink that the journey was virtually fixed as soon as she reached knollsea and found that a little pleasure steamer crossed to cherbourg once a week during the summer so that she would not have to enter the crowded routes at all  i am afraid i shall not see you in knollsea she said  i am about to go to cherbourg and then to rouen  how sorry i am  when do you leave  at the beginning of next week said ethelberta settling the time there and then  did i hear you say that you were going to cherbourg and rouen lord mountclere inquired  i think to do so said ethelberta  i am going to normandy myself said a voice behind her and without turning she knew that neigh was standing there  they next went outside and lord mountclere offered ethelberta his arm on the ground of assisting her down the burnished grass slope  ethelberta taking pity upon him took it but the assistance was all on her side she stood like a statue amid his slips and totterings some of which taxed her strength heavily and her ingenuity more to appear as the supported and not the supporter  the incident brought neigh still further from his retirement and she learnt that he was one of a yachting party which had put in at knollsea that morning she was greatly relieved to find that he was just now on his way to london whence he would probably proceed on his journey abroad  ethelberta adhered as well as she could to her resolve that neigh should not speak with her alone but by dint of perseverance he did manage to address her without being overheard  will you give me an answer said neigh  i have come on purpose  i cannot just now  i have been led to doubt you  doubt me  what new wrong have i done  spoken jestingly of my visit to farnfield  good   i did not speak or think of you  when i told that incident i had no idea who the lady wasi did not know it was you till two days later and i at once held my tongue  i vow to you upon my soul and life that what i say is true  how shall i prove my truth better than by my errand here  dont speak of this now  i am so occupied with other things  i am going to rouen and will think of it on my way  i am going there too  when do you go  i shall be in rouen next wednesday i hope  may i ask where  hotel beau sejour  will you give me an answer there  i can easily call upon you  it is now a month and more since you first led me to hope  i did not lead you to hopeat any rate clearly  indirectly you did  and although i am willing to be as considerate as any man ought to be in giving you time to think over the question there is a limit to my patience  any necessary delay i will put up with but i wont be trifled with  i hate all nonsense and cant stand it  indeed  good morning  but mrs petherwinjust one word  i have nothing to say  i will meet you at rouen for an answer  i would meet you in hades for the matter of that  remember this next wednesday if i live i shall call upon you at rouen  she did not say nay  may i he added  if you will  but say it shall be an appointment  very well  lord mountclere was by this time toddling towards them to ask if they would come on to his house enckworth court not very far distant to lunch with the rest of the party  neigh having already arranged to go on to town that afternoon was obliged to decline and ethelberta thought fit to do the same idly asking lord mountclere if enckworth court lay in the direction of a gorge that was visible where they stood  no considerably to the left he said  the opening you are looking at would reveal the sea if it were not for the trees that block the way  ah those trees have a history they are halfadozen elms which i planted myself when i was a boy  how time flies  it is unfortunate they stand just so as to cover the blue bit of sea that addition would double the value of the view from here  you would prefer the blue sea to the trees  in that particular spot i should they might have looked just as well and yet have hidden nothing worth seeing  the narrow slit would have been invaluable there  they shall fall before the sun sets in deference to your opinion said lord mountclere  that would be rash indeed said ethelberta laughing when my opinion on such a point may be worth nothing whatever  where no other is acted upon it is practically the universal one he replied gaily  and then ethelbertas elderly admirer bade her adieu and away the whole party drove in a long train over the hills towards the valley wherein stood enckworth court  ethelbertas carriage was supposed by her friends to have been left at the village inn as were many others and her retiring from view on foot attracted no notice  she watched them out of sight and she also saw the rest departthose who their interest in archaeology having begun and ended with this spot had like herself declined the hospitable viscounts invitation and started to drive or walk at once home again  thereupon the castle was quite deserted except by ethelberta the ass and the jackdaws now floundering at ease again in and about the ivy of the keep  not wishing to enter knollsea till the evening shades were falling she still walked amid the ruins examining more leisurely some points which the stress of keeping herself companionable would not allow her to attend to while the assemblage was present  at the end of the survey being somewhat weary with her clambering she sat down on the slope commanding the gorge where the trees grew to make a pencil sketch of the landscape as it was revealed between the ragged walls  thus engaged she weighed the circumstances of lord mountcleres invitation and could not be certain if it were prudishness or simple propriety in herself which had instigated her to refuse  she would have liked the visit for many reasons and if lord mountclere had been anybody but a remarkably attentive old widower she would have gone  as it was it had occurred to her that there was something in his tone which should lead her to hesitate  were any among the elderly or married ladies who had appeared upon the ground in a detached form as she had doneand many had appeared thusinvited to enckworth and if not why were they not  that lord mountclere admired her there was no doubt and for this reason it behoved her to be careful  his disappointment at parting from her was in one aspect simply laughable from its odd resemblance to the unfeigned sorrow of a boy of fifteen at a first parting from his first love in another aspect it caused reflection and she thought again of his curiosity about her doings for the remainder of the summer        while she sketched and thought thus the shadows grew longer and the sun low  and then she perceived a movement in the gorge  one of the trees forming the curtain across it began to wave strangely it went further to one side and fell where the tree had stood was now a rent in the foliage and through the narrow rent could be seen the distant sea  ethelberta uttered a soft exclamation  it was not caused by the surprise she had felt nor by the intrinsic interest of the sight nor by want of comprehension  it was a sudden realization of vague things hitherto dreamed of from a distance onlya sense of novel power put into her hands without request or expectation  a landscape was to be altered to suit her whim  she had in her lifetime moved essentially larger mountains but they had seemed of far less splendid material than this for it was the nature of the gratification rather than its magnitude which enchanted the fancy of a woman whose poetry in spite of her necessities was hardly yet extinguished  but there was something more with which poetry had little to do  whether the opinion of any pretty woman in england was of more weight with lord mountclere than memories of his boyhood or whether that distinction was reserved for her alone this was a point that she would have liked to know  the enjoyment of power in a new element an enjoyment somewhat resembling in kind that which is given by a first ride or swim held ethelberta to the spot and she waited but sketched no more  another treetop swayed and vanished as before and the slit of sea was larger still  her mind and eye were so occupied with this matter that sitting in her nook she did not observe a thin young man his boots white with the dust of a long journey on foot who arrived at the castle by the valleyroad from knollsea  he looked awhile at the ruin and skirting its flank instead of entering by the great gateway climbed up the scarp and walked in through a breach  after standing for a moment among the walls now silent and apparently empty with a disappointed look he descended the slope and proceeded along on his way  ethelberta who was in quite another part of the castle saw the black spot diminishing to the size of a fly as he receded along the dusty road and soon after she descended on the other side where she remounted the ass and ambled homeward as she had come in no bright mood  what seeing the precariousness of her state was the days triumph worth after all unless before her beauty abated she could ensure her position against the attacks of chance        to be thus is nothing    but to be safely thus  she said it more than once on her journey that day  on entering the sittingroom of their cot up the hill she found it empty and from a change perceptible in the position of small articles of furniture something unusual seemed to have taken place in her absence the dwelling being of that sort in which whatever goes on in one room is audible through all the rest picotee who was upstairs heard the arrival and came down  picotees face was rosed over with the brilliance of some excitement  what do you think i have to tell you berta she said  i have no idea said her sister  surely she added her face intensifying to a wan sadness mr julian has not been here  yes said picotee  and we went down to the sandshe and myrtle and georgina and emmeline and iand cornelia came down when she had put away the dinner  and then we dug wriggles out of the sand with myrtles spade we got such a lot and had such fun they are in a dish in the kitchen  mr julian came to see you but at last he could wait no longer and when i told him you were at the meeting in the castle ruins he said he would try to find you there on his way home if he could get there before the meeting broke up  then it was he i saw far away on the roadyes it must have been  she remained in gloomy reverie a few moments and then said very welllet it be  picotee get me some tea i do not want dinner  but the news of christophers visit seemed to have taken away her appetite for tea also and after sitting a little while she flung herself down upon the couch and told picotee that she had settled to go and see their aunt charlotte  i am going to write to sol and dan to ask them to meet me there she added  i want them if possible to see paris  it will improve them greatly in their trades i am thinking if they can see the kinds of joinery and decoration practised in france  they agreed to go if i should wish it before we left london  you of course will go as my maid  picotee gazed upon the sea with a crestfallen look as if she would rather not cross it in any capacity just then  it would scarcely be worth going to the expense of taking me would it she said  the cause of picotees sudden sense of economy was so plain that her sister smiled but young love however foolish is to a thinking person far too tragic a power for ridicule and ethelberta forbore going on as if picotee had not spoken i must have you with me  i may be seen there so many are passing through rouen at this time of the year cornelia can take excellent care of the children while we are gone  i want to get out of england and i will get out of england  there is nothing but vanity and vexation here  i am sorry you were away when he called said picotee gently  o i dont mean that  i wish there were no different ranks in the world and that contrivance were not a necessary faculty to have at all well we are going to cross by the little steamer that puts in here and we are going on monday  she added in another minute what had mr julian to tell us that he came here  how did he find us out  i mentioned that we were coming here in my letter to faith  mr julian says that perhaps he and his sister may also come for a few days before the season is over  i should like to see miss julian again  she is such a nice girl  yes  ethelberta played with her hair and looked at the ceiling as she reclined  i have decided after all she said that it will be better to take cornelia as my maid and leave you here with the children cornelia is stronger as a companion than you and she will be delighted to go  do you think you are competent to keep myrtle and georgina out of harms way  o yesi will be exceedingly careful said picotee with great vivacity  and if there is time i can go on teaching them a little then picotee caught ethelbertas eye and colouring red sank down beside her sister whispering i know why it is  but if you would rather have me with you i will go and not once wish to stay  ethelberta looked as if she knew all about that and said of course there will be no necessity to tell the julians about my departure until they have fixed the time for coming and cannot alter their minds  the sound of the children with cornelia and their appearance outside the window pushing between the fuchsia bushes which overhung the path put an end to this dialogue they entered armed with buckets and spades a very moist and sandy aspect pervading them as far up as the highwater mark of their clothing and began to tell ethelberta of the wonders of the deep     32 a room in enckworth court   are you sure the report is true  i am sure that what i say is true my lord but it is hardly to be called a report  it is a secret known at present to nobody but myself and mrs doncastles maid  the speaker was lord mountcleres trusty valet and the conversation was between him and the viscount in a dressingroom at enckworth court on the evening after the meeting of archaeologists at corvsgate castle  hmhm the daughter of a butler  does mrs doncastle know of this yet or mr neigh or any of their friends  no my lord  you are quite positive  quite positive  i was by accident the first that mrs menlove named the matter to and i told her it might be much to her advantage if she took particular care it should go no further  mrs menlove  whos she  the ladysmaid at mrs doncastles my lord  o ahof course  you may leave me now tipman  lord mountclere remained in thought for a moment  a clever little puss to hoodwink us all like thisheehee he murmured  her educationhow finished and her beautyso seldom that i meet with such a woman  cut down my elms to please a butlers daughterwhat a jokecertainly a good joke  to interest me in her on the right side instead of the wrong was strange but it can be made to change sidesheeheeit can be made to change sides  tipman  tipman came forward from the doorway  will you take care that that piece of gossip you mentioned to me is not repeated in this house  i strongly disapprove of talebearing of any sort and wish to hear no more of this  such stories are never true answer medo you hear  such stories are never true  i beg pardon but i think your lordship will find this one true said the valet quietly  then where did she get her manners and education  do you know  i do not my lord  i suppose she picked em up by her wits  never mind what you suppose said the old man impatiently  whenever i ask a question of you tell me what you know and no more  quite so my lord  i beg your lordships pardon for supposing  hmhm  have the fashionbooks and plates arrived yet  le follet has my lord but not the others  let me have it at once  always bring it to me at once  are there any handsome ones this time  they are much the same class of female as usual i think my lord said tipman fetching the paper and laying it before him  yes they are said the viscount leaning back and scrutinizing the faces of the women one by one and talking softly to himself in a way that had grown upon him as his age increased  yet they are very well that one with her shoulder turned is pure and charmingthe brownhaired one will pass  all very harmless and innocent but without character no soul or inspiration or eloquence of eye  what an eye was hers  there is not a girl among them so beautiful     tipman  come and take it away  i dont think i will subscribe to these papers any longerhow long have i subscribed  never mindi take no interest in these things and i suppose i must give them up  what white article is that i see on the floor yonder  i can see nothing my lord  yes yes you can  at the other end of the room  it is a white handkerchief  bring it to me  i beg pardon my lord but i cannot see any white handkerchief whereabouts does your lordship mean  there in the corner  if it is not a handkerchief what is it  walk along till you come to itthat is it now a little furthernow your foot is against it  o thatit is not anything  it is the light reflected against the skirting so that it looks like a white patch of somethingthat is all  hmhm  my eyeshow weak they are  i am getting old thats what it is i am an old man  o no my lord  yes an old man  well we shall all be old some day and so will your lordship i suppose but as yet  i tell you i am an old man  yes my lordi did not mean to contradict  an old man in one senseold in a young mans sense but not in a houseofparliament or historical sense  a little oldishi meant that my lord  i may be an old man in one sense or in another sense in your mind but let me tell you there are men older than i  yes so there are my lord  people may call me what they please and you may be impertinent enough to repeat to me what they say but let me tell you i am not a very old man after all  i am not an old man  old in knowledge of the world i meant my lord not in years  well yes  experience of course i cannot be without  and i like what is beautiful  tipman you must go to knollsea dont send but go yourself as i wish nobody else to be concerned in this  go to knollsea and find out when the steamboat for cherbourg starts and when you have done that i shall want you to send taylor to me  i wish captain strong to bring the fawn round into knollsea bay  next week i may want you to go to cherbourg in the yacht with meif the channel is pretty calmand then perhaps to rouen and paris  but i will speak of that tomorrow  very good my lord  meanwhile i recommend that you and mrs menlove repeat nothing you may have heard concerning the lady you just now spoke of  here is a slight present for mrs menlove and accept this for yourself  he handed money  your lordship may be sure we will not the valet replied     33 the english channelnormandy   on monday morning the little steamer speedwell made her appearance round the promontory by knollsea bay to take in passengers for the transit to cherbourg  breezes the freshest that could blow without verging on keenness flew over the quivering deeps and shallows and the sunbeams pierced every detail of barrow path and rabbitrun upon the lofty convexity of down and waste which shut in knollsea from the world to the west  they left the pier at eight oclock taking at first a short easterly course to avoid a sinister ledge of limestones jutting from the water like crocodiles teeth which first obtained notoriety in english history through being the spot whereon a formidable danish fleet went to pieces a thousand years ago  at the moment that the speedwell turned to enter upon the direct course a schooneryacht whose sheets gleamed like bridal satin loosed from a remoter part of the bay continuing to bear off she cut across the steamers wake and took a course almost due southerly which was precisely that of the speedwell  the wind was very favourable for the yacht blowing a few points from north in a steady pressure on her quarter and having been built with every modern appliance that shipwrights could offer the schooner found no difficulty in getting abreast and even ahead of the steamer as soon as she had escaped the shelter of the hills  the more or less parallel courses of the vessels continued for some time without causing any remark among the people on board the speedwell  at length one noticed the fact and another and then it became the general topic of conversation in the group upon the bridge where ethelberta her hair getting frizzed and her cheeks carnationed by the wind sat upon a campstool looking towards the prow  she is bound for guernsey said one  in halfanhour she will put about for a more westerly course youll see  she is not for guernsey or anywhere that way said an acquaintance looking through his glass  if she is out for anything more than a morning cruise she is bound for our port  i should not wonder if she is crossing to get stocked as most of them do to save the duty on her wine and provisions  do you know whose yacht it is  i do not  ethelberta looked at the light leaning figure of the pretty schooner which seemed to skate along upon her bilge and make white shavings of all the sea that touched her  she at first imagined that this might be the yacht neigh had arrived in at the end of the previous week for she knew that he came as one of a yachting party and she had noticed no other boat of that sort in the bay since his arrival  but as all his party had gone ashore and not yet returned she was surprised to see the supposed vessel here  to add to her perplexity she could not be positive now that it came to a real nautical query whether the craft of neighs friends had one mast or two for she had caught but a fragmentary view of the topsail over the appletrees  is that the yacht which has been lying at knollsea for the last few days she inquired of the master of the speedwell as soon as she had an opportunity  the master warmed beneath his coppercoloured rind  o no miss that one you saw was a cuttera smaller boat altogether he replied  built on the slidingkeel principle you understand missand red below her waterline if you noticed  this is lord mountcleres yachtthe fawn you might have seen her reching in round oldharry rock this morning afore we started  lord mountcleres  yesa nobleman of this neighbourhood  but he dont do so much at yachting as he used to in his younger days  i believe hes aboard this morning however  ethelberta now became more absorbed than ever in their ocean comrade and watched its motions continually  the schooner was considerably in advance of them by this time and seemed to be getting by degrees out of their course  she wondered if lord mountclere could be really going to cherbourg if so why had he said nothing about the trip to her when she spoke of her own approaching voyage thither  the yacht changed its character in her eyes losing the indefinite interest of the unknown it acquired the charm of a riddle on motives of which the alternatives were had lord mountcleres journey anything to do with her own or had it not  common probability pointed to the latter supposition but the time of starting the course of the yacht and recollections of lord mountcleres homage suggested the more extraordinary possibility  she went across to cornelia  the man who handed us on boarddidnt i see him speaking to you this morning she said  o yes said cornelia  he asked if my mistress was the popular mrs petherwin  and you told him i suppose  yes  what made you do that cornelia  i thought i might i couldnt help it  when i went through the toll gate such a gentlemanlylooking man asked me if he should help me to carry the things to the end of the pier and as we went on together he said he supposed me to be mrs petherwins maid  i said yes  the two men met afterwards so there would ha been no good in my denying it to one of em  who was this gentlemanly person  i asked the other man that and he told me one of lord mountcleres upper servants  i knew then there was no harm in having been civil to him  he is wellmannered and talks splendid language  that yacht you see on our right hand is lord mountcleres property  if i do not mistake we shall have her closer byandby and you may meet your gentlemanly friend again  be careful how you talk to him  ethelberta sat down thought of the meeting at corvsgate castle of the dinnerparty at mr doncastles of the strange position she had there been in and then of her father  she suddenly reproached herself for thoughtlessness for in her pocket lay a letter from him which she had taken from the postman that morning at the moment of coming from the door and in the hurry of embarking had forgotten ever since  opening it quickly she read     my dear ethelbertayour letter reached me yesterday and i called    round at exonbury crescent in the afternoon as you wished  everything    is going on right there and you have no occasion to be anxious about    them  i do not leave town for another week or two and by the time i    am gone sol and dan will have returned from paris if your mother and    gwendoline want any help so that you need not hurry back on their    account     i have something else to tell you which is not quite so    satisfactory and it is this that makes me write at once but do not    be alarmed  it began in this way  a few nights after the    dinnerparty here i was determined to find out if there was any truth    in what you had been told about that boy and having seen menlove go    out as usual after dark i followed her  sure enough when she had    got into the park up came master joe smoking a cigar  as soon as    they had met i went towards them and menlove seeing somebody draw    nigh began to edge off when the blockhead said never mind my    love it is only the old man  being very provoked with both of them    though she was really the most to blame i gave him some smart cuts    across the shoulders with my cane and told him to go home which he    did with a flea in his ear the rascal  i believe i have cured his    courting tricks for some little time     well menlove then walked by me quite cool as if she were merely a    lady passing by chance at the time which provoked me still more    knowing the whole truth of it and i could not help turning upon her    and saying you madam ought to be served the same way  she    replied in very haughty words and i walked away saying that i had    something better to do than argue with a woman of her character at    that hour of the evening  this so set her up that she followed me    home marched into my pantry and told me that if i had been more    careful about my manners in calling her a bad character it might have    been better both for me and my stuckup daughtera daw in eagles    plumesand so on  now it seems that she must have coaxed something    out of joey about youfor what lad in the world could be a match for    a woman of her experience and arts  i hope she will do you no serious    damage but i tell you the whole state of affairs exactly as they are    that you may form your own opinions  after all there is no real    disgrace for none of us have ever done wrong but have worked    honestly for a living  however i will let you know if anything    serious really happens  this was all that her father said on the matter the letter concluding with messages to the children and directions from their mother with regard to their clothes  ethelberta felt very distinctly that she was in a strait the old impression that unless her position were secured soon it never would be secured returned with great force  a doubt whether it was worth securing would have been very strong ere this had not others besides herself been concerned in her fortunes  she looked up from her letter and beheld the pertinacious yacht it led her up to a conviction that therein lay a means and an opportunity  nothing further of importance occurred in crossing  ethelbertas head ached after a while and cornelias healthy cheeks of red were found to have diminished their colour to the size of a wafer and the quality of a stain  the speedwell entered the breakwater at cherbourg to find the schooner already in the roadstead and by the time the steamer was brought up ethelberta could see the men on board the yacht clewing up and making things snug in a way from which she inferred that they were not going to leave the harbour again that day  with the aspect of a fair galleon that could easily outmanoeuvre her persevering buccaneer ethelberta passed alongside  could it be possible that lord mountclere had on her account fixed this day for his visit across the channel  well i would rather be haunted by him than by mr neigh she said and began laying her plans so as to guard against inconvenient surprises  the next morning ethelberta was at the railway station taking tickets for herself and cornelia when she saw an old yet sly and somewhat merry faced englishman a little way off  he was attended by a younger man who appeared to be his valet  i will exchange one of these tickets she said to the clerk and having done so she went to cornelia to inform her that it would after all be advisable for them to travel separate adding lord mountclere is in the station and i think he is going on by our train  remember you are my maid again now  is not that the gentlemanly man who assisted you yesterday  she signified the valet as she spoke  it is said cornelia  when the passengers were taking their seats and ethelberta was thinking whether she might not after all enter a secondclass with cornelia instead of sitting solitary in a first because of an old mans proximity she heard a shuffling at her elbow and the next moment found that he was overtly observing her as if he had not done so in secret at all  she at once gave him an unsurprised gesture of recognition  i saw you some time ago what a singular coincidence she said  a charming one said lord mountclere smiling a halfminute smile and making as if he would take his hat off and would not quite  perhaps we must not call it coincidence entirely he continued my journey which i have contemplated for some time was not fixed this week altogether without a thought of your presence on the roadheehee  do you go far today  as far as caen said ethelberta  ah  thats the end of my days journey too said lord mountclere they parted and took their respective places lord mountclere choosing a compartment next to the one ethelberta was entering and not as she had expected attempting to join her  now she had instantly fancied when the viscount was speaking that there were signs of some departure from his former respectful manner towards her and an enigma lay in that  at their earlier meetings he had never ventured upon a distinct coupling of himself and herself as he had done in his broad compliment todayif compliment it could be called  she was not sure that he did not exceed his license in telling her deliberately that he had meant to hover near her in a private journey which she was taking without reference to him  she did not object to the act but to the avowal of the act and being as sensitive as a barometer on signs affecting her social condition it darted upon ethelberta for one little moment that he might possibly have heard a word or two about her being nothing more nor less than one of a tribe of thralls hence his freedom of manner  certainly a plain remark of that sort was exactly what a susceptible peer might be supposed to say to a pretty woman of far inferior degree  a rapid redness filled her face at the thought that he might have smiled upon her as upon a domestic whom he was disposed to chuck under the chin  but no she said  he would never have taken the trouble to follow and meet with me had he learnt to think me other than a lady  it is extremity of devotionthats all  it was not ethelbertas inexperience but that her conception of self precluded such an association of ideas which led her to dismiss the surmise that his attendance could be inspired by a motive beyond that of paying her legitimate attentions as a coordinate with him and his in the social field  even if he only meant flirtation she read it as of that sort from which courtship with an eye to matrimony differs only in degree  hence she thought his interest in her was not likely under the ordinary influences of caste feeling to continue longer than while he was kept in ignorance of her consanguinity with a stock proscribed she sighed at the anticipated close of her fullfeathered towering when her ties and bonds should be uncovered  she might have seen matters in a different light and sighed more  but in the stir of the moment it escaped her thought that ignorance of her position and a consequent regard for her as a woman of good standing would have prevented his indulgence in any course which was open to the construction of being disrespectful  valognes carentan isigny bayeux were passed and the train drew up at caen  ethelbertas intention had been to stay here for one night but having learnt from lord mountclere as previously described that this was his destination she decided to go on  on turning towards the carriage after a few minutes of promenading at the caen station she was surprised to perceive that lord mountclere who had alighted as if to leave was still there  they spoke again to each other  i find i have to go further he suddenly said when she had chatted with him a little time  and beckoning to the man who was attending to his baggage he directed the things to be again placed in the train  time passed and they changed at the next junction  when ethelberta entered a carriage on the branch line to take her seat for the remainder of the journey there sat the viscount in the same division  he explained that he was going to rouen  ethelberta came to a quick resolution  her audacity like that of a child getting nearer and nearer a parents side became wonderfully vigorous as she approached her destination and though there were three good hours of travel to rouen as yet the heavier part of the journey was past  at her aunts would be a safe refuge play what pranks she might and there she would tomorrow meet those bravest of defenders sol and dan to whom she had sent as much money as she could conveniently spare towards their expenses with directions that they were to come by the most economical route and meet her at the house of her aunt madame moulin previous to their educational trip to paris their own contribution being the value of the weeks work they would have to lose thus backed up by sol and dan her aunt and cornelia ethelberta felt quite the reverse of a lonely female persecuted by a wicked lord in a foreign country  he shall pay for his weaknesses whatever they mean she thought and what they mean i will find out at once  i am going to paris she said  you cannot tonight i think  tomorrow i mean  i should like to go on tomorrow  perhaps i may  so that there is a chance of our meeting again  yes but i do not leave rouen till the afternoon  i first shall go to the cathedral and drive round the city  lord mountclere smiled pleasantly  there seemed a sort of encouragement in her words  ethelbertas thoughts however had flown at that moment to the approaching situation at her aunts hotel it would be extremely embarrassing if he should go there  where do you stay lord mountclere she said  thus directly asked he could not but commit himself to the name of the hotel he had been accustomed to patronize which was one in the upper part of the city  mine is not that one said ethelberta frigidly  no further remark was made under this head and they conversed for the remainder of the daylight on scenery and other topics lord mountcleres air of festivity lending him all the qualities of an agreeable companion but notwithstanding her resolve ethelberta failed for that day at least to make her mind clear upon lord mountcleres intentions  to that end she would have liked first to know what were the exact limits set by society to conduct under present conditions if society had ever set any at all which was open to question since experience had long ago taught her that much more freedom actually prevails in the communion of the sexes than is put on paper as etiquette or admitted in so many words as correct behaviour  in short everything turned upon whether he had learnt of her position when off the platform at mayfair hall  wearied with these surmises and the days travel she closed her eyes and then her enamoured companion more widely opened his and traced the beautiful features opposite him  the arch of the browslike a slur in musicthe droop of the lashes the meeting of the lips and the sweet rotundity of the chinone by one and all together they were adored till his heart was like a retort full of spirits of wine  it was a warm evening and when they arrived at their journeys end distant thunder rolled behind heavy and opaque clouds  ethelberta bade adieu to her attentive satellite called to cornelia and entered a cab but before they reached the inn the thunder had increased  then a cloud cracked into flame behind the iron spire of the cathedral showing in relief its black ribs and stanchions as if they were the bars of a blazing cresset held on high  ah we will clamber up there tomorrow said ethelberta  a wondrous stillness pervaded the streets of the city after this though it was not late and their arrival at m moulins door was quite an event for the quay  no rain came as they had expected and by the time they halted the western sky had cleared so that the newlylit lamps on the quay and the evening glow shining over the river inwove their harmonious rays as the warp and woof of one lustrous tissue  before they had alighted there appeared from the archway madame moulin in person followed by the servants of the hotel in a manner signifying that they did not receive a visitor once a fortnight though at that moment the clatter of sixty knives forks and tongues was audible through an open window from the adjoining diningroom to the great interest of a group of idlers outside  ethelberta had not seen her aunt since she last passed through the town with lady petherwin who then told her that this landlady was the only respectable relative she seemed to have in the world  aunt charlottes face was an english outline filled in with french shades under the eyes on the brows and round the mouth by the natural effect of years she resembled the british hostess as little as well could be no point in her causing the slightest suggestion of drops taken for the stomachs sake  telling the two young women she would gladly have met them at the station had she known the hour of their arrival she kissed them both without much apparent notice of a difference in their conditions indeed seeming rather to incline to cornelia whose country face and homely style of clothing may have been more to her mind than ethelbertas finished travellingdress a class of article to which she appeared to be well accustomed  her husband was at this time at the head of the tabledhote and mentioning the fact as an excuse for his non appearance she accompanied them upstairs  after the strain of keeping up smiles with lord mountclere the rattle and shaking and the general excitements of the chase across the water and along the rail a face in which she saw a dim reflex of her mothers was soothing in the extreme and ethelberta went up to the staircase with a feeling of expansive thankfulness  cornelia paused to admire the clean court and the small caged birds sleeping on their perches the boxes of veronica in bloom of oleander and of tamarisk which freshened the air of the court and lent a romance to the lamplight the cooks in their paper caps and white blouses appearing at odd moments from an avernus behind while the prompt vla of teetotums in mob caps spinning down the staircase in answer to the periodic clang of bells filled her with wonder and pricked her conscience with thoughts of how seldom such transcendent nimbleness was attempted by herself in a part so nearly similar     34 the hotel beau sejour and spots near it   the next day much to ethelbertas surprise there was a letter for her in her mothers uphill hand  she neglected all the rest of its contents for the following engrossing sentences     menlove has wormed everything out of poor joey we find and your    father is much upset about it  she had another quarrel with him and    then declared she would expose you and us to mrs doncastle and all    your friends  i think that menlove is the kind of woman who will    stick to her word and the question for you to consider is how can    you best face out any report of the truth which she will spread and    contradict the lies that she will add to it  it appears to me to be a    dreadful thing and so it will probably appear to you  the worst part    will be that your sisters and brothers are your servants and that    your father is actually engaged in the house where you dine  i am    dreadful afraid that this will be considered a fine joke for gossips    and will cause no end of laughs in society at your expense  at any    rate should menlove spread the report it would absolutely prevent    people from attending your lectures next season for they would feel    like dupes and be angry with theirselves and you and all of us     the only way out of the muddle that i can see for you is to put some    scheme of marrying into effect as soon as possible and before these    things are known  surely by this time with all your opportunities    you have been able to strike up an acquaintance with some gentleman or    other so as to make a suitable match  you see my dear berta    marriage is a thing which once carried out fixes you more firm in a    position than any personal brains can do for as you stand at present    every loose tooth and every combedout hair and every new wrinkle    and every sleepless night is so much took away from your chance for    the future depending as it do upon your skill in charming  i know    that you have had some good offers so do listen to me and warm up    the best man of them again a bit and get him to repeat his words    before your roundness shrinks away and tis too late     mr ladywell has called here to see you it was just after i had    heard that this menlove might do harm so i thought i could do no    better than send down word to him that you would much like to see him    and were wondering sadly why he had not called lately  i gave him    your address at rouen that he might find you if he chose at once    and be got to propose since he is better than nobody  i believe he    said directly joey gave him the address that he was going abroad    and my opinion is that he will come to you because of the    encouragement i gave him  if so you must thank me for my foresight    and care for you     i heave a sigh of relief sometimes at the thought that i at any    rate found a husband before the present manfamine began  dont    refuse him this time theres a dear or mark my words youll have    cause to rue itunless you have beforehand got engaged to somebody    better than he  you will not if you have not already for the    exposure is sure to come soon  o this false positionit is ruining your nature my too thoughtful mother  but i will not accept any of themill brazen it out said ethelberta throwing the letter wherever it chose to fly and picking it up to read again  she stood and thought it all over  i must decide to do something was her sigh again and feeling an irresistible need of motion she put on her things and went out to see what resolve the morning would bring  no rain had fallen during the night and the air was now quiet in a warm heavy fog through which old cidersmells reminding her of wessex occasionally came from narrow streets in the background  ethelberta passed up the rue grandpont into the little dusky rue saintromain behind the cathedral being driven mechanically along by the fever and fret of her thoughts  she was about to enter the building by the transept door when she saw lord mountclere coming towards her  ethelberta felt equal to him or a dozen such this morning  the looming spectres raised by her mothers information the wearing sense of being overweighted in the race were driving her to a hamletlike fantasticism and defiance of augury moreover she was abroad  i am about to ascend to the parapets of the cathedral said she in answer to a half inquiry  i should be delighted to accompany you he rejoined in a manner as capable of explanation by his knowledge of her secret as was ethelbertas manner by her sense of nearing the end of her maying  but whether this frequent glide into her company was meant as ephemeral flirtation to fill the halfhours of his journey or whether it meant a serious love suitwhich were the only alternatives that had occurred to her on the subjectdid not trouble her now  i am bound to be civil to so great a lord she lightly thought and expressing no objection to his presence she passed with him through the outbuildings containing gothic lumber from the shadowy pile above and ascended the stone staircase  emerging from its windings they duly came to the long wooden ladder suspended in midair that led to the parapet of the tower  this being wide enough for two abreast she could hardly do otherwise than wait a moment for the viscount who up to this point had never faltered and who amused her as they went by scraps of his experience in various countries which to do him justice he told with vivacity and humour  thus they reached the end of the flight and entered behind a balustrade  the prospect will be very lovely from this point when the fog has blown off said lord mountclere faintly for climbing and chattering at the same time had fairly taken away his breath  he leant against the masonry to rest himself  the air is clearing already i fancy i saw a sunbeam or two  it will be lovelier above said ethelberta  let us go to the platform at the base of the fleche and wait for a view there  with all my heart said her attentive companion  they passed in at a door and up some more stone steps which landed them finally in the upper chamber of the tower  lord mountclere sank on a beam and asked smilingly if her ambition was not satisfied with this goal  i recollect going to the top some years ago he added and it did not occur to me as being a thing worth doing a second time  and there was no fog then either  o said ethelberta it is one of the most splendid things a person can do  the fog is going fast and everybody with the least artistic feeling in the direction of birdseye views makes the ascent every time of coming here  of course of course said lord mountclere  and i am only too happy to go to any height with you  since you so kindly offer we will go to the very top of the spireup through the fog and into the sunshine said ethelberta  lord mountclere covered a grim misgiving by a gay smile and away they went up a ladder admitting to the base of the huge iron framework above then they entered upon the regular ascent of the cage towards the hoped for celestial blue and among breezes which never descended so low as the town  the journey was enlivened with more breathless witticisms from lord mountclere till she stepped ahead of him again when he asked how many more steps there were  she inquired of the man in the blue blouse who accompanied them  fifty five she returned to lord mountclere a moment later  they went round and round and yet around  how many are there now lord mountclere demanded this time of the man  a hundred and ninety monsieur he said  but there were only fiftyfive ever so long ago  two hundred and five then said the man  perhaps the mist prevented mademoiselle hearing me distinctly  never mind i would follow were there five thousand more did mademoiselle bid me said the exhausted nobleman gallantly in english  hush said ethelberta with displeasure  he doesnt understand a word said lord mountclere  they paced the remainder of their spiral pathway in silence and having at last reached the summit lord mountclere sank down on one of the steps panting out dear me dear me  ethelberta leaned and looked around and said how extraordinary this is  it is sky above below everywhere  he dragged himself together and stepped to her side  they formed as it were a little world to themselves being completely ensphered by the fog which here was dense as a sea of milk  below was neither town country nor cathedralsimply whiteness into which the iron legs of their gigantic perch faded to nothing  we have lost our labour there is no prospect for you after all lord mountclere said ethelberta turning her eyes upon him  he looked at her face as if there were and she continued listen i hear sounds from the town peoples voices and carts and dogs and the noise of a railwaytrain  shall we now descend and own ourselves disappointed  whenever you choose  before they had put their intention in practice there appeared to be reasons for waiting awhile  out of the plain of fog beneath a stone tooth seemed to be upheaving itself then another showed forth  these were the summits of the st romain and the butter towersat the western end of the building  as the fog stratum collapsed other summits manifested their presence further offamong them the two spires and lantern of st ouens when to the left the dome of st madelines caught a first ray from the peering sun under which its scaly surface glittered like a fish  then the mist rolled off in earnest and revealed far beneath them a whole city its red blue and grey roofs forming a variegated pattern small and subdued as that of a pavement in mosaic eastward in the spacious outlook lay the hill of st catherine breaking intrusively into the large level valley of the seine south was the river which had been the parent of the mist and the ile lacroix gorgeous in scarlet purple and green  on the western horizon could be dimly discerned melancholy forests and further to the right stood the hill and rich groves of boisguillaume  ethelberta having now done looking around the descent was begun and continued without intermission till they came to the passage behind the parapet  ethelberta was about to step airily forward when there reached her ear the voices of persons below  she recognized as one of them the slow unaccented tones of neigh  please wait a minute she said in a peremptory manner of confusion sufficient to attract lord mountcleres attention  a recollection had sprung to her mind in a moment  she had half made an appointment with neigh at her aunts hotel for this very week and here was he in rouen to keep it  to meet him while indulging in this vagary with lord mountclerewhich now that the mood it had been engendered by was passing off she somewhat regrettedwould be the height of imprudence  i should like to go round to the other side of the parapet for a few moments she said with decisive quickness  come with me lord mountclere  they went round to the other side  here she kept the viscount and their suisse until she deemed it probable that neigh had passed by when she returned with her companions and descended to the bottom  they emerged into the rue saintromain whereupon a woman called from the opposite side of the way to their guide stating that she had told the other english gentleman that the english lady had gone into the fleche  ethelberta turned and looked up  she could just discern neighs form upon the steps of the fleche above ascending toilsomely in search of her  what english gentleman could that have been said lord mountclere after paying the man  he spoke in a way which showed he had not overlooked her confusion  it seems that he must have been searching for us or rather for you  only mr neigh said ethelberta  he told me he was coming here  i believe he is waiting for an interview with me  hm said lord mountclere  businessonly business said she  shall i leave you  perhaps the business is importantmost important  unfortunately it is  you must forgive me this once i cannot helpwill you give me permission to make a difficult remark said lord mountclere in an impatient voice  with pleasure  well then the business i meant wasan engagement to be married  had it been possible for a woman to be perpetually on the alert she might now have supposed that lord mountclere knew all about her a mechanical deference must have restrained such an illusion had he seen her in any other light than that of a distracting slave  but she answered quietly so did i  but how does he knowdear me dear me  i beg pardon said the viscount  she looked at him curiously as if to imply that he was seriously out of his reckoning in respect of her if he supposed that he would be allowed to continue this little play at lovemaking as long as he chose when she was offered the position of wife by a man so good as neigh  they stood in silence side by side till much to her ease cornelia appeared at the corner waiting  at the last moment he said in somewhat agitated tones and with what appeared to be a renewal of the respect which had been imperceptibly dropped since they crossed the channel i was not aware of your engagement to mr neigh  i fear i have been acting mistakenly on that account  there is no engagement as yet said she  lord mountclere brightened like a child  then may i have a few words in private  not nownot today said ethelberta with a certain irritation at she knew not what  believe me lord mountclere you are mistaken in many things  i mean you think more of me than you ought  a time will come when you will despise me for this days work and it is madness in you to go further  lord mountclere knowing what he did know may have imagined what she referred to but ethelberta was without the least proof that he had the key to her humour  well well ill be responsible for the madness he said  i know you to bea famous woman at all events and thats enough  i would say more but i cannot here  may i call upon you  not now  when shall i  if you must let it be a month hence at my house in town she said indifferently the hamlet mood being still upon her  yes call upon us then and i will tell you everything that may remain to be told if you should be inclined to listen  a rumour is afloat which will undeceive you in much and depress me to death  and now i will walk back pray excuse me  she entered the street and joined cornelia  lord mountclere paced irregularly along turned the corner and went towards his inn nearing which his tread grew lighter till he scarcely seemed to touch the ground  he became gleeful and said to himself nervously palming his hip with his left hand as if previous to plunging it into hot water for some prize upon my life ive a good mind  upon my life i have     i must make a straightforward thing of it and at once or he will have her  but he shall not and i willheehee  the fascinated man screaming inwardly with the excitement glee and agony of his position entered the hotel wrote a hasty note to ethelberta and despatched it by hand looked to his dress and appearance ordered a carriage and in a quarter of an hour was being driven towards the hotel beau sejour whither his note had preceded him     35 the hotel continued and the quay in front   ethelberta having arrived there some time earlier had gone straight to her aunt whom she found sitting behind a large ledger in the office making up the accounts with her husband a wellframed reflective man with a grey beard  m moulin bustled waited for her remarks and replies and made much of her in a general way when ethelberta said what she had wanted to say instantly has a gentleman called mr neigh been here  o yesi think it is neightheres a card upstairs replied her aunt i told him you were alone at the cathedral and i believe he walked that way  besides that one another has come for youa mr ladywell and he is waiting  not for me  yes indeed  i thought he seemed so anxious under a sort of assumed calmness that i recommended him to remain till you came in  goodness aunt why did you ethelberta said and thought how much her mothers sister resembled her mother in doings of that sort  i thought he had some good reason for seeing you  are these men intruders then  o noa woman who attempts a public career must expect to be treated as public property what would be an intrusion on a domiciled gentlewoman is a tribute to me  you cannot have celebrity and sexprivilege both  thus ethelberta laughed off the awkward conjuncture inwardly deploring the unconscionable maternal meddling which had led to this though not resentfully for she had too much staunchness of heart to decry a parents misdirected zeal  had the clanship feeling been universally as strong as in the chickerel family the fable of the wellbonded fagot might have remained unwritten  ladywell had sent her a letter about getting his picture of herself engraved for an illustrated paper and she had not replied considering that she had nothing to do with the matter her form and feature having been given in the painting as no portrait at all but as those of an ideal  to see him now would be vexatious and yet it was chilly and formal to an ungenerous degree to keep aloof from him sitting lonely in the same house  a few weeks hence she thought when menloves disclosures make me ridiculous he may slight me as a lackeys girl an upstart an adventuress and hardly return my bow in the street  then i may wish i had given him no personal cause for additional bitterness so putting off the fine lady ethelberta thought she would see ladywell at once  ladywell was unaffectedly glad to meet her so glad that ethelberta wished heartily for his sake there could be warm friendship between herself and him as well as all her lovers without that insistent courtshipandmarriage question which sent them all scattering like leaves in a pestilent blast at enmity with one another  she was less pleased when she found that ladywell after saying all there was to say about his painting gently signified that he had been misinformed as he believed concerning her future intentions which had led to his absenting himself entirely from her the remark being of course a natural product of her mothers injudicious message to him  she cut him short with terse candour  yes she said a false report is in circulation  i am not yet engaged to be married to any one if that is your meaning  ladywell looked cheerful at this frank answer and said tentatively am i forgotten  no you are exactly as you always were in my mind  then i have been cruelly deceived  i was guided too much by appearances and they were very delusive  i am beyond measure glad i came here today  i called at your house and learnt that you were here and as i was going out of town in any indefinite direction i settled then to come this way  what a happy idea it was  to think of you nowand i may be permitted to  assuredly you may not  how many times i have told you that  but i do not wish for any formal engagement said ladywell quickly fearing she might commit herself to some expression of positive denial which he could never surmount  ill waitill wait any length of time remember you have never absolutely forbidden myfriendship  will you delay your answer till some time hence when you have thoroughly considered since i fear it may be a hasty one now  yes indeed it may be hasty  you will delay it  yes  when shall it be  say a month hence  i suggest that because by that time you will have found an answer in your own mind strange things may happen before then she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say i will go and return to my firsthowever thats no matter  whatdid you ladywell began altogether bewildered by this  it is a passage in hosea which came to my mind as possibly applicable to myself some day she answered  it was mere impulse  hahaa jestone of your romances broken loose  there is no law for impulse that is why i am here  thus fancifully they conversed till the interview concluded  getting her to promise that she would see him again ladywell retired to a sitting room on the same landing in which he had been writing letters before she came up  immediately upon this her aunt who began to suspect that something peculiar was in the wind came to tell her that mr neigh had been inquiring for her again  send him in said ethelberta  neighs footsteps approached and the wellknown figure entered ethelberta received him smilingly for she was getting so used to awkward juxtapositions that she treated them quite as a natural situation  she merely hoped that ladywell would not hear them talking through the partition  neigh scarcely said anything as a beginning she knew his errand perfectly and unaccountable as it was to her the strange and unceremonious relationship between them that had originated in the peculiar conditions of their first close meeting was continued now as usual  have you been able to bestow a thought on the question between us  i hope so said neigh  it is no use said ethelberta  wait a month and you will not require an answer  you will not mind speaking low because of a person in the next room  not at allwhy will that be  i might say but let us speak of something else  i dont see how we can said neigh brusquely  i had no other reason on earth for calling here  i wished to get the matter settled and i could not be satisfied without seeing you  i hate writing on matters of this sort  in fact i cant do it and thats why i am here  he was still speaking when an attendant entered with a note  will you excuse me one moment said ethelberta stepping to the window and opening the missive  it contained these words only in a scrawl so full of deformities that she could hardly piece its meaning together     i must see you again today unless you absolutely deny yourself to    me which i shall take as a refusal to meet me any more  i will    arrive punctually five minutes after you receive this note  do pray    be alone if you can and eternally gratifyyours     mountclere  if anything has happened i shall be pleased to wait said neigh seeing her concern when she had closed the note  o no it is nothing said ethelberta precipitately  yet i think i will ask you to wait she added not liking to dismiss neigh in a hurry for she was not insensible to his perseverance in seeking her over all these miles of sea and land and secondly she feared that if he were to leave on the instant he might run into the arms of lord mountclere and ladywell  i shall be only too happy to stay till you are at leisure said neigh in the unimpassioned delivery he used whether his meaning were a trite compliment or the expression of his most earnest feeling  i may be rather a long time said ethelberta dubiously  my time is yours  ethelberta left the room and hurried to her aunt exclaiming o aunt charlotte i hope you have rooms enough to spare for my visitors for they are like the fox the goose and the corn in the riddle i cannot leave them together and i can only be with one at a time  i want the nicest drawingroom you have for an interview of a bare two minutes with an old gentleman  i am so sorry this has happened but it is not altogether my fault  i only arranged to see one of them but the other was sent to me by mother in a mistake and the third met with me on my journey thats the explanation  theres the oldest of them just come  she looked through the glass partition and under the arch of the court gate as the wheels of the viscounts carriage were heard outside ethelberta ascended to a room on the first floor lord mountclere was shown up and the door closed upon them  at this time neigh was very comfortably lounging in an armchair in ethelbertas room on the second floor  this was a pleasant enough way of passing the minutes with such a tender interview in prospect and as he leant he looked with languid and luxurious interest through the open casement at the spars and rigging of some luggers on the seine the pillars of the suspension bridge and the scenery of the faubourg st sever on the other side of the river  how languid his interest might ultimately have become there is no knowing but there soon arose upon his ear the accents of ethelberta in low distinctness from somewhere outside the room  yes the scene is pleasant today she said  i like a view over a river  i should think the steamboats are objectionable when they stop here said another person  neighs face closed in to an aspect of perplexity  surely that cannot be lord mountclere he muttered  had he been certain that ethelberta was only talking to a stranger neigh would probably have felt their conversation to be no business of his much as he might have been surprised to find her giving audience to another man at such a place  but his impression that the voice was that of his acquaintance lord mountclere coupled with doubts as to its possibility was enough to lead him to rise from the chair and put his head out of the window  upon a balcony beneath him were the speakers as he had suspectedethelberta and the viscount  looking right and left he saw projecting from the next window the head of his friend ladywell gazing right and left likewise apparently just drawn out by the same voice which had attracted himself  whatyou neighhow strange came from ladywells lips before he had time to recollect that great coolness existed between himself and neigh on ethelbertas account which had led to the reduction of their intimacy to the most attenuated of nods and goodmornings ever since the harlequin rose incident at cripplegate  yes it is rather strange said neigh with saturnine evenness  still a fellow must be somewhere  each then looked over his windowsill downwards upon the speakers who had attracted them thither  lord mountclere uttered something in a low tone which did not reach the young men to which ethelberta replied as i have said lord mountclere i cannot give you an answer now  i must consider what to do with mr neigh and mr ladywell  it is too sudden for me to decide at once  i could not do so until i have got home to england when i will write you a letter stating frankly my affairs and those of my relatives  i shall not consider that you have addressed me on the subject of marriage until having received my letter you  repeat my proposal said lord mountclere  yes  my dear mrs petherwin it is as good as repeated  but i have no right to assume anything you dont wish me to assume and i will wait  how long is it that i am to suffer in this uncertainty  a month  by that time i shall have grown weary of my other two suitors  a month  really inflexible  ethelberta had returned inside the window and her answer was inaudible ladywell and neigh looked up and their eyes met  both had been reluctant to remain where they stood but they were too fascinated to instantly retire  neigh moved now and ladywell did the same  each saw that the face of his companion was flushed  come in and see me said ladywell quickly before quite withdrawing his head  i am staying in this room  i will said neigh and taking his hat he left ethelbertas apartment forthwith  on entering the quarters of his friend he found him seated at a table whereon writing materials were strewn  they shook hands in silence but the meaning in their looks was enough  just let me write a note ladywell and im your man said neigh then with the freedom of an old acquaintance  i was going to do the same thing said ladywell  neigh then sat down and for a minute or two nothing was to be heard but the scratching of a pair of pens ending on the one side with a more boisterous scratch as the writer shaped eustace ladywell and on the other with slow firmness in the characters alfred neigh  theres for you my fair one said neigh closing and directing his letter  yours is for mrs petherwin  so is mine said ladywell grasping the bellpull  shall i direct it to be put on her table with this one  thanks  and the two letters went off to ethelbertas sittingroom which she had vacated to receive lord mountclere in an empty one beneath neighs letter was simply a pleading of a sudden call away which prevented his waiting till she should return ladywells though stating the same reason for leaving was more of an upbraiding nature and might almost have told its reader were she to take the trouble to guess that he knew of the business of lord mountclere with her today  now let us get out of this place said neigh  he proceeded at once down the stairs followed by ladywell whosettling his account at the bureau without calling for a bill and directing his portmanteau to be sent to the rightbank railway stationwent with neigh into the street  they had not walked fifty yards up the quay when two british workmen in holiday costume who had just turned the corner of the rue jeanne darc approached them  seeing him to be an englishman one of the two addressed neigh saying can you tell us the way sir to the hotel bold soldier  neigh pointed out the place he had just come from to the tall young men and continued his walk with ladywell  ladywell was the first to break silence  i have been considerably misled neigh he said and i imagine from what has just happened that you have been misled too  just a little said neigh bringing abstracted lines of meditation into his face  but it was my own fault for i ought to have known that these stage and platform women have what they are pleased to call bohemianism so thoroughly engrained with their natures that they are no more constant to usage in their sentiments than they are in their way of living  good lord to think she has caught old mountclere  she is sure to have him if she does not dally with him so long that he gets cool again  a beautiful creature like her to think of marrying such an infatuated idiot as he  he can give her a title as well as younger men  it will not be the first time that such matches have been made  i cant believe it said ladywell vehemently  she has too much poetry in hertoo much good sense her nature is the essence of all thats romantic  i cant help saying it though she has treated me cruelly  she has good looks certainly  ill own to that  as for her romance and goodfeeling that i leave to you  i think she has treated you no more cruelly as you call it than she has me come to that  she told me she would give me an answer in a month said ladywell emotionally  so she told me said neigh  and so she told him said ladywell  and i have no doubt she will keep her word to him in her usual precise manner  but see what she implied to me  i distinctly understood from her that the answer would be favourable  so did i  so does he  and he is sure to be the one who gets it since only one of us can well i wouldnt marry her for love money nor  offspring  exactly i would not  ill give you an answer in a monthto all three of us  for gods sake lets sit down here and have something to drink  they drew up a couple of chairs to one of the tables of a wineshop close by and shouted to the waiter with the vigour of persons going to the dogs  here behind the horizontalheaded trees that dotted this part of the quay they sat over their bottles denouncing womankind till the sun got low down upon the river and the houses on the further side began to be toned by a blue mist  at last they rose from their seats and departed neigh to dine and consider his route and ladywell to take the train for dieppe  while these incidents had been in progress the two workmen had found their way into the hotel where ethelberta was staying  passing through the entrance they stood at gaze in the court much perplexed as to the door to be made for the difficulty was solved by the appearance of cornelia who in expectation of them had been for the last halfhour leaning over the sill of her bedroom window which looked into the interior amusing herself by watching the movements to and fro in the court beneath  after conversing awhile in undertones as if they had no real right there at all cornelia told them she would call their sister if an old gentleman who had been to see her were gone again  cornelia then ran away and sol and dan stood aloof till they had seen the old gentleman alluded to go to the door and drive off shortly after which ethelberta ran down to meet them  whatever have you got as your luggage she said after hearing a few words about their journey and looking at a curious object like a huge extended accordion with bellows of gorgeouspatterned carpeting  well i thought to myself said sol tis a terrible bother about carrying our things  so what did i do but turn to and make a carpetbag that would hold all mine and dans too  this you see berta is a deal top and bottom out of threequarter stuff stained and varnished  well then you see ive got carpet sides tacked on with these brass nails which make it look very handsome and so when my bag is empty twill shut up and be only a couple of boards under yer arm and when tis open it will hold amost anything you like to put in it  that portmantle didnt cost more than three halfcrowns altogether and ten pound wouldnt ha got anything so strong from a portmantle maker would it dan  well no  and then you see berta sol continued in the same earnest tone and further exhibiting the article ive made this trapdoor in the top with hinges and padlock complete so that  i am afraid it is tiring you after your journey to explain all this to me said ethelberta gently noticing that a few gallic smilers were gathering round  aunt has found a nice room for you at the top of the staircase in that cornerescalier d youll see painted at the bottomand when you have been up come across to me at number thirtyfour on this side and well talk about everything  look here sol said dan who had left his brother and gone on to the stairs  what a rum staircasethe treads all in little blocks and painted chocolate as i am alive  i am afraid i shall not be able to go on to paris with you after all ethelberta continued to sol  something has just happened which makes it desirable for me to return at once to england  but i will write a list of all you are to see and where you are to go so that it will make little difference i hope  ten minutes before this time ethelberta had been frankly and earnestly asked by lord mountclere to become his bride not only so but he pressed her to consent to have the ceremony performed before they returned to england  ethelberta had unquestionably been much surprised and barring the fact that the viscount was somewhat ancient in comparison with herself the temptation to close with his offer was strong and would have been felt as such by any woman in the position of ethelberta now a little reckless by stress of circumstances and tinged with a bitterness of spirit against herself and the world generally  but she was experienced enough to know what heaviness might result from a hasty marriage entered into with a mind full of concealments and suppressions which if told were likely to stop the marriage altogether and after trying to bring herself to speak of her family and situation to lord mountclere as he stood a certain caution triumphed and she concluded that it would be better to postpone her reply till she could consider which of two courses it would be advisable to adopt to write and explain to him or to explain nothing and refuse him  the third course to explain nothing and hasten the wedding she rejected without hesitation with a pervading sense of her own obligations in forming this compact it did not occur to her to ask if lord mountclere might not have duties of explanation equally with herself though bearing rather on the moral than the social aspects of the case  her resolution not to go on to paris was formed simply because lord mountclere himself was proceeding in that direction which might lead to other unseemly rencounters with him had she too persevered in her journey  she accordingly gave sol and dan directions for their guidance to paris and back starting herself with cornelia the next day to return again to knollsea and to decide finally and for ever what to do in the vexed question at present agitating her  never before in her life had she treated marriage in such a terribly cool and cynical spirit as she had done that day she was almost frightened at herself in thinking of it  how far any known system of ethics might excuse her on the score of those curious pressures which had been brought to bear upon her life or whether it could excuse her at all she had no spirit to inquire  english society appeared a gloomy concretion enough to abide in as she contemplated it on this journey home yet since its gloominess was less an essential quality than an accident of her point of view that point of view she had determined to change  there lay open to her two directions in which to move  she might annex herself to the easygoing high by wedding an old nobleman or she might join for good and all the easygoing low by plunging back to the level of her family giving up all her ambitions for them settling as the wife of a provincial musicmaster named julian with a little shop of fiddles and flutes a couple of old pianos a few sheets of stale music pinned to a string and a narrow back parlour wherein she would wait for the phenomenon of a customer  and each of these divergent grooves had its fascinations till she reflected with regard to the first that even though she were a legal and indisputable lady mountclere she might be despised by my lords circle and left lone and lorn  the intermediate path of accepting neigh or ladywell had no more attractions for her taste than the fact of disappointing them had qualms for her conscience and how few these were may be inferred from her opinion true or false that two words about the spigot on her escutcheon would sweep her lovers affections to the antipodes  she had now and then imagined that her previous intermarriage with the petherwin family might efface much besides her surname but experience proved that the having been wife for a few weeks to a minor who died in his fathers lifetime did not weave such a tissue of glory about her course as would resist a speedy undoing by startling confessions on her station before her marriage and her environments now     36 the house in town   returning by way of knollsea where she remained a week or two ethelberta appeared one evening at the end of september before her house in exonbury crescent accompanied by a pair of cabs with the children and luggage but picotee was left at knollsea for reasons which ethelberta explained when the family assembled in conclave  her father was there and began telling her of a surprising change in menlovean unaskedfor concession to their cause and a vow of secrecy which he could not account for unless any friend of ethelbertas had bribed her  o nothat cannot be said she  any influence of lord mountclere to that effect was the last thing that could enter her thoughts  however what menlove does makes little difference to me now  and she proceeded to state that she had almost come to a decision which would entirely alter their way of living  i hope it will not be of the sort your last decision was said her mother  no quite the reverse  i shall not live here in state any longer  we will let the house throughout as lodgings while it is ours and you and the girls must manage it  i will retire from the scene altogether and stay for the winter at knollsea with picotee  i want to consider my plans for next year and i would rather be away from town  picotee is left there and i return in two days with the books and papers i require  what are your plans to be  i am going to be a schoolmistressi think i am  a schoolmistress  yes  and picotee returns to the same occupation which she ought never to have forsaken  we are going to study arithmetic and geography until christmas then i shall send her adrift to finish her term as pupilteacher while i go into a trainingschool  by the time i have to give up this house i shall just have got a little country school  but said her mother aghast why not write more poems and sell em  why not be a governess as you were said her father  why not go on with your tales at mayfair hall said gwendoline  ill answer as well as i can  i have decided to give up romancing because i cannot think of any more that pleases me  i have been trying at knollsea for a fortnight and it is no use  i will never be a governess again i would rather be a servant  if i am a schoolmistress i shall be entirely free from all contact with the great which is what i desire for i hate them and am getting almost as revolutionary as sol father i cannot endure this kind of existence any longer i sleep at night as if i had committed a murder i start up and see processions of people audiences battalions of lovers obtained under false pretencesall denouncing me with the finger of ridicule  mothers suggestion about my marrying i followed out as far as dogged resolution would carry me but during my journey here i have broken down for i dont want to marry a second time among people who would regard me as an upstart or intruder  i am sick of ambition  my only longing now is to fly from society altogether and go to any hovel on earth where i could be at peace  whathas anybody been insulting you said mrs chickerel  yes or rather i sometimes think he may have that is if a proposal of marriage is only removed from being a proposal of a very different kind by an accident  a proposal of marriage can never be an insult her mother returned  i think otherwise said ethelberta  so do i said her father  unless the man was beneath you and i dont suppose he was that added mrs chickerel  you are quite right he was not that  but we will not talk of this branch of the subject  by far the most serious concern with me is that i ought to do some good by marriage or by heroic performance of some kind while going back to give the rudiments of education to remote hamleteers will do none of you any good whatever  never you mind us said her father mind yourself  i shall hardly be minding myself either in your opinion by doing that said ethelberta dryly  but it will be more tolerable than what i am doing now  georgina and myrtle and emmeline and joey will not get the education i intended for them but that must go i suppose  how full of vagaries you are said her mother  why wont it do to continue as you are  no sooner have i learnt up your schemes and got enough used to em to see something in em than you must needs bewilder me again by starting some fresh one so that my mind gets no rest at all  ethelberta too keenly felt the justice of this remark querulous as it was to care to defend herself  it was hopeless to attempt to explain to her mother that the oscillations of her mind might arise as naturally from the perfection of its balance like those of a loganstone as from inherent lightness and such an explanation however comforting to its subject was little better than none to simple hearts who only could look to tangible outcrops  really ethelberta remonstrated her mother this is very odd  making yourself miserable in trying to get a position on our account is one thing and not necessary but i think it ridiculous to rush into the other extreme and go wilfully down in the scale  you may just as well exercise your wits in trying to swim as in trying to sink  yes thats what i think said her father  but of course berta knows best  i think so too said gwendoline  and so do i said cornelia  if i had once moved about in large circles like ethelberta i wouldnt go down and be a schoolmistressnot i  i own it is foolishsuppose it is said ethelberta wearily and with a readiness of misgiving that showed how recent and hasty was the scheme perhaps you are right mother anything rather than retreat  i wonder if you are right  well i will think again of it tonight  do not let us speak more about it now  she did think of it that night very long and painfully  the arguments of her relatives seemed ponderous as opposed to her own inconsequent longing for escape from galling trammels  if she had stood alone the sentiment that she had begun to build but was not able to finish by whomsoever it might have been entertained would have had few terrors but that the opinion should be held by her nearest of kin to cause them pain for life was a grievous thing  the more she thought of it the less easy seemed the justification of her desire for obscurity  from regarding it as a high instinct she passed into a humour that gave that desire the appearance of a whim  but could she really set in train events which if not abortive would take her to the altar with viscount mountclere  in one determination she never faltered to commit her sin thoroughly if she committed it at all  her relatives believed her choice to lie between neigh and ladywell alone  but once having decided to pass over christopher whom she had loved there could be no pausing for ladywell because she liked him or for neigh in that she was influenced by him they were both too near her level to be trusted to bear the shock of receiving her from her fathers hands  but it was possible that though her genesis might tinge with vulgarity a commoners household susceptible of such depreciation it might show as a picturesque contrast in the family circle of a peer  hence it was just as well to go to the end of her logic where reasons for tergiversation would be most pronounced  this thought of the viscount however was a secret for her own breast alone  nearly the whole of that night she sat weighingfirst the question itself of marrying lord mountclere and at other times whether for safety she might marry him without previously revealing family particulars hitherto held necessary to be revealeda piece of conduct she had once felt to be indefensible  the ingenious ethelberta much more prone than the majority of women to theorize on conduct felt the need of some soothing defence of the actions involved in any ambiguous course before finally committing herself to it  she took down a wellknown treatise on utilitarianism which she had perused once before and to which she had given her adherence ere any instance had arisen wherein she might wish to take it as a guide  here she desultorily searched for argument and found it but the application of her authors philosophy to the marriage question was an operation of her own as unjustifiable as it was likely in the circumstances     the ultimate end she read with reference to and for the sake of    which all other things are desirable whether we are considering our    own good or that of other people is an existence exempt as far as    possible from pain and as rich as possible in enjoyments both in    point of quantity and quality     this being according to the    utilitarian opinion the end of human action is necessarily also the    standard of morality  it was an open question so far whether her own happiness should or should not be preferred to that of others  but that her personal interests were not to be considered as paramount appeared further on     the happiness which forms the standard of what is right in conduct is    not the agents own happiness but that of all concerned  as between    his own happiness and that of others utilitarianism requires him to    be as strictly impartial as a disinterested and benevolent spectator  as to whose happiness was meant by that of other people all concerned and so on her luminous moralist soon enlightened her     the occasions on which any person except one in a thousand has it    in his power to do this on an extended scalein other words to be a    public benefactorare but exceptional and on these occasions alone    is he called on to consider public utility in every other case    private utility the interest or happiness of some few persons is all    he has to attend to  and that these few persons should be those endeared to her by every domestic tie no argument was needed to prove  that their happiness would be in proportion to her own welldoing and power to remove their risks of indigence required no proving either to her now  by a sorry but unconscious misapplication of sound and wide reasoning did the active mind of ethelberta thus find itself a solace  at about the midnight hour she felt more fortified on the expediency of marriage with lord mountclere than she had done at all since musing on it  in respect of the second query whether or not in that event to conceal from lord mountclere the circumstances of her position till it should be too late for him to object to them she found her conscience inconveniently in the way of her theory and the oracle before her afforded no hint  ahit is a point for a casuist she said  an old treatise on casuistry lay on the top shelf  she opened itmore from curiosity than from guidance this time it must be observedat a chapter bearing on her own problem the disciplina arcani or the doctrine of reserve  here she read that there were plenty of apparent instances of this in scripture and that it was formed into a recognized system in the early church  with reference to direct acts of deception it was argued that since there were confessedly cases where killing is no murder might there not be cases where lying is no sin  it could not be rightor indeed anything but most absurdto say in effect that no doubt circumstances would occur where every sound man would tell a lie and would be a brute or a fool if he did not and to say at the same time that it is quite indefensible in principle  duty was the key to conduct then and if in such cases duties appeared to clash they would be found not to do so on examination  the lesser duty would yield to the greater and therefore ceased to be a duty  this author she found to be not so tolerable he distracted her  she put him aside and gave over reading having decided on this second point that she would at any hazard represent the truth to lord mountclere before listening to another word from him  well at last i have done she said and am ready for my role  in looking back upon her past as she retired to rest ethelberta could almost doubt herself to be the identical woman with her who had entered on a romantic career a few short years ago  for that doubt she had good reason  she had begun as a poet of the satanic school in a sweetened form she was ending as a pseudoutilitarian  was there ever such a transmutation effected before by the action of a hard environment  it was not without a qualm of regret that she discerned how the last infirmity of a noble mind had at length nearly departed from her  she wondered if her early notes had had the genuine ring in them or whether a poet who could be thrust by realities to a distance beyond recognition as such was a true poet at all  yet ethelbertas gradient had been regular emotional poetry light verse romance as an object romance as a means thoughts of marriage as an aid to her pursuits a vow to marry for the good of her family in other words from soft and playful romanticism to distorted benthamism  was the moral incline upward or down     37 knollseaan ornamental villa   her energies collected and fermented anew by the results of the vigil ethelberta left town for knollsea where she joined picotee the same evening  picotee produced a letter which had been addressed to her sister at their london residence but was not received by her there mrs chickerel having forwarded it to knollsea the day before ethelberta arrived in town  the crinkled writing in character like the coastline of tierra del fuego was becoming familiar by this time  while reading the note she informed picotee between a quick breath and a rustle of frills that it was from lord mountclere who wrote on the subject of calling to see her suggesting a day in the following week  now picotee she continued we shall have to receive him and make the most of him for i have altered my plans since i was last in knollsea  altered them again  what are you going to be nownot a poor person after all  indeed not  and so i turn and turn  can you imagine what lord mountclere is coming for  but dont say what you think  before i reply to this letter we must go into new lodgings to give them as our address the first business tomorrow morning will be to look for the gayest house we can find and captain flower and this little cabin of his must be things we have never known  the next day after breakfast they accordingly sallied forth  knollsea had recently begun to attract notice in the world  it had this year undergone visitation from a score of professional gentlemen and their wives a minor canon three marine painters seven young ladies with books in their hands and nineandthirty babies  hence a few lodginghouses of a dash and pretentiousness far beyond the mark of the old cottages which formed the original substance of the village had been erected to meet the wants of such as these  to a building of this class ethelberta now bent her steps and the crush of the season having departed in the persons of threequarters of the abovenamed visitors who went away by a coach a van and a couple of wagonettes one morning she found no difficulty in arranging for a red and yellow streaked villa which was so bright and glowing that the sun seemed to be shining upon it even on a cloudy day and the ruddiest native looked pale when standing by its walls  it was not without regret that she renounced the sailors pretty cottage for this porticoed and balconied dwelling but her lines were laid down clearly at last and thither she removed forthwith  from this brandnew house did ethelberta pen the letter fixing the time at which she would be pleased to see lord mountclere  when the hour drew nigh enormous force of will was required to keep her perturbation down  she had not distinctly told picotee of the object of the viscounts visit but picotee guessed nearly enough  ethelberta was upon the whole better pleased that the initiative had again come from him than if the first step in the new campaign had been her sending the explanatory letter as intended and promised  she had thought almost directly after the interview at rouen that to enlighten him by writing a confession in cold blood according to her first intention would be little less awkward for her in the method of telling than in the facts to be told  so the last hair was arranged and the last fold adjusted and she sat down to await a new page of her history  picotee sat with her under orders to go into the next room when lord mountclere should call and ethelberta determined to waste no time directly he began to make advances in clearing up the phenomena of her existence to him to the end that no fact which in the event of his taking her to wife could be used against her as an example of concealment might remain unrelated the collapse of his attachment under the test might however form the grand climax of such a play as this  the day was rather cold for the season and ethelberta sat by a fire but the windows were open and picotee was amusing herself on the balcony outside  the hour struck ethelberta fancied she could hear the wheels of a carriage creeping up the steep ascent which led to the drive before the door  is it he she said quickly  no said picotee whose indifference contrasted strangely with the restlessness of her who was usually the coolest  it is a man shaking down apples in the garden over the wall  they lingered on till some three or four minutes had gone by  surely thats a carriage said ethelberta then  i think it is said picotee outside stretching her neck forward as far as she could  no it is the men on the beach dragging up their boats they expect wind tonight  how wearisome  picotee you may as well come inside if he means to call he will but he ought to be here by this time  it was only once more and that some time later that she again said listen  thats not the noise of a carriage it is the fizz of a rocket  the coastguardsmen are practising the lifeapparatus today to be ready for the autumn wrecks  ah said ethelberta her face clearing up  hers had not been a sweethearts impatience but her mood had intensified during these minutes of suspense to a harassing mistrust of her mancompelling power which was if that were possible more gloomy than disappointed love  i know now where he is  that operation with the cradleapparatus is very interesting and he is stopping to see it     but i shall not wait indoors much longer whatever he may be stopping to see  it is very unaccountable and vexing after moving into this new house too  we were much more comfortable in the old one  in keeping any previous appointment in which i have been concerned he has been ridiculously early  shall i run round said picotee and if he is not watching them we will go out  very well said her sister  the time of picotees absence seemed an age  ethelberta heard the roar of another rocket and still picotee did not return  what can the girl be thinking of she mused     what a halfandhalf policy mine has been  thinking of marrying for position and yet not making it my rigid plan to secure the man the first moment that he made his offer  so i lose the comfort of having a soul above worldliness and my compensation for not having it likewise  a minute or two more and in came picotee  what has kept you so longand how excited you look said ethelberta  i thought i would stay a little while as i had never seen a rocketapparatus said picotee faintly and strangely  but is he there asked her sister impatiently  yeshe was  hes gone now  lord mountclere  no  there is no old man there at all  mr julian was there  a little ah came from ethelberta like a note from a stormbird at night  she turned round and went into the back room  is mr julian going to call here she inquired coming forward again  nohes gone by the steamboat  he was only passing through on his way to sandbourne where he is gone to settle a small business relating to his fathers affairs  he was not in knollsea ten minutes owing to something which detained him on the way  did he inquire for me  no  and only think ethelbertasuch a remarkable thing has happened though i nearly forgot to tell you  he says that coming along the road he was overtaken by a carriage and when it had just passed him one of the horses shied pushed the other down a slope and overturned the carriage  one wheel came off and trundled to the bottom of the hill by itself  christopher of course ran up and helped out of the carriage an old gentlemannow do you know whats likely  it was lord mountclere  i am glad thats the cause said ethelberta involuntarily  i imagined you would suppose it to be lord mountclere  but mr julian did not know the gentleman and said nothing about who he might be  did he describe him  not muchjust a little  well  he said he was a sly old dog apparently to hear how he swore in whispers  this affair is what made mr julian so late that he had no time to call here  lord mountcleres ankleif it was lord mountclerewas badly sprained  but the servants were not injured beyond a scratch on the coachmans face  then they got another carriage and drove at once back again  it must be he or else why is he not come  it is a pity too that mr julian was hindered by this so that there was no opportunity for him to bide a bit in knollsea  ethelberta was not disposed to believe that christopher would have called had time favoured him to the utmost  between himself and her there was that kind of division which is more insurmountable than enmity for estrangements produced by good judgment will last when those of feeling break down in smiles  not the lovers who part in passion but the lovers who part in friendship are those who most frequently part for ever  did you tell mr julian that the injured gentleman was possibly lord mountclere and that he was coming here said ethelberta  i made no remark at alli did not think of him till afterwards  the inquiry was hardly necessary for picotees words would dry away like a brook in the sands when she held conversation with christopher  as they had anticipated the sufferer was no other than their intending visitor  next morning there was a note explaining the accident and expressing its writers suffering from the cruel delay as greater than that from the swollen ankle which was progressing favourably  nothing further was heard of lord mountclere for more than a week when she received another letter which put an end to her season of relaxation and once more braced her to the contest  this epistle was very courteously written and in point of correctness propriety and gravity might have come from the quill of a bishop  herein the old nobleman gave a further description of the accident but the main business of the communication was to ask her if since he was not as yet very active she would come to enckworth court and delight himself and a small group of friends who were visiting there  she pondered over the letter as she walked by the shore that day and after some hesitation decided to go     38 enckworth court   it was on a dull stagnant noiseless afternoon of autumn that ethelberta first crossed the threshold of enckworth court  the daylight was so lowered by the impervious roof of cloud overhead that it scarcely reached further into lord mountcleres entrancehall than to the splays of the windows even but an hour or two after midday and indoors the glitter of the fire reflected itself from the very panes so inconsiderable were the opposing rays  enckworth court in its main part had not been standing more than a hundred years  at that date the weakened portions of the original mediaeval structure were pulled down and cleared away old jambs being carried off for rickstaddles and the foliated timbers of the hall roof making themselves useful as fancy chairs in the summerhouses of rising inns  a new block of masonry was built up from the ground of such height and lordliness that the remnant of the old pile left standing became as a mere cupbearer and culinary menial beside it  the rooms in this old fragment which had in times past been considered sufficiently dignified for dininghall withdrawingroom and so on were now reckoned barely high enough for sculleries servants hall and laundries the whole of which were arranged therein  the modern portion had been planned with such a total disregard of association that the very rudeness of the contrast gave an interest to the mass which it might have wanted had perfect harmony been attempted between the old nucleus and its adjuncts a probable result if the enlargement had taken place later on in time  the issue was that the hooded windows simple stringcourses and random masonry of the gothic workman stood elbow to elbow with the equalspaced ashlar architraves and fasciae of the classic addition each telling its distinct tale as to stage of thought and domestic habit without any of those artifices of blending or restoration by which the seeker for history in stones will be utterly hoodwinked in time to come  to the left of the door and vestibule which ethelberta passed through rose the principal staircase constructed of a freestone so milkwhite and delicately moulded as to be easily conceived in the lamplight as of biscuitware  who unacquainted with the secrets of geometrical construction could imagine that hanging so airily there to all appearance supported on nothing were twenty or more tons dead weight of stone that would have made a prison for an elephant if so arranged  the art which produced this illusion was questionable but its success was undoubted  how lovely said ethelberta as she looked at the fairy ascent  his staircase alone is worth my hand  passing along by the colonnade which partly fenced the staircase from the visitor the saloon was reached an apartment forming a double cube about the lefthand end of this were grouped the drawingrooms and library while on the right was the dininghall with billiard smoking and gun rooms in mysterious remoteness beyond  without attempting to trace an analogy between a man and his mansion it may be stated that everything here though so dignified and magnificent was not conceived in quite the true and eternal spirit of art  it was a house in which pugin would have torn his hair  those massive blocks of redveined marble lining the hallemulating in their surfaceglitter the escalier de marbre at versailleswere cunning imitations in paint and plaster by workmen brought from afar for the purpose at a prodigious expense by the present viscounts father and recently repaired and re varnished  the dark green columns and pilasters corresponding were brick at the core  nay the external walls apparently of massive and solid freestone were only veneered with that material being like the pillars of brick within  to a stone mask worn by a brick face a story naturally appertainedone which has since done service in other quarters  when the vast addition had just been completed king george visited enckworth  its owner pointed out the features of its grand architectural attempt and waited for commendation  brick brick brick said the king  the georgian lord mountclere blushed faintly albeit to his very poll and said nothing more about his house that day  when the king was gone he sent frantically for the craftsmen recently dismissed and soon the green lawns became again the colour of a nineelms cement wharf  thin freestone slabs were affixed to the whole series of fronts by copper cramps and dowels each one of substance sufficient to have furnished a poor boys pocket with pennies for a month till not a speck of the original surface remained and the edifice shone in all the grandeur of massive masonry that was not massive at all  but who remembered this save the builder and his crew and as long as nobody knew the truth pretence looked just as well  what was honest in enckworth court was that portion of the original edifice which still remained now degraded to subservient uses  where the untitled mountclere of the white rose faction had spread his knees over the brands when the place was a castle and not a court the still room maid now simmered her preserves and where elizabethan mothers and daughters of that sturdy line had tapestried the lovescenes of isaac and jacob boots and shoes were now cleaned and coals stowed away  lord mountclere had so far recovered from the sprain as to be nominally quite well under pressure of a wish to receive guests  the sprain had in one sense served him excellently  he had now a reason apart from that of years for walking with his stick and took care to let the reason be frequently known  today he entertained a larger number of persons than had been assembled within his walls for a great length of time  until after dinner ethelberta felt as if she were staying at an hotel few of the people whom she had met at the meeting of the imperial association greeted her here  the viscounts brother was not present but sir cyril blandsbury and his wife were there a lively pair of persons entertaining as actors and friendly as dogs  beyond these all the faces and figures were new to her though they were handsome and dashing enough to satisfy a court chronicler  ethelberta in a dress sloped about as high over the shoulder as would have drawn approval from reynolds and expostulation from lely thawed and thawed each friend who came near her and sent him or her away smiling yet she felt a little surprise  she had seldom visited at a countryhouse and knew little of the ordinary composition of a group of visitors within its walls but the present assemblage seemed to want much of that oldfashioned stability and quaint monumental dignity she had expected to find under this historical roof  nobody of her entertainers own rank appeared  not a single clergyman was there  a tendency to talk walpolean scandal about foreign courts was particularly manifest  and although tropical travellers indian officers and their wives courteous exiles and descendants of irish kings were infinitely more pleasant than lord mountcleres landed neighbours would probably have been to such a cosmopolite as ethelberta a calm tory or old whig company would have given a greater treat  they would have struck as gratefully upon her senses as sylvan scenery after crags and cliffs or silence after the roar of a cataract  it was evening and all these personages at enckworth court were merry snug and warm within its walls  dinnertime had passed and everything had gone on well when mrs tara ofanagan who had a goldclamped tooth which shone every now and then asked ethelberta if she would amuse them by telling a story since nobody present except lord mountclere had ever heard one from her lips  seeing that ethelberta had been working at that art as a profession it can hardly be said that the question was conceived with tact though it was put with grace  lord mountclere evidently thought it objectionable for he looked unhappy  to only one person in the brilliant room did the request appear as a timely accident and that was to ethelberta herself her honesty was always making war upon her manoeuvres and shattering their delicate meshes to her great inconvenience and delay  thus there arose those devious impulses and tangential flights which spoil the works of every wouldbe schemer who instead of being wholly machine is half heart  one of these now was to show herself as she really was not only to lord mountclere but to his friends assembled whom in her ignorance she respected more than they deserved and so get rid of that selfreproach which had by this time reached a morbid pitch through her oversensitiveness to a situation in which a large majority of women and men would have seen no falseness  full of this curious intention she quietly assented to the request and laughingly bade them put themselves in listening order  an old story will suit us said the lady who had importuned her  we have never heard one  no it shall be quite new she replied  one not yet made public though it soon will be  the narrative began by introducing to their notice a girl of the poorest and meanest parentage the daughter of a servingman and the fifth of ten children  she graphically recounted as if they were her own the strange dreams and ambitious longings of this child when young her attempts to acquire education partial failures partial successes and constant struggles instancing how on one of these occasions the girl concealed herself under a bookcase of the library belonging to the mansion in which her father served as footman and having taken with her there like a young fawkes matches and a halfpenny candle was going to sit up all night reading when the family had retired until her father discovered and prevented her scheme  then followed her experiences as nurserygoverness her evening lessons under selfselected masters and her ultimate rise to a higher grade among the teaching sisterhood  next came another epoch  to the mansion in which she was engaged returned a truant son between whom and the heroine an attachment sprang up  the master of the house was an ambitious gentleman just knighted who perceiving the state of their hearts harshly dismissed the homeless governess and rated the son the consequence being that the youthful pair resolved to marry secretly and carried their resolution into effect  the runaway journey came next and then a moving description of the death of the young husband and the terror of the bride  the guests began to look perplexed and one or two exchanged whispers this was not at all the kind of story that they had expected it was quite different from her usual utterances the nature of which they knew by report  ethelberta kept her eye upon lord mountclere  soon to her amazement there was that in his face which told her that he knew the story and its heroine quite well  when she delivered the sentence ending with the professedly fictitious words i thus was reduced to great distress and vainly cast about me for directions what to do lord mountcleres manner became so excited and anxious that it acted reciprocally upon ethelberta her voice trembled she moved her lips but uttered nothing  to bring the story up to the date of that very evening had been her intent but it was beyond her power  the spell was broken she blushed with distress and turned away for the folly of a disclosure here was but too apparent  though every one saw that she had broken down none of them appeared to know the reason why or to have the clue to her performance  fortunately lord mountclere came to her aid  let the first part end here he said rising and approaching her  we have been well entertained so far  i could scarcely believe that the story i was listening to was utterly an invention so vividly does mrs petherwin bring the scenes before our eyes  she must now be exhausted we will have the remainder tomorrow  they all agreed that this was well and soon after fell into groups and dispersed about the rooms  when everybodys attention was thus occupied lord mountclere whispered to ethelberta tremulously dont tell more you think too much of them they are no better than you  will you meet me in the little winter garden two minutes hence  pass through that door and along the glass passage  he himself left the room by an opposite door  she had not set three steps in the warm snug octagon of glass and plants when he appeared on the other side  you knew it all before she said looking keenly at him  who told you and how long have you known it  before yesterday or last week said lord mountclere  even before we met in france  why are you so surprised  ethelberta had been surprised and very greatly to find him as it were secreted in the very rear of her position  that nothing she could tell was new to him was a good deal to think of but it was little beside the recollection that he had actually made his first declaration in the face of that knowledge of her which she had supposed so fatal to all her matrimonial ambitions  and now only one point remains to be settled he said taking her hand you promised at rouen that at our next interview you would honour me with a decisive replyone to make me happy for ever  but my father and friends said she  are nothing to be concerned about  modern developments have shaken up the classes like peas in a hopper  an annuity and a comfortable cottage  my brothers are workmen  manufacture is the single vocation in which a mans prospects may be said to be illimitable  heeheethey may buy me up before they die and now what stands in the way  it would take fifty alliances with fifty families so little disreputable as yours darling to drag mine down  ethelberta had anticipated the scene and settled her course what had to be said and done here was mere formality yet she had been unable to go straight to the assent required  however after these words of selfdepreciation which were let fall as much for her own future ease of conscience as for his present warning she made no more ado  i shall think it a great honour to be your wife she said simply     39 knollseamelchester   the year was now moving on apace but ethelberta and picotee chose to remain at knollsea in the brilliant variegated brick and stone villa to which they had removed in order to be in keeping with their ascending fortunes  autumn had begun to make itself felt and seen in bolder and less subtle ways than at first  in the morning now on coming downstairs in place of a yellowishgreen leaf or two lying in a corner of the lowest step which had been the only previous symptoms around the house she saw dozens of them playing at corkscrews in the wind directly the door was opened  beyond towards the sea the slopes and scarps that had been muffled with a thick robe of cliff herbage were showing their chill grey substance through the withered verdure like the background of velvet whence the pile has been fretted away  unexpected breezes broomed and rasped the smooth bay in evanescent patches of stippled shade and besides the small boats the ponderous lighters used in shipping stone were hauled up the beach in anticipation of the equinoctial attack  a few days after ethelbertas reception at enckworth an improved stanhope driven by lord mountclere himself climbed up the hill until it was opposite her door  a few notes from a piano softly played reached his ear as he descended from his place on being shown in to his betrothed he could perceive that she had just left the instrument moreover a tear was visible in her eye when she came near him  they discoursed for several minutes in the manner natural between a defenceless young widow and an old widower in lord mountcleres position to whom she was plighteda great deal of formal considerateness making itself visible on her part and of extreme tenderness on his  while thus occupied he turned to the piano and casually glanced at a piece of music lying open upon it  some words of writing at the top expressed that it was the composers original copy presented by him christopher julian to the author of the song  seeing that he noticed the sheet somewhat lengthily ethelberta remarked that it had been an offering made to her a long time agoa melody written to one of her own poems  in the writing of the composer observed lord mountclere with interest  an offering from the musician himselfvery gratifying and touching  mr christopher julian is the name i see upon it i believe  i knew his father dr julian a sandbourne man if i recollect  yes said ethelberta placidly  but it was really with an effort  the song was the identical one which christopher sent up to her from sandbourne when the fire of her hope burnt high for less material ends and the discovery of the sheet among her music that day had started eddies of emotion for some time checked  i am sorry you have been grieved said lord mountclere with gloomy restlessness  grieved said ethelberta  did i not see a tear there or did my eyes deceive me  you might have seen one  ah a tear and a song  i think  you naturally think that a woman who cries over a mans gift must be in love with the giver  ethelberta looked him serenely in the face  lord mountcleres jealous suspicions were considerably shaken  not at all he said hastily as if ashamed  one who cries over a song is much affected by its sentiment  do you expect authors to cry over their own words she inquired merging defence in attack  i am afraid they dont often do that  you would make me uneasy  on the contrary i would reassure you  are you not still doubting she asked with a pleasant smile  i cannot doubt you  swear like a faithful knight  i swear my fairy my flower  after this the old man appeared to be pondering indeed his thoughts could hardly be said to be present when he uttered the words  for though the tabernacle was getting shaky by reason of years and merry living so that what was going on inside might often be guessed without by the movement of the hangings as in a puppetshow with worn canvas he could be quiet enough when scheming any plot of particular neatness which had less emotion than impishness in it  such an innocent amusement he was pondering now  before leaving her he asked if she would accompany him to a morning instrumental concert at melchester which was to take place in the course of that week for the benefit of some local institution  melchester she repeated faintly and observed him as searchingly as it was possible to do without exposing herself to a raking fire in return could he know that christopher was living there and was this said in prolongation of his recent suspicion  but lord mountcleres face gave no sign  you forget one fatal objection said she the secrecy in which it is imperative that the engagement between us should be kept  i am not known in melchester without my carriage nor are you  we may be known by somebody on the road  then let it be arranged in this way  i will not call here to take you up but will meet you at the station at anglebury and we can go on together by train without notice  surely there can be no objection to that  it would be mere prudishness to object since we are to become one so shortly  he spoke a little impatiently  it was plain that he particularly wanted her to go to melchester  i merely meant that there was a chance of discovery in our going out together  and discovery means no marriage  she was pale now and sick at heart for it seemed that the viscount must be aware that christopher dwelt at that place and was about to test her concerning him  why does it mean no marriage said he  my father might and almost certainly would object to it  although he cannot control me he might entreat me  why would he object said lord mountclere uneasily and somewhat haughtily  i dont know  but you will be my wifesay again that you will  i will  he breathed  he will not objectheehee he said  o noi think you will be mine now  i have said so  but look to me all the same  you malign yourself dear one  but you will meet me at anglebury as i wish and go on to melchester with me  i shall be pleased toif my sister may accompany me  ahyour sister  yes of course  they settled the time of the journey and when the visit had been stretched out as long as it reasonably could be with propriety lord mountclere took his leave  when he was again seated on the drivingphaeton which he had brought that day lord mountclere looked gleeful and shrewd enough in his own opinion to outwit mephistopheles  as soon as they were ascending a hill and he could find time to free his hand he pulled off his glove and drawing from his pocket a programme of the melchester concert referred to contemplated therein the name of one of the intended performers  the name was that of mr c julian  replacing it again he looked ahead and some time after murmured with wily mirth an excellent testa lucky thought  nothing of importance occurred during the intervening days  at two oclock on the appointed afternoon ethelberta stepped from the train at melchester with the viscount who had met her as proposed she was followed behind by picotee  the concert was to be held at the townhall halfanhour later  they entered a fly in waiting and secure from recognition were driven leisurely in that direction picotee silent and absorbed with her own thoughts  theres the cathedral said lord mountclere humorously as they caught a view of one of its towers through a street leading into the close  yes  it boasts of a very fine organ  ah  and the organist is a clever young man  oh  lord mountclere paused a moment or two  by the way you may remember that he is the mr julian who set your song to music  i recollect it quite well  her heart was horrified and she thought lord mountclere must be developing into an inquisitor which perhaps he was  but none of this reached her face  they turned in the direction of the hall were set down and entered  the large assemblyroom set apart for the concert was upstairs and it was possible to enter it in two ways by the large doorway in front of the landing or by turning down a side passage leading to councilrooms and subsidiary apartments of small size which were allotted to performers in any exhibition thus they could enter from one of these directly upon the platform without passing through the audience  will you seat yourselves here said lord mountclere who instead of entering by the direct door had brought the young women round into this greenroom as it may be called  you see we have come in privately enough when the musicians arrive we can pass through behind them and step down to our seats from the front  the players could soon be heard tuning in the next room  then one came through the passageroom where the three waited and went in then another then another  last of all came julian  ethelberta sat facing the door but christopher never in the least expecting her there did not recognize her till he was quite inside  when he had really perceived her to be the one who had troubled his soul so many times and long the blood in his facenever very muchpassed off and left it like the shade of a cloud  between them stood a table covered with green baize which reflecting upwards a band of sunlight shining across the chamber flung upon his already white features the virescent hues of death  the poor musician whose person much to his own inconvenience constituted a complete breviary of the gentle emotions looked as if he were going to fall down in a faint  ethelberta flung at lord mountclere a look which clipped him like pincers he never forgot it as long as he lived  this is your pretty jealous schemei see it she hissed to him and without being able to control herself went across to julian  but a slight gasp came from behind the door where picotee had been sitting  ethelberta and lord mountclere looked that way and behold picotee had nearly swooned  ethelbertas show of passion went as quickly as it had come for she felt that a splendid triumph had been put into her hands  now do you see the truth she whispered to lord mountclere without a drachm of feeling pointing to christopher and then to picoteeas like as two snowdrops now  i do i do murmured the viscount hastily  they both went forward to help christopher in restoring the fragile picotee he had set himself to that task as suddenly as he possibly could to cover his own near approach to the same condition  not much help was required the little girls indisposition being quite momentary and she sat up in the chair again  are you better said ethelberta to christopher  quite wellquite he said smiling faintly  i am glad to see you  i must i think go into the next room now  he bowed and walked out awkwardly  are you better too she said to picotee  quite well said picotee  you are quite sure you know between whom the love lies noweh ethelberta asked in a sarcastic whisper of lord mountclere  i ambeyond a doubt murmured the anxious nobleman he feared that look of hers which was not less dominant than irresistible  some additional moments given to thought on the circumstances rendered ethelberta still more indignant and intractable  she went out at the door by which they had entered along the passage and down the stairs  a shuffling footstep followed but she did not turn her head  when they reached the bottom of the stairs the carriage had gone their exit not being expected till two hours later  ethelberta nothing daunted swept along the pavement and down the street in a turbulent prance lord mountclere trotting behind with a jowl reduced to a mere nothing by his concern at the discourtesy into which he had been lured by jealous whisperings  my dearestforgive me i confess i doubted youbut i was beside myself came to her ears from over her shoulder  but ethelberta walked on as before  lord mountclere sighed like a poet over a ledger  an old manwho is not very oldnaturally torments himself with fears of losingno noit was an innocent jest of mineyou will forgive a jokeheehee he said again on getting no reply  you had no right to mistrust me  i do notyou did not blench  you should have told me before that it was your sister and not yourself who was entangled with him  you brought me to melchester on purpose to confront him  yes i did  are you not ashamed  i am satisfied  it is better to know the truth by any means than to die of suspense better for us bothsurely you see that  they had by this time got to the end of a long street and into a deserted side road by which the station could be indirectly reached picotee appeared in the distance as a mere distracted speck of girlhood following them because not knowing what else to do in her sickness of body and mind  once out of sight here ethelberta began to cry  ethelberta said lord mountclere in an agony of trouble dont be vexed  it was an inconsiderate tricki own it  do what you will but do not desert me now  i could not bear ityou would kill me if you were to leave me  anything but be mine  ethelberta continued her way and drying her eyes entered the station where on searching the timetables she found there would be no train for anglebury for the next two hours  then more slowly she turned towards the town again meeting picotee and keeping in her company  lord mountclere gave up the chase but as he wished to get into the town again he followed in the same direction  when ethelberta had proceeded as far as the red lion hotel she turned towards it with her companion and being shown to a room the two sisters shut themselves in  lord mountclere paused and entered the white hart the rival hotel to the red lion which stood in an adjoining street  having secluded himself in an apartment here walked from window to window awhile and made himself generally uncomfortable he sat down to the writing materials on the table and concocted a note     white hart hotel     my dear mrs petherwinyou do not mean to be so cruel as to break    your plighted word to me  remember there is no love without much    jealousy and lovers are ever full of sighs and misgiving  i have    owned to as much contrition as can reasonably be expected  i could    not endure the suspicion that you loved anotheryours always     mountclere  this he sent watching from the window its progress along the street  he awaited anxiously for an answer and waited long  it was nearly twenty minutes before he could hear a messenger approaching the door  yesshe had actually sent a reply he prized it as if it had been the first encouragement he had ever in his life received from woman     my lord wrote ethelbertai am not prepared at present to enter    into the question of marriage at all the incident which has occurred    affords me every excuse for withdrawing my promise since it was given    under misapprehensions on a point that materially affects my    happiness     e petherwin  hohohomiss hoitytoity said lord mountclere trotting up and down but remembering it was her june against his november this did not last long and he frantically replied     my darlingi cannot release youi must do anything to keep my    treasure  will you not see me for a few minutes and let bygones go    to the winds  was ever a thrush so safe in a cherry net before  the messenger came back with the information that mrs petherwin had taken a walk to the close her companion alone remaining at the hotel there being nothing else left for the viscount to do he put on his hat and went out on foot in the same direction  he had not walked far when he saw ethelberta moving slowly along the high street before him  ethelberta was at this hour wandering without any fixed intention beyond that of consuming time  she was very wretched and very indifferent the former when thinking of her past the latter when thinking of the days to come  while she walked thus unconscious of the streets and their groups of other wayfarers she saw christopher emerge from a door not many paces in advance and close it behind him he stood for a moment on the step before descending into the road  she could not even had she wished it easily check her progress without rendering the chance of his perceiving her still more certain  but she did not wish any such thing and it made little difference for he had already seen her in taking his survey round and came down from the door to her side  it was impossible for anything formal to pass between them now  you are not at the concert mr julian she said  i am glad to have a better opportunity of speaking to you and of asking for your sister unfortunately there is not time for us to call upon her today  thank you but it makes no difference said julian with somewhat sad reserve  i will tell her i have met you she is away from home just at present  and finding that ethelberta did not rejoin immediately he observed the chief organist old dr breeve has taken my place at the concert as it was arranged he should do after the opening part  i am now going to the cathedral for the afternoon service  you are going there too  i thought of looking at the interior for a moment  so they went on side by side saying little for it was a situation in which scarcely any appropriate thing could be spoken  ethelberta was the less reluctant to walk in his company because of the provocation to skittishness that lord mountclere had given a provocation which she still resented  but she was far from wishing to increase his jealousy and yet this was what she was doing lord mountclere being a perturbed witness from behind of all that was passing now  they turned the corner of the short street of connection which led under an archway to the cathedral close the old peer dogging them still christopher seemed to warm up a little and repeated the invitation  you will come with your sister to see us before you leave he said  we have tea at six  we shall have left melchester before that time  i am now only waiting for the train  you two have not come all the way from knollsea alone  part of the way said ethelberta evasively  and going back alone  no  only for the last five miles  at least that was the arrangementi am not quite sure if it holds good  you dont wish me to see you safely in the train  it is not necessary thank you very much  we are well used to getting about the world alone and from melchester to knollsea is no serious journey late or early     yet i think i ought in honesty to tell you that we are not entirely by ourselves in melchester today  i remember i saw your friendrelativein the room at the townhall  it did not occur to my mind for the moment that he was any other than a stranger standing there  he is not a relative she said with perplexity  i hardly know christopher how to explain to you my position here today because of some difficulties that have arisen since we have been in the town which may alter it entirely  on that account i will be less frank with you than i should like to be considering how long we have known each other it would be wrong however if i were not to tell you that there has been a possibility of my marriage with him  the elderly gentleman  yes  and i came here in his company intending to return with him  but you shall know all soon  picotee shall write to faith  i always think the cathedral looks better from this point than from the point usually chosen by artists he said with nervous quickness directing her glance upwards to the silent structure now misty and unrelieved by either high light or deep shade  we get the grouping of the chapels and choiraisles more clearly shownand the whole culminates to a more perfect pyramid from this spotdo you think so  yes  i do  a little further and christopher stopped to enter when ethelberta bade him farewell  i thought at one time that our futures might have been different from what they are apparently becoming he said then regarding her as a stallreader regards the brilliant book he cannot afford to buy  but one gets weary of repining about that  i wish picotee and yourself could see us oftener i am as confirmed a bachelor now as faith is an old maid  i wonder ifshould the event you contemplate occuryou and he will ever visit us or we shall ever visit you  christopher was evidently imagining the elderly gentleman to be some retired farmer or professional man already so intermixed with the metamorphic classes of society as not to be surprised or inconvenienced by her beginnings one who wished to secure ethelberta as an ornament to his parlour fire in a quiet spirit and in no intoxicated mood regardless of issues  she could scarcely reply to his supposition and the parting was what might have been predicted from a conversation so carefully controlled  ethelberta as she had intended now went on further and entering the nave began to inspect the sallow monuments which lined the grizzled pile she did not perceive amid the shadows an old gentleman who had crept into the mouldy place as stealthily as a worm into a skull and was keeping himself carefully beyond her observation  she continued to regard feature after feature till the choristers had filed in from the south side and peals broke forth from the organ on the black oaken mass at the junction of nave and choir shaking every cobweb in the dusky vaults and ethelbertas heart no less  she knew the fingers that were pressing out those rolling sounds and knowing them became absorbed in tracing their progress  to go towards the organloft was an act of unconsciousness and she did not pause till she stood almost beneath it  ethelberta was awakened from vague imaginings by the close approach of the old gentleman alluded to who spoke with a great deal of agitation  i have been trying to meet with you said lord mountclere  come let us be friends againethelberta i must not lose you  you cannot mean that the engagement shall be broken off  he was far too desirous to possess her at any price now to run a second risk of exasperating her and forbore to make any allusion to the recent pantomime between herself and christopher that he had beheld though it might reasonably have filled him with dread and petulance  i do not mean anything beyond this said she that i entirely withdraw from it on the faintest sign that you have not abandoned such miserable jealous proceedings as those you adopted today  i have quite abandoned them  will you come a little further this way and walk in the aisle  you do still agree to be mine  if it gives you any pleasure i do  yes yes  i implore that the marriage may be soonvery soon  the viscount spoke hastily for the notes of the organ which were plunging into their ears ever and anon from the hands of his young rival seemed inconveniently and solemnly in the way of his suit  well lord mountclere  say in a few daysit is the only thing that will satisfy me  i am absolutely indifferent as to the day  if it pleases you to have it early i am willing  dare i ask that it may be this week said the delighted old man  i could not say that  but you can name the earliest day  i cannot now  we had better be going from here i think  the cathedral was filling with shadows and cold breathings came round the piers for it was november when night very soon succeeds noon in spots where noon is sobered to the pallor of eve  but the service was not yet over and before quite leaving the building ethelberta cast one other glance towards the organ and thought of him behind it  at this moment her attention was arrested by the form of her sister picotee who came in at the north door closed the lobbywicket softly and went lightly forward to the choir  when within a few yards of it she paused by a pillar and lingered there looking up at the organ as ethelberta had done  no sound was coming from the ponderous mass of tubes just then but in a short space a whole crowd of tones spread from the instrument to accompany the words of a response  picotee started at the burst of music as if taken in a dishonest action and moved on in a manner intended to efface the lovers loiter of the preceding moments from her own consciousness no less than from other peoples eyes  do you see that said ethelberta  that little figure is my dearest sister  could you but ensure a marriage between her and him she listens to i would do anything you wish  that is indeed a gracious promise said lord mountclere  and would you agree to what i asked just now  yes  when  a gleeful spark accompanied this  as you requested  this week  the day after tomorrow  if you will  but remember what lies on your side of the contract  i fancy i have given you a task beyond your powers  well darling we are at one at last said lord mountclere rubbing his hand against his side  and if my task is heavy and i cannot guarantee the result i can make it very probable  marry me on fridaythe day after tomorrowand i will do all that money and influence can effect to bring about their union  you solemnly promise  you will never cease to give me all the aid in your power until the thing is done  i do solemnly promiseon the conditions named  very good  you will have ensured my fulfilment of my promise before i can ensure yours but i take your word  you will marry me on friday  give me your hand upon it  she gave him her hand  is it a covenant he asked  it is said she  lord mountclere warmed from surface to centre as if he had drunk of hippocras and after holding her hand for some moments raised it gently to his lips  two days and you are mine he said  that i believe i never shall be  never shall be  why darling  i dont know  some catastrophe will prevent it  i shall be dead perhaps  you distress me  ahyou meant meyou meant that i should be dead because you think i am old  but that is a mistakei am not very old  i thought only of myselfnothing of you  yes i know  dearest it is dismal and chilling herelet us go  ethelberta mechanically moved with him and felt there was no retreating now  in the meantime the young ladykin whom the solemn vowing concerned had lingered round the choir screen as if fearing to enter yet loth to go away  the service terminated the heavy books were closed doors were opened and the feet of the few persons who had attended evensong began pattering down the paved alleys  not wishing picotee to know that the object of her secret excursion had been discovered ethelberta now stepped out of the west doorway with the viscount before picotee had emerged from the other and they walked along the path together until she overtook them  i fear it becomes necessary for me to stay in melchester tonight said lord mountclere  i have a few matters to attend to here as the result of our arrangements  but i will first accompany you as far as anglebury and see you safely into a carriage there that shall take you home  to morrow i will drive to knollsea when we will make the final preparations  ethelberta would not have him go so far and back again merely to attend upon her hence they parted at the railway with due and correct tenderness and when the train had gone lord mountclere returned into the town on the special business he had mentioned for which there remained only the present evening and the following morning if he were to call upon her in the afternoon of the next daythe day before the weddingnow so recklessly hastened on his part and so coolly assented to on hers  by the time that the two young people had started it was nearly dark some portions of the railway stretched through little copses and plantations where the leafshedding season being now at its height red and golden patches of fallen foliage lay on either side of the rails and as the travellers passed all these deathstricken bodies boiled up in the whirlwind created by the velocity and were sent flying right and left of them in myriads a cleanfanned track being left behind  picotee was called from the observation of these phenomena by a remark from her sister picotee the marriage is to be very early indeed  it is to be the day after tomorrowif it can  nevertheless i dont believe in the facti cannot  did you arrange it so  nobody can make you marry so soon  i agreed to the day murmured ethelberta languidly  how can it be  the gay dresses and the preparations and the peoplehow can they be collected in the time berta  and so much more of that will be required for a lord of the land than for a common man  o i cant think it possible for a sister of mine to marry a lord  and yet it has been possible any time this last month or two strange as it seems to you     it is to be not only a plain and simple wedding without any lofty appliances but a secret oneas secret as if i were some underage heiress to an indian fortune and he a young man of nothing a year  has lord mountclere said it must be so private  i suppose it is on account of his family  no  i say so and it is on account of my family  father might object to the wedding i imagine from what he once said or he might be much disturbed about it so i think it better that he and the rest should know nothing till all is over  you must dress again as my sister tomorrow dear  lord mountclere is going to pay us an early visit to conclude necessary arrangements  o the life as a lady at enckworth court  the flowers the woods the rooms the pictures the plate and the jewels  horses and carriages rattling and prancing seneschals and pages footmen hopping up and hopping down  it will be glory then  we might hire our father as one of my retainers to increase it said ethelberta drily  picotees countenance fell  how shall we manage all about that  tis terrible really  the marriage granted those things will right themselves by time and weight of circumstances  you take a wrong view in thinking of glories of that sort  my only hope is that my life will be quite private and simple as will best become my inferiority and lord mountcleres staidness  such a splendid library as there is at enckworth picoteequartos folios history verse elzevirs caxtonsall that has been done in literature from moses down to scottwith such companions i can do without all other sorts of happiness  and you will not go to town from easter to lammastide as other noble ladies do asked the younger girl rather disappointed at this aspect of a viscountesss life  i dont know  but you will give dinners and travel and go to see his friends and have them to see you  i dont know  will you not be then as any other peeress and shall not i be as any other peeresss sister  that too i do not know  all is mystery  nor do i even know that the marriage will take place  i feel that it may not and perhaps so much the better since the man is a stranger to me  i know nothing whatever of his nature and he knows nothing of mine     40 melchester continued   the commotion wrought in julians mind by the abrupt incursion of ethelberta into his quiet sphere was thorough and protracted  the witchery of her presence he had grown strong enough to withstand in part but her composed announcement that she had intended to marry another and as far as he could understand was intending it still added a new chill to the old shade of disappointment which custom was day by day enabling him to endure  during the whole interval in which he had produced those diapason blasts heard with such inharmonious feelings by the three auditors outside the screen his thoughts had wandered wider than his notes in conjectures on the character and position of the gentleman seen in ethelbertas company  owing to his assumption that lord mountclere was but a stranger who had accidentally come in at the side door christopher had barely cast a glance upon him and the wide difference between the years of the viscount and those of his betrothed was not so particularly observed as to raise that point to an item in his objections now  lord mountclere was dressed with all the cunning that could be drawn from the metropolis by money and reiterated dissatisfaction he prided himself on his upright carriage his stick was so thin that the most malevolent could not insinuate that it was of any possible use in walking his teeth had put on all the vigour and freshness of a second spring  hence his look was the slowest of possible clocks in respect of his age and his manner was equally as much in the rear of his appearance  christopher was now over fiveandtwenty  he was getting so well accustomed to the spectacle of a world passing him by and splashing him with its wheels that he wondered why he had ever minded it  his habit of dreaming instead of doing had led him up to a curious discovery  it is no new thing for a man to fathom profundities by indulging humours the active the rapid the people of splendid momentum have been surprised to behold what results attend the lives of those whose usual plan for discharging their active labours has been to postpone them indefinitely certainly the immediate result in the present case was to all but himself small and invisible but it was of the nature of highest things what he had learnt was that a woman who has once made a permanent impression upon a man cannot altogether deny him her image by denying him her company and that by sedulously cultivating the acquaintance of this creature of contemplation she becomes to him almost a living soul  hence a sublimated ethelberta accompanied him everywhereone who never teased him eluded him or disappointed him when he smiled she smiled when he was sad she sorrowed  he may be said to have become the literal duplicate of that whimsical unknown rhapsodist who wrote of his own similar situation     by absence this good means i gain       that i can catch her       where none can watch her    in some close corner of my brain       there i embrace and kiss her       and so i both enjoy and miss her  this frame of mind naturally induced an amazing abstraction in the organist never very vigilant at the best of times  he would stand and look fixedly at a frog in a shady pool and never once think of batrachians or pause by a green bank to split some tall blade of grass into filaments without removing it from its stalk passing on ignorant that he had made a catoninetails of a graceful slip of vegetation  he would hear the cathedral clock strike one and go the next minute to see what time it was  i never seed such a man as mr julian is said the head blower  hell meet me anywhere outofdoors and never wink or nod  youd hardly expect it  i dont find fault but youd hardly expect it seeing how i play the same instrument as he do himself and have done it for so many years longer than he  how i have indulged that man too  if tis pedals for two martel hours of practice i never complain and he has plenty of vagaries  when tis hot summer weather theres nothing will do for him but choir great and swell altogether till yer face is in a vapour and on a frosty winter night hell keep me there while he tweedles upon the twelfth and sixteenth till my arms be scrammed for want of motion  and never speak a word outofdoors somebody suggested that perhaps christopher did not notice his coadjutors presence in the street and time proved to the organblower that the remark was just  whenever christopher caught himself at these vacuous tricks he would be struck with admiration of ethelbertas wisdom foresight and selfcommand in refusing to wed such an incapable man he felt that he ought to be thankful that a bright memory of her was not also denied to him and resolved to be content with it as a possession since it was as much of her as he could decently maintain  wrapped thus in a humorous sadness he passed the afternoon under notice and in the evening went home to faith who still lived with him and showed no sign of ever being likely to do otherwise  their present place and mode of life suited her well  she revived at melchester like an exotic sent home again  the leafy close the climbing buttresses the pondering ecclesiastics the great doors the singular keys the whispered talk echoes of lonely footsteps the sunset shadow of the tall steeple reaching further into the town than the good bishops teaching and the general complexion of a spot where morning had the stillness of evening and spring some of the tones of autumn formed a proper background to a person constituted as faith who like miss hepzibah pyncheons chicken possessed in miniature all the antiquity of her progenitors  after tea christopher went into the streets as was frequently his custom less to see how the world crept on there than to walk up and down for nothing at all  it had been marketday and remnants of the rural population that had visited the town still lingered at corners their toes hanging over the edge of the pavement and their eyes wandering about the street  the angle which formed the turningpoint of christophers promenade was occupied by a jewellers shop of a standing which completely outshone every other shop in that or any trade throughout the town  indeed it was a staple subject of discussion in melchester how a shop of such pretensions could find patronage sufficient to support its existence in a place which though well populated was not fashionable  it had not long been established there and was the enterprise of an incoming man whose whole course of procedure seemed to be dictated by an intention to astonish the native citizens very considerably before he had done  nearly everything was glass in the frontage of this fairy mart and its contents glittered like the hammochrysos stone  the panes being of plateglass and the shop having two fronts a diagonal view could be had through it from one to the other of the streets to which it formed a corner  this evening as on all evenings a flood of radiance spread from the windowlamps into the thick autumn air so that from a distance that corner appeared as the glistening nucleus of all the light in the town towards it idle men and women unconsciously bent their steps and closed in upon the panes like nightbirds upon the lantern of a lighthouse  when christopher reached the spot there stood close to the pavement a plain close carriage apparently waiting for some person who was purchasing inside  christopher would hardly have noticed this had he not also perceived pressed against the glass of the shop window an unusual number of local noses belonging to overgrown working lads tosspots an idiot the hamsmokers assistant with his sleeves rolled up a scotand lot freeholder three or four seamstresses the young woman who brought home the washing and so on  the interest of these gazers in some proceedings within which by reason of the gaslight were as public as if carried on in the open air was very great  yes thats what hes a buying ohaw haw said one of the young men as the shopman removed from the window a gorgeous blue velvet tray of weddingrings and laid it on the counter  tis what you may come to yerself sooner or later god have mercy upon ye and as such no scoffing matter said an older man  faith id as lief cry as laugh to see a man in that corner  hes a gent getting up in years too  he must hev been through it a few times afore seemingly to sit down and buy the tools so cool as that  well no  see what the shyest will do at such times  you baint yerself then no man living is hisself then  true said the hamsmokers man  tis a thought to look at that a chap will take all this trouble to get a woman into his house and a twelvemonth after would as soon hear it thunder as hear her sing  the policeman standing near was a humane man through having a young family he could hardly keep and he hesitated about telling them to move on  christopher had before this time perceived that the articles were laid down before an old gentleman who was seated in the shop and that the gentleman was none other than he who had been with ethelberta in the concertroom  the discovery was so startling that constitutionally indisposed as he was to stand and watch he became as glued to the spot as the other idlers  finding himself now for the first time directly confronting the preliminaries of ethelbertas marriage to a stranger he was left with far less equanimity than he could have supposed possible to the situation  so near the time he said and looked hard at lord mountclere  christopher had now a far better opportunity than before for observing ethelbertas betrothed  apart from any bias of jealousy disappointment or mortification he was led to judge that this was not quite the man to make ethelberta happy  he had fancied her companion to be a man under fifty he was now visibly sixty or more  and it was not the sort of sexagenarianism beside which a young womans happiness can sometimes contrive to keep itself alive in a quiet sleepy way  suddenly it occurred to him that this was the man whom he had helped in the carriage accident on the way to knollsea  he looked again  by no means undignified the face presented that combination of slyness and jocundity which we are accustomed to imagine of the canonical jolly dogs in mediaeval tales  the gamesome curate of meudon might have supplied some parts of the countenance cunning friar tuck the remainder nothing but the viscounts constant habit of going to church every sunday morning when at his country residence kept unholiness out of his features for though he lived theologically enough on the sabbath as it became a man in his position to do he was strikingly mundane all the rest of the week always preferring the devil to god in his oaths  and nothing but antecedent goodhumour prevented the short fits of crossness incident to his passing infirmities from becoming established  his look was exceptionally jovial now and the corners of his mouth twitched as the telegraphneedles of a hundred little erotic messages from his heart to his brain  anybody could see that he was a merry man still who loved good company warming drinks nymphlike shapes and pretty words in spite of the disagreeable suggestions he received from the pupils of his eyes and the joints of his lively limbs that imps of mischief were busy sapping and mining in those regions with the view of tumbling him into a certain cool cellar under the church aisle  in general if a lover can find any ground at all for serenity in the tide of an elderly rivals success he finds it in the fact itself of that ancientness  the other side seems less a rival than a makeshift but christopher no longer felt this and the significant signs before his eyes of the imminence of ethelbertas union with this old hero filled him with restless dread  true the gentleman as he appeared illuminated by the jewellers gasjets seemed more likely to injure ethelberta by indulgence than by severity while her beauty lasted but there was a nameless something in him less tolerable than this  the purchaser having completed his dealings with the goldsmith was conducted to the door by the master of the shop and into the carriage which was at once driven off up the street  christopher now much desired to know the name of the man whom a nice chain of circumstantial evidence taught him to regard as the happy winner where scores had lost  he was grieved that ethelbertas confessed reserve should have extended so far as to limit her to mere indefinite hints of marriage when they were talking almost on the brink of the weddingday  that the ceremony was to be a private onewhich it probably would be because of the disparity of agesdid not in his opinion justify her secrecy  he had shown himself capable of a transmutation as valuable as it is rare in men the change from pestering lover to staunch friend and this was all he had got for it  but even an old lover sunk to an indifferentist might have been tempted to spend an unoccupied halfhour in discovering particulars now and christopher had not lapsed nearly so far as to absolute unconcern  that evening however nothing came in his way to enlighten him  but the next day when skirting the close on his ordinary duties he saw the same carriage standing at a distance and paused to behold the same old gentleman come from a wellknown office and reenter the vehiclelord mountclere in fact in earnest pursuit of the business of yesternight having just pocketed a document in which romance rashness law and gospel are so happily made to work together that it may safely be regarded as the neatest compromise which has ever been invented since adam sinned  this time julian perceived that the brougham was one belonging to the white hart hotel which lord mountclere was using partly from the necessities of these hasty proceedings and also because by so doing he escaped the notice that might have been bestowed upon his own equipage or menservants the mountclere hammercloths being known in melchester christopher now walked towards the hotel leisurely yet with anxiety  he inquired of a porter what people were staying there that day and was informed that they had only one person in the house lord mountclere whom sudden and unexpected business had detained in melchester since the previous day  christopher lingered to hear no more  he retraced the street much more quickly than he had come and he only said lord mountclereit must never be  as soon as he entered the house faith perceived that he was greatly agitated  he at once told her of his discovery and she exclaimed what a brilliant match  o faith said christopher you dont know  you are far from knowing it is as gloomy as midnight  good god can it be possible  faith blinked in alarm without speaking  did you never hear anything of lord mountclere when we lived at sandbourne  i knew the nameno more  no noof course you did not  well though i never saw his face to my knowledge till a short time ago i know enough to say that if earnest representations can prevent it this marriage shall not be  father knew him or about him very well and he once told mewhat i cannot tell you  fancy i have seen him three timesyesterday last night and this morningbesides helping him on the road some weeks ago and never once considered that he might be lord mountclere  he is here almost in disguise one may say neither man nor horse is with him and his object accounts for his privacy  i see how it isshe is doing this to benefit her brothers and sisters if possible but she ought to know that if she is miserable they will never be happy  thats the nature of womenthey take the form for the essence and thats what she is doing now  i should think her guardian angel must have quitted her when she agreed to a marriage which may tear her heart out like a claw  you are too warm about it kitit cannot be so bad as that  it is not the thing but the sensitiveness to the thing which is the true measure of its pain  perhaps what seems so bad to you falls lightly on her mind a campaigner in a heavy rain is not more uncomfortable than we are in a slight draught and ethelberta fortified by her sapphires and gold cups and wax candles will not mind facts which look like spectres to us outside  a title will turn troubles into romances and she will shine as an interesting viscountess in spite of them  the discussion with faith was not continued christopher stopping the argument by saying that he had a good mind to go off at once to knollsea and show her her danger  but till the next morning ethelberta was certainly safe no marriage was possible anywhere before then  he passed the afternoon in a state of great indecision constantly reiterating i will go     41 workshopsan innthe street   on an extensive plot of ground lying somewhere between the thames and the kensington squares stood the premises of messrs nockett and perch builders and contractors  the yard with its workshops formed part of one of those frontier lines between mangy business and garnished domesticity that occur in what are called improving neighbourhoods  we are accustomed to regard increase as the chief feature in a great citys progress its wellknown signs greeting our eyes on every outskirt  slush ponds may be seen turning into basementkitchens a broad causeway of shattered earthenware smothers plots of budding gooseberrybushes and vegetable trenches foundations following so closely upon gardens that the householder may be expected to find cadaverous sprouts from overlooked potatoes rising through the chinks of his cellar floor  but the other great process that of internal transmutation is not less curious than this encroachment of grey upon green  its first erections are often only the milkteeth of a suburb and as the district rises in dignity they are dislodged by those which are to endure  slightness becomes supplanted by comparative solidity commonness by novelty lowness and irregularity by symmetry and height  an observer of the precinct which has been named as an instance in point might have stood under a lamppost and heard simultaneously the peal of the visitors bell from the new terrace on the right hand and the stroke of tools from the musty workshops on the left  waggons laden with deals came up on this side and landaus came down on the otherthe former to lumber heavily through the oldestablished contractors gates the latter to sweep fashionably into the square  about twelve oclock on the day following lord mountcleres exhibition of himself to christopher in the jewellers shop at melchester and almost at the identical time when the viscount was seen to come from the office for marriagelicences in the same place a carriage drove nearly up to the gates of messrs nockett and cos yard  a gentleman stepped out and looked around  he was a man whose years would have been pronounced as fiveandforty by the friendly fifty by the candid fiftytwo or three by the grim  he was as handsome a study in grey as could be seen in town there being far more of the ravens plumage than of the gulls in the mixture as yet and he had a glance of that practised sort which can measure people weigh them repress them encourage them to sprout and blossom as a march sun encourages crocuses ask them questions give them answersin short a glance that could do as many things as an american cookingstove or a multuminparvo pocketknife  but as with most men of the world this was mere mechanism his actual emotions were kept so far within his person that they were rarely heard or seen near his features  on reading the builders names over the gateway he entered the yard and asked at the office if solomon chickerel was engaged on the premises  the clerk was going to be very attentive but finding the visitor had come only to speak to a workman his tense attitude slackened a little and he merely signified the foot of a flemish ladder on the other side of the yard saying you will find him sir up there in the joiners shop  when the man in the black coat reached the top he found himself at the end of a long apartment as large as a chapel and as low as a maltroom across which ran parallel carpenters benches to the number of twenty or more a gangway being left at the side for access throughout  behind every bench there stood a man or two planing fitting or chiselling as the case might be  the visitor paused for a moment as if waiting for some cessation of their violent motions and uproar till he could make his errand known  he waited ten seconds he waited twenty but beyond that a quick look had been thrown upon him by every pair of eyes the muscular performances were in no way interrupted every one seemed oblivious of his presence and absolutely regardless of his wish  in truth the texture of that salmoncoloured skin could be seen to be aristocratic without a microscope and the exceptious artizan has an offhand way when contrasts are made painfully strong by an idler of this kind coming gloved and brushed into the very den where he is sweating and muddling in his shirtsleeves  the gentleman from the carriage then proceeded down the workshop wading up to his knees in a sea of shavings and bruising his ankles against corners of board and sawnoff blocks that lay hidden like reefs beneath at the ninth bench he made another venture  sol chickerel said the man addressed as he touched his planeiron upon the oilstone  hes one of them just behind  damn it all cant one of you show me the visitor angrily observed for he had been used to more attention than this  here point him out he handed the man a shilling  no trouble to do that said the workman and he turned and signified sol by a nod without moving from his place  the stranger entered sols division and nailing him with his eye said at once i want to speak a few words with you in private  is not a mrs petherwin your sister  sol started suspiciously  has anything happened to her he at length said hurriedly  o no  it is on a business matter that i have called  you need not mind owning the relationship to methe secret will be kept  i am the brother of one whom you may have heard of from herlord mountclere  i have not  but if you will wait a minute sir  he went to a little glazed box at the end of the shop where the foreman was sitting and after speaking a few words to this person sol led mountclere to the door and down the ladder  i suppose we cannot very well talk here after all said the gentleman when they reached the yard and found several men moving about therein  perhaps we had better go to some roomthe nearest inn will answer the purpose wont it  excellently  theres the green bushes over the way  they have a very nice private room upstairs  yes that will do  and passing out of the yard the man with the glance entered the inn with sol where they were shown to the parlour as requested  while the waiter was gone for some wine which mountclere ordered the more ingenuous of the two resumed the conversation by saying awkwardly yes mrs petherwin is my sister as you supposed sir but on her account i do not let it be known  indeed said mountclere  well i came to see you in order to speak of a matter which i thought you might know more about than i do for it has taken me quite by surprise  my brother lord mountclere is it seems to be privately married to mrs petherwin tomorrow  is that really the fact said sol becoming quite shaken  i had no thought that such a thing could be possible  it is imminent  father has told me that she has lately got to know some nobleman but i never supposed there could be any meaning in that  you were altogether wrong said mountclere leaning back in his chair and looking at sol steadily  do you feel it to be a matter upon which you will congratulate her  a very different thing said sol vehemently  though he is your brother sir i must say this that i would rather she married the poorest man i know  why  from what my father has told me of him he is nota more desirable brotherinlaw to me than i shall be in all likelihood to him  what business has a man of that character to marry berta i should like to ask  thats what i say returned mountclere revealing his satisfaction at sols estimate of his noble brother it showed that he had calculated well in coming here  my brother is getting old and he has lived strangely your sister is a highly respectable young lady  and he is not respectable you mean  i know he is not  i worked near enckworth once  i cannot say that returned mountclere  possibly a certain fraternal feeling repressed a direct assent and yet this was the only representation which could be expected to prejudice the young man against the wedding if he were such an one as the visitor supposed sol to bea man vulgar in sentiment and ambition but pure in his anxiety for his sisters happiness  at any rate we are agreed in thinking that this would be an unfortunate marriage for both added mountclere  about both i dont know  it may be a good thing for him  when do you say it is to be sirtomorrow  yes  i dont know what to do said sol walking up and down  if half what i have heard is true i would lose a winters work to prevent her marrying him  what does she want to go mixing in with people who despise her for  now look here mr mountclere since you have been and called me out to talk this over it is only fair that you should tell me the exact truth about your brother  is it a lie or is it true that he is not fit to be the husband of a decent woman  that is a curious inquiry said mountclere whose manner and aspect neutral as a winter landscape had little in common with sols warm and unrestrained bearing  there are reasons why i think your sister will not be happy with him  then it is true what they say said sol bringing down his fist upon the table  i know your meaning well enough  whats to be done  if i could only see her this minute she might be kept out of it  you think your presence would influence your sisterif you could see her before the wedding  i think it would  but whos to get at her  i am going so you had better come on with meunless it would be best for your father to come  perhaps it might said the bewildered sol  but he will not be able to get away and its no use for dan to go  if anybody goes i must  if she has made up her mind nothing can be done by writing to her  i leave at once to see lord mountclere the other continued  i feel that as my brother is evidently ignorant of the position of mrs petherwins family and connections it is only fair in me as his nearest relative to make them clear to him before it is too late  you mean that if he knew her friends were workingpeople he would not think of her as a wife  tis a reasonable thought  but make your mind easy she has told him  i make a great mistake if she has for a moment thought of concealing that from him  she may not have deliberately done so  butand i say this with no ill feelingit is a matter known to few and she may have taken no steps to undeceive him  i hope to bring him to see the matter clearly unfortunately the thing has been so secret and hurried that there is barely time  i knew nothing until this morningnever dreamt of such a preposterous occurrence  preposterous  if it should come to pass she would play her part as his lady as well as any other woman and better  i wish there was no more reason for fear on my side than there is on yours  things have come to a sore head when she is not considered lady enough for such as he  but perhaps your meaning is that if your brother were to have a son you would lose your heirpresumptive title to the cornet of mountclere well twould be rather hard for ye now i come to think otupon my life twould  the suggestion is as delicate as the  atmosphere of this vile room but let your ignorance be your excuse my man  it is hardly worth while for us to quarrel when we both have the same object in view do you think so  thats truethats true  when do you start sir  we must leave almost at once said mountclere looking at his watch if we cannot catch the two oclock train there is no getting there to nightand tomorrow we could not possibly arrive before one  i wish there was time for me to go and tidy myself a bit said sol anxiously looking down at his working clothes  i suppose you would not like me to go with you like this  confound the clothes  if you cannot start in five minutes we shall not be able to go at all  very well thenwait while i run across to the shop then i am ready how do we get to the station  my carriage is at the corner waiting  when you come out i will meet you at the gates  sol then hurried downstairs and a minute or two later mr mountclere followed looking like a man bent on policy at any price  the carriage was brought round by the time that sol reappeared from the yard  he entered and sat down beside mountclere not without a sense that he was spoiling good upholstery the coachman then allowed the lash of his whip to alight with the force of a small fly upon the horses which set them up in an angry trot  sol rolled on beside his new acquaintance with the shamefaced look of a man going to prison in a van for pedestrians occasionally gazed at him full of what seemed to himself to be ironical surprise  i am afraid i ought to have changed my clothes after all he said writhing under a perception of the contrast between them  not knowing anything about this i aint a bit prepared  if i had got even my second best hat it wouldnt be so bad  it makes no difference said mountclere inanimately  or i might have brought my portmantle with some things  it really is not important  on reaching the station they found there were yet a few minutes to spare which sol made use of in writing a note to his father to explain what had occurred     42 the doncastles residence and outside the same   mrs doncastles dressingbell had rung but menlove the ladys maid having at the same time received a letter by the evening post paused to read it before replying to the summons     enckworth court wednesday     darling louisai can assure you that i am no more likely than    yourself to form another attachment as you will perceive by what    follows  before we left town i thought that to be able to see you    occasionally was sufficient for happiness but down in this lonely    place the case is different  in short my dear i ask you to consent    to a union with me as soon as you possibly can  your prettiness has    won my eyes and lips completely sweet and i lie awake at night to    think of the golden curls you allowed to escape from their confinement    on those nice times of private clothes when we walked in the park and    slipped the bonds of service which you were never born to any more    than i        had not my own feelings been so strong i should have told you at the    first dash of my pen that what i expected is coming to pass at    lastthe old dog is going to be privately married to mrs p  yes    indeed and the wedding is coming off tomorrow secret as the grave    all her friends will doubtless leave service on account of it  what    he does now makes little difference to me of course as i had already    given warning but i shall stick to him like a briton in spite of it    he has today made me a present and a further five pounds for    yourself expecting you to hold your tongue on every matter connected    with mrs ps friends and to say nothing to any of them about this    marriage until it is over  his lordship impressed this upon me very    strong and familiar as a brother and of course we obey his    instructions to the letter for i need hardly say that unless he keeps    his promise to help me in setting up the shop our nuptials cannot be    consumed  his help depends upon our obedience as you are aware        this and much more was from her very last lover lord mountcleres valet who had been taken in hand directly she had convinced herself of joeys hopeless youthfulness  the missive sent mrs menloves spirits soaring like spring larks she flew upstairs in answer to the bell with a joyful triumphant look which the illuminated figure of mrs doncastle in her dressingroom could not quite repress  one could almost forgive menlove her arts when so modest a result brought such vast content  mrs doncastle seemed inclined to make no remark during the dressing and at last menlove could repress herself no longer  i should like to name something to you mm  yes  i shall be wishing to leave soon if it is convenient  very well menlove answered mrs doncastle as she serenely surveyed her right eyebrow in the glass  am i to take this as a formal notice  if you please but i could stay a week or two beyond the month if suitable  i am going to be marriedthats what it is mm  o  i am glad to hear it though i am sorry to lose you  it is lord mountcleres valetmr tipmanmm  indeed  menlove went on building up mrs doncastles hair awhile in silence  i suppose you heard the other news that arrived in town today mm she said again  lord mountclere is going to be married tomorrow  tomorrow  are you quite sure  o yes mm  mr tipman has just told me so in his letter  he is going to be married to mrs petherwin  it is to be quite a private wedding  mrs doncastle made no remark and she remained in the same still position as before but a countenance expressing transcendent surprise was reflected to menlove by the glass  at this sight menloves tongue so burned to go further and unfold the ladys relations with the butler downstairs that she would have lost a months wages to be at liberty to do it  the disclosure was almost too magnificent to be repressed  to deny herself so exquisite an indulgence required an effort which nothing on earth could have sustained save the one thing that did sustain itthe knowledge that upon her silence hung the most enormous desideratum in the world her own marriage  she said no more and mrs doncastle went away  it was an ordinary family dinner that day but their nephew neigh happened to be present  just as they were sitting down mrs doncastle said to her husband why have you not told me of the wedding tomorrowor dont you know anything about it  wedding said mr doncastle  lord mountclere is to be married to mrs petherwin quite privately  good god said some person  mr doncastle did not speak the words they were not spoken by neigh they seemed to float over the room and round the walls as if originating in some spiritualistic source  yet mrs doncastle remembering the symptoms of attachment between ethelberta and her nephew which had appeared during the summer looked towards neigh instantly as if she thought the words must have come from him after all but neighs face was perfectly calm he together with her husband was sitting with his eyes fixed in the direction of the sideboard and turning to the same spot she beheld chickerel standing pale as death his lips being parted as if he did not know where he was  did you speak said mrs doncastle looking with astonishment at the butler  chickerel whats the matterare you ill said mr doncastle simultaneously  was it you who said that  i did sir said chickerel in a husky voice scarcely above a whisper i could not help it  why  she is my daughter and it shall be known at once  who is your daughter  he paused a few moments nervously  mrs petherwin he said  upon this announcement neigh looked at poor chickerel as if he saw through him into the wall  mrs doncastle uttered a faint exclamation and leant back in her chair the bare possibility of the truth of chickerels claims to such paternity shook her to pieces when she viewed her intimacies with ethelberta during the past seasonthe court she had paid her the arrangements she had entered into to please her above all the dinnerparty which she had contrived and carried out solely to gratify lord mountclere and bring him into personal communication with the general favourite thus making herself probably the chief though unconscious instrument in promoting a match by which her butler was to become fatherinlaw to a peer she delighted to honour  the crowd of perceptions almost took away her life she closed her eyes in a white shiver  do you mean to say that the lady who sat here at dinner at the same time that lord mountclere was present is your daughter asked doncastle  yes sir said chickerel respectfully  how did she come to be your daughter  i  well she is my daughter sir  did you educate her  not altogether sir  she was a very clever child  lady petherwin took a deal of trouble about her education  they were both left widows about the same time the son died then the father  my daughter was only seventeen then  but though shes older now her marriage with lord mountclere means misery  he ought to marry another woman  it is very extraordinary mr doncastle murmured  if you are ill you had better go and rest yourself chickerel  send in thomas  chickerel who seemed to be much disturbed then very gladly left the room and dinner proceeded  but such was the peculiarity of the case that though there was in it neither murder robbery illness accident fire or any other of the tragic and legitimate shakers of human nerves two of the three who were gathered there sat through the meal without the least consciousness of what viands had composed it  impressiveness depends as much upon propinquity as upon magnitude and to have honoured unawares the daughter of the vilest antipodean miscreant and murderer would have been less discomfiting to mrs doncastle than it was to make the same blunder with the daughter of a respectable servant who happened to live in her own house  to neigh the announcement was as the catastrophe of a story already begun rather than as an isolated wonder ethelbertas words had prepared him for something though the nature of that thing was unknown  chickerel ought not to have kept us in ignorance of thisof course he ought not said mrs doncastle as soon as they were left alone  i dont see why not replied mr doncastle who took the matter very coolly as was his custom  then she herself should have let it be known  nor does that follow  you didnt tell mrs petherwin that your grandfather narrowly escaped hanging for shooting his rival in a duel  of course not  there was no reason why i should give extraneous information  nor was there any reason why she should  as for chickerel he doubtless felt how unbecoming it would be to make personal remarks upon one of your guestshahaha  well wellhahahaha  i know this said mrs doncastle in great anger that if my father had been in the room i should not have let the fact pass unnoticed and treated him like a stranger  would you have had her introduce chickerel to us all round  my dear margaret it was a complicated position for a woman  then she ought not to have come  there may be something in that though she was dining out at other houses as good as ours  well i should have done just as she did for the joke of the thing  hahahait is very goodvery  it was a case in which the appetite for a jest would overpower the sting of conscience in any wellconstituted beingthat my dear i must maintain  i say she should not have come answered mrs doncastle firmly  of course i shall dismiss chickerel  of course you will do no such thing  i have never had a butler in the house before who suited me so well  it is a great credit to the man to have such a daughter and i am not sure that we do not derive some lustre of a humble kind from his presence in the house  but seriously i wonder at your shortsightedness when you know the troubles we have had through getting new men from nobody knows where  neigh perceiving that the breeze in the atmosphere might ultimately intensify to a palpable black squall seemed to think it would be well to take leave of his uncle and aunt as soon as he conveniently could nevertheless he was much less discomposed by the situation than by the active cause which had led to it  when mrs doncastle arose her husband said he was going to speak to chickerel for a minute or two and neigh followed his aunt upstairs  presently doncastle joined them  i have been talking to chickerel he said  it is a very curious affairthis marriage of his daughter and lord mountclere  the whole situation is the most astounding i have ever met with  the man is quite ill about the news  he has shown me a letter which has just reached him from his son on the same subject  lord mountcleres brother and this young man have actually gone off together to try to prevent the wedding and chickerel has asked to be allowed to go himself if he can get soon enough to the station to catch the night mail  of course he may go if he wishes  what a funny thing said the lady with a wretchedly factitious smile the times have taken a strange turn when the angry parent of the comedy who goes posthaste to prevent the undutiful daughters rash marriage is a gentleman from below stairs and the unworthy lover a peer of the realm  neigh spoke for almost the first time  i dont blame chickerel in objecting to lord mountclere  i should object to him myself if i had a daughter  i never liked him  why said mrs doncastle lifting her eyelids as if the act were a heavy task  for reasons which dont generally appear  yes said mr doncastle in a low tone  still we must not believe all we hear  is chickerel going said neigh  he leaves in five or ten minutes said doncastle  after a few further words neigh mentioned that he was unable to stay longer that evening and left them  when he had reached the outside of the door he walked a little way up the pavement and back again as if reluctant to lose sight of the street finally standing under a lamppost whence he could command a view of mr doncastles front  presently a man came out in a greatcoat and with a small bag in his hand neigh at once recognizing the person as chickerel went up to him  mr doncastle tells me you are going on a sudden journey  at what time does your train leave neigh asked  i go by the ten oclock sir i hope it is a thirdclass said chickerel though i am afraid it may not be  it is as much as you will do to get to the station said neigh turning the face of his watch to the light  here come into my cabi am driving that way  thank you sir said chickerel  neigh called a cab at the first opportunity and they entered and drove along together  neither spoke during the journey  when they were driving up to the station entrance neigh looked again to see the hour  you have not a minute to lose he said in repressed anxiety  and your journey will be expensive instead of walking from anglebury to knollsea you had better driveabove all dont lose time  never mind what class the train is  take this from me since the emergency is great  he handed something to chickerel folded up small  the butler took it without inquiry and stepped out hastily  i sincerely hope she  well goodnight chickerel continued neigh ending his words abruptly  the cab containing him drove again towards the stationgates leaving chickerel standing on the kerb  he passed through the bookingoffice and looked at the paper neigh had put into his hand  it was a fivepound note  chickerel mused on the circumstance as he took his ticket and got into the train     43 the railwaythe seathe shore beyond   by this time sol and the honourable edgar mountclere had gone far on their journey into wessex  enckworth court mountcleres destination though several miles from knollsea was most easily accessible by the same route as that to the village the latter being the place for which sol was bound  from the few words that passed between them on the way mountclere became more stubborn than ever in a belief that this was a carefully laid trap of the fair ethelbertas to ensnare his brother without revealing to him her family ties which it therefore behoved him to make clear with the utmost force of representation before the fatal union had been contracted  being himself the viscounts only remaining brother and near relative the disinterestedness of his motives may be left to imagination that there was much real excuse for his conduct must however be borne in mind  whether his attempt would prevent the union was another question he believed that conjoined with his personal influence over the viscount and the importation of sol as a firebrand to throw between the betrothed pair it might do so  about halfanhour before sunset the two individuals linked by their differences reached the point of railway at which the branch to sandbourne left the main line  they had taken tickets for sandbourne intending to go thence to knollsea by the steamer that plied between the two places during the summer monthsmaking this a short and direct route  but it occurred to mountclere on the way that summer being over the steamer might possibly have left off running the wind might be too high for a small boat and no large one might be at hand for hire therefore it would be safer to go by train to anglebury and the remaining sixteen miles by driving over the hills even at a great loss of time  accident however determined otherwise  they were in the station at the junction inquiring of an official if the speedwell had ceased to sail when a countryman who had just come up from sandbourne stated that though the speedwell had left off for the year there was that day another steamer at sandbourne  this steamer would of necessity return to knollsea that evening partly because several people from that place had been on board and also because the knollsea folk were waiting for groceries and draperies from london there was not an ounce of tea or a hundredweight of coal in the village owing to the recent winds which had detained the provision parcels at sandbourne and kept the colliers upchannel until the change of weather this day  to introduce necessaries by a roundabout land journey was not easy when they had been ordered by the other and habitual route  the boat returned at six oclock  so on they went to sandbourne driving off to the pier directly they reached that place for it was getting towards night  the steamer was there as the man had told them much to the relief of sol who being extremely anxious to enter knollsea before a late hour had known that this was the only way in which it could be done  some unforeseen incident delayed the boat and they walked up and down the pier to wait  the prospect was gloomy enough  the wind was north east the sea along shore was a chalkygreen though comparatively calm this part of the coast forming a shelter from wind in its present quarter  the clouds had different velocities and some of them shone with a coppery glare produced by rays from the west which did not enter the inferior atmosphere at all  it was reflected on the distant waves in patches with an effect as if the waters were at those particular spots stained with blood  this departed and what daylight was left to the earth came from strange and unusual quarters of the heavens  the zenith would be bright as if that were the place of the sun then all overhead would close and a whiteness in the east would give the appearance of morning while a bank as thick as a wall barricaded the west which looked as if it had no acquaintance with sunsets and would blush red no more  any other passengers shouted the master of the steamboat  we must be off it may be a dirty night  sol and mountclere went on board and the pier receded in the dusk  shall we have any difficulty in getting into knollsea bay said mountclere  not if the wind keeps where it is for another hour or two  i fancy it is shifting to the eastard said sol  the captain looked as if he had thought the same thing  i hope i shall be able to get home tonight said a knollsea woman  my little children be left alone  your misess is in a bad way tooisnt she skipper  yes  and youve got the doctor from sandbourne aboard to tend her  yes  then youll be sure to put into knollsea if you can  yes  dont be alarmed maam  well do what we can  but no one must boast  the skippers remark was the result of an observation that the wind had at last flown to the east the single point of the compass whence it could affect knollsea bay  the result of this change was soon perceptible  about midway in their transit the land elbowed out to a bold chalk promontory beyond this stretched a vertical wall of the same cliff in a line parallel with their course  in fair weather it was possible and customary to steer close along under this hoary facade for the distance of a mile there being six fathoms of water within a few boats lengths of the precipice  but it was an ugly spot at the best of times landward no less than seaward the cliff rounding off at the top in vegetation like a forehead with lowgrown hair no defined edge being provided as a warning to unwary pedestrians on the downs above  as the wind sprung up stronger white clots could be discerned at the water level of the cliff rising and falling against the black band of shaggy weed that formed a sort of skirting to the base of the wall  they were the firstfruits of the new east blast which shaved the face of the cliff like a razorgatherings of foam in the shape of heads shoulders and arms of snowy whiteness apparently struggling to rise from the deeps and ever sinking back to their old levels again  they reminded an observer of a drowning scene in a picture of the deluge  at some points the face of rock was hollowed into gaping caverns and the water began to thunder into these with a leap that was only topped by the rebound seaward again  the vessels head was kept a little further to sea but beyond that everything went on as usual  the precipice was still in view and before it several huge columns of rock appeared detached from the mass behind  two of these were particularly noticeable in the grey airone vertical stout and square the other slender and tapering  they were individualized as husband and wife by the coast men  the waves leapt up their sides like a pack of hounds this however though fearful in its boisterousness was nothing to the terrible games that sometimes went on round the knees of those giants in stone  yet it was sufficient to cause the course of the frail steamboat to be altered yet a little morefrom southwestbysouth to southbywestto give the breakers a still wider berth  i wish we had gone by land sir twould have been surer play said sol to mountclere a catanddog friendship having arisen between them  yes said mountclere  knollsea is an abominable place to get into with an east wind blowing they say  another circumstance conspired to make their landing more difficult which mountclere knew nothing of  with the wind easterly the highest sea prevailed in knollsea bay from the slackening of floodtide to the first hour of ebb  at that time the water outside stood without a current and ridges and hollows chased each other towards the beach unchecked  when the tide was setting strong up or down channel its flow across the mouth of the bay thrust aside to some extent the landward plunge of the waves  we glance for a moment at the state of affairs on the land they were nearing  this was the time of year to know the truth about the inner nature and character of knollsea for to see knollsea smiling to the summer sun was to see a courtier before a king knollsea was not to be known by such simple means  the halfdozen detached villas used as lodginghouses in the summer standing aloof from the cots of the permanent race rose in the dusk of this gusty evening empty silent damp and dark as tombs the gravel walks leading to them were invaded by leaves and tufts of grass  as the darkness thickened the wind increased and each blast raked the iron railings before the houses till they hummed as if in a song of derision  certainly it seemed absurd at this time of year that human beings should expect comfort in a spot capable of such moods as these  however one of the houses looked cheerful and that was the dwelling to which ethelberta had gone  its gay external colours might as well have been black for anything that could be seen of them now but an unblinded window revealed inside it a room bright and warm  it was illuminated by firelight only  within ethelberta appeared against the curtains close to the glass  she was watching through a binocular a faint light which had become visible in the direction of the bluff far away over the bay  here is the spruce at last i think she said to her sister who was by the fire  i hope they will be able to land the things i have ordered they are on board i know  the wind continued to rise till at length something from the lungs of the gale alighted like a feather upon the pane and remained there sticking seeing the substance ethelberta opened the window to secure it  the fire roared and the pictures kicked the walls she closed the sash and brought to the light a crisp fragment of foam  how suddenly the sea must have risen said picotee  the servant entered the room  please misess says she is afraid you wont have your things tonight m  they say the steamer cant land and misess wants to know if she can do anything  it is of no consequence said ethelberta  they will come some time unless they go to the bottom  the girl left the room  shall we go down to the shore and see what the night is like said ethelberta  this is the last opportunity i shall have  is it right for us to go considering you are to be married tomorrow said picotee who had small affection for nature in this mood  her sister laughed  let us put on our cloaksnobody will know us  i am sorry to leave this grim and primitive place even for enckworth court  they wrapped themselves up and descended the hill  on drawing near the battling line of breakers which marked the meeting of sea and land they could perceive within the nearly invisible horizon an equilateral triangle of lights  it was formed of three stars a red on the one side a green on the other and a white on the summit  this composed of masthead and side lamps was all that was visible of the spruce which now faced endon about halfamile distant and was still nearing the pier  the girls went further and stood on the foreshore listening to the din  seaward appeared nothing distinct save a black horizontal band embodying itself out of the grey water strengthening its blackness and enlarging till it looked like a nearing wall  it was the concave face of a coming wave  on its summit a white edging arose with the aspect of a lace frill it broadened and fell over the front with a terrible concussion  then all before them was a sheet of whiteness which spread with amazing rapidity till they found themselves standing in the midst of it as in a field of snow  both felt an insidious chill encircling their ankles and they rapidly ran up the beach  you girls come away there or youll be washed off what need have ye for going so near  ethelberta recognized the stentorian voice as that of captain flower who with a party of boatmen was discovered to be standing near under the shelter of a wall  he did not know them in the gloom and they took care that he should not  they retreated further up the beach when the hissing fleece of froth slid again down the shingle dragging the pebbles under it with a rattle as of a beast gnawing bones  the spot whereon the men stood was called downunderwall it was a nook commanding a full view of the bay and hither the nautical portion of the village unconsciously gravitated on windy afternoons and nights to discuss past disasters in the reticent spirit induced by a sense that they might at any moment be repeated  the stranger who should walk the shore on roaring and sobbing november eves when there was not light sufficient to guide his footsteps and muse on the absoluteness of the solitude would be surprised by a smart goodnight being returned from this corner in company with the echo of his tread  in summer the six or eight perennial figures stood on the breezy side of the wallin winter and in rain to leeward but no weather was known to dislodge them  i had no sooner come ashore than the wind began to fly round said the previous speaker and it must have been about the time they were off old harry point  shell put back for certain i said and i had no more thought o seeing her than johns setnet that was carried round the point o monday  poor feller his wife being in such a state makes him anxious to land if a can thats what tis plain enough  why that said flower  the doctors aboard a believe ill have the most understanding man in sandbourne cost me little or much he said  tis all over and shes better said the other  i called halfanhour afore dark  flower being an experienced man knew how the judgment of a ships master was liable to be warped by family anxieties many instances of the same having occurred in the history of navigation  he felt uneasy for he knew the deceit and guile of this bay far better than did the master of the spruce who till within a few recent months had been a stranger to the place  indeed it was the bay which had made flower what he was instead of a man in thriving retirement  the two great ventures of his life had been blown ashore and broken up within that very semicircle  the sturdy sailor now stood with his eyes fixed on the triangle of lights which showed that the steamer had not relinquished her intention of bringing up inside the pier if possible his right hand was in his pocket where it played with a large key which lay there  it was the key of the lifeboat shed and flower was coxswain  his musing was on the possibility of a use for it this night  it appeared that the captain of the spruce was aiming to pass in under the lee of the pier but a strong current of four or five knots was running between the piles drifting the steamer away at every attempt as soon as she slowed  to come in on the other side was dangerous the hull of the vessel being likely to crash against and overthrow the fragile erection with damage to herself also  flower who had disappeared for a few minutes now came back  it is just possible i can make em hear with the trumpet now they be to leeward he said and proceeded with two or three others to grope his way out upon the pier which consisted simply of a row of rotten piles covered with rotten planking no balustrade of any kind existing to keep the unwary from tumbling off  at the water level the piles were eaten away by the action of the sea to about the size of a mans wrist and at every fresh influx the whole structure trembled like a spiders web  in this lay the danger of making fast for a strong pull from a headfast rope might drag the erection completely over  flower arrived at the end where a lantern hung  spruce ahoy he blared through the speaking trumpet two or three times  there seemed to be a reply of some sort from the steamer  tuesdays gale hev loosened the pier capn ounce the bollards be too weak to make fast to must land in boats if ye will land but dangerous yer wife is out of danger and tis a boyyyy  ethelberta and picotee were at this time standing on the beach a hundred and fifty yards off  whether or not the master of the steamer received the information volunteered by flower the two girls saw the triangle of lamps get narrow at its base reduce themselves to two in a vertical line then to one then to darkness  the spruce had turned her head from knollsea  they have gone back and i shall not have my wedding things after all said ethelberta  well i must do without them  you see twas best to play sure said flower to his comrades in a tone of complacency  they might have been able to do it but twas risky  the shopfolk be out of stock i hear and the visiting lady up the hill is terribly in want of clothes so tis said  but whats that ounce ought to have put back afore  then the lantern which hung at the end of the jetty was taken down and the darkness enfolded all around from view  the bay became nothing but a voice the foam an occasional touch upon the face the spruce an imagination the pier a memory  everything lessened upon the senses but one that was the wind  it mauled their persons like a hand and caused every scrap of their raiment to tug westward  to stand with the face to sea brought semisuffocation from the intense pressure of air  the boatmen retired to their position under the wall to lounge again in silence  conversation was not considered necessary their sense of each others presence formed a kind of conversation  meanwhile picotee and ethelberta went up the hill  if your wedding were going to be a public one what a misfortune this delay of the packages would be said picotee  yes replied the elder  i think the bracelet the prettiest of all the presents he brought to daydo you  it is the most valuable  lord mountclere is very kind is he not  i like him a great deal better than i diddo you berta  yes very much better said ethelberta warming a little  if he were not so suspicious at odd moments i should like him exceedingly  but i must cure him of that by a regular course of treatment and then hell be very nice  for an old man  he likes you better than any young man would take the trouble to do  i wish somebody else were old too  he will be some day  yes but  never mind time will straighten many crooked things  do you think lord mountclere has reached home by this time  i should think so though i believe he had to call at the parsonage before leaving knollsea  had he  what for  why of course somebody must  o yes  do you think anybody in knollsea knows it is going to be except us and the parson  i suppose the clerk knows  i wonder if a lord has ever been married so privately before  frequently when he marries far beneath him as in this case  but even if i could have had it i should not have liked a showy wedding  i have had no experience as a bride except in the private form of the ceremony  berta i am sometimes uneasy about you even now and i want to ask you one thing if i may  are you doing this for my sake  would you have married mr julian if it had not been for me  it is difficult to say exactly  it is possible that if i had had no relations at all i might have married him  and i might not  i dont intend to marry  in that case you will live with me at enckworth  however we will leave such details till the groundwork is confirmed  when we get indoors will you see if the boxes have been properly corded and are quite ready to be sent for  then come in and sit by the fire and ill sing some songs to you  sad ones you mean  no they shall not be sad  perhaps they may be the last you will ever sing to me  they may be  such a thing has occurred  but we will not think so  well suppose you are to sing many to me yet  yes  theres good sense in that picotee  in a world where the blind only are cheerful we should all do well to put out our eyes  there i did not mean to get into this state forgive me picotee  it is because i have had a thoughtwhy i cannot tellthat as much as this man brings to me in rank and gifts he may take out of me in tears  berta  but theres no reason in itnot any for not in a single matter does what has been supply us with any certain ground for knowing what will be in the world  i have seen marriages where happiness might have been said to be ensured and they have been all sadness afterwards and i have seen those in which the prospect was black as night and they have led on to a time of sweetness and comfort  and i have seen marriages neither joyful nor sorry that have become either as accident forced them to become the persons having no voice in it at all  well then why should i be afraid to make a plunge when chance is as trustworthy as calculation  if you dont like him well enough dont have him berta  theres time enough to put it off even now  o no  i would not upset a wellconsidered course on the haste of an impulse  our will should withstand our misgivings  now let us see if all has been packed and then well sing  that evening while the wind was wheeling round and round the dwelling and the calm eye of the lighthouse afar was the single speck perceptible of the outside world from the door of ethelbertas temporary home the music of songs mingled with the stroke of the wind across the iron railings and was swept on in the general tide of the gale and the noise of the rolling sea till not the echo of a tone remained  an hour before this singing an old gentleman might have been seen to alight from a little onehorse brougham and enter the door of knollsea parsonage  he was bent upon obtaining an entrance to the vicars study without giving his name  but it happened that the vicars wife was sitting in the front room making a pillowcase for the childrens bed out of an old surplice which had been excommunicated the previous easter she heard the newcomers voice through the partition started and went quickly to her husband who was where he ought to have been in his study  at her entry he looked up with an abstracted gaze having been lost in meditation over a little schooner which he was attempting to rig for their youngest boy  at a word from his wife on the suspected name of the visitor he resumed his earlier occupation of inserting a few strong sentences full of the observation of maturer life between the lines of a sermon written during his first years of ordination in order to make it available for the coming sunday  his wife then vanished with the little ship in her hand and the visitor appeared  a talk went on in low tones  after a ten minutes stay he departed as secretly as he had come  his errand was the cause of much whispered discussion between the vicar and his wife during the evening but nothing was said concerning it to the outside world     44 sandbournea lonely heaththe red lionthe highway   it was halfpast eleven before the spruce with mountclere and sol chickerel on board had steamed back again to sandbourne  the direction and increase of the wind had made it necessary to keep the vessel still further to sea on their return than in going that they might clear without risk the windy sousing thwacking basting scourging jack ketch of a corner called oldharry point which lay about halfway along their track and stood with its detached posts and stumps of white rock like a skeletons lower jaw grinning at british navigation  here strong currents and cross currents were beginning to interweave their scrolls and meshes the water rising behind them in tumultuous heaps and slamming against the fronts and angles of cliff whence it flew into the air like clouds of flour  who could now believe that this roaring abode of chaos smiled in the sun as gently as an infant during the summer days not long gone by every pinnacle crag and cave returning a doubled image across the glassy sea  they were now again at sandbourne a point in their journey reached more than four hours ago  it became necessary to consider anew how to accomplish the difficult remainder  the wind was not blowing much beyond what seamen call half a gale but there had been enough unpleasantness afloat to make landsmen glad to get ashore and this dissipated in a slight measure their vexation at having failed in their purpose  still mountclere loudly cursed their confidence in that treacherously short route and sol abused the unknown sandbourne man who had brought the news of the steamers arrival to them at the junction  the only course left open to them now short of giving up the undertaking was to go by the road along the shore which curving round the various little creeks and inland seas between their present position and knollsea was of no less length than thirty miles  there was no train back to the junction till the next morning and sols proposition that they should drive thither in hope of meeting the mailtrain was overruled by mountclere  we will have nothing more to do with chance he said  we may miss the train and then we shall have gone out of the way for nothing  more than that the down mail does not stop till it gets several miles beyond the nearest station for knollsea so it is hopeless  if there had only been a telegraph to the confounded place  telegraphwe might as well telegraph to the devil as to an old booby and a damned scheming young widow  i very much question if we shall do anything in the matter even if we get there  but i suppose we had better go on now  you can do as you like  i shall go on if i have to walk every step ot  thats not necessary  i think the best postinghouse at this end of the town is tempettswe must knock them up at once  which will you doattempt supper here or break the back of our journey first and get on to anglebury  we may rest an hour or two there unless you feel really in want of a meal  no  ill leave eating to merrier men who have no sister in the hands of a cursed old vandal  very well said mountclere  well go on at once  an additional halfhour elapsed before they were fairly started the lateness and abruptness of their arrival causing delay in getting a conveyance ready the tempestuous night had apparently driven the whole town gentle and simple early to their beds  and when at length the travellers were on their way the aspect of the weather grew yet more forbidding  the rain came down unmercifully the booming wind caught it bore it across the plain whizzed it against the carriage like a sower sowing his seed  it was precisely such weather and almost at the same season as when picotee traversed the same moor stricken with her great disappointment at not meeting christopher julian  further on for several miles the drive lay through an open heath dotted occasionally with fir plantations the trees of which told the tale of their species without help from outline or colour they spoke in those melancholy moans and sobs which give to their sound a solemn sadness surpassing even that of the sea  from each carriagelamp the long rays stretched like feelers into the air and somewhat cheered the way until the insidious damp that pervaded all things above around and underneath overpowered one of them and rendered every attempt to rekindle it ineffectual  even had the two mens dislike to each others society been less the general din of the night would have prevented much talking as it was they sat in a rigid reticence that was almost a third personality  the roads were laid hereabouts with a light sandy gravel which though not clogging was soft and friable  it speedily became saturated and the wheels ground heavily and deeply into its substance  at length after crossing from ten to twelve miles of these eternal heaths under the eternally drumming storm they could discern eyelets of light winking to them in the distance from under a nebulous brow of pale haze  they were looking on the little town of havenpool  soon after this crossroads were reached one of which at right angles to their present direction led down on the left to that place  here the man stopped and informed them that the horses would be able to go but a mile or two further  very well we must have others that can said mountclere  does our way lie through the town  no sirunless we go there to change horses which i thought to do  the direct road is straight on  havenpool lies about three miles down there on the left  but the water is over the road and we had better go round we shall come to no place for two or three miles and then only to flychett  whats flychett like  a trumpery small bit of a village  still i think we had better push on said sol  i am against running the risk of finding the way flooded about havenpool  so am i returned mountclere  i know a wheelwright in flychett continued sol and he keeps a beer house and owns two horses  we could hire them and have a bit of sommat in the shape of victuals and then get on to anglebury  perhaps the rain may hold up by that time  anythings better than going out of our way  yes  and the horses can last out to that place said mountclere  up and on again my man  on they went towards flychett  still the everlasting heath the black hills bulging against the sky the barrows upon their round summits like warts on a swarthy skin  the storm blew huskily over bushes of heather and furze that it was unable materially to disturb and the travellers proceeded as before  but the horses were now far from fresh and the time spent in reaching the next village was quite half as long as that taken up by the previous heavy portion of the drive  when they entered flychett it was about three  now wheres the inn said mountclere yawning  just on the knap sol answered  tis a little small place and we must do as well as we can  they pulled up before a cottage upon the whitewashed front of which could be seen a square board representing the sign  after an infinite labour of rapping and shouting a casement opened overhead and a womans voice inquired what was the matter  sol explained when she told them that the horses were away from home  now we must wait till these are rested growled mountclere  a pretty muddle  it cannot be helped answered sol and he asked the woman to open the door  she replied that her husband was away with the horses and van and that they could not come in  sol was known to her and he mentioned his name but the woman only began to abuse him  come publican youd better let us in or well have the law fort rejoined sol with more spirit  you dont dare to keep nobility waiting like this  nobility  my mate hev the title of honourable whether or no so lets have none of your slack said sol  dont be a fool young chopstick exclaimed mountclere  get the door opened  i willin my own way said sol testily  you mustnt mind my trading upon your quality as tis a case of necessity  this is a woman nothing will bring to reason but an appeal to the higher powers  if every man of title was as useful as you are tonight sir id never call them lumber again as long as i live  how singular  theres never a bit of rubbish that wont come in use if you keep it seven years  if my utility depends upon keeping you company may i go to h for lacking every atom of the virtue  hear hear  but it hardly is becoming in me to answer up to a man so much older than i or i could say more  suppose we draw a line here for the present sir and get indoors  do what you will in heavens name  a few more words to the woman resulted in her agreeing to admit them if they would attend to themselves afterwards  this sol promised and the key of the door was let down to them from the bedroom window by a string when they had entered sol who knew the house well busied himself in lighting a fire the driver going off with a lantern to the stable where he found standingroom for the two horses  mountclere walked up and down the kitchen mumbling words of disgust at the situation the few of this kind that he let out being just enough to show what a fearfully large number he kept in  acalling up people at this time of morning the woman occasionally exclaimed down the stairs  but folks show no mercy upon their flesh and bloodnot one bit or mite  now never be stomachy my good soul cried sol from the fireplace where he stood blowing the fire with his breath  only tell me where the victuals bide and ill do all the cooking  well pay like princesespecially my mate  theres but little in house said the sleepy woman from her bedroom theres pigs fry a side of bacon a conger eel and pickled onions  conger eel said sol to mountclere  no thank you  pigs fry  no thank you  well then tell me where the bacon is shouted sol to the woman  you must find it came again down the stairs  tis somewhere up in chimley but in which part i cant mind  really i dont know whether i be upon my head or my heels and my brain is all in a spin wi being rafted up in such a larry  bide where you be theres a dear said sol  well do it all  just tell us where the teacaddy is and the gridiron and then you can go to sleep again  the woman appeared to take his advice for she gave the information and silence soon reigned upstairs  when one piece of bacon had been with difficulty cooked over the newly lit fire sol said to mountclere with the rasher on his fork now look here sir i think while i am making the tea you ought to go on griddling some more of these as you havent done nothing at all  i do the paying     well give me the bacon  and when you have done yours ill cook the mans as the poor fellers hungry i make no doubt  mountclere fork in hand then began with his rasher tossing it about the gridiron in masterly style sol attending to the tea  he was attracted from this occupation by a brilliant flame up the chimney mountclere exclaiming now the cursed thing is on fire  blow it outhardthats it  well now sir do you come and begin upon mine as you must be hungry  ill finish the griddling  ought we to mind the man sitting down in our company as theres no other room for him  i hear him coming in  o nonot at all  put him over at that table  and ill join him  you can sit here by yourself sir  the meal was despatched and the coachman again retired promising to have the horses ready in about an hour and a half  sol and mountclere made themselves comfortable upon either side of the fireplace since there was no remedy for the delay after sitting in silence awhile they nodded and slept  how long they would have remained thus in consequence of their fatigues there is no telling had not the mistress of the cottage descended the stairs about two hours later after peeping down upon them at intervals of five minutes during their sleep lest they should leave without her knowledge  it was six oclock and sol went out for the man whom he found snoring in the hayloft  there was now real necessity for haste and in ten minutes they were again on their way        day dawned upon the red lion inn at anglebury with a timid and watery eye  from the shadowy archway came a shining lantern which was seen to be dangling from the hand of a little bowlegged old manthe hostler john  having reached the front he looked around to measure the daylight opened the lantern and extinguished it by a pinch of his fingers  he paused for a moment to have the customary word or two with his neighbour the milkman who usually appeared at this point at this time  it sounds like the whistle of the morning train the milkman said as he drew near a scream from the further end of the town reaching their ears well i hope now the winds in that quarter we shall hae a little more fine weatherhey hostler  what be ye a talking o  can hear the whistle plain i say  o ay  i suppose you do  but faith tis a poor fist i can make at hearing anything  there i could have told all the same that the wind was in the east even if i had not seed poor thomas tribbles smoke blowing across the little orchard  joints be a true weathercock enough when past threescore  these easterly rains when they do come which is not often come wi might enough to squail a man into his grave  well we must look for it hostler     why what mighty ekkypage is this come to town at such a purblinking time of day  tis what time only can tellthough twill not be long first the hostler replied as the driver of the pair of horses and carriage containing sol and mountclere slackened pace and drew rein before the inn  fresh horses were immediately called for and while they were being put in the two travellers walked up and down  it is now a quarter to seven oclock said mountclere and the question arises shall i go on to knollsea or branch off at corvsgate castle for enckworth  i think the best plan will be to drive first to enckworth set me down and then get him to take you on at once to knollsea  what do you say  when shall i reach knollsea by that arrangement  by halfpast eight oclock  we shall be at enckworth before eight which is excellent time  very well sir i agree to that said sol feeling that as soon as one of the two birds had been caught the other could not mate without their knowledge  the carriage and horses being again ready away they drove at once both having by this time grown too restless to spend in anglebury a minute more than was necessary  the hostler and his lad had taken the jaded sandbourne horses to the stable rubbed them down and fed them when another noise was heard outside the yard the omnibus had returned from meeting the train relinquishing the horses to the small stablelad the old hostler again looked out from the arch  a young man had stepped from the omnibus and he came forward  i want a conveyance of some sort to take me to knollsea at once  can you get a horse harnessed in five minutes  ill make shift to do what i can master not promising about the minutes  the truest man can say no more  wont ye step into the bar sir and give your order  ill let ye know as soon as tis ready  christopher turned into a room smelling strongly of the night before and stood by the newlykindled fire to wait  he had just come in haste from melchester  the upshot of his excitement about the wedding which as the possible hour of its solemnization drew near had increased till it bore him on like a wind was this unpremeditated journey  lying awake the previous night the hangings of his bed pulsing to every beat of his heart he decided that there was one last and great service which it behoved him as an honest man and friend to say nothing of lover to render to ethelberta at this juncture  it was to ask her by some means whether or not she had engaged with open eyes to marry lord mountclere and if not to give her a word or two of enlightenment  that done she might be left to take care of herself  his plan was to obtain an interview with picotee and learn from her accurately the state of things  should he by any possibility be mistaken in his belief as to the contracting parties a knowledge of the mistake would be cheaply purchased by the journey  should he not he would send up to ethelberta the strong note of expostulation which was already written and waiting in his pocket  to intrude upon her at such a time was unseemly and to despatch a letter by a messenger before evidence of its necessity had been received was most undesirable  the whole proceeding at best was clumsy yet earnestness is mostly clumsy and how could he let the event pass without a protest  before daylight on that autumn morning he had risen told faith of his intention and started off  as soon as the vehicle was ready christopher hastened to the door and stepped up  the little stableboy led the horse a few paces on the way before relinquishing his hold at the same moment a respectably dressed man on foot with a small black bag in his hand came up from the opposite direction along the street leading from the railway  he was a thin elderly man with grey hair that a great anxiety pervaded him was as plainly visible as were his features  without entering the inn he came up at once to old john  have you anything going to knollsea this morning that i can get a lift in said the pedestrianno other than ethelbertas father  nothing empty that i know of  or carrier  no  a matter of fifteen shillings then i suppose  yesno doubt  but yond theres a young man just now starting he might not take it ill if ye were to ask him for a seat and go halves in the hire of the trap  shall i call out  ah do  the hostler bawled to the stableboy who put the question to christopher  there was room for two in the dogcart and julian had no objection to save the shillings of a fellowtraveller who was evidently not rich  when chickerel mounted to his seat christopher paused to look at him as we pause in some enactment that seems to have been already before us in a dream long ago  ethelbertas face was there as the landscape is in the map the romance in the history the aim in the deed denuded rayless and sorry but discernible  for the moment however this did not occur to julian  he took the whip the boy loosed his hold upon the horse and they proceeded on their way  what slapdash jinks may there be going on at knollsea then my sonny said the hostler to the lad as the dogcart and the backs of the two men diminished on the road  you be a knollsea boy have anything reached your young ears about whats in the wind there david straw  no nothing except that tis going to be christmas day in five weeks and then a hidebound bull is going to be killed if he dont die afore the time and gied away by my lord in threepound junks as a reward to good people who never curse and sing bad songs except when they be drunk mother says perhaps she will have some and tis excellent if well stewed mother says  a very fair chronicle for a boy to give but not what i asked for  when you try to answer a old mans question always bear in mind what it was that old man asked  a hidebound bull is good when well stewed i make no doubtfor they who like it but thats not it  what i said was do you know why three fokes a rich man a middling man and a poor man should want horses for knollsea afore seven oclock in the morning on a blinking day in fall when everything is as wet as a dishclout whereas thats more than often happens in fine summer weather  noi dont know john hostler  then go home and tell your mother that ye be no wideawake boy and that old john who went to school with her father afore she was born or thought o says so     chok it all why should i think theres sommat going on at knollsea  honest travelling have been so rascally abused since i was a boy in pinners by tribes of nobodies tearing from one end of the country to tother to see the sun go down in salt water or the moon play jacklantern behind some rotten tower or other that upon my song when life and deaths in the wind theres no telling the difference  i like their sixpences ever so much  young sonny dont you answer up to me when you baint in the storystopping my words in that fashion  i wont have it david  now up in the tallet with ye theres a good boy and down with another lock or two of hayas fast as you can do it for me  the boy vanished under the archway and the hostler followed at his heels  meanwhile the carriage bearing mr mountclere and sol was speeding on its way to enckworth  when they reached the spot at which the road forked into two they left the knollsea route and keeping thence under the hills for the distance of five or six miles drove into lord mountcleres park  in ten minutes the house was before them framed in by dripping trees  mountclere jumped out and entered without ceremony  sol being anxious to know if lord mountclere was there ordered the coachman to wait a few moments  it was now nearly eight oclock and the smoke which ascended from the newlylit fires of the court painted soft blue tints upon the brown and golden leaves of lofty boughs adjoining  o ethelberta said sol as he regarded the fair prospect  the gravel of the drive had been washed clean and smooth by the nights rain but there were fresh wheelmarks other than their own upon the track  yet the mansion seemed scarcely awake and stillness reigned everywhere around  not more than three or four minutes had passed when the door was opened for mountclere and he came hastily from the doorsteps  i must go on with you he said getting into the vehicle  hes gone  whereto knollsea said sol  yes said mountclere  now go ahead to knollsea he shouted to the man  to think i should be fooled like this  i had no idea that he would be leaving so soon  we might perhaps have been here an hour earlier by hard striving  but who was to dream that he would arrange to leave it at such an unearthly time of the morning at this dark season of the year  drivedrive he called again out of the window and the pace was increased  i have come two or three miles out of my way on account of you said sol sullenly  and all this time lost  i dont see why you wanted to come here at all  i knew it would be a waste of time  damn it all man said mountclere it is no use for you to be angry with me  i think it is for tis you have brought me into this muddle said sol in no sweeter tone  ha ha  upon my life i should be inclined to laugh if i were not so much inclined to do the other thing at bertas trick of trying to make close family allies of such a cantankerous pair as you and i  so much of one mind as we be so alike in our ways of living so close connected in our callings and principles so matched in manners and customs twould be a thousand pities to part ushey mr mountclere  mountclere faintly laughed with the same hideous merriment at the same idea and then both remained in a withering silence meant to express the utter contempt of each for the other both in family and in person  they passed the lodge and again swept into the highroad  drive on said mountclere putting his head again out of the window and shouting to the man  drive like the devil he roared again a few minutes afterwards in fuming dissatisfaction with their rate of progress  baint i doing of it said the driver turning angrily round  i aint going to ruin my governors horses for strangers who wont pay double for emnot i  i am driving as fast as i can  if other folks get in the way with their traps i suppose i must drive round em sir  there was a slight crash  there continued the coachman  thats what comes of my turning round  sol looked out on the other side and found that the forewheel of their carriage had become locked in the wheel of a dogcart they had overtaken the road here being very narrow  their coachman who knew he was to blame for this mishap felt the advantage of taking time by the forelock in a case of accusation and began swearing at his victim as if he were the sinner  sol jumped out and looking up at the occupants of the other conveyance saw against the sky the back elevation of his father and christopher julian sitting upon a little seat which they overhung like two big puddings upon a small dish  fatherwhat you going said sol  is it about berta that youve come  yes i got your letter said chickerel and i felt i should like to comethat i ought to come to save her from what shell regret  luckily this gentleman a stranger to me has given me a lift from anglebury or i must have hired  he pointed to christopher  but hes mr julian said sol  you are mrs petherwins fatheri have travelled in your company without knowing it exclaimed christopher feeling and looking both astonished and puzzled  at first it had appeared to him that in direct antagonism to his own purpose her friends were favouring ethelbertas wedding but it was evidently otherwise  yes thats father said sol  father this is mr julian  mr julian this gentleman here is lord mountcleres brotherand to cut the story short we all wish to stop the wedding  then let us get on in heavens name said mountclere  you are the ladys father  i am said chickerel  then you had better come into this carriage  we shall go faster than the dogcart  now driver are the wheels right again  chickerel hastily entered with mountclere sol joined them and they sped on  christopher drove close in their rear not quite certain whether he did well in going further now that there were plenty of people to attend to the business but anxious to see the end  the other three sat in silence with their eyes upon their knees though the clouds were dispersing and the morning grew bright  in about twenty minutes the square unembattled tower of knollsea church appeared below them in the vale its summit just touching the distant line of sea upon sky  the element by which they had been victimized on the previous evening now smiled falsely to the low morning sun  they descended the road to the village at a little more mannerly pace than that of the earlier journey and saw the rays glance upon the hands of the church clock which marked fiveandtwenty minutes to nine     45 knollseathe road thenceenckworth   all eyes were directed to the churchgate as the travellers descended the hill  no wedding carriages were there no favours no slatternly group of women brimming with interest no aged pauper on two sticks who comes because he has nothing else to do till dying time no nameless female passing by on the other side with a laugh of indifference no ringers taking off their coats as they vanish up a turret no hobbledehoys on tiptoe outside the chancel windowsin short none whatever of the customary accessories of a country wedding was anywhere visible  thank god said chickerel  wait till you know he deserves it said mountclere  nothings done yet between them  it is not likely that anything is done at this time of day  but i have decided to go to the church first  you will probably go to your relatives house at once  sol looked to his father for a reply  no i too shall go to the church first just to assure myself said chickerel  i shall then go on to mrs petherwins  the carriage was stopped at the corner of a steep incline leading down to the edifice  mountclere and chickerel alighted and walked on towards the gates sol remaining in his place  christopher was some way off descending the hill on foot having halted to leave his horse and trap at a small inn at the entrance to the village  when chickerel and mountclere reached the churchyard gate they found it slightly open  the churchdoor beyond it was also open but nobody was near the spot  we have arrived not a minute too soon however said mountclere preparations have apparently begun  it was to be an early wedding no doubt  entering the building they looked around it was quite empty  chickerel turned towards the chancel his eye being attracted by a red kneeling cushion placed at about the middle of the altarrailing as if for early use  mountclere strode to the vestry somewhat at a loss how to proceed in his difficult task of unearthing his brother obtaining a private interview with him and then by the introduction of sol and chickerel causing a general convulsion  ha heres somebody he said observing a man in the vestry  he advanced with the intention of asking where lord mountclere was to be found  chickerel came forward in the same direction  are you the parish clerk said mountclere to the man who was dressed up in his best clothes  i hev the honour of that calling the man replied  two large books were lying before him on the vestry table one of them being open  as the clerk spoke he looked slantingly on the page as a person might do to discover if some writing were dry  mountclere and chickerel gazed on the same page  the book was the marriageregister  too late said chickerel  there plainly enough stood the signatures of lord mountclere and ethelberta  the viscounts was very black and had not yet dried  her strokes were firm and comparatively thick for a womans though paled by juxtaposition with her husbands muddled characters  in the space for witnesses names appeared in trembling lines as fine as silk the autograph of picotee the second name being that of a stranger probably the clerk  yes yeswe are too late it seems said mountclere coolly  who could have thought theyd marry at eight  chickerel stood like a man baked hard and dry  further than his first two words he could say nothing  they must have set about it early upon my soul mountclere continued when did the wedding take place he asked of the clerk sharply  it was over about five minutes before you came in replied that luminary pleasantly as he played at an invisible game of pitchandtoss with some halfsovereigns in his pocket  i received orders to have the church ready at five minutes to eight this morning though i knew nothing about such a thing till bedtime last night  it was very private and plain not that i should mind another such a one sir and he secretly pitched and tossed again  meanwhile sol had found himself too restless to sit waiting in the carriage for more than a minute after the other two had left it  he stepped out at the same instant that christopher came past and together they too went on to the church  father ought we not to go on at once to ethelbertas instead of waiting said sol on reaching the vestry still in ignorance  twas no use in coming here  no use at all said chickerel as if he had straw in his throat  look at this  i would almost sooner have had it that in leaving this church i came from her gravewell no perhaps not that but i fear it is a bad thing  sol then saw the names in the register christopher saw them and the man closed the book  christopher could not well command himself and he retired  i knew it  i always said that pride would lead berta to marry an unworthy man and so it has said sol bitterly  what shall we do now ill see her  do no such thing young man said mountclere  the best course is to leave matters alone  they are married  if you are wise you will try to think the match a good one and be content to let her keep her position without inconveniencing her by your intrusions or complaints  it is possible that the satisfaction of her ambition will help her to endure any few surprises to her propriety that may occur  she is a clever young woman and has played her cards adroitly  i only hope she may never repent of the game  ahem  good morning  saying this mountclere slightly bowed to his relations and marched out of the church with dignity but it was told afterwards by the coachman who had no love for mountclere that when he stepped into the fly and was as he believed unobserved he was quite overcome with fatuous rage his lips frothing like a mug of hot ale  what an impertinent gentleman tis said chickerel  as if we had tried for her to marry his brother  he knows better than that said sol  but hell never believe that berta didnt lay a trap for the old fellow  he thinks at this moment that lord mountclere has never been told of us and our belongings  i wonder if she has deceived him in anything murmured chickerel  i can hardly suppose it  but she is altogether beyond me  however if she has misled him on any point she will suffer for it  you need not fear that father  it isnt her way of working  why couldnt she have known that when a title is to be had for the asking the owner must be a shocking one indeed  the title is well enough  any poor scrubs in our place must be fools not to think the match a very rare and astonishing honour as far as the position goes  but that my brave girl will be miserable is a part of the honour i cant stomach so well  if he had been any other lord in the kingdom we might have been merry indeed  i believe he will ruin her happinessyes i donot by any personal snubbing or rough conduct but by other things causing her to be despised and that is a thing she cant endure  shes not to be despised without a deal of troublewe must remember that  and if he insults her by introducing new favourites as they say he did his first wife ill call upon him and ask his meaning and take her away  nonsensewe shall never know what he does or how she feels she will never let out a word  however unhappy she may be she will always deny itthats the unfortunate part of such marriages  an old chap like that ought to leave young women alone damn him  the clerk came nearer  i am afraid i cannot allow bad words to be spoke in this sacred pile he said  as far as my personal self goes i should have no objection to your cussing as much as you like but as a official of the church my conscience wont allow it to be done  your conscience has allowed something to be done that cussing and swearing are godly worship to  the prettiest maid is left out of harness however said the clerk the little witness was the chicken to my tastelord forgive me for saying it and a man with a wife and family  sol and his father turned to withdraw and soon forgot the remark but it was frequently recalled by christopher  do you think of trying to see ethelberta before you leave said sol  certainly not said chickerel  mr mountcleres advice was good in that  the more we keep out of the way the more good we are doing her  i shall go back to anglebury by the carrier and get on at once to london you will go with me i suppose  the carrier does not leave yet for an hour or two  i shall walk on and let him overtake me  if possible i will get one glimpse of enckworth court bertas new home there may be time if i start at once  i will walk with you said sol  there is room for one with me said christopher  i shall drive back early in the afternoon  thank you said sol  i will endeavour to meet you at corvsgate  thus it was arranged  chickerel could have wished to search for picotee and learn from her the details of this mysterious matter  but it was particularly painful to him to make himself busy after the event and to appear suddenly and uselessly where he was plainly not wanted to appear would be an awkwardness which the pleasure of seeing either daughter could scarcely counterbalance  hence he had resolved to return at once to town and there await the news together with the detailed directions as to his own future movements carefully considered and laid down which were sure to be given by the farseeing ethelberta  sol and his father walked on together chickerel to meet the carrier just beyond enckworth sol to wait for christopher at corvsgate  his wish to see in company with his father the outline of the seat to which ethelberta had been advanced that day was the triumph of youthful curiosity and interest over dogged objection  his fathers wish was based on calmer reasons  christopher lone and out of place remained in the church yet a little longer  he desultorily walked round  reaching the organ chamber he looked at the instrument and was surprised to find behind it a young man  julian first thought him to be the organist on second inspection however he proved to be a person christopher had met before under far different circumstances it was our young friend ladywell looking as sick and sorry as a lily with a slug in its stalk  the occasion the place and their own condition made them kin christopher had despised ladywell ladywell had disliked christopher but a third item neutralized the other twoit was their common lot  christopher just nodded for they had only met on ethelbertas stairs ladywell nodded more and spoke  the church appears to be interesting he said  yes  such a tower is rare in england said christopher  they then dwelt on other features of the building thence enlarging to the village and then to the rocks and marine scenery both avoiding the malady they suffered fromthe marriage of ethelberta  the village streets are very picturesque and the cliff scenery is good of its kind rejoined ladywell  the rocks represent the feminine side of grandeur  here they are white with delicate tops  on the west coast they are higher black and with angular summits  those represent grandeur in its masculine aspect  it is merely my own idea and not very bright perhaps  it is very ingenious said christopher and perfectly true  ladywell was pleased  i am here at present making sketches for my next subjecta winter sea  otherwise i should not havehappened to be in the church  you are acquainted with mrs petherwini think you are mr ladywell who painted her portrait last season  yes said ladywell colouring  you may have heard her speak of mr julian  o yes said ladywell offering his hand  then by degrees their tongues wound closer round the subject of their sadness each tacitly owning to what he would not tell  i saw it said ladywell heavily  did she look troubled  not in the leastbright and fresh as a may morning  she has played me many a bitter trick and poor neigh too a friend of mine  but i cannot help forgiving her     i saw a carriage at the door and strolled in the ceremony was just proceeding so i sat down here  well i have done with knollsea  the place has no further interest for me now  i may own to you as a friend that if she had not been living here i should have studied at some other coastof course thats in confidence  i understand quite  i only arrived in the neighbourhood two days ago and did not set eyes upon her till this morning she has kept so entirely indoors  then the young men parted and halfanhour later the ingenuous ladywell came from the visitors inn by the shore a man walking behind him with a quantity of artists materials and appliances  he went on board the steamer which this morning had performed the passage in safety ethelberta single having been the loadstone in the cliffs that had attracted ladywell hither ethelberta married was the negative pole of the same sending him away  and thus did a woman put an end to the only opportunity of distinction on artexhibition walls that ever offered itself to the tortuous ways quaint alleys and marbled bluffs of knollsea as accessories in the picture of a winter sea  christophers interest in the village was of the same evaporating nature he looked upon the sea and the great swell and the waves sending up a sound like the huzzas of multitudes but all the wild scene was irksome now  the oceanbound steamers far away on the horizon inspired him with no curiosity as to their destination the house ethelberta had occupied was positively hateful and he turned away to wait impatiently for the hour at which he had promised to drive on to meet sol at corvsgate  sol and chickerel plodded along the road in order to skirt enckworth before the carrier came up  reaching the top of a hill on their way they paused to look down on a peaceful scene  it was a park and wood glowing in all the matchless colours of late autumn parapets and pediments peering out from a central position afar  at the bottom of the descent before them was a lodge to which they now descended  the gate stood invitingly open  exclusiveness was no part of the owners instincts one could see that at a glance  no appearance of a wellrolled gardenpath attached to the parkdrive as is the case with many betokening by the perfection of their surfaces their proprietors deficiency in hospitality  the approach was like a turnpike road full of great ruts clumsy mendings bordered by trampled edges and incursions upon the grass at pleasure  butchers and bakers drove as freely herein as peers and peeresses  christening parties wedding companies and funeral trains passed along by the doors of the mansion without check or question  a wild untidiness in this particular has its recommendations for guarded grounds ever convey a suspicion that their owner is young to landed possessions as religious earnestnesss implies newness of conversion and conjugal tenderness recent marriage  halfanhour being wanting as yet to chickerels time with the carrier sol and himself like the rest of the world when at leisure walked into the extensive stretch of grass and grove  it formed a park so large that not one of its owners had ever wished it larger not one of its owners rivals had ever failed to wish it smaller and not one of its owners satellites had ever seen it without praise  they somewhat avoided the roadway passing under the huge misshapen ragged trees and through fern brakes ruddy and crisp in their decay  on reaching a suitable eminence the father and son stood still to look upon the manychimneyed building or rather conglomeration of buildings to which these groves and glades formed a setting  we will just give a glance said chickerel and then go away  it dont seem well to me that ethelberta should have this it is too much the sudden change will do her no good  i never believe in anything that comes in the shape of wonderful luck  as it comes so it goes  had she been brought home today to one of those tenantfarms instead of these woods and walls i could have called it good fortune  what she should have done was glorify herself by glorifying her own line of life not by forsaking that line for another  better have been admired as a governess than shunned as a peeress which is what she will be  but it is just the same everywhere in these days  young men will rather wear a black coat and starve than wear fustian and do well  one man to want such a monstrous house as that  well tis a fine place  see theres the carpenters shops the timberyard and everything as if it were a little town  perhaps berta may hire me for a job now and then  i always knew she would cut herself off from us  she marked for it from childhood and she has finished the business thoroughly  well it is no matter father for why should we want to trouble her she may write and i shall answer but if she calls to see me i shall not return the visit and if she meets me with her husband or any of her new society about her i shall behave as a stranger  it will be best said chickerel  well now i must move  however by the sorcery of accident before they had very far retraced their steps an open carriage became visible round a bend in the drive chickerel with a servants instinct was for beating a retreat  no said sol  let us stand our ground  we have already been seen and we do no harm  so they stood still on the edge of the drive and the carriage drew near it was a landau and the sun shone in upon lord mountclere with lady mountclere sitting beside him like abishag beside king david  very blithe looked the viscount for he rode upon a cherub today  she appeared fresh rosy and strong but dubious though if mien was anything she was a viscountess twice over  her dress was of a dovecoloured material with a bonnet to match a little tufted white feather resting on the top like a truceflag between the blood of noble and vassal  upon the cool grey of her shoulders hung a few locks of hair toned warm as fire by the sunshiny addition to its natural hue  chickerel instinctively took off his hat sol did the same  for only a moment did ethelberta seem uncertain how to act  but a solution to her difficulty was given by the face of her brother  there she saw plainly at one glance more than a dozen speeches would have toldfor sols features thoroughly expressed his intention that to him she was to be a stranger  her eyes flew to chickerel and he slightly shook his head  she understood them now  with a tear in her eye for her father and a sigh in her bosom for sol she bowed in answer to their salute her husband moved his hat and nodded and the carriage rolled on lord mountclere might possibly be making use of the fine morning in showing her the park and premises  chickerel with a moist eye now went on with his son towards the highroad  when they reached the lodge the lodgekeeper was walking in the sun smoking his pipe  good morning he said to chickerel  any rejoicings at the court today the butler inquired  quite the reverse  not a soul there  tisnt knowed anywhere at all  i had no idea of such a thing till he brought my lady here  not going off neither  theyve come home like the commonest couple in the land and not even the bells allowed to ring  they walked along the public road and the carrier came in view  father said sol i dont think ill go further with you  shes gone into the house and suppose she should run back without him to try to find us  it would be cruel to disappoint her  ill bide about here for a quarter of an hour in case she should  mr julian wont have passed corvsgate till i get there  well one or two of her old ways may be left in her still and it is not a bad thought  then you will walk the rest of the distance if you dont meet mr julian  i must be in london by the evening  any time tonight will do for me  i shall not begin work until tomorrow so that the four oclock train will answer my purpose  thus they parted and sol strolled leisurely back  the road was quite deserted and he lingered by the park fence  sol said a birdlike voice how did you come here  he looked up and saw a figure peering down upon him from the top of the park wall the ground on the inside being higher than the road  the speaker was to the expected ethelberta what the moon is to the sun a star to the moon  it was picotee  hullo picotee said sol  theres a little gate a quarter of a mile further on said picotee  we can meet there without your passing through the big lodge  ill be there as soon as you  sol ascended the hill passed through the second gate and turned back again when he met picotee coming forward under the trees  they walked together in this secluded spot  berta says she wants to see you and father said picotee breathlessly you must come in and make yourselves comfortable  she had no idea you were here so secretly and she didnt know what to do  fathers gone said sol  how vexed she will be  she thinks there is something the matterthat you are angry with her for not telling you earlier  but you will come in sol  no i cant come in said her brother  why not  it is such a big house you cant think  you need not come near the front apartments if you think we shall be ashamed of you in your working clothes  how came you not to dress up a bit sol  still berta wont mind it much  she says lord mountclere must take her as she is or he is kindly welcome to leave her  ah well  i might have had a word or two to say about that but the time has gone by for it worse luck  perhaps it is best that i have said nothing and she has had her way  no i shant come in picotee  father is gone and i am going too  o sol  we are rather put out at her acting like thisfather and i and all of us  she might have let us know about it beforehand even if she is a lady and we what we always was  it wouldnt have let her down so terrible much to write a line  she might have learnt something that would have led her to take a different step  but you will see poor berta  she has done no harm  she was going to write long letters to all of you today explaining her wedding and how she is going to help us all on in the world  sol paused irresolutely  no i wont come in he said  it would disgrace her for one thing dressed as i be more than that i dont want to come in  but i should like to see her if she would like to see me and ill go up there to that little fir plantation and walk up and down behind it for exactly halfanhour  she can come out to me there sol had pointed as he spoke to a knot of young trees that hooded a knoll a little way off  ill go and tell her said picotee  i suppose they will be off somewhere and she is busy getting ready  o no  they are not going to travel till next year  ethelberta does not want to go anywhere and lord mountclere cannot endure this changeable weather in any place but his own house  poor fellow  then you will wait for her by the firs  ill tell her at once  picotee left him and sol went across the glade     46 enckworth continuedthe anglebury highway   he had not paced behind the firs more than ten minutes when ethelberta appeared from the opposite side  at great inconvenience to herself she had complied with his request  ethelberta was trembling  she took her brothers hand and said is father then gone  yes said sol  i should have been gone likewise but i thought you wanted to see me  of course i did and him too  why did you come so mysteriously and i must say unbecomingly  i am afraid i did wrong in not informing you of my intention  to yourself you may have  father would have liked a word with you beforeyou did it  you both looked so forbidding that i did not like to stop the carriage when we passed you  i want to see him on an important matterhis leaving mrs doncastles service at once  i am going to write and beg her to dispense with a notice which i have no doubt she will do  hes very much upset about you  my secrecy was perhaps an error of judgment she said sadly  but i had reasons  why did you and my father come here at all if you did not want to see me  we did want to see you up to a certain time  you did not come to prevent my marriage  we wished to see you before the marriagei cant say more  i thought you might not approve of what i had done said ethelberta mournfully  but a time may come when you will approve  never  dont be harsh sol  a coronet covers a multitude of sins  a coronet good lordand you my sister  look at my hand  sol extended his hand  look how my thumb stands out at the root as if it were out of joint and that hard place inside there  did you ever see anything so ugly as that handa misshaped monster isnt he  that comes from the jackplane and my pushing against it day after day and year after year  if i were found drowned or buried dressed or undressed in fustian or in broadcloth folk would look at my hand and say that mans a carpenter  well now how can a man branded with work as i be be brother to a viscountess without something being wrong  of course theres something wrong in it or he wouldnt have married yousomething which wont be righted without terrible suffering  no no said she  you are mistaken  there is no such wonderful quality in a title in these days  what i really am is second wife to a quiet old country nobleman who has given up society  what more commonplace  my life will be as simple even more simple than it was before  berta you have worked to false lines  a creeping up among the useless lumber of our nation thatll be the first to burn if there comes a flare i never see such a deserter of your own lot as you be  but you were always like it berta and i am ashamed of ye  more than that a good woman never marries twice  you are too hard sol said the poor viscountess almost crying  ive done it all for you  even if i have made a mistake and given my ambition an ignoble turn dont tell me so now or you may do more harm in a minute than you will cure in a lifetime  it is absurd to let republican passions so blind you to fact  a family which can be honourably traced through history for five hundred years does affect the heart of a person not entirely hardened against romance  whether you like the peerage or no they appeal to our historical sense and love of old associations  i dont care for history  prophecy is the only thing can do poor men any good  when you were a girl you wouldnt drop a curtsey to em historical or otherwise and there you were right  but instead of sticking to such principles you must needs push up so as to get girls such as you were once to curtsey to you not even thinking marriage with a bad man too great a price to pay fort  a bad man  what do you mean by that  lord mountclere is rather old but hes worthy  what did you mean sol  nothinga mere sommat to say  at that moment picotee emerged from behind a tree and told her sister that lord mountclere was looking for her  well sol i cannot explain all to you now she said  i will send for you in london  she wished him goodbye and they separated picotee accompanying sol a little on his way  ethelberta was greatly perturbed by this meeting  after retracing her steps a short distance she still felt so distressed and unpresentable that she resolved not to allow lord mountclere to see her till the clouds had somewhat passed off it was but a bare act of justice to him to hide from his sight such a bridal mood as this  it was better to keep him waiting than to make him positively unhappy  she turned aside and went up the valley where the park merged in miles of wood and copse  she opened an iron gate and entered the wood casually interested in the vast variety of colours that the halffallen leaves of the season wore more much more occupied with personal thought  the path she pursued became gradually involved in bushes as well as trees giving to the spot the character rather of a coppice than a wood  perceiving that she had gone far enough ethelberta turned back by a path which at this point intersected that by which she had approached and promised a more direct return towards the court  she had not gone many steps among the hazels which here formed a perfect thicket when she observed a belt of holly bushes in their midst towards the outskirts of these an opening on her left hand directly led thence winding round into a clear space of greensward which they completely enclosed  on this isolated and mewed up bit of lawn stood a timberbuilt cottage having ornamental bargeboards balconettes and porch  it was an erection interesting enough as an experiment and grand as a toy but as a building contemptible  a blue gauze of smoke floated over the chimney as if somebody was living there round towards the side some empty hencoops were piled away while under the hollies were divers frameworks of wire netting and sticks showing that birds were kept here at some seasons of the year  being lady of all she surveyed ethelberta crossed the leafy sward and knocked at the door  she was interested in knowing the purpose of the peculiar little edifice  the door was opened by a woman wearing a clean apron upon a not very clean gown  ethelberta asked who lived in so pretty a place  miss gruchette the servant replied  but she is not here now  does she live here alone  yesexcepting myself and a fellowservant  oh  she lives here to attend to the pheasants and poultry because she is so clever in managing them  they are brought here from the keepers over the hill  her father was a fancier  miss gruchette attends to the birds and two servants attend to miss gruchette  well to tell the truth mm the servants do almost all of it  still thats what miss gruchette is here for  would you like to see the house it is pretty  the woman spoke with hesitation as if in doubt between the desire of earning a shilling and the fear that ethelberta was not a stranger  that ethelberta was lady mountclere she plainly did not dream  i fear i can scarcely stay long enough yet i will just look in said ethelberta  and as soon as they had crossed the threshold she was glad of having done so  the cottage internally may be described as a sort of boudoir extracted from the bulk of a mansion and deposited in a wood  the front room was filled with nicknacks curious worktables filigree baskets twisted brackets supporting statuettes in which the grotesque in every case ruled the design lovebirds in gilt cages french bronzes wonderful boxes needlework of strange patterns and other attractive objects  the apartment was one of those which seem to laugh in a visitors face and on closer examination express frivolity more distinctly than by words  miss gruchette is here to keep the fowls said ethelberta in a puzzled tone after a survey  yes  but they dont keep her  ethelberta did not attempt to understand and ceased to occupy her mind with the matter  they came from the cottage to the door where she gave the woman a trifling sum and turned to leave  but footsteps were at that moment to be heard beating among the leaves on the other side of the hollies and ethelberta waited till the walkers should have passed  the voices of two men reached herself and the woman as they stood  they were close to the house yet screened from it by the hollybushes when one could be heard to say distinctly as if with his face turned to the cottage  lady mountclere gone for good  i suppose so  haha  so come so go  the speakers passed on their backs becoming visible through the opening they appeared to be woodmen  what lady mountclere do they mean said ethelberta  the woman blushed  they meant miss gruchette  oha nickname  yes  why  the woman whispered why in a story of about two minutes length ethelberta turned pale  is she going to return she inquired in a thin hard voice  yes next week  you know her mm  no  i am a stranger  so much the better  i may tell you then that an old tale is flying about the neighbourhoodthat lord mountclere was privately married to another woman at knollsea this morning early  can it be true  i believe it to be true  and that she is of no family  of no family  indeed  then the lord only knows what will become of the poor thing there will be murder between em  between whom  her and the lady who lives here  she wont budge an inchnot she  ethelberta moved aside  a shade seemed to overspread the world the sky the trees and the objects in the foreground  she kept her face away from the woman and whispering a reply to her goodmorning passed through the hollies into the leafstrewn path  as soon as she came to a large trunk she placed her hands against it and rested her face upon them  she drew herself lower down lower lower till she crouched upon the leaves  aytis what father and sol meant  o heaven she whispered  she soon arose and went on her way to the house  her fair features were firmly set and she scarcely heeded the path in the concentration which had followed her paroxysm  when she reached the park proper she became aware of an excitement that was in progress there  ethelbertas absence had become unaccountable to lord mountclere who could hardly permit her retirement from his sight for a minute  but at first he had made due allowance for her eccentricity as a woman of genius and would not take notice of the halfhours desertion unpardonable as it might have been in other classes of wives  then he had inquired searched been alarmed he had finally sent menservants in all directions about the park to look for her  he feared she had fallen out of a window down a well or into the lake  the next stage of search was to have been drags and grapnels but ethelberta entered the house  lord mountclere rushed forward to meet her and such was her contrivance that he noticed no change  the searchers were called in ethelberta explaining that she had merely obeyed the wish of her brother in going out to meet him  picotee who had returned from her walk with sol was upstairs in one of the rooms which had been allotted to her  ethelberta managed to run in there on her way upstairs to her own chamber  picotee put your things on again she said  you are the only friend i have in this house and i want one badly  go to sol and deliver this message to himthat i want to see him at once  you must overtake him if you walk all the way to anglebury  but the train does not leave till four so that there is plenty of time  what is the matter said picotee  i cannot walk all the way  i dont think you will have to do thati hope not  he is going to stop at corvsgate to have a bit of lunch i might overtake him there if i must  yes  and tell him to come to the east passage door  it is that door next to the entrance to the stableyard  there is a little yewtree outside it  on second thoughts you dear must not come back  wait at corvsgate in the little inn parlour till sol comes to you again  you will probably then have to go home to london alone but do not mind it the worst part for you will be in going from the station to the crescent but nobody will molest you in a fourwheel cab you have done it before however he will tell you if this is necessary when he gets back  i can best fight my battles alone  you shall have a letter from me the day after tomorrow stating where i am  i shall not be here  but what is it so dreadful  nothing to frighten you  but she spoke with a breathlessness that completely nullified the assurance  it is merely that i find i must come to an explanation with lord mountclere before i can live here permanently and i cannot stipulate with him while i am here in his power  till i write goodbye  your things are not unpacked so let them remain here for the presentthey can be sent for  poor picotee more agitated than her sister but never questioning her orders went downstairs and out of the house  she ran across the shrubberies into the park and to the gate whereat sol had emerged some halfhour earlier  she trotted along upon the turnpike road like a lost doe crying as she went at the new trouble which had come upon berta whatever that trouble might be  behind her she heard wheels and the stepping of a horse but she was too concerned to turn her head  the pace of the vehicle slackened however when it was abreast of picotee and she looked up to see christopher as the driver  miss chickerel he said with surprise  picotee had quickly looked down again and she murmured yes  christopher asked what he could not help asking in the circumstances would you like to ride  i should be glad said she overcoming her flurry  i am anxious to overtake my brother sol  i have arranged to pick him up at corvsgate said christopher  he descended and assisted her to mount beside him and drove on again almost in silence  he was inclined to believe that some supernatural legerdemain had to do with these periodic impacts of picotee on his path she sat mute and melancholy till they were within halfamile of corvsgate  thank you she said then perceiving sol upon the road there is my brother i will get down now  he was going to ride on to anglebury with me said julian  picotee did not reply and sol turned round  seeing her he instantly exclaimed whats the matter picotee  she explained to him that he was to go back immediately and meet her sister at the door by the yew as ethelberta had charged her christopher knowing them so well was too much an interested member of the group to be left out of confidence and she included him in her audience  and what are you to do said sol to her  i am to wait at corvsgate till you come to me  i cant understand it sol muttered with a gloomy face  theres something wrong and it was only to be expected thats what i say mr julian  if necessary i can take care of miss chickerel till you come said christopher  thank you said sol  then i will return to you as soon as i can at the castle inn just ahead  tis very awkward for you to be so burdened by us mr julian but we are in a trouble that i dont yet see the bottom of  i know said christopher kindly  we will wait for you  he then drove on with picotee to the inn which was not far off and sol returned again to enckworth  feeling somewhat like a thief in the night he zigzagged through the park behind belts and knots of trees until he saw the yew dark and clear as if drawn in ink upon the fair face of the mansion  the way up to it was in a little cutting between shrubs the door being a private entrance sunk below the surface of the lawn and invisible from other parts of the same front  as soon as he reached it ethelberta opened it at once as if she had listened for his footsteps  she took him along a passage in the basement up a flight of steps and into a huge solitary chill apartment  it was the ballroom  spacious mirrors in gilt frames formed panels in the lower part of the walls the remainder being toned in sagegreen  in a recess between each mirror was a statue  the ceiling rose in a segmental curve and bore sprawling upon its face gilt figures of wanton goddesses cupids satyrs with tambourines drums and trumpets the whole ceiling seeming alive with them  but the room was very gloomy now there being little light admitted from without and the reflections from the mirrors gave a depressing coldness to the scene  it was a place intended to look joyous by night and whatever it chose to look by day  we are safe here said she  but we must listen for footsteps  i have only five minutes lord mountclere is waiting for me  i mean to leave this place come what may  why said sol in astonishment  i cannot tell yousomething has occurred  god has got me in his power at last and is going to scourge me for my bad doingsthats what it seems like  sol listen to me and do exactly what i say  go to anglebury hire a brougham bring it on as far as little enckworth you will have to meet me with it at one of the park gates later in the eveningprobably the west at halfpast seven  leave it at the village with the man come on here on foot and stay under the trees till just before six it will then be quite dark and you must stand under the projecting balustrade a little further on than the door you came in by  i will just step upon the balcony over it and tell you more exactly than i can now the precise time that i shall be able to slip out and where the carriage is to be waiting  but it may not be safe to speak on account of his closeness to mei will hand down a note  i find it is impossible to leave the house by daylighti am certain to be pursuedhe already suspects something  now i must be going or he will be here for he watches my movements because of some accidental words that escaped me  berta i shant have anything to do with this said sol  it is not right  i am only going to rouen to aunt charlotte she implored  i want to get to southampton to be in time for the midnight steamer  when i am at rouen i can negotiate with lord mountclere the terms on which i will return to him  it is the only chance i have of rooting out a scandal and a disgrace which threatens the beginning of my life here  my letters to him and his to me can be forwarded through you or through father and he will not know where i am  any woman is justified in adopting such a course to bring her husband to a sense of her dignity  if i dont go away now it will end in a permanent separation  if i leave at once and stipulate that he gets rid of her we may be reconciled  i cant help you you must stick to your husband  i dont like them or any of their sort barring about three or four for the reason that they despise me and all my sort  but ethelberta for all that ill play fair with them  no halfandhalf trimming business  you have joined em and rayed yourself against us and there youd better bide  you have married your man and your duty is towards him  i know what he is and so does father but if i were to help you to run away now i should scorn myself more than i scorn him  i dont care for that or for any such politics  the mountclere line is noble and how was i to know that this member was not noble too  as the representative of an illustrious family i was taken with him but as a mani must shun him  how can you shun him  you have married him  nevertheless i wont stay  neither law nor gospel demands it of me after what i have learnt  and if law and gospel did demand it i would not stay  and if you will not help me to escape i go alone  you had better not try any such wild thing  the creaking of a door was heard  o sol she said appealingly dont go into the question whether i am right or wrongonly remember that i am very unhappy  do help mei have no other person in the world to ask  be under the balcony at six oclock  say you willi must gosay you will  ill think said sol very much disturbed  there dont cry ill try to be under the balcony at any rate  i cannot promise more but ill try to be there  she opened in the panelling one of the oldfashioned concealed modes of exit known as jibdoors which it was once the custom to construct without architraves in the walls of large apartments so as not to interfere with the general design of the room  sol found himself in a narrow passage running down the whole length of the ballroom and at the same time he heard lord mountcleres voice within talking to ethelberta  sols escape had been marvellous as it was the viscount might have seen her tears  he passed down some steps along an area from which he could see into a row of servants offices among them a kitchen with a fireplace flaming like an altar of sacrifice  nobody seemed to be concerned about him there were workmen upon the premises and he nearly matched them  at last he got again into the shrubberies and to the side of the park by which he had entered  on reaching corvsgate he found picotee in the parlour of the little inn as he had directed  mr julian she said had walked up to the ruins and would be back again in a few minutes  sol ordered the horse to be put in and by the time it was ready christopher came down from the hill room was made for sol by opening the flap of the dogcart and christopher drove on  he was anxious to know the trouble and sol was not reluctant to share the burden of it with one whom he believed to be a friend  he told scrap by scrap the strange request of ethelberta  christopher though ignorant of ethelbertas experience that morning instantly assumed that the discovery of some concealed spectre had led to this precipitancy  when does she wish you to meet her with the carriage  probably at halfpast seven at the west lodge but that is to be finally fixed by a note she will hand down to me from the balcony  which balcony  the nearest to the yewtree  at what time will she hand the note  as the court clock strikes six she says  and if i am not there to take her instructions of course she will give up the idea which is just what i want her to do  christopher begged sol to go  whether ethelberta was right or wrong he did not stop to inquire  she was in trouble she was too clearheaded to be in trouble without good reason and she wanted assistance out of it but such was sols nature that the more he reflected the more determined was he in not giving way to her entreaty  by the time that they reached anglebury he repented having given way so far as to withhold a direct refusal  it can do no good he said mournfully  it is better to nip her notion in its beginning  she says she wants to fly to rouen and from there arrange terms with him  but it cant be doneshe should have thought of terms before  christopher made no further reply  leaving word at the red lion that a man was to be sent to take the horse of him he drove directly onwards to the station  then you dont mean to help her said julian when sol took the ticketsone for himself and one for picotee  i serve her best by leaving her alone said sol  i dont think so  she has married him  she is in distress  she has married him  sol and picotee took their seats picotee upbraiding her brother  i can go by myself she said in tears  do go back for berta sol  she said i was to go home alone and i can do it  you must not  it is not right for you to be hiring cabs and driving across london at midnight  berta should have known better than propose it  she was flurried  go sol  but her entreaty was fruitless  have you got your ticket mr julian said sol  i suppose we shall go together till we get near melchester  i have not got my ticket yetill be back in two minutes  the minutes went by and christopher did not reappear  the train moved off christopher was seen running up the platform as if in a vain hope to catch it  he has missed the train said sol  picotee looked disappointed and said nothing  they were soon out of sight  god forgive me for such a hollow pretence said christopher to himself but he would have been uneasy had he known i wished to stay behind  i cannot leave her in trouble like this  he went back to the red lion with the manner and movement of a man who after a lifetime of desultoriness had at last found something to do  it was now getting late in the afternoon  christopher ordered a onehorse brougham at the inn and entering it was driven out of the town towards enckworth as the evening shades were beginning to fall  they passed into the hamlet of little enckworth at halfpast five and drew up at a beer house at the end  jumping out here julian told the man to wait till he should return  thus far he had exactly obeyed her orders to sol  he hoped to be able to obey them throughout and supply her with the aid her brother refused  he also hoped that the change in the personality of her confederate would make no difference to her intention  that he was putting himself in a wrong position he allowed but time and attention were requisite for such analysis meanwhile ethelberta was in trouble  on the one hand was she waiting hopefully for sol on the other was sol many miles on his way to town between them was himself  he ran with all his might towards enckworth park mounted the lofty stone steps by the lodge saw the dark bronze figures on the piers through the twilight and then proceeded to thread the trees  among these he struck a light for a moment it was ten minutes to six  in another five minutes he was panting beneath the walls of her house  enckworth court was not unknown to christopher for he had frequently explored that spot in his sandbourne days  he perceived now why she had selected that particular balcony for handing down directions it was the only one round the house that was low enough to be reached from the outside the basement here being a little way sunk in the ground  he went close under turned his face outwards and waited  about a foot over his head was the stone floor of the balcony forming a ceiling to his position  at his back two or three feet behind was a blank wallthe wall of the house  in front of him was the misty park crowned by a sky sparkling with winter stars  this was abruptly cut off upward by the dark edge of the balcony which overhung him  it was as if some person within the room above had been awaiting his approach  he had scarcely found time to observe his situation when a human hand and portion of a bare arm were thrust between the balusters descended a little way from the edge of the balcony and remained hanging across the starlit sky  something was between the fingers  christopher lifted his hand took the scrap which was paper and the arm was withdrawn  as it withdrew a jewel on one of the fingers sparkled in the rays of a large planet that rode in the opposite sky  light steps retreated from the balcony and a window closed  christopher had almost held his breath lest ethelberta should discover him at the critical moment to be other than sol and mar her deliverance by her alarm  the still silence was anything but silence to him he felt as if he were listening to the clanging chorus of an oratorio  and then he could fancy he heard words between ethelberta and the viscount within the room they were evidently at very close quarters and dexterity must have been required of her  he went on tiptoe across the gravel to the grass and once on that he strode in the direction whence he had come  by the thick trunk of one of a group of aged trees he stopped to get a light just as the court clock struck six in loud long tones  the transaction had been carried out through her impatience possibly four or five minutes before the time appointed  the note contained in a shaken hand in which however the wellknown characters were distinguishable these words in pencil  at halfpast seven oclock  just outside the north lodge dont fail  this was the time she had suggested to sol as that which would probably best suit her escape if she could escape at all  she had changed the place from the west to the north lodgenothing else  the latter was certainly more secluded though a trifle more remote from the course of the proposed journey there was just time enough and none to spare for fetching the brougham from little enckworth to the lodge the village being two miles off  the few minutes gained by her readiness at the balcony were useful now  he started at once for the village diverging somewhat to observe the spot appointed for the meeting  it was excellently chosen the gate appeared to be little used the lane outside it was covered with trees and all around was silent as the grave  after this hasty survey by the wan starlight he hastened on to little enckworth  an hour and a quarter later a little brougham without lamps was creeping along by the park wall towards this spot  the leaves were so thick upon the unfrequented road that the wheels could not be heard and the horses pacing made scarcely more noise than a rabbit would have done in limping along  the vehicle progressed slowly for they were in good time  about ten yards from the park entrance it stopped and christopher stepped out  we may have to wait here ten minutes he said to the driver  and then shall we be able to reach anglebury in time for the up mailtrain to southampton  halfpast seven halfpast eight halfpast ninetwo hours  o yes sir easily  a young lady in the case perhaps sir  yes  well i hope shell be done honestly by even if she is of humble station  tis best and cheapest too in the long run  the coachman was apparently imagining the dove about to flit away to be one of the pretty maidservants that abounded in enckworth court such escapades as these were not unfrequent among them a fair face having been deemed a sufficient recommendation to service in that house without too close an inquiry into character since the death of the first viscountess  now then silence and listen for a footstep at the gate  such calmness as there was in the musicians voice had been produced by considerable effort  for his heart had begun to beat fast and loud as he strained his attentive ear to catch the footfall of a woman who could only be his illegally  the obscurity was as great as a starry sky would permit it to be  beneath the trees where the carriage stood the darkness was total     47 enckworth and its precinctsmelchester   to be wise after the event is often to act foolishly with regard to it and to preserve the illusion which has led to the event would frequently be a course that omniscience itself could not find fault with  reaction with ethelberta was complete and the more violent in that it threatened to be useless  sols bitter chiding had been the first thing to discompose her fortitude  it reduced her to a consciousness that she had allowed herself to be coerced in her instincts and yet had not triumphed in her duty  she might have pleased her family better by pleasing her tastes and have entirely avoided the grim irony of the situation disclosed later in the day  after the second interview with sol she was to some extent composed in mind by being able to nurse a definite intention  as momentum causes the narrowest wheel to stand upright a scheme fairly imbibed will give the weakest some power to maintain a position stoically  in the temporary absence of lord mountclere about six oclock she slipped out upon the balcony and handed down a note  to her relief a hand received it instantly  the hour and a half wanting to halfpast seven she passed with great effort  the main part of the time was occupied by dinner during which she attempted to devise some scheme for leaving him without suspicion just before the appointed moment  happily and as if by a providence there was no necessity for any such thing  a little while before the halfhour when she moved to rise from dinner he also arose tenderly begging her to excuse him for a few minutes that he might go and write an important note to his lawyer until that moment forgotten though the postman was nearly due  she heard him retire along the corridor and shut himself into his study his promised time of return being a quarter of an hour thence  five minutes after that memorable parting ethelberta came from the little door by the bush of yew well and thickly wrapped up from head to heels she skimmed across the park and under the boughs like a shade mounting then the stone steps for pedestrians which were fixed beside the park gates here as at all the lodges  outside and below her she saw an oblong shapeit was a brougham and it had been drawn forward close to the bottom of the steps that she might not have an inch further to go on foot than to this barrier  the whole precinct was thronged with trees half their foliage being overhead the other half under foot for the gardeners had not yet begun to rake and collect the leaves thus it was that her dress rustled as she descended the steps  the carriage door was held open by the driver and she entered instantly he shut her in and mounted to his seat  as they drove away she became conscious of another person inside  o solit is done she whispered believing the man to be her brother her companion made no reply  ethelberta familiar with sols moods of troubled silence did not press for an answer  it was indeed certain that sols assistance would have been given under a sullen protest even if unwilling to disappoint her he might well have been taciturn and angry at her course  they sat in silence and in total darkness  the road ascended an incline the horses tramp being still deadened by the carpet of leaves then the large trees on either hand became interspersed by a low brushwood of varied sorts from which a large bird occasionally flew in its fright at their presence beating its wings recklessly against the hard stems with force enough to cripple the delicate quills  it showed how deserted was the spot after nightfall  sol said ethelberta again  why not talk to me  she now noticed that her fellowtraveller kept his head and his whole person as snugly back in the corner out of her way as it was possible to do  she was not exactly frightened but she could not understand the reason  the carriage gave a quick turn and stopped  where are we now she said  shall we get to anglebury by nine  what is the time sol  i will see replied her companion  they were the first words he had uttered  the voice was so different from her brothers that she was terrified her limbs quivered  in another instant the speaker had struck a wax vesta and holding it erect in his fingers he looked her in the face  heeheehee  the laugher was her husband the viscount  he laughed again and his eyes gleamed like a couple of tarnished brass buttons in the light of the wax match  ethelberta might have fallen dead with the shock so terrible and hideous was it  yet she did not  she neither shrieked nor fainted but no poor january fieldfare was ever colder no icehouse more dank with perspiration than she was then  a very pleasant joke my dearheehee  and no more than was to be expected on this merry happy day of our lives  nobody enjoys a good jest more than i do i always enjoyed a jestheehee  now we are in the dark again and we will alight and walk  the path is too narrow for the carriage but it will not be far for you  take your husbands arm  while he had been speaking a defiant pride had sprung up in her instigating her to conceal every weakness  he had opened the carriage door and stepped out  she followed taking the offered arm  take the horse and carriage to the stables said the viscount to the coachman who was his own servant the vehicle and horse being also his the coachman turned the horses head and vanished down the woodland track by which they had ascended  the viscount moved on uttering private chuckles as numerous as a woodpeckers taps and ethelberta with him  she walked as by a miracle but she would walk  she would have died rather than not have walked then  she perceived now that they were somewhere in enckworth wood  as they went she noticed a faint shine upon the ground on the other side of the viscount which showed her that they were walking beside a wet ditch  she remembered having seen it in the morning it was a shallow ditch of mud she might push him in and run and so escape before he could extricate himself  it would not hurt him  it was her last chance  she waited a moment for the opportunity  we are one to one and i am the stronger she at last exclaimed triumphantly and lifted her hand for a thrust  on the contrary darling we are one to halfadozen and you considerably the weaker he tenderly replied stepping back adroitly and blowing a whistle  at once the bushes seemed to be animated in four or five places  john he said in the direction of one of them  yes my lord replied a voice from the bush and a keeper came forward  william  another man advanced from another bush  quite right  remain where you are for the present  is tomkins there  yes my lord said a man from another part of the thicket  you go and keep watch by the further lodge there are poachers about where is strongway  just below my lord  tell him and his brother to go to the west gate and walk up and down let them search round it among the trees inside  anybody there who cannot give a good account of himself to be brought before me tomorrow morning  i am living at the cottage at present  thats all i have to say to you  and turning round to ethelberta now dearest we will walk a little further if you are able  i have provided that your friends shall be taken care of  he tried to pull her hand towards him gently like a cat opening a door  they walked a little onward and lord mountclere spoke again with imperturbable goodhumour  i will tell you a story to pass the time away  i have learnt the art from youyour mantle has fallen upon me and all your inspiration with it  listen dearest  i saw a young man come to the house today afterwards i saw him cross a passage in your company  you entered the ballroom with him  that room is a treacherous place  it is panelled with wood and between the panels and the walls are passages for the servants opening from the room by doors hidden in the woodwork  lady mountclere knew of one of these and made use of it to let out her conspirator lord mountclere knew of another and made use of it to let in himself  his sight is not good but his ears are unimpaired  a meeting was arranged to take place at the west gate at halfpast seven unless a note handed from the balcony mentioned another time and place he heard it allheehee  when lady mountcleres confederate came for the note i was in waiting above and handed one down a few minutes before the hour struck confirming the time but changing the place  when lady mountclere handed down her note just as the clock was striking her confederate had gone and i was standing beneath the balcony to receive it  she dropped it into her husbands handshohohoho  lord mountclere ordered a brougham to be at the west lodge as fixed by lady mountcleres note  probably lady mountcleres friend ordered a brougham to be at the north gate as fixed by my note written in imitation of lady mountcleres hand  lady mountclere came to the spot she had mentioned and like a good wife rushed into the arms of her husbandhoohoohoohoohoo  as if by an ungovernable impulse ethelberta broke into laughter alsolaughter which had a wild unnatural sound it was hysterical  she sank down upon the leaves and there continued the fearful laugh just as before  lord mountclere became greatly frightened  the spot they had reached was a green space within a girdle of hollies and in front of them rose an ornamental cottage  this was the building which ethelberta had visited earlier in the day it was the petit trianon of enckworth court  the viscount left her side and hurried forward  the door of the building was opened by a woman  have you prepared for us as i directed  yes my lord tea and coffee are both ready  never mind that now  lady mountclere is ill come and assist her indoors  tell the other woman to bring wine and water at once  he returned to ethelberta  she was better and was sitting calmly on the bank  she rose without assistance  you may retire he said to the woman who had followed him and she turned round  when ethelberta saw the building she drew back quickly  where is the other lady mountclere she inquired  gone  she shall never returnnever  never  it was not intended that she should  that sounds well  lord mountclere we may as well compromise matters  i think so too  it becomes a lady to make a virtue of a necessity  it was stratagem against stratagem  mine was ingenious yours was masterly  accept my acknowledgment  we will enter upon an armed neutrality  no  let me be your adorer and slave again as ever  your beauty dearest covers everything  you are my mistress and queen  but here we are at the door  tea is prepared for us here  i have a liking for life in this cottage mode and live here on occasion  women attend to lady mountclere  the woman who had seen ethelberta in the morning was alarmed at recognizing her having since been informed officially of the marriage she murmured entreaties for pardon  they assisted the viscountess to a chair the door was closed and the wind blew past as if nobody had ever stood there to interrupt its flight        full of misgivings christopher continued to wait at the north gate  half past seven had long since been past and no ethelberta had appeared  he did not for the moment suppose the delay to be hers and this gave him patience having taken up the position he was induced by fidelity to abide by the consequences  it would be only a journey of two hours to reach anglebury station he would ride outside with the driver put her into the train and bid her adieu for ever  she had cried for help and he had heard her cry  at last through the trees came the sound of the court clock striking eight and then for the first time a doubt arose in his mind whether she could have mistaken the gate  she had distinctly told sol the west lodge her note had expressed the north lodge  could she by any accident have written one thing while meaning another  he entered the carriage and drove round to the west gate  all was as silent there as at the other the meeting between ethelberta and lord mountclere being then long past and he drove back again  he left the carriage and entered the park on foot approaching the house slowly  all was silent the windows were dark moping sounds came from the trees and sky as from sorrow whispering to night  by this time he felt assured that the scheme had miscarried  while he stood here a carriage without lights came up the drive it turned in towards the stableyard without going to the door  the carriage had plainly been empty  returning across the grass by the way he had come he was startled by the voices of two men from the road hard by  have ye zeed anybody  not a soul  shall we go across again  whats the good lets home to supper  my lord must have heard somebody or a wouldnt have said it  perhaps hes nervous now hes living in the cottage again  i thought that fancy was over  well im glad tis a young wife hes brought us shell have her routs and her rackets as well as the highborn ones youll see as soon as she gets used to the place  she must be a queer christian to pick up with him  well if sheve charity tis enough for we poor men her faith and hope may be as please god  now i be for onalong homeward  as soon as they had gone christopher moved from his hiding and avoiding the gravelwalk returned to his coachman telling him to drive at once to anglebury  julian was so impatient of the futility of his adventure that he wished to annihilate its existence  on reaching anglebury he determined to get on at once to melchester that the event of the night might be summarily ended to be still in the neighbourhood was to be still engaged in it  he reached home before midnight  walking into their house in a quiet street as dissatisfied with himself as a man well could be who still retained health and an occupation he found faith sitting up as usual  his news was simple the marriage had taken place before he could get there and he had seen nothing of either ceremony or viscountess  the remainder he reserved for a more convenient season  edith looked anxiously at him as he ate supper smiling now and then  well i am tired of this life said christopher  so am i said faith  ah if we were only rich  ah yes  or if we were not rich she said turning her eyes to the fire  if we were only slightly provided for it would be better than nothing  how much would you be content with kit  as much as i could get  would you be content with a thousand a year for both of us  i daresay i should he murmured breaking his bread  or five hundred for both  or five hundred  or even three hundred  bother three hundred  less than double the sum would not satisfy me  we may as well imagine much as little  faiths countenance had fallen  o kit she said you always disappoint me  i do  how do i disappoint you this time  by not caring for three hundred a yeara hundred and fifty eachwhen that is all i have to offer you  faith said he looking up for the first time  ahof course  lucys will  i had forgotten  it is true and i had prepared such a pleasant surprise for you and now you dont care  our cousin lucy did leave us something after all  i dont understand the exact total sum but it comes to a hundred and fifty a year eachmore than i expected though not so much as you deserved heres the letter  i have been dwelling upon it all day and thinking what a pleasure it would be and it is not after all  good gracious faith i was only supposing  the real thing is another matter altogether  well the idea of lucys will containing our names  i am sure i would have gone to the funeral had i known  i wish it were a thousand  o noit doesnt matter at all  but certainly three hundred for two is a tantalizing sum not enough to enable us to change our condition and enough to make us dissatisfied with going on as we are  we must forget we have it and let it increase  it isnt enough to increase much  we may as well use it  but how  take a bigger housewhats the use  give up the organthen i shall be rather worse off than i am at present  positively it is the most provoking amount anybody could have invented had they tried ever so long poor lucy to do that and not even to come near us when father died     ah i know what well do  well go abroadwell live in italy     sequel angleburyenckworthsandbourne   two years and a half after the marriage of ethelberta and the evening adventures which followed it a man young in years though considerably older in mood and expression walked up to the red lion inn at anglebury  the anachronism sat not unbecomingly upon him and the voice was precisely that of the christopher julian of heretofore  his way of entering the inn and calling for a conveyance was more offhand than formerly he was much less afraid of the sound of his own voice now than when he had gone through the same performance on a certain chill evening the last time that he visited the spot  he wanted to be taken to knollsea to meet the steamer there and was not coming back by the same vehicle  it was a very different day from that of his previous journey along the same road different in season different in weather and the humour of the observer differed yet more widely from its condition then than did the landscape from its former hues  in due time they reached a commanding situation upon the road from which were visible knots and plantations of trees on the enckworth manor  christopher broke the silence  lord mountclere is still alive and well i am told  o ay  hell live to be a hundred  never such a change as has come over the man of late years  indeed  o tis my lady  shes a one to put up with  still tis said here and there that marrying her was the best days work that he ever did in his life although shes got to be my lord and my lady both  is she happy with him  she is very sharp with the pore manabout happy i dont know  he was a goodnatured old man for all his sins and would sooner any day lay out money in new presents than pay it in old debts  but tis altered now tisnt the same place  ah in the old times i have seen the floor of the servants hall over the vamp of your boot in solid beer that we had poured aside from the horns because we couldnt see straight enough to pour it in  see  no we couldnt see a hole in a ladder  and now even at christmas or whitsuntide when a man if ever he desires to be overcome with a drop would naturally wish it to be you can walk out of enckworth as straight as you walked in  all her doings  then she holds the reins  she do  there was a little tussle at first but how could a old man hold his own against such a spry young body as that  she threatened to run away from him and kicked up bobsadying and i dont know what all and being the woman of course she was sure to beat in the long run pore old nobleman she marches him off to church every sunday as regular as a clock makes him read family prayers that havent been read in enckworth for the last thirty years to my certain knowledge and keeps him down to three glasses of wine a day strict so that you never see him any the more generous for liquor or a bit elevated at all as it used to be  there tis true it has done him good in one sense for they say hed have been dead in five years if he had gone on as he was going  so that shes a good wife to him after all  well if she had been a little worse twould have been a little better for him in one sense for he would have had his own way more  but he was a curious feller at one time as we all know and i suppose tis as much as he can expect but tis a strange reverse for him  it is said that when hes asked out to dine or to anything in the way of a jaunt his eye flies across to hers afore he answers and if her eye says yes he says yes and if her eye says no he says no  tis a sad condition for one who ruled womankind as he that a woman should lead him in a string whether he will or no  sad indeed  shes steward and agent and everything  she has got a room called my ladys office and great ledgers and cashbooks you never see the like in old times there were bailiffs to look after the workfolk foremen to look after the tradesmen a buildingsteward to look after the foremen a landsteward to look after the buildingsteward and a dashing grand agent to look after the landsteward fine times they had then i assure ye  my lady said they were eating out the property like a honeycomb and then there was a terrible row  half of em were sent flying and now theres only the agent and the viscountess and a sort of surveyor man and of the three she does most work so tis said  she marks the trees to be felled settles what horses are to be sold and bought and is out in all winds and weathers  there if somebody hadnt looked into things twould soon have been all up with his lordship he was so very extravagant  in one sense twas lucky for him that she was born in humble life because owing to it she knows the ins and outs of contriving which he never did  then a man on the verge of bankruptcy will do better to marry a poor and sensible wife than a rich and stupid one  well here we are at the tenth milestone  i will walk the remainder of the distance to knollsea as there is ample time for meeting the last steamboat  when the man was gone christopher proceeded slowly on foot down the hill and reached that part of the highway at which he had stopped in the cold november breeze waiting for a woman who never came  he was older now and he had ceased to wish that he had not been disappointed  there was the lodge and around it were the trees brilliant in the shining greens of june  every twig sustained its bird and every blossom its bee  the roadside was not muffled in a garment of dead leaves as it had been then and the lodgegate was not open as it always used to be  he paused to look through the bars  the drive was well kept and gravelled the grass edgings formerly marked by hoofs and ruts and otherwise trodden away were now green and luxuriant bent sticks being placed at intervals as a protection  while he looked through the gate a woman stepped from the lodge to open it  in her haste she nearly swung the gate into his face and would have completely done so had he not jumped back  i beg pardon sir she said on perceiving him  i was going to open it for my lady and i didnt see you  christopher moved round the corner  the perpetual snubbing that he had received from ethelberta ever since he had known her seemed about to be continued through the medium of her dependents  a trotting accompanied by the sound of light wheels had become perceptible and then a vehicle came through the gate and turned up the road which he had come down  he saw the back of a basket carriage drawn by a pair of piebald ponies  a lad in livery sat behind with folded arms the driver was a lady  he saw her bonnet her shoulders her hairbut no more  she lessened in his gaze and was soon out of sight  he stood a long time thinking but he did not wish her his  in this wholesome frame of mind he proceeded on his way thankful that he had escaped meeting her though so narrowly  but perhaps at this remote season the embarrassment of a rencounter would not have been intense  at knollsea he entered the steamer for sandbourne  mr chickerel and his family now lived at firtop villa in that place a house which like many others had been built since julians last visit to the town  he was directed to the outskirts and into a fir plantation where drives and intersecting roads had been laid out and where new villas had sprung up like mushrooms  he entered by a swing gate on which firtop was painted and a maidservant showed him into a neatly furnished room containing mr chickerel mrs chickerel and picotee the matron being reclined on a couch which improved health had permitted her to substitute for a bed  he had been expected and all were glad to see again the sojourner in foreign lands even down to the ladylike tabby who was all purr and warmth towards him except when she was all claws and nippers  but had the prime sentiment of the meeting shown itself it would have been the unqualified surprise of christopher at seeing how much picotees face had grown to resemble her sisters it was less a resemblance in contours than in expression and tone  they had an early tea and then mr chickerel sitting in a patriarchal chair conversed pleasantly with his guest being well acquainted with him through other members of the family  they talked of julians residence at different italian towns with his sister of faith who was at the present moment staying with some old friends in melchester and as was inevitable the discourse hovered over and settled upon ethelberta the prime ruler of the courses of them all with little exception through recent years  it was a hard struggle for her said chickerel looking reflectively out at the fir trees  i never thought the girl would have got through it  when she first entered the house everybody was against her  she had to fight a whole host of them singlehanded  there was the viscounts brother other relations lawyers ladies servants not one of them was her friend and not one who wouldnt rather have seen her arrive there in evil relationship with him than as she did come  but she stood her ground  she was put upon her mettle and one by one they got to feel there was somebody among them whose little finger if they insulted her was thicker than a mountcleres loins  she must have had a will of iron it was a situation that would have broken the hearts of a dozen ordinary women for everybody soon knew that we were of no family and thats what made it so hard for her  but there she is as mistress now and everybody respecting her  i sometimes fancy she is occasionally too severe with the servants and i know what service is  but she says it is necessary owing to her birth and perhaps she is right  i suppose she often comes to see you  four or five times a year said picotee  she cannot come quite so often as she would said mrs chickerel because of her lofty position which has its juties  well as i always say berta doesnt take after me  i couldnt have married the man even though he did bring a coronet with him  i shouldnt have cared to let him ask ye said chickerel  however thats neither here nor thereall ended better than i expected  hes fond of her  and it is wonderful what can be done with an old man when you are his darling said mrs chickerel  if i were berta i should go to london oftener said picotee to turn the conversation  but she lives mostly in the library  and o what do you think  she is writing an epic poem and employs emmeline as her reader  dear me  and how are sol and dan  you mentioned them once in your letters said christopher  berta has set them up as builders in london  she bought a business for them said chickerel  but sol wouldnt accept her help for a long time and now he has only agreed to it on condition of paying her back the money with interest which he is doing they have just signed a contract to build a hospital for twenty thousand pounds  picotee broke inyou knew that both gwendoline and cornelia married two years ago and went to queensland  they married two brothers who were farmers and left england the following week  georgie and myrtle are at school  and joey  we are thinking of making joseph a parson said mrs chickerel  indeed a parson  yes tis a genteel living for the boy  and hes talents that way since he has been under masters he knows all the strange sounds the old romans and greeks used to make by way of talking and the love stories of the ancient women as if they were his own  i assure you mr julian if you could hear how beautiful the boy tells about little cupid with his bow and arrows and the rows between that pagan apostle jupiter and his wife because of another woman and the handsome young gods who kissed venus youd say he deserved to be made a bishop at once  the evening advanced and they walked in the garden  here by some means picotee and christopher found themselves alone  your letters to my sister have been charming said christopher  and so regular too  it was as good as a birthday every time one arrived  picotee blushed and said nothing  christopher had full assurance that her heart was where it always had been  a suspicion of the fact had been the reason of his visit here to day  other letters were once written from england to italy and they acquired great celebrity  do you know whose  walpoles said picotee timidly  yes but they never charmed me half as much as yours  you may rest assured that one person in the world thinks walpole your second  you should not have read them they were not written to you  but i suppose you wished to hear of ethelberta  at first i did said christopher  but oddly enough i got more interested in the writer than in her news  i dont know if ever before there has been an instance of loving by means of letters  if not it is because there have never been such sweet ones written  at last i looked for them more anxiously than faith  you see you knew me before  picotee would have withdrawn this remark if she could fearing that it seemed like a suggestion of her love long ago  then on my return i thought i would just call and see you and go away and think what would be best for me to do with a view to the future  but since i have been here i have felt that i could not go away to think without first asking you what you think on one pointwhether you could ever marry me  i thought you would ask that when i first saw you  did you  why  you looked at me as if you would  well continued christopher the worst of it is i am as poor as job faith and i have three hundred a year between us but only half is mine so that before i get your promise i must let your father know how poor i am  besides what i mention i have only my earnings by music  but i am to be installed as chief organist at melchester soon instead of deputy as i used to be which is something  i am to have five hundred pounds when i marry  that was lord mountcleres arrangement with ethelberta  he is extremely anxious that i should marry well  thats unfortunate  a marriage with me will hardly be considered well  o yes it will said picotee quickly and then looked frightened  christopher drew her towards him and imprinted a kiss upon her cheek at which picotee was not so wretched as she had been some years before when he mistook her for another in that performance  berta will never let us come to want she said with vivacity when she had recovered  she always gives me what is necessary  we will endeavour not to trouble her said christopher amused by picotees utter dependence now as ever upon her sister as upon an eternal providence  however it is well to be kin to a coach though you never ride in it  now shall we go indoors to your father  you think he will not object  i think he will be very glad replied picotee  berta will i know
