tranquillity and decay  appendix i appendix ii appendix iii appendix iv appendix v appendix vi appendix vii appendix viii      preface   during the decade between 1879 and 1889 i was engaged in a detailed study of wordsworth and amongst other things edited a library edition of his poetical works in eight volumes including the prefaces and appendices to his poems and a few others of his prose works such as his description of the scenery of the lakes in the north of england this edition was published by mr paterson edinburgh at intervals between the years 1882 and 1886 and it was followed in 1889 by a life of wordsworth in three volumes which was a continuation of the previous eight  the present edition is not a reproduction of those eleven volumes of 18829 it is true that to much of the editorial material included in the latteras well as in my memorials of coleorton and in the english lake district as interpreted in the poems of wordsworthi can add little that is new but the whole of what was included in these books has been revised corrected and readjusted in this one 1 errata in the previous volumes are corrected several thousand new notes have been added many of the old ones are entirely recast the changes of text introduced by wordsworth into the successive editions of his poems have all been revised new readingsderived from many ms sourceshave been added while the chronological order of the poems has in several instances been changed in the light of fresh evidence  the distinctive features of my edition of 18826 were stated in the preface to its first volume so far as these features remain in the present edition they may be repeated as follows  first the poems are arranged in chronological order of composition not of publication in all the collective editions issued by wordsworth during his lifetime the arrangement of his poems in artificial groups based on their leading characteristicsa plan first adopted in 1815was adhered to although he not unfrequently transferred a poem from one group to another here they are printed with one or two exceptions to be afterwards explained in the order in which they were written  second the changes of text made by wordsworth in the successive editions of his poems are given in footnotes with the dates of the changes  third suggested changes written by the poet on a copy of the stereotyped edition of 18367long kept at rydal mount and bought after mrs wordsworths death at the sale of a portion of the library at the mountare given in footnotes  fourth the notes dictated by wordsworth to miss isabella fenwicka dear friend of the rydal mount household and a woman of remarkable character and facultywhich tell the story of his poems and the circumstances under which each was written are printed in full  fifth topographical notesexplanatory of allusions made by wordsworth to localities in the lake district of england to places in scotland somersetshire yorkshire the isle of man and others on the continent of europeare given either at the close of the poem in which the allusions occur or as footnotes to the passages they illustrate  sixth several complete poems and other fragments of verse not included in any edition of his works published during wordsworths lifetime or since are printed as an appendix to volume viii  seventh a new bibliography of the poems and prose works and of the several editions issued in england and america from 1793 to 1850 is added  eighth a new life of the poet is given  these features of the edition of 18826 are preserved in that of 1896 and the following are added  first the volumes are published not in library 8vo size butas the works of every poet should be issuedin one more convenient to handle and to carry eight volumes are devoted to the poetical works and among them are included those fragments by his sister dorothy and others which wordsworth published in his lifetime among his own poems they are printed in the chronological order of composition so far as that is known  second in the case of each poem any note written by wordsworth himself as explanatory of it comes first and has the initials w w with the date of its first insertion placed after it next follows the fenwick note within square brackets thus   and signed i f and afterwards any editorial note required when however wordsworths own notes were placed at the end of the poems or at the foot of the page his plan is adopted and the date appended i should have been glad had it been possiblethe editors of the twentieth century may note thisto print wordsworths own notes the fenwick notes and the editors in different type and in type of a decreasing size but the idea occurred to me too late i e after the first volume had been passed for press  third all the prose works of wordsworth are given in full and follow the poems in two volumes the prose works were collected by dr grosart and published in 1876 extracts from them have since been edited by myself and others but they will now be issued like the poems in chronological order under their own titles and with such notes as seem desirable  fourth all the journals written by dorothy wordsworth at alfoxden dove cottage and elsewhere as well as her record of tours with her brother in scotland on the continent etc are publishedsome of them in full others only in part an explanation of why any journal is curtailed will be found in the editorial note preceding it much new material will be found in these journals  fifth the letters of william and dorothy wordsworthwith a few from mary and dora wordsworthare arranged chronologically and published by themselves hitherto these letters have been scattered in many quartersin the late bishop of lincolns memoirs of his uncle in the diary reminiscences and correspondence of henry crabb robinson in the memorials of coleorton and my own life of the poet in the prose works in the transactions of the wordsworth society in the letters of charles lamb in the memorials of thomas de quincey and other volumes but many more both of wordsworths and his sisters have never before seen the light more than a hundred and fifty letters from dorothy wordsworth to mrs clarkson the wife of the great slaveliberator were sent to me some time ago by mrs arthur tennyson a relative of mrs clarkson and i have recently seen and been allowed to copy wordsworths letters to his early friend francis wrangham through the kindness of their late owner mr mackay of the grange trowbridge many other letters of great interest have recently reached me  sixth in addition to a new bibliography and a chronological table of the poems and the prose works a bibliography of wordsworth criticism is appended it includes most of the articles on the poet and notices of his works which have appeared in great britain america and the continent of europe under this head i have specially to thank mrs henry a st john of ithaca ny a devoted transatlantic wordsworthian who has perhaps done more than any onesince henry reedto promote the study of her favourite poet in america mrs st johns wordsworth collection is unique and her knowledge and enthusiasm are as great as her industry has been professor e legouis of the university of lyonswho wrote an interesting book on wordsworths friend le général michel beaupuy 1891has sent me material from france which will be found in its proper place frau professor gothein of bonn who has translated many of wordsworths poems into german and written his life william wordsworth sein leben seine werke seine zeitgenossen 1893 has similarly helped me in reference to german criticism  seventh as the poets letters and his sisters journals will appear in earlier volumes the new life of wordsworth will be much shorter than that which was published in 1889 in three volumes 8vo it will not exceed a single volume  eighth in the edition of 18826 each volume contained an etching of a locality associated with wordsworth the drawings were made by john mwhirter ra in watercolour and they were afterwards etched by mr c o murray one portrait by haydon was prefixed to the first volume of the life in each volume of this editionpoems prose works journals letters and lifethere will be a new portrait either of the poet or his wife or sister or daughter and also a small vignette of a place associated with or memorialised by wordsworth in some way the following will be the arrangement    vol     portraits  vignettes   the poems     i  w wordsworth by w shuter

h manesse the portraits with many others will be described in detail in a subsequent volume  in all editorial notes the titles given by wordsworth to his poems are invariably printed in italics not with inverted commas before and after as wordsworth himself so often printed them and when he gave no title to a poem its first line will be invariably placed within inverted commas this plan of using italics and not roman letters applies also to the title of any book referred to by wordsworth or by his sister in her journals whether they put the title in italics or within commas it is always italicised in this edition  a subsidiary matter such as this becomes important when one finds that many editors of parts of the works of wordsworth or of selections from them have invented titles of their own and have sent their volumes to press without the slightest indication to their readers that the titles were not wordsworths mixing up their own notion of what best described the contents of the poem or the letter with those of the writer some have suppressed wordsworths and put their own title in its place others have contented themselves more modestly with inventing a title when wordsworth gave none i do not object to these titles in themselves several such as those by archbishop trench are suggestive and valuable what i object to is that any editorno matter whoshould mingle his own titles with those of the poet and give no indication to the reader as to which is which dr grosart has been so devoted a student of wordsworth and we owe him so much that one regrets to find in the prose works of wordsworth 1876 the following title given to his letter to the bishop of llandaff apology for the french revolution it is interesting to know that dr grosart thought this a useful description of the letter but a clear indication should have been given that it was not wordsworths it is true that in the general preface to his volumes dr grosart takes upon himself the responsibility for this title but it should not have been printed as the title in chief or as the headline to the text similarly with the titles of the second and third of the three essays on epitaphs  as students of wordsworth know he issued a volume in 1838 containing all his sonnets then written and at the close of that edition he added the six sonnets annexed were composed as this volume was going through the press but too late for insertion in the class of miscellaneous ones to which they belong in 1884 archbishop trench edited the sonnets with an admirable introductory essay on the history of the english sonnet but while wordsworth gave no title to the 3rd and the 4th of the six composed as the volume was going through the presseither in his edition of 1838 or in any subsequent issue of his poemshis editor did so he gave what are really excellent titles but he does not tell us that they are his own he calls them respectively the thrush at twilight and the thrush at dawn possibly wordsworth would have approved of both of those titles but that they are not his should have been indicated  i do not think it wise from an editorial point of view even to print in a chronological tableas professor dowden has done in his admirable aldine editiontitles which were not wordsworths without some indication to that effect but in the case of selections from wordsworthsuch as those of mr hawes turner and mr a j symingtonevery one must feel that the editor should have informed his readers when the title was wordsworths and when it was his own coinage in the case of a much greater manand one of wordsworths most illustrious successors in the great hierarchy of english poesy matthew arnoldit may be asked why should he have put margaret or the ruined cottage as the title of a poem written in 17957 when wordsworth never once published it under that name it was an extract from the first book of the excursionwritten it is true in these early yearsbut only issued as part of the latter poem first published in 1814  the question of the number the character and the length of the notes which a wise editor should append to the works of a great poet or to any classic is perhaps still sub judice my own opinion is that in all editorial work the notes should be illustrative rather than critical and that they should only bring out those points which the ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand if the poems were not annotated for this reason topographical historical and antiquarian notes are almost essential the notes which wordsworth himself wrote to his poems are of unequal length and merit it was perhaps necessary for him to writeat all events it is easy to understand and to sympathise with his writingthe long note on the revered parson of the duddon valley the rev robert walker who will be remembered for many generations as the wonderful walker the poets editors have also been occasionally led to add digressive notes to clear up points which had been left by himself either dubious or obscure i must plead guilty to the charge of doing so eg the identification of the muccawiss see the excursion book iii l 953 with the whippoorwill involved a great deal of laborious correspondence years ago it was a question of real difficulty and although the result reached could now be put into two or three lines i have thought it desirable that the opinions of those who wrote about it and helped toward the solution should be recorded what i print is only a small part of the correspondence that took place  on the other hand it would be quite out of place in a note to the famous passage in the 4th book of the excursion beginning     i have seen   a curious child applying to his ear  to enter on a discussion as to the extent of wordsworths debtif anyto the author of gebir it is quite sufficient to print the relative passage from landors poem at the foot of the page  all the notes written by wordsworth himself in his numerous editions will be found in this one with the date of their first appearance added slight textual changes however or casual addenda are not indicated unless they are sufficiently important changes in the text of notes have not the same importance to posterity as changes in the text of poems in the preface to the prose works reference will be made to wordsworths alterations of his text at present i refer only to his own notes to his poems when they were written as footnotes to the page they remain footnotes still when they were placed by him as prefaces to his poems they retain that place in this edition but when they were appendix notesas eg in the early editions of lyrical balladsthey are now made footnotes to the poems they illustrate in such a case however as the elaborate note to the excursion containing a reprint of the essay upon epitaphsoriginally contributed to the friendit is transferred to the prose works to which it belongs by priority of date and as it would be inexpedient to print it twice over it is omitted from the notes to the excursion  as to the place which notes to a poets works should occupy there is no doubt that numerous and lengthy oneshowever valuable or even necessary by way of illustrationdisfigure the printed page and some prefer that they should be thrown all together at the end of each volume or at the close of a series such asin wordsworths casethe river duddon ecclesiastical sonnets the prelude the white doe of rylstone etc i do not think however that many care to turn repeatedly to the close of a series of poems or the end of a volume to find an explanatory note helped only by an index number and when perhaps even that does not meet his eye at the foot of the page i do not find that even ardent wordsworth students like to search for notes in appendices and perhaps the more ardent they are the less desirable is it for them thus to hunt the waterfalls  i have the greatest admiration for the work which professor dowden has done in his edition of wordsworth but the plan which he has followed in his aldine edition of giving not only the fenwick notes but all the changes of text introduced by wordsworth into his successive editions in additional editorial notes at the end of each volumeto understand which the reader must turn the pages repeatedly from text to note and note to text forwards and backwards at times distractinglyis for practical purposes almost unworkable the reader who examines notes critically is ever one among a thousand even if they are printed at the foot of the page and meet the eye readily if they are consigned to the realm of addenda they will be read by very few and studied by fewer  to those who object to notes being thrust into view as it must be admitted that they are in this editionbecause it disturbs the pleasure of the reader who cares for the poetry of wordsworth and for the poetry alonei may ask how many persons have read the fenwick notes given together in a series and mixed up heterogeneously with wordsworths own notes to his poems in comparison with those who have read and enjoyed them in the editions of 1857 and 1863 professor dowden justifies his plan of relegating the fenwick and other notes to the end of each volume of his edition on the ground that students of the poet must take the trouble of hunting to and fro for such things i greatly doubt if many who have read and profitedfor they could not but profitby a perusal of professor dowdens work have taken that trouble or that future readers of the aldine edition will take it  to refer somewhat more in detail to the features of this edition   first as to the chronological order of the poems  the chief advantage of a chronological arrangement of the works of any authorand especially of a poet who himself adopted a different planis that it shows us as nothing else can do the growth of his own mind the progressive development of his genius and imaginative power by such a redistribution of what he wrote we can trace the rise the culmination and alsoit may bethe decline and fall of his genius wordsworths own arrangementfirst adopted in the edition of 1815was designed by him with the view of bringing together in separate classes those poems which referred to the same or similar subjects or which were supposed to be the product of the same or a similar faculty irrespective of the date of composition thus one group was entitled poems of the fancy another poems of the imagination a third poems proceeding from sentiment and reflection a fourth epitaphs and elegiac pieces again poems on the naming of places memorials of tours ecclesiastical sonnets miscellaneous sonnets etc the principle which guided him in this was obvious enough it was in some respects a most natural arrangement and in now adopting a chronological order the groups which he constructed with so much care are broken up probably every author would attach more importance to a classification of his works which brought them together under appropriate headings irrespective of date than to a method of arrangement which exhibited the growth of his own mind and it may be taken for granted that posterity would not think highly of any author who attached special value to this latter element none the less posterity may wish to trace the gradual development of genius in the imaginative writers of the past by the help of such a subsequent rearrangement of their works  there are difficulties however in the way of such a rearrangement some of which in wordsworths case cannot be entirely surmounted in the case of itinerary sonnets referring to the same subject the dismemberment of a seriescarefully arranged by their authorseems to be specially unnatural but wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle if there was a fitness in collecting all his sonnets in one volume in the year 1838 out of deference to the wishes of his friends in order that these poems might be brought under the eye at oncethus removing them from their original places in his collected worksit seems equally fitting now to rearrange them chronologically as far as it is possible to do so it will be seen that it is not always possible  then there is the case of two poems following each other in wordsworths own arrangement by natural affinity such as the epistle to sir george beaumont written in 1811 which in almost all existing editions is followed by the poem written in 1841 and entitled upon perusing the foregoing epistle thirty years after its composition or the dedication to the white doe of rylstone written in april 1815 while the poem itself was written in 1807 to separate these poems seems unnatural and as it would be inadmissible to print the second of the two twice overonce as a sequel to the first poem and again in its chronological placeadherence to the latter plan has its obvious disadvantage in the case of these poems  mr aubrey de vere is very desirous that i should arrange all the poems dedicated to national independence and liberty together in series as wordsworth left them on the principle that though the order of publication should as a rule be the order of composition in poetry all rules require as well as admit of exceptions as i have the greatest respect for the judgment of such an authority as mr de vere i may explain that i only venture to differ from him because there are seventyfour poemsincluding the sonnets and odesin this series and because they cover a period ranging from 1802 to 1815 i am glad however that many of these sonnets can be printed together especially the earlier ones of 1802  after carefully weighing every consideration it has seemed to me desirable to adopt the chronological arrangement in this particular edition in which an attempt is made to trace the growth of wordsworths genius as it is unfolded in his successive works his own arrangement of his poems will always possess a special interest and value and it is not likely ever to be entirely superseded in subsequent issues of his works the editors and publishers of the future may possibly prefer it to the plan now adopted and it will commend itself to many readers from the mere fact that it was wordsworths own but in an edition such as the presentwhich is meant to supply material for the study of the poet to those who may not possess or have access to the earlier and rarer editionsno method of arrangement can be so good as the chronological one its importance will be obvious after several volumes are published when the point referred to aboveviz the evolution of the poets geniuswill be shown by the very sequence of the subjects chosen and their method of treatment from year to year  the date of the composition of wordsworths poems cannot always be ascertained with accuracy and to get at the chronological order it is not sufficient to take up his earlier volumes and thereafter to note the additions made in subsequent ones we now know approximately when each poem was first published although in some instances they appeared in newspapers and magazines and in many cases publication was long after the date of composition for example guilt and sorrow or incidents upon salisbury plainwritten in the years 179194was not published in extenso till 1842 the tragedy of the borderers composed in 179596 was also first published in 1842 the preludecommenced in the beginning of the year 1799 and completed in the summer of 1805was published posthumously in 1850 and some unpublished poemsboth of early and late yearswere first issued in 1886 a poem was frequently kept back from some doubt as to its worth or from a wish to alter and amend it of the five or six hundred sonnets that he wrote wordsworth said most of them were frequently retouched and not a few laboriously some poems were almost entirely recast and occasionally fugitive verses were withheld from publication for a time because it was hoped that they would subsequently form part of a larger whole  in the case of many of the poems we are left to conjecture the date of composition although we are seldom without some clue to it the fenwick notes are a great assistance in determining the chronology these noteswhich will be afterwards more fully referred towere dictated by wordsworth to miss fenwick in the year 1843 but at that time his memory could not be absolutely trusted as to dates and in some instances we know it to have been at fault for example he said of the old cumberland beggar that it was written at racedown and alfoxden in my twentythird year now he went to racedown in the autumn of 1795 when he was twentyfive years old and to alfoxden in the autumn of 1797 when twentyseven again the poem rural architecture is put down in the fenwick note as written at townend in 1801 but it had been published in 1800 in the second edition of lyrical ballads similarly wordsworth gave the dates 1801 or 1802 for the reverie of poor susan which had also appeared in lyrical ballads 1800  wordsworths memory was not always to be trusted even when he was speaking of a group of his own poems for example in the edition of 1807 there is a short series described thus poems composed during a tour chiefly on foot they are numbered 1 2 3 4 5 now one would naturally suppose that all the poems in this set of five were composed during the same pedestrian tour and that they all referred to the same time but the series contains alice fell 1802 beggars 1802 to a skylark 1805 and resolution and independence 1802  much more valuable than the fenwick notesfor a certain portion of wordsworths lifeis his sister dorothys journal the mistakes in the former can frequently be corrected from the minutely kept diary of those early years when the brother and sister lived together at grasmere the whole of that journal so far as it is desirable to print it for posterity will be given in a subsequent volume  long before the publication of the fenwick notes wordsworth himself supplied some data for a chronological arrangement of his works in the table of contents prefixed to the first collected edition of 1815 in two volumesand also to the second collected edition of 1820 in four volumesthere are two parallel columns one giving the date of composition and the other that of publication there are numerous blanks in the former column which was the only important one as the year of publication could be ascertained from the editions themselves sometimes the date is given vaguely as in the case of the sonnets dedicated to liberty where the note runs from the year 1807 to 1813 at other times the entry of the year of publication is inaccurate for example the inscription for the spot where the hermitage stood on st herberts island derwentwater is put down as belonging to the year 1807 but this poem does not occur in the volumes of 1807 but in the second volume of lyrical ballads 1800 it will thus be seen that it is only by comparing wordsworths own lists of the years to which his poems belong with the contents of the several editions of his works with the fenwick notes and with his sisters journal that we can approximately reconstruct the true chronology to these sources of information must be added the internal evidence of the poems themselves incidental references in letters to friends and stray hints gathered from various quarters  many new sources of information as to the date of the composition of the poems became known to me during the publication of my previous edition and after its issue the most important being the journals of dorothy wordsworth these discoveries showed that my chronological table of 1882although then relatively up to datewas incomplete the tables constructed by mr tutin and by professor dowden are both more accurate than it was it is impossible to attain to finality in such a matter and several facts afterwards discovered and mentioned in the later volumes of my previous edition have been used against the conclusions come to in the earlier ones i have thus supplied the feathers for a few subsequent critical arrows the shots have not been unkindly ones and i am glad of the result viz that our knowledge of the datesboth as to the composition and first publication of the poems is now much more exact than before when a conjectural one is given in this edition the fact is always mentioned  this chronological method of arrangement however has its limits it is not possible always to adopt it nor is it invariably necessary even in order to obtain a true view of the growth of wordsworths mind in thisas in so many other thingswisdom lies in the avoidance of extremes the extreme of rigid fidelity to the order of time on the one hand and the extreme of an irrational departure from it on the other while an effort has been made to discover the exact order of the composition of the poemsand this is shown not only in the chronological table but at the beginning of each separate poemit has been considered expedient to depart from that order in printing some of the poems in certain cases a poem was begun and laid aside and again resumed at intervals and it is difficult to know to what year the larger part of it should be assigned when we know the date at which a poem was commenced and that it was finished long afterwards but have no clue as to the year it is assigned to the year in which it was begun for example the address to kilchurn castle was begun in 1803 but only the first three lines were written then wordsworth tells us that the rest was added many years after but when we know not and the poem was not published till 1827 in such a case it is placed in this edition as if it belonged chronologically to 1803 and retains its place in the series of poems which memorialise the tour in scotland of that year on a similar principle the highland girl is placed in the same series although dorothy wordsworth tells us in her journal of the tour that it was composed not long after our return from scotland and glen almainalthough written afterwards at rydalretains its published place in the memorial group again the departure from the vale of grasmere august 1803 is prefixed to the same series although it was not written till 1811 and first published in 1827 to give symmetry to such a series it is necessary to depart from the exact chronological orderthe departure being duly indicated  on the same principle i have followed the address to the scholars of the village school of by its natural sequelby the side of the grave some years after the date of the composition of which is unknown and the epistle to sir george beaumont 1811 is followed by the later lines to which wordsworth gave the most prosaic titlehe was often infelicitous in his titlesupon perusing the foregoing epistle thirty years after its composition a like remark applies to the poem beggars which is followed by its own sequel although the order of date is disturbed while all the epitaphs translated from chiabrera are printed together  it is manifestly appropriate that the poems belonging to a seriessuch as the ecclesiastical sonnets or those referring to the duddonshould be brought together as wordsworth finally arranged them even although we may be aware that some of them were written subsequently and placed in the middle of the series the sonnets referring to aspects of christianity in americainserted in the 1845 and 184950 editions of the collected worksare found in no previous edition or version of the ecclesiastical sonnets these along with some others on the offices of the english liturgy were suggested to wordsworth by an american prelate bishop doane and by professor henry reed 2 but we do not know in what year they were written the ecclesiastical sonnetsfirst called ecclesiastical sketcheswere written in the years 182022 the above additions to them appeared twentyfive years afterwards but they ought manifestly to retain their place as arranged by wordsworth in the edition of 1845 the case is much the same with regard to the duddon sonnets they were first published in 1820 but no xiv beginning    o mountain stream the shepherd and his cot  was written in the year 1806 and appears in the edition of 1807 this sonnet will be printed in the series to which it belongs and not in its chronological place i think it would be equally unjust to remove it from the groupin which it helps to form a unityand to print it twice over 3 on the other hand the series of poems composed during a tour in scotland and on the english border in the autumn of 1831and first published in the year 1835 in the volume entitled yarrow revisited and other poemscontains two which wordsworth himself tells us were composed earlier and there is no reason why these poems should not be restored to their chronological place the series of itinerary sonnets published along with them in the yarrow volume of 1835 is the record of another scottish tour taken in the year 1833 and wordsworth says of them that they were composed or suggested during a tour in the summer of 1833 we cannot now discover which of them were written during the tour and which at rydal mount after his return but it is obvious that they should be printed in the order in which they were left by him in 1835 it may be noted that almost all the evening voluntaries belong to these years1832 to 1835when the author was from sixtytwo to sixtyfive years of age  wordsworths habit of revision may perhaps explain the mistakes into which he occasionally fell as to the dates of his poems and the difficulty of reconciling what he says as to the year of composition with the date assigned by his sister in her journal when he says written in 1801 or 1802 he may be referring to the last revision which he gave to his work certain it is however that he sometimes gave a date for the composition which was subsequent to the publication of the poem in question  in the case of those poems to which no date was attached i have tried to find a clue by which to fix an approximate one obviously it would not do to place all the undated poems in a class by themselves such an arrangement would be thoroughly artificial and while we are in many instances left to conjecture we can always say that such and such a poem was composed not later than a particular year when the precise date is undiscoverable i have thought it best to place the poem in or immediately before the year in which it was first published  poems which were several years in process of composition having been laid aside and taken up repeatedly eg the prelude which was composed between the years 1799 and 1805are placed in the year in which they were finished disputable questions as to the date of any poem are dealt with in the editorial note prefixed or appended to it  there is one poem which i have intentionally placed out of its chronological place viz the ode intimations of immortality from recollections of early childhood it was written at intervals from 1803 to 1806 and was first published in the edition of 1807 where it stood at the end of the second volume in every subsequent edition of the collected works1815 to 1850it closed the groups of poems the excursion only following it in a volume of its own this was an arrangement made by wordsworth of set purpose and steadily adhered tothe ode forming as it were the high altar of his poetic cathedral as he wished it to retain that place in subsequent editions of his works it retains it in this one  mr arnolds arrangement of the poems in his volume of selections 4 is extremely interesting and valuable but as to the method of grouping adopted i am not sure that it is better than wordsworths own as a descriptive title poems of sentiment and reflection is quite as good as poems akin to the antique and poems of the fancy quite as appropriate as poems of ballad form  wordsworths arrangement of his poems in groups was psychologically very interesting but it is open to many objections unfortunately wordsworth was not himself consistentin the various editions issued by himselfeither in the class into which he relegated each poem or the order in which he placed it there there is tantalising topsyturvyism in this so that an editor who adopts it is almost compelled to select wordsworths latest grouping which was not always his best  sir william rowan hamilton wrote to mr aubrey de vere in 1835 that dora wordsworth told him that her father was sometimes at a loss whether to refer her to the poems of the imagination or the poems of the fancy for some particular passage aubrey de vere himself considered wordsworths arrangement as a parade of system and wrote of it i cannot help thinking that in it he mistakes classification for method 5 i confess that it is often difficult to see why some of the poems were assigned by their author to the realm of the fancy the imagination and sentiment and reflection respectively in a note to the horn of egremont castle edition 1815 wordsworth speaks of it as referring to the imagination rather than as being produced by it and says that he would not have placed it amongst his poems of the imagination but to avoid a needless multiplication of classes and in the editions of 1827 and 1832 he actually included the great ode on immortality among his epitaphs and elegiac poems as late as 27th september 1845 he wrote to professor henry reed    following your example i e the example set in reeds american   edition of the poems i have greatly extended the class entitled   poems of the imagination thinking as you must have done that if   imagination were predominant in the class it was not indispensable   that it should pervade every poem which it contained limiting the   class as i had done before seemed to imply and to the uncandid or   observing did so that the faculty which is the primum mobile in   poetry had little to do in the estimation of the author with pieces   not arranged under that head i therefore feel much obliged to you for   suggesting by your practice the plan which i have adopted  could anything show more explicitly than this that wordsworth was not perfectly satisfied with his own artificial groups professor reed in his american edition of 1837 however acted on wordsworths expressed intention of distributing the contents of yarrow revisited and other poems amongst the classes he tells us that he interspersed the contents of this volume among the poems already arranged by wordsworth 6  it may also be mentioned that not only members of his own household but many of wordsworths friendsnotably charles lambexpressed a preference for a different arrangement of his poems from that which he had adopted   second the various readings or variations of text made by wordsworth during his lifetime or written by him on copies of his poems or discovered in ms letters from himself or his sister or his wife are given in footnotes in this edition few english poets changed their text more frequently or with more fastidiousness than wordsworth did he did not always alter it for the better every alteration however which has been discovered by me whether for the better or for the worse is here printed in full we have thus a record of the fluctuations of his own mind as to the form in which he wished his poems to appear and this record casts considerable light on the development of his genius 7  a knowledge of these changes of text can only be obtained in one or other of two ways either the reader must have access to all the thirtytwo editions of poems the publication of which wordsworth personally supervised or he must have all the changes in the successive editions exhibited in the form of footnotes and appended to the particular text that is selected and printed in the body of the work it is extremely difficultin some cases quite impossibleto obtain the early editions the great public libraries of the country do not possess them all8 it is therefore necessary to fall back upon the latter plan which seems the only one by which a knowledge of the changes of the text can be made accessible either to the general reader or to the special student of english poetry  the text whichafter much considerationi have resolved to place throughout in the body of the work is wordsworths own final textus receptus ie the text of 184950 reproduced in the posthumous edition of 1857 9 and since opinion will doubtless differ as to the wisdom of this selection it may be desirable to state at some length the reasons which have led me to adopt it  there are only three possible courses open to an editor who wishes to givealong with the text selectedall the various readings chronologically arranged as footnotes either 1st the earliest text may be taken or 2nd the latest may be chosen or 3rd the text may be selected from different editions so as to present each poem in its best state according to the judgment of the editor in whatever edition it is found a composite text made up from two or more editions would be inadmissible  now most persons who have studied the subject know that wordsworths best text is to be found in one poem in its earliest edition in another in its latest and in a third in some intermediate edition i cannot agree either with the statement that he always altered for the worse or that he always altered for the better his critical judgment was not nearly so unerring in this respect as coleridges was or as tennysons has been it may be difficult therefore to assign an altogether satisfactory reason for adopting either the earliest or the latest text and at first sight the remaining alternative plan may seem the wisest of the three there are indeed difficulties in the way of the adoption of any one of the methods suggested and as i adopt the latest textnot because it is always intrinsically the best but on other grounds to be immediately statedit may clear the way if reference be made in the first instance to the others and to the reasons for abandoning them  as to a selection of the text from various editions this would doubtless be the best plan were it a practicable one and perhaps it may be attainable some day but wordsworth is as yet too near us for such an editorial treatment of his works to be successful the fundamental objection to it is that scarcely two mindseven among the most competent of contemporary judgeswill agree as to what the best text is an edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be acceptable to more than a few persons of course no arrangement of any kind can escape adverse criticism it would be most unfortunate if it did but this particular edition would fail in its main purpose if questions of individual taste were made primary and not secondary and an arrangement which gave scope for the arbitrary selection of particular textsaccording to the wisdom or the want of wisdom of the editorwould deservedly meet with severe criticism in many quarters besides such a method of arrangement would not indicate the growth of the poets mind and the development of his genius if an editor wished to indicate his own opinion of the best text for each poemunder the idea that his judgment might be of some use to other peopleit would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal note than by printing his selected text in the main body of the work he could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the readings indicate his own preference and leave it to others to select what they preferred besides the compiler of such an edition would often find himself in doubt as to what the best text really was the merit of the different readings being sometimes almost equal or very nearly balanced and were he to endeavour to get out of the difficulty by obtaining the judgments of literary men or even of contemporary poets he would find that their opinions would in most cases be dissimilar if they did not openly conflict those who cannot come to a final decision as to their own text would not be likely to agree as to the merits of particular readings in the poems of their predecessors unanimity of opinion on this point is indeed quite unattainable  nevertheless it would be easy for an editor to show the unfortunate result of keeping rigorously either to the latest or to the earliest text of wordsworth if on the one hand the latest were taken it could be shown that many of the changes introduced into it were for the worse and some of them very decidedly so for example in the poem to a skylarkcomposed in 1825the second verse retained in the editions of 1827 1832 1836 and 1843 was unaccountably dropped out in the editions of 1845 and 1849 the following is the complete poem of 1825 as published in 1827     ethereal minstrel pilgrim of the sky   dost thou despise the earth where cares abound   or while the wings aspire are heart and eye   both with thy nest upon the dewy ground   thy nest which thou canst drop into at will   those quivering wings composed that music still    to the last point of vision and beyond   mount daring warbler that loveprompted strain   twixt thee and thine a neverfailing bond   thrills not the less the bosom of the plain   yet mightst thou seem proud privilege to sing   all independent of the leafy spring    leave to the nightingale her shady wood   a privacy of glorious light is thine   whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood   of harmony with rapture more divine   type of the wise who soar but never roam   true to the kindred points of heaven and home   there is no doubt that the first and third stanzas are the finest and some may respect the judgment that cut down the poem by the removal of its second verse but others will say if it was right that such a verse should be removed why were many others of questionable merit allowed to remain why was such a poem as the glowworm of the edition of 1807 never republished while the waterfall and the eglantine and to the spade of a friend were retained to give one other illustration where a score are possible in the sonnet belonging to the year 1807 beginning    beloved vale i said when i shall con  we find in the latest text the linesfirst adopted in 1827    i stood of simple shame the blushing thrall   so narrow seemed the brooks the fields so small  while the early edition of 1807 contains the far happier lines    to see the trees which i had thought so tall   mere dwarfs the brooks so narrow fields so small  on the other hand if the earliest text be invariably retained some of the best poems will be spoiled or the improvements lost since wordsworth did usually alter for the better for example few persons will doubt that the form in which the second stanza of the poem to the cuckoo written in 1802 appeared in 1845 is an improvement on all its predecessors i give the readings of 1807 1815 1820 1827 and 1845     while i am lying on the grass   i hear thy restless shout   from hill to hill it seems to pass   about and all about                        1807    while i am lying on the grass   thy loud note smites my ear   from hill to hill it seems to pass   at once far off and near                    1815    while i am lying on the grass   thy loud note smites my ear   it seems to fill the whole airs space   at once far off and near                    1820    while i am lying on the grass   thy twofold shout i hear   that seems to fill the whole airs space   as loud far off as near                     1827    while i am lying on the grass   thy twofold shout i hear   from hill to hill it seems to pass   at once far off and near                   1845   similarly in each of the three poems to the daisy composed in 1802 and in the afterthought to the duddon the alterations introduced into the latest editions were all improvements upon the early version  it might be urged that these considerations would warrant the interference of an editor and justify him in selecting the text which he thought the best upon the whole but this must be left to posterity when editors can escape the bias of contemporary thought and feeling when their judgments are refined by distance and mellowed by the new literary standards of the intervening yearswhen in fact wordsworth is as far away from his critics as shakespeare now isit may be possible to adjust a final text but the task is beyond the power of the present generation  it may farther be urged that if this reasoning be validand if for the present one text must be retained uniformly throughoutthe natural plan is to take the earliest and not the latest and this has some recommendations it seems more simple more natural and certainly the easiest we have a natural sequence if we begin with the earliest and go on to the latest readings then all the readers of wordsworth who care to possess or to consult the present edition will doubtless possess one or other of the complete copies of his works which contain his final text while probably not one in twenty have ever seen the first edition of any of his poems with the exception of the prelude it is true that if the reader turns to a footnote to compare the versions of different years while he is reading for the sake of the poetry he will be so distracted that the effect of the poem as a whole will be entirely lost because the critical spirit which judges of the text works apart from the spirit of sympathetic appreciation in which all poetry should be read but it is not necessary to turn to the footnotes and to mark what may be called the literary growth of a poem while it is being read for its own sake and these notes are printed in smaller type so as not to obtrude themselves on the eye of the reader  against the adoption of the earlier text there is this fatal objection that if it is to be done at all it must be done throughout and in the earliest poems wordsworth wroteviz an evening walk and descriptive sketchesthe subsequent alterations almost amounted to a cancelling of the earlier version his changes were all or almost all unmistakably for the better indeed there was little in these worksin the form in which they first appearedto lead to the belief that an original poet had arisen in england it is true that coleridge saw in them the signs of the dawn of a new era and wrote thus of descriptive sketches before he knew its author seldom if ever was the emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the literary horizon more evidently announced nevertheless the earliest text of these sketches is in many places so artificial prosaic and dull that its reproduction except as an appendix or in the form of footnotes would be an injustice to wordsworth 10 on the other hand the passages subsequently cancelled are so numerous and so long that if placed in footnotes the latter would in some instances be more extensive than the text the quarto of 1793 will therefore be reprinted in full as an appendix to the first volume of this edition the school exercise written at hawkshead in the poets fourteenth year will be found in vol viii passing over these juvenile efforts there are poemssuch as guilt and sorrow peter bell and many othersin which the earlier text is an inferior one which was either corrected or abandoned by wordsworth in his maturer years it would be a conspicuous blunder to printin the place of honourthe crude original which was afterwards repudiated by its author  it may be remembered in connection with wordsworths text that he himself said i am for the most part uncertain about my success in altering poems but in this case he is speaking of an insertion i am sure i have produced a great improvement memoirs of wordsworth vol i p 174 11 again in writing to mr dyce in 1830 you know what importance i attach to following strictly the last copy of the text of an author  it is also worthy of note that the study of their chronology casts some light on the changes which the poems underwent the second edition of lyrical ballads appeared in 1800 in that edition the text of 1798 is scarcely altered but in the year in which it was published wordsworth was engrossed with his settlement at grasmere and in the springtime of creative work he probably never thought of revising his earlier pieces in the year 1800 he composed at least twentyfive new poems the third edition of lyrical ballads appeared in 1802 and during that year he wrote fortythree new poems many of them amongst the most perfect of his lyrics his critical instinct had become much more delicate since 1800 and it is not surprising to findas we do findthat between the text of the lyrical ballads of 1800 and that of 1802 there are many important variations this is seen for example in the way in which he dealt with the female vagrant which is altered throughout its early redundance is pruned away and in many instances the final text sanctioned in 1845 had been adopted in 1803 without going into further detail it is sufficient to remark that in the year 1803 wordsworths critical faculty the faculty of censorship had developed almost step for step with the creative originality of his genius in that prolific year when week by week almost day by day fresh poems were thrown off with marvellous facilityas we see from his sisters journalhe had become a severe if not a fastidious critic of his own earlier work a further explanation of the absence of critical revision in the edition of 1800 may be found in the fact that during that year wordsworth was engaged in writing the preface to his poems which dealt in so remarkable a manner with the nature of poetry in general and with his own theory of it in particular  a further reference to the evening walk will illustrate wordsworths way of dealing with his earlier text in his later editions this poem showed from the first a minute observation of naturenot only in her external form and colour but also in her suggestivenessthough not in her symbolism and we also find the same transition from nature to man the same interest in rural life and the same lingering over its incidents that we see in his maturer poems nevertheless there is much that is conventional in the first edition of an evening walk published in 1793 i need only mention as a sample the use of the phrase silent tides to describe the waters of a lake when this poem was revised in the year 1815with a view to its insertion in the first edition of the collected workswordsworth merely omitted large portions of it and some of its best passages were struck out he scarcely amended the text at all in 1820 however he pruned and improved it throughout so that between this poem as recast in 1820 and reproduced almost verbatim in the next two editions of 1827 and 1832 and his happiest descriptions of nature in his most inspired moods there is no great difference but in 1836 he altered it still further in detail and in that state practically left it apparently not caring to revise it further in the edition of 1845 however there are several changes so far as i can judge there is one alteration for the worse and one only the reading in the edition of 1793    in these lone vales if aught of faith may claim   thin silver hairs and ancient hamlet fame   when up the hills as now retreats the light   strange apparitions mock the village sight  is better than that finally adopted    in these secluded vales if village fame   confirmed by hoary hairs belief may claim   when up the hills as now retired the light   strange apparitions mocked the shepherds sight  it will be seen however from the changes made in the text of this poem how wordsworths observation of nature developed how thoroughly dissatisfied he soon became with everything conventional and discarded every image not drawn directly or at first hand from nature  the text adopted in the present edition is for the reasons stated that which was finally sanctioned by wordsworth himself in the last edition of his poems 184950 the earlier readings occurring in previous editions are given in footnotes and it may be desirable to explain the way in which these are arranged it will be seen that whenever the text has been changed a date is given in the footnote before the other readings are added this date which accompanies the reference number of the footnote indicates the year in which the reading finally retained was first adopted by wordsworth the earlier readings then follow in chronological order with the year to which they belong 12 and it is in every case to be assumed that the last of the changes indicated was continued in all subsequent editions of the works no direct information is given as to how long a particular reading was retained or through how many editions it ran it is to be assumed however that it was retained in all intermediate editions till the next change of text is stated it would encumber the notes with too many figures if in every instance in which a change was made the corresponding state of the text in all the other editions was indicated but if no new reading follows the text quoted it is to be taken for granted that the reading in question was continued in every subsequent edition until the date which accompanies the reference figure  two illustrations will make this clear the first is a case in which the text was only altered once the second an instance in which it was altered six times in the evening walk the following lines occur    the dog loud barking mid the glittering rocks   hunts where his master points the intercepted flocks  and the footnote is as follows                                                    1836   that barking busy mid the glittering rocks   hunts where he points the intercepted flocks 1793  in the light of what has been said above and by reference to the bibliography it will be seen from these two dates that the original text of 1793given in the footnotewas continued in the editions of 1820 1827 and 1832 it was omitted from the extract of 1815 that it was changed in the year 1836 and that this reading was retained in the editions of 1843 1845 and 1849  again in simon lee the lines occur    but what to them avails the land   which he can till no longer  and the following are the footnotes                                         1845   but what avails the land to them   which they can till no longer       1798    but what saith he avails the land   which i can till no longer          1827    but what avails it now the land   which he can till no longer         1832    tis his but what avails the land   which he can till no longer         1837    the time alas is come when he   can till the land no longer         1840    the time is also come when he   can till the land no longer         c   from this it will be seen that the text adopted in the first edition of lyrical ballads in 1798 was retained in the editions of 1800 1802 1805 1815 and 1820 that it was altered in each of the editions of 1827 1832 1837 1840 as also in the ms readings in lord coleridges copy of the works and in the edition of 1845  and that the version of 1845 was retained in the edition of 184950 it should be added that when a verse or stanza or lineoccurring in one or other of the earlier editionswas omitted from that of 1849 the footnote simply contains the extract along with the date of the year or years in which it occurs and that in such cases the date does not follow the reference number of the footnote but is placed for obvious reasons at the end of the extract  the same thing is true of descriptive sketches in the year 1827 there were scarcely any alterations made on the text of the poem as printed in 1820 still fewer were added in 1832 but for the edition of 1836 the whole was virtually rewritten and in that state it was finally left although a few significant changes were made in 1845  slight changes of spelling which occur in the successive editions are not mentioned when however the change is one of transposition although the text remains unalteredas is largely the case in simon lee for exampleit is always indicated  it will be further observed that at the beginning of every poem two dates are given the first on the lefthand side is the date of composition the second on the righthand side is the date of the first publication in what class the poem first appeared and the changes if any which subsequently occurred in its title are mentioned in the note appended   third in the present edition several suggested changes of text which were written by wordsworth on the margin of a copy of his edition of 18367 which he kept beside him at rydal mount are published these ms notes seem to have been written by himself or dictated to others at intervals between the years 1836 and 1850 and they are thus a record of passing thoughts or moods of his own mind during these years some of these were afterwards introduced into the editions of 1842 1846 and 1849 others were not made use of the latter have now a value of their own as indicating certain new phases of thought and feeling in wordsworths later years i owe my knowledge of them and the permission to use them to the kindness of the late chief justice of england lord coleridge the following is an extract from a letter from him     fox ghyll ambleside 4th october 1881    i have been long intending to write you as to the manuscript notes   and alterations in wordsworths poems which you have had the   opportunity of seeing and so far as you thought fit of using for   your edition they came into my possession in this way i saw them   advertised in a catalogue which was sent me and at my request the   book was very courteously forwarded to me for my inspection it   appeared to me of sufficient interest and value to induce me to buy   it and i accordingly became the purchaser    it is a copy of the edition in six volumes the publication of which   began in the year 1836 and of the volume containing the collected   sonnets which was afterwards printed uniformly with that edition it   appears to have been the copy which wordsworth himself used for   correcting altering and adding to the poems contained in it as you   have seen in some of the poems the alterations are very large   amounting sometimes to a complete rewriting of considerable passages   many of these alterations have been printed in subsequent editions   some have not two or three small poems as far as i know have not   been hitherto published much of the writing is wordsworths own but   perhaps the larger portion is the handwriting of others one or more   not familiar to me as wordsworths is    how the volumes came to be sold i do not know such as they are   and whatever be their interest or value you are as far as i am   concerned heartily welcome to them and i shall be glad indeed if   they add in the least degree to make your edition more worthy of the   great man for whom my admiration grows every day i live and my deep   gratitude to whom will cease only with my life and my reason   this precious copy of the edition of 18367 is now the property of lady coleridge i reexamined it in 1894 and added several readings which i had omitted to note twelve years ago when lord coleridge first showed it to me i should add that since the issue of the volumes of 18826 many other ms copies of individual poems have come under my notice and that every important variation of text in them is incorporated in this edition  as it is impossible to discover the precise year in which the suggested alterations of text were written by wordsworth on the margin of the edition of 1836 they will be indicated wherever they occur by the initial letter c comparatively few changes occur in the poems of early years  a copy of the 1814 quarto edition of the excursion now in the possession of a grandson of the poet the rev john wordsworth gosforth rectory cumberlandwhich was the copy wordsworth kept at rydal mount for annotation and correction much in the same way as he kept the edition of 18367has also been kindly sent to me by its present owner for examination and use in this edition and in it i have found some additional readings   fourth in the present edition all the notes and memoranda explanatory of the poems which wordsworth dictated to miss fenwick are given in full miss fenwick lived much at rydal mount during the later years of the poets life and it is to their friendship and to her inducing wordsworth to dictate these notes that we owe most of the information we possess as to the occasions and circumstances under which his poems were composed these notes were first made use ofalthough only in a fragmentary mannerby the late bishop of lincoln in the memoirs of his uncle they were afterwards incorporated in full in the edition of 1857 issued by mr moxon under the direction of mr carter and in the centenary edition they were subsequently printed in the prose works of wordsworth edited by dr grosart and in my edition of 18826 i am uncertain whether it was the original ms written by miss fenwick or the copy of it afterwards taken for miss quillinan to which dr grosart had access the text of these notes as printed in the edition of 1857 is certainly in very many cases widely different from what is given in the prose works of 1876 i have made many correctionsfrom the ms which i have examined with careof errors which exist in all previously printed copies of these notes including my own  what appears in this volume is printed from a ms which miss quillinan gave me to examine and copy and which she assured me was the original one the proper place for these fenwick notes is doubtless that which was assigned to them by the editor of 1857 viz before the poems which they respectively illustrate   fifth topographical notes explanatory of the allusions made by wordsworth to the localities in the english lake district and elsewhere are added throughout the volumes this has already been attempted to some extent by several writers but a good deal more remains to be done and i may repeat what i wrote on this subject in 1878  many of wordsworths allusions to place are obscure and the exact localities difficult to identify it is doubtful if he cared whether they could be afterwards traced out or not and in reference to one particular rock referred to in the poems on the naming of places when asked by a friend to localise it he declined replying to the question yes thator any other that will suit there is no doubt that in many instances his allusions to place are intentionally vague and in some of his most realistic passages he avowedly weaves together a description of localities remote from each other  it is true that poems of places are not meant to be photographs and were they simply to reproduce the features of a particular district and be an exact transcript of reality they would be literary photographs and not poems poetry cannot in the nature of things be a mere register of phenomena appealing to the eye or the ear no imaginative writer however in the whole range of english literature is so peculiarly identified with locality as wordsworth is and there is not one on the roll of poets the appreciation of whose writings is more aided by an intimate knowledge of the district in which he lived the wish to be able to identify his allusions to those places which he so specially interpreted is natural to every one who has ever felt the spell of his genius and it is indispensable to all who would know the special charm of a region which he described as a national property and of which he beyond all other men may be said to have effected the literary conveyance to posterity  but it has been askedand will doubtless be asked againwhat is the use of a minute identification of all these places is not the general fact that wordsworth described this district of mountain vale and mere sufficient without any further attempt at localisation the question is more important and has wider bearings than appears upon the surface  it must be admitted on the one hand that the discovery of the precise point in every local allusion is not necessary to an understanding or appreciation of the poems but it must be remembered on the other hand that wordsworth was never contented with simply copying what he saw in nature of the evening walkwritten in his eighteenth yearhe says that the plan of the poem    has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place a   proof of which i was unconscious at the time of my unwillingness to   submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance   the country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local   aspects13  again he says of the lines written while sailing in a boat at evening    it was during a solitary walk on the banks of the cam that i was   first struck with this appearance and applied it to my own feelings   in the manner here expressed changing the scene to the thames near   windsor 14  and of guilt and sorrow he said    to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well   acquainted with salisbury plain it may be proper to say that of the   features described as belonging to it one or two are taken from other   desolate parts of england 15  in the excursion he passes from langdale to grasmere over to patterdale back to grasmere and again to hawes water without warning and even in the case of the duddon sonnets he introduces a description taken direct from rydal mr aubrey de vere tells of a conversation he had with wordsworth in which he vehemently condemned the ultrarealistic poet who goes to nature with    pencil and notebook and jots down whatever strikes him most   adding nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms   he should have left his pencil and notebook at home fixed his eye as   he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him and   taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy afterwards he   would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was   preserved to him much was also most wisely obliterated that which   remained the picture surviving in his mind would have presented the   ideal and essential truth of the scene and done so in large part by   discarding much which though in itself striking was not   characteristic in every scene many of the most brilliant details   are but accidental  the two last sentences of this extract give admirable expression to one feature of wordsworths interpretation of nature in the deepest poetry as in the loftiest musicin wordsworths lyrics as in beethovens sonatasit is by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they exhaustively express that their truth and power are known in what he leaves unsaid wrote schiller i discover the master of style it depends no doubt upon the vision of the inward eye and the reproductive power of the idealising mind whether the result is a travesty of nature or the embodiment of a truth higher than nature yields on the other hand it is equally certain that the identification of localities casts a sudden light in many instances upon obscure passages in a poem and is by far the best commentary that can be given it is much to be able to compare the actual scene with the ideal creation suggested by it as the latter was both wordsworths reading of the text of nature and his interpretation of it in his seventythird year he said looking back on his evening walk that there was not an image in the poem which he had not observed and that he recollected the time and place where most of them were noted in the fenwick notes we constantly find him saying the fact occurred strictly as recorded the fact was as mentioned in the poem and the fact very often involved the accessories of place  any one who has tried to trace out the allusions in the poems on the naming of places or to discover the site of michaels sheepfold to identify ghimmer crag or thurstonmerenot to speak of the individual rocks and recesses near blea tarn at the head of little langdale so minutely described in the excursionwill admit that local commentary is an important aid to the understanding of wordsworth if to read the yew trees in borrowdale itself    in mute repose   to lie and listen to the mountain flood   murmuring from glaramaras inmost caves  to read the brothers in ennerdale or the daffodils by the shore of ullswater gives a new significance to these poems of the imagination a discovery of the obscurer allusions to place or scene will deepen our appreciation of those passages in which his idealism is most pronounced every one knows kirkstone pass aira force dungeon ghyll the wishing gate and helm crag many persons know the glowworm rock and used to know the rock of names but where is emmas dell or the meeting point of two highways so characteristically described in the twelfth book of the prelude and who will fix the site of the pool in rydal upper park immortalised in the poem to m h or identify joannas rock many of the places in the english lake district are undergoing change and every year the local allusions will be more difficult to trace perhaps the most interesting memorial of the poet which existed viz the rock of names on the shore of thirlmere is now sunk under the waters of a manchester reservoir other memorials are perishing by the wear and tear of time the decay of old buildings the alteration of roads the cutting down of trees and the modernising or improving of the district generally all this is inevitable but it is well that many of the natural objects over and around which the light of wordsworths genius lingers are out of the reach of improvements and are indestructible even by machinery  if it be objected that several of the places which we try to identifyand which some would prefer to leave for ever undisturbed in the realm of imaginationwere purposely left obscure it may be replied that death and time have probably now removed all reasons for reticence especially in the case of those poems referring to domestic life and friendly ties while an author is alive or while those are alive to whom he has made reference in the course of his allusions to place it may even be right that works designed for posterity should not be dealt with after the fashion of the modern interviewer but greatness has its penalties and a fierce light beats around the throne of genius as well as round that of empire moreover all experience shows that posterity takes a great and a growing interest in exact topographical illustrations of the works of great authors the labour recently bestowed upon the places connected with shakespeare scott and burns sufficiently attests this  the localities in westmoreland which are most permanently associated with wordsworth are these grasmere where he lived during the years of his poetic prime and where he is buried lower easdale where he passed so many days with his sister by the side of the brook and on the terraces at lancrigg and where the prelude was dictated rydal mount where he spent the latter half of his life and where he found one of the most perfect retreats in england great langdale and blea tarn at the head of little langdale immortalised in the excursion the upper end of ullswater and kirkstone pass and all the mountain tracks and paths round grasmere and rydal especially the old upper road between them under nab scar his favourite walk during his later years where he composed hundreds of verses there is scarcely a rock or mountain summit a stream or tarn or even a well a grove or forestside in all that neighbourhood which is not imperishably identified with this poet who at once interpreted them as they had never been interpreted before and added                    the gleam   the light that never was on sea or land   the consecration and the poets dream  it may be worthy of note that wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle of tracing out local allusions both by dictating the fenwick notes and by republishing his essay on the topography of the lakes along with the duddon sonnets in 1820and also by itself in 1822from a belief that it would tend materially to illustrate his poems  in this edition the topographical notes usually follow the poems to which they refer but in the case of the longer poems such as the prelude the excursion and others it seems more convenient to print them at the foot of the page than to oblige the reader to turn to the end of the volume  from the accident of my having tried long agoat principal shairps requestto do what he told me he wished to do but had failed to carry out i have been supposed quite erroneously to be an authority on the subject of the english lake district as interpreted in the poems of wordsworth the latter it is true is the title of one of the books which i have written about wordsworth but although i visited the lakes in 1860as a pilgrim resoluteand have revisited the district nearly every year for more than a quarter of a century i may say that i have only a partial knowledge of it others such as canon rawnsley mr harry goodwin and mr rix for example know many parts of it much better than i do but as i have often had to compare my own judgment with that of such experts as the late dr cradock principal of brasenose college oxford and others i may add that when i differ from them it has been only after a reexamination of their evidence at the localities themselves   sixth several poems and fragments of poems hitherto unpublishedor published in stray quarters and in desultory fashionwill find a place in this edition but i reserve these fragments and place them all together in an appendix to the last volume of the poetical works if it is desirable to print these poems in such an edition as this it is equally desirable to separate them from those which wordsworth himself sanctioned in his final edition of 184950  every great author in the literature of the worldwhether he lives to old age when his judgment may possibly be less critical or dies young when it may be relatively more accurateshould himself determine what portions of his work ought and what ought not to survive at the same timewhile i do not presume to judge in the case of writers whom i know less fully than i happen to know wordsworth and his contemporariesit seems clear that the very greatest men have occasionally erred as to what parts of their writings might with most advantage survive and that they have even more frequently erred as to what ms letters etccasting light on their contemporariesshould or should not be preserved i am convinced for example that if the wordsworth household had not destroyed all the letters which coleridge sent to them in the first decade of this century the world would now possess much important knowledge which is for ever lost it may have been wise for reasons now unknown to burn those letters written by coleridge but the students of the literature of the period would gladly have them now  passing from the question of the preservation of letters it is evident that wordsworth was very careful in distinguishing between the verses which he sent to newspapers and magazines and those poems which he included in his published volumes his anxiety on this point may be inferred from the way in which he more than once emphasised the fact of republication eg in peter bell 1819 he put the following prefatory note to four sonnets which had previously appeared in blackwoods magazine and which afterwards 1828 appeared in the poetical album of alaric watts the following sonnets having lately appeared in periodical publications are here reprinted  some of the poems or fragments of poems included in the addenda to volume viii of this edition i would willingly have left out especially the sonnet addressed to miss maria williams but since they have appeared elsewhere i feel justified in now reprinting even that trivial youthful effusion signed axiologus i rejoice however that there is no likelihood that the somersetshire tragedy will ever see the light when i told wordsworths successor in the laureateship that i had burned a copy of that poem sent to me by one to whom it had been confided his delight was great it is the chronicle of a revolting crime with nothing in the verse to warrant its publication the only curious thing about it is that wordsworth wrote it with this exception there is no reason why the fragments which he did not himself republish and others which he published but afterwards suppressed should not now be printed the suppression of some of these by the poet himself is as unaccountable as is his omission of certain stanzas in the earlier poems from their later versions even the cambridge installation ode which is so feeble will be reprinted 16 the glowworm which only appeared in the edition of 1807 will be republished in full andrew jonesalso suppressed after appearing in lyrical ballads of 1800 1802 and 1805will be replaced in like manner the youthful school exercise written at hawkshead the translation from the georgics of virgil the poem addressed to the queen in 1846 will appear in their chronological place in vol viii there are also a translation of some french stanzas by francis wrangham on the birth of lovea poem entitled the eagle and the dove which was privately printed in a volume consisting chiefly of french fragments and called la petite chouannerie ou historie dun college breton sous lempirea sonnet on the rebuilding of a church at cardiffan election squib written during the lowther and brougham contest for the representation of the county of cumberland in 1818some stanzas written in the visitors book at the ferry windermere and other fragments then since wordsworth published some verses by his sister dorothy in his own volumes other unpublished fragments by miss wordsworth may find a place in this edition i do not attach much importance however to the recovery of these unpublished poems the truth is as sir henry taylorhimself a poet and critic of no mean orderremarked 17    in these days when a great mans path to posterity is likely to be   more and more crowded there is a tendency to create an obstruction   in the desire to give an impulse to gather about a mans work all the   details that can be found out about it is in my opinion to put a   drag upon it and as of the works so of the life  the industrious labour of some editors in disinterring the trivial works of great men is not a commendable industry all great writers have occasionally written triflesthis is true even of shakespeareand if they wished them to perish why should we seek to resuscitate them besides this labourwhether due to the industry of admiring friends or to the ambition of the literary resurrectionistis futile because the verdict of time is sure and posterity is certain to consign the recovered trivialities to kindly oblivion the question which should invariably present itself to the editor of the fragments of a great writer is can these bones live if they cannot they had better never see the light indeed the only good reason for reprinting the fragments which have been lost because the author himself attached no value to them is that in a complete collection of the works of a great man some of them may have a biographic or psychological value but have we any right to reproduce from an antiquarian motive whatin a literary senseis either trivial or feeble or sterile  we must however distinguish between what is suitable for an edition meant either to popularise an author or to interpret him and an edition intended to bring together all that is worthy of preservation for posterity there is great truth in what mr arnold has lately said of byron    i question whether by reading everything which he gives us we are so   likely to acquire an admiring sense even of his variety and   abundance as by reading what he gives us at his happier moments   receive him absolutely without omission and compromise follow his   whole outpouring stanza by stanza and line by line from the very   commencement to the very end and he is capable of being tiresome   18  this is quite true nevertheless english literature demands a complete edition of all the works of byron and it may be safely predicted that for weightier reasons and with greater urgency it will continue to call for the collected works of wordsworth  it should also be noted that the fact of wordsworths having dictated to miss fenwick so late as 1843 a stanza from the convict in his note to the lament of mary queen of scots 1817 justifies the inclusion of the whole of that suppressed poem in such an edition as this  the fact that wordsworth did not republish all his poems in his final edition of 184950 is not conclusive evidence that he thought them unworthy of preservation and reproduction it must be remembered that the prelude itself was a posthumous publication and also that the fragmentary canto of the recluse entitled home at grasmereas well as the other canto published in 1886 and entitled most prosaically composed when a probability existed of our being obliged to quit rydal mount as a residencewere not published by the poet himself i am of opinion that his omission of the stanzas beginning    among all lovely things my love had been  and of the sonnet on his voyage down the rhine was due to sheer forgetfulness of their existence few poets remember all their past fugitive productions at the same time there are other fragmentswritten when he was experimenting with his theme and when the inspiration of genius had forsaken himwhich it is unfortunate that he did not himself destroy  among the poems which wordsworth suppressed in his final edition is the latin translation of the somnambulist by his son this will be republished more especially as it was included by wordsworth himself in the second edition of his yarrow revisited  it may be well to mention the repetitions which are inevitable in this edition  1 as already explained those fragments of the reclusewhich were issued in all the earlier volumes and afterwards incorporated in the preludeare printed as they originally appeared  2 short notes are extracted from dorothy wordsworths recollections of a tour made in scotland 1803 which illustrate the poems composed during that tour while the whole text of that tour will be printed in full in subsequent volumes  3 other fragments including the lines beginning    wisdom and spirit of the universe  will be printed both by themselves in their chronological place and in the longer poem of which they form a part according to the original plan of their author  a detail perhaps not too trivial to mention is that in this editionat the suggestion of several friendsi have followed the example of professor dowden in his aldine edition and numbered the lines of almost all the poemseven the sonnets when i have not done so the reason will be obvious viz either the structure or the brevity of the poem 19  in giving the date of each poem i have used the word composed rather than written very much because wordsworth himselfand his sister in her journalsalmost invariably use the word composed although he criticised the term as applied to the creation of a poem as if it were a manufactured article in his chronological table mr dowden adopts the word composed but in his edition of the poems he has made use of the term written 20  no notice or almost none of misprints in wordsworths own text is taken in the notes to this edition sometimes an error occurred and was carried on through more than one edition and corrected in the next eg in the childless father the editions of 1827 1832 and 1836 have the line    fresh springs of green boxwood not six months before  in the errata of the edition of 1836 this is corrected to fresh sprigs there are other errata which remained in the edition of 184950 eg in rob roys grave vools for veols and mistakes in quotations from other poets such as invention for instruction in withers poem on the daisy these are corrected without mention  i should perhaps add that while i have included amongst the illustrative notes extracts from henry crabb robinsons diary etc many of them are now published for the first time these voluminous mss of robinsons have been reexamined with care and the reader who compares the three volumes of the diary etcedited by dr sadlerwith the extracts now printed from the original ms will see where sentences omitted by the original editor have been included  as this edition proceeds my debt to manywho have been so kind as to put their wordsworth mss and memoranda at my disposalwill be apparent  it is difficult to acknowledge duly my obligation to collectors of autograph lettersmr morrison the late mr locker lampson the late mr mackay of the grange trowbridge and a score of othersbut i may say in general that the kindness of those who possess wordsworth mss in allowing me to examine them has been a very genuine evidence of their interest in the poet and his work  my special thanks are due to mr gordon wordsworth who has in the kindest manner and for many years placed everything at my disposal which could further my labour on his grandfathers works  finally i wish to express the great debt i owe to the late mr j dykes campbell for many suggestions and for his unwearied interest in this workwhich i think was second only to his interest in coleridgeand also to mr w b kinghorn for his valuable assistance in the revision of proof sheets  if there are any desiderata in reference to wordsworthin addition to a new life a critical essay and such a bibliography of criticism as will be adequate for posteritya concordance to his works is one of them a correspondent once offered to prepare this for me if i found a publisher and another has undertaken to compile a volume of parallel passages from the earlier poets of england and of the world a concordance might very well form part of a volume of wordsworthiana and be a real service to future students of the poet  william knight    footnote 1 in addition to my own detection of errors in the text and notes to the editions 18829 i acknowledge special obligation to the late vicechancellor of the victoria university principal greenwood who went over every volume with laborious care and sent me the result to the late mr j dykes campbell to mr j r tutin to the rev thomas hutchinson of kimbolton and to many others i am similarly indebted   footnote 2 see memoirs of william wordsworth ii pp 113 114   footnote 3 it is however different with the fragments which were

commentators as to what the original text was as in the case of the greek poets or of dante or even of shakespeare they are the actual alterations introduced deliberately as improvements by the hand of the poet himself   footnote 8 the collection in the british museum and those in all the university libraries of the country are incomplete   footnote 9 the publication of this edition was superintended by mr carter who acted as wordsworths secretary for thirtyseven years and was appointed one of his literary executors   footnote 10 let the indiscriminate admirer of first editions turn to this quarto and perhaps even he may wonder why it has been rescued from oblivion i am only aware of the existence of five copies of the edition of 1793 and although it has a certain autobiographic value i do not think that many who read it once will return to it again except as a literary curiosity hereand not in lyrical ballads or the excursionwas the quarry where jeffrey or gifford might have found abundant material for criticism   footnote 11 it is unfortunate that the memoirs do not tell us to what poem the remark applies or to whom the letter containing it was addressed   footnote 12 it is important to note that the printed text in several of the editions is occasionally cancelled in the list of errata at the beginning or the end of the volume also that many copies of the early editions notably those of 1800 were bound up without the full errata list in this edition there were two such lists one of them very brief but the cancelled words in these errata lists must be taken into account in determining the text of each edition   footnote 13 i f note see vol i p 5   footnote 14 i f note see vol i p 32   footnote 15 advertisement see vol i p 78   footnote 16 how much of

juvenile pieces the following note was prefixed to that series from 1820 to 1832    of the poems in this class the evening walk and descriptive   sketches were first published in 1793 they are reprinted with some   unimportant alterations that were chiefly made very soon after their   publication it would have been easy to amend them in many passages   both as to sentiment and expression and i have not been altogether   able to resist the temptation but attempts of this kind are made at   the risk of injuring those characteristic features which after all   will be regarded as the principal recommendation of juvenile poems  in 1836 unimportant was erased before alterations and after temptation the following was added as will be obvious to the attentive reader in some instances these are few for i am aware that attempts of this kind etc    the above which was written some time ago scarcely applies to the   poem descriptive sketches as it now stands the corrections   though numerous are not however such as to prevent its retaining   with propriety a place in the class of juvenile pieces  in the editions of 1845 and 1849 wordsworth called his juvenile pieces poems written in youthed    dear native regions etc 1786 hawkshead the beautiful image   with which this poem concludes suggested itself to me while i was   resting in a boat along with my companions under the shade of a   magnificent row of sycamores which then extended their branches from   the shore of the promontory upon which stands the ancient and at that   time the more picturesque hall of coniston the seat of the le   flemings from very early times the poem of which it was the   conclusion was of many hundred lines and contained thoughts and   images most of which have been dispersed through my other   writingsi f  in the editions 1815 to 1832 the title given to this poem was extract from the conclusion of a poem composed upon leaving school the row of sycamores at hawkshead referred to in the fenwick note no longer exists  in the autobiographical memoranda dictated by wordsworth at rydal mount in november 1847 he says   i wrote while yet a schoolboy a long poem running upon my own adventures and the scenery of the county in which i was brought up the only part of that poem which has been preserved is the conclusion of it which stands at the beginning of my collected poems a  in the eighth book of the prelude lines 468475 this fragment is introduced and there wordsworth tells us that once when boating on coniston lake thurstonmere in his boyhood he entered under a grove of trees on its western marge and glided along the line of lowroofed water as in a cloister he adds    while in that shade   loitering i watched the golden beams of light   flung from the setting sun as

my sister it was   composed at school and during my first two college vacations there   is not an image in it which i have not observed and now in my   seventythird year i recollect the time and place when most of them   were noticed i will confine myself to one instance      waving his hat the shepherd from the vale     directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale     the dog loud barking mid the glittering rocks     hunts where his master points the intercepted flocks    i was an eyewitness of this for the first time while crossing the   pass of dunmail raise upon second thought i will mention another   image      and fronting the bright west yon oak entwines     its darkening boughs and leaves in stronger lines    this is feebly and imperfectly expressed but i recollect distinctly   the very spot where this first struck me it was on the way between   hawkshead and ambleside and gave me extreme pleasure the moment was   important in my poetical history for i date from it my consciousness   of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been   unnoticed by the poets of any age or country so far as i was   acquainted with them and i made a resolution to supply in some degree   the deficiency i could not have been at that time above fourteen   years of age the description of the swans that follows was taken   from the daily opportunities i had of observing their habits not as   confined to the gentlemans park but in a state of nature there were   two pairs of them that divided the lake of esthwaite and its   inandout flowing streams between them never trespassing a single   yard upon each others separate domain they were of the old   magnificent species bearing in beauty and majesty about the same   relation to the thames swan which that does to the goose it was from   the remembrance of those noble creatures i took thirty years after   the picture of the swan which i have discarded from the poem of   dion b while i was a schoolboy the late mr curwen introduced a   little fleet of these birds but of the inferior species to the lake   of windermere their principal home was about his own island but they   sailed about into remote parts of the lake and either from real or   imagined injury done to the adjoining fields they were got rid of at   the request of the farmers and proprietors but to the great regret of   all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and   quiet habits i will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that   the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk or an   individual place a proof of which i was unconscious at the time of   my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and   real circumstance the country is idealised rather than described in   any one of its local aspectsi f  the title of this poem as first published in 1793 was an evening walk an epistle in verse addressed to a young lady from the lakes of the north of england by w wordsworth ba of st johns cambridge extracts from it were published in all the collected editions of the poems under the general title of juvenile pieces from 1815 to 1843 and in 1845 and 1849 of poems written in youth the following prefatory note to the juvenile pieces occurs in the editions 1820 to 1832    they are reprinted with some unimportant alterations that were   chiefly made very soon after their publication it would have been   easy to amend them in many passages both as to sentiment and   expression and i have not been altogether able to resist the   temptation but attempts of this kind are made at the risk of injuring   those characteristic features which after all will be regarded as   the principal recommendation of juvenile poems  to this wordsworth added in 1836    the above which was written some time ago scarcely applies to the   poem descriptive sketches as it now stands the corrections   though numerous are not however such as to prevent its retaining   with propriety a place in the class of juvenile pieces  in may 1794 wordsworth wrote to his friend mathews    it was with great reluctance that i sent these two little works into   the world in so imperfect a state but as i had done nothing at the   university i thought these little things might show that i could do   something  wordsworths notes to this poem are printed from the edition of

          the poem     far from my dearest friend tis mine to rove   through bare grey dell high wood and pastoral cove   where derwent rests and listens to the roar   that stuns the tremulous cliffs of high lodore 1   where peace to grasmeres lonely island leads                     5   to willowy hedgerows and to emerald meads   leads to her bridge rude church and cottaged grounds   her rocky

 a cloudy substitute for failing gladness 3   in youths keen 4 eye the livelong day was bright   the sun at morning and the stars at night   alike when first the bitterns hollow bill   was heard or woodcocks d roamed the moonlight hill 5        20    in thoughtless gaiety i coursed the plain 6   and hope itself was all i knew of pain   for then the inexperienced heart would beat 7   at times while young content forsook her seat   and wild impatience pointing upward showed                     25   through passes yet unreached a brighter road 8   alas the idle tale of man is found   depicted in the dials moral round   hope with reflection blends her social rays 9   to gild the total tablet of his days                             30   yet still the sport of some malignant power

     40   spotting the northern cliffs with lights between   when crowding cattle checked by rails that make   a fence far stretched into the shallow lake   lashed the cool water with their restless tails   or from high points of rock looked out for fanning gales13     45   when schoolboys stretched their length upon the green   and round the broadspread oak a glimmering scene   in the rough fernclad park the herded deer 14   shook the stilltwinkling tail and glancing ear   when horses in the sunburnt intake e stood                     50   and vainly eyed below the tempting flood   or

withered briars that oer the crags recline 18   save where with sparkling foam a small cascade                 65   illumines from within the leafy shade 19   beyond along the vista of the brook

above lines in the evening walk is to be found in chapter i of the second book p 55 it gives a weird account of the appearance of horsemen being exercised in troops upon    southenfell side as seen on the 25th of june 1744 by william   lancaster of blakehills and a farm servant david strichet    these visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest part of   southenfell and became visible just at a place called knott they   then moved in regular troops along the side of the fell till they   came opposite blakehills when they went over the mountain then they   described a kind of curvilinear path upon the side of the fell and   both these first and last appearances were bounded by the top of the   mountain    frequently the last or last but one in a troop would leave his   place and gallop to the front and then take the same pace with the   resta regular swift walk thus changes happened to every troop for   many troops appeared and oftener than once or twice yet not at all   times alike nor was this phenomenon seen at blakehill only it was   seen by every person at every cottage within the distance of a mile   neither was it confined to a momentary view for from the time that   strichet first observed it the appearance must have lasted at least   two hours and a half viz from half past seven till the night coming   on prevented further view  this interesting optical illusionwhich suggests the wonderful island in the atlantic seen from the isles of aran near galway alluded to in the chorographical description of west or hierconnaught of r oflahertywas caused by the peculiar angle of the light from the setting sun the reflection of the water of the solway and the refraction of the vapour and clouds above the solway these aerial and visionary horsemen were being exercised somewhere above the kirkcudbright shore it was not the first time the phenomenon had been seen within historic times on the same fellside and at the same time of year canon rawnsley writes to me    i have an idea that the fact that it took place at midsummer eve   june 27 the eve of the feast of st john upon which occasion the   shepherds hereabout used to light bonfires on the hills no doubt a   relic of the custom of the beltane fires of old norse days perhaps of   earlier sunworship festivals of british times may have had   something to do with the naming of the mountain blencathara of which   southenfell or shepherdsfell as the name implies is part   blencathara we are told may mean the hill of demons or the haunted   hill my suggestion is that the old sunworshippers who met in   midsummer eve on castrigg at the druid circle or donnring saw just   the same phenomenon as strichet and lancaster saw upon southenfell   and hence the name nay perhaps the druid circle was built where it   is because it was well in view of the demon hill  ed   footnote r this is a fact of which i have been an eyewitnessw w 1793   footnote s the quotation is from collins the passions

hold in my esteem i should have been cautious   of wounding your delicacy by thus publicly addressing you had not the   circumstance of our having been companions among the alps seemed to   give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples   which your modesty might otherwise have suggested c    in inscribing this little work to you i consult my heart you know   well how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a   postchaise and two travellers plodding slowly along the road side   by side each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his   shoulders how much more of heart between the two latter    i am happy in being conscious that i shall have one reader who will   approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret you they must   certainly interest in reminding you of moments to which you can   hardly look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of   melancholy you will meet with few images without recollecting the   spot where we observed them together consequently whatever is feeble   in my design or spiritless in my colouring will be amply supplied by   your own memory    with still greater propriety i might have inscribed to you a   description of some of the features of your native mountains through   which we have wandered together in the same manner with so much   pleasure but the seasunsets which give such splendour to the vale   of clwyd snowdon the chair of idris the quiet village of   bethgelert menai and her druids the alpine steeps of the conway and   the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the dee   remain yet untouched apprehensive that my pencil may never be   exercised on these subjects i cannot let slip this opportunity of   thus publicly assuring you with how much affection and esteem    i am dear sir   most sincerely yours   w wordsworth    london 1793     much the greatest part of this poem was composed during my walks upon   the banks of the loire in the years 1791 1792 i will only notice   that the description of the valley filled with mist beginningin   solemn shapeswas taken from that beautiful region of which the   principal features are lungarn and sarnen nothing that i ever saw in   nature left a more delightful impression on my mind than that which i   have attempted alas how feebly to convey to others in these lines   those two lakes have always interested me especially from bearing in   their size and other features a resemblance to those of the north of   england it is much to be deplored that a district so beautiful should   be so unhealthy as it isi f  as the original text of the descriptive sketches is printed in appendix i p 309 to this volumewith all the notes to that edition of 1793it is not quoted in the footnotes to the final text in the pages which follow except in cases which will justify themselves therefore the various readings which follow begin with the edition of 1815 which was however a mere fragment of the original text almost the whole of the poem of 1793 was reproduced in 1820 but there were many alterations of the text in that edition and in those of 1827 1832 1836 and 1845 wordsworths own footnotes here reproduced are those which he retained in the edition of 1849  descriptive sketches was ranked among the juvenile pieces from 1815 onwards but in 1836 it was put in a class by itself along with

been altered in the expression was published so far back as   the year 1798 under the title of the female vagrant the extract is   of such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it   here but it was necessary to restore it to its original position or   the rest would have been unintelligible the whole was written before   the close of the year 1794 and i will detail rather as matter of   literary biography than for any other reason the circumstances under   which it was produced    during the latter part of the summer of 1793 having passed a month in   the isle of wight in view of the fleet which was then preparing for   sea off portsmouth at the commencement of the war i left the place   with melancholy forebodings the american war was still fresh in   memory the struggle which was beginning and which many thought would   be brought to a speedy close by the irresistible arms of great britain   being added to those of the allies i was assured in my own mind would   be of long continuance and productive of distress and misery beyond   all possible calculation this conviction was pressed upon me by   having been a witness during a long residence in revolutionary   france of the spirit which prevailed in that country after leaving   the isle of wight i spent two a days in wandering on foot over   salisbury plain which though cultivation was then widely spread   through parts of it had upon the whole a still more impressive   appearance than it now retains    the monuments and traces of antiquity scattered in abundance over   that region led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of   those remote times with certain aspects of modern society and with   calamities principally those consequent upon war to which more than   other classes of men the poor are subject in those reflections   joined with some particular facts that had come to my knowledge the   following stanzas originated    in conclusion to obviate some distraction in the minds of those who   are well acquainted with salisbury plain it may be proper to say   that of the features described as belonging to it one or two are   taken from other desolate parts of england                                          unwilling to be unnecessarily particular i have assigned this poem   to the dates 1793 and 94 but in fact much of the female vagrants   story was composed at least two years before all that relates to her   sufferings as a sailors wife in america and her condition of mind   during her voyage home were faithfully taken from the report made to   me of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same   trials and affected in the same way mr coleridge when i first   became acquainted with him was so much impressed with this poem that   it would have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood but   the mariners fate appeared to me so tragical as to require a   treatment more subdued and yet more strictly applicable in   expression than i had at first given to it this fault was corrected   nearly sixty years afterwards when i determined to publish the whole   it may be worth while to remark that though the incidents of this   attempt do only in a small degree produce each other and it deviates   accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to   be governed it is not therefore wanting in continuous hold upon the   mind or in unity which is effected by the identity of moral interest   that places the two personages upon the same footing in the readers   sympathies my ramble over many parts of salisbury plain put me as   mentioned in the preface upon writing this poem and left upon my   mind imaginative impressions the force of which i have felt to this   day from that district i proceeded to bath bristol and so on to the   banks of the wye where i took again to travelling on foot in   remembrance of that part of my journey which was in 93 i began the   versesfive years have

servant to an itinerant conjurer my notion was to witness the   pleasure i expected the boy would receive from the prospect of the   islands below and the intermingling water i was not disappointed and   i hope the fact insignificant as it may appear to some may be   thought worthy of note by others who may cast their eye over these   notesi f                                         from 1815 to

in youth by science nursed   and led by nature into a wild scene   of lofty hopes he to the world went forth                       15   a favoured being knowing no desire   which genius did not hallow gainst the taint   of dissolute tongues and jealousy and hate   and scornagainst all enemies prepared   all but neglect the world for so it thought                   20   owed him no service wherefore he at once   with indignation turned himself away 4   and with the food of pride sustained his soul   in solitudestranger these gloomy boughs   had charms for him and here he loved to sit

distant scenehow lovely tis   thou seestand he would gaze till it became                    35   far lovelier and his heart could not sustain   the beauty still more beauteous nor that time   when nature had subdued him to herself 8   would he forget those beings to whose minds   warm from the labours of benevolence                             40   the world and human life 9 appeared a scene   of kindred loveliness then he would sigh   inly disturbed to think 10 that others felt   what he must never feel and so lost man   on visionary views would fancy feed                             45

a mile from hawkshead on the eastern shore of the lake a little to the left above the present highway as one goes towards sawrey mr bowman the son of wordsworths last teacher at the grammarschool of hawkshead told me that it stood about forty yards nearer the village than the yew which is now on the roadside and is sometimes called wordsworths yew in the poets schooldays the road passed right through the unenclosed common and the tree was a conspicuous object it was removed he says owing to the popular belief that its leaves were poisonous and might injure the cattle grazing in the common the present tree is erroneously called wordsworths yew its proximity to the place where the tree of the poem stood has given rise to the local traditioned

  a tragedy   composed 17956published 1842     readers already acquainted with my poems will recognise in the   following composition some eight or ten lines a which i have not   scrupled to retain in the places where they originally stood it is   proper however to add that they would not have been used elsewhere   if i had foreseen the time when i might be induced to publish this   tragedy    february 28 1842 b     this dramatic piece as noted in its titlepage was composed in   17956 it lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three   months unregarded among my papers without being mentioned even to my   most intimate friends having however impressions upon my mind which   made me unwilling to destroy the ms i determined to undertake the   responsibility of publishing it during my own life rather than impose   upon my successors the task of deciding its fate accordingly it has   been revised with some care but as it was at first written and is   now published without any view to its exhibition upon the stage not   the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story or   the composition of the characters above all in respect to the two   leading persons of the drama i felt no inducement to make any change   the study of human nature suggests this awful truth that as in the   trials to which life subjects us sin and crime are apt to start from   their very opposite qualities so there are no limits to the hardening   of the heart and the perversion of the understanding to which they   may carry their slaves during my long residence in france while the   revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness i had   frequent opportunities of being an eyewitness of this process and it   was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory that the tragedy of   the borderers was composed c                                           of this dramatic work i have little to say in addition to the short   printed note which will be found attached to it it was composed at   racedown in dorset during the latter part of the year 1795 and in   the following year had it been the work of a later period of life it   would have been different in some respects from what it is now the   plot would have been something more complex and a greater variety of   characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of   incidents so mournful the manners also would have been more attended   to my care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the   characters and the position in which the persons in the drama stood   relatively to each other that the reader for i had then no thought   of the stage might be moved and to a degree instructed by lights   penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature in this endeavour   i cannot think upon a very late review that i have failed as to the   scene and period of action little more was required for my purpose   than the absence of established law and government so that the agents   might be at liberty to act on their own impulses nevertheless i do   remember that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from   local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do i read   redpaths history of the borders but found there nothing to my   purpose i once made an observation to sir w scott in which he   concurred that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could   be written on such a subject much about the same time but little   after coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of remorse and   it happened that soon after through one of the mr pooles mr   knight the actor heard that we had been engaged in writing plays   and upon his suggestion mine was curtailed and i believe coleridges   also was offered to mr harris manager of covent garden for myself   i had no hope nor even a wish though a successful play would in the   then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good   fortune that he should accept my performance so that i incurred no   disappointment when the piece was judiciously returned as not   calculated for the stage in this judgment i entirely concurred and   had it been otherwise it was so natural for me to shrink from public   notice that any hope i might have had of success would not have   reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition mr cs play was as   is well known brought forward several years after through the   kindness of mr sheridan in conclusion i may observe that while i   was composing this play i wrote a short essay illustrative of that   constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the   apparently motiveless actions of bad men intelligible to careful   observers this was partly done with reference to the character of   oswald and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into   so heinous a crime but still more to preserve in my distinct   remembrance what i had observed of transitions in character and the   reflections i had been led to make during the time i was a witness of   the changes through which the french revolution passedi f   the borderers was first published in the 1842 edition of poems

became impatient               and would not hear me   marmaduke                             noit cannot be               i dare not trust myself with such a thought               yet whence this

        i put a slip of foxglove in his hand               which pleased him so that he was hushed at once               when into one of those same spotted bells               a bee came darting

and never speaks   oswald                          who is it   marmaduke                                  i have seen her   oswald        oh the poor tenant of that ragged homestead               her whom the monster clifford drove to madness   marmaduke     i met a peasant near the spot he told me               these ten years she had sate all day alone               within those empty walls   oswald                                   i too have seen her               chancing to pass this way some six months gone               at midnight i betook me to the churchyard               the moon shone clear the air was still so still               the trees were silent as the graves beneath them               long did i watch and saw her pacing round               upon the selfsame spot still round and round               her lips for ever moving   marmaduke                              at her door               rooted i stood for looking at the woman               i thought i saw the

we rank not happily               with those who take the spirit of their rule               from that soft class of devotees who feel               reverence for life so deeply that they spare               the verminous brood and cherish what they spare               while feeding on their bodies would that idonea               were present to the end that we might hear               what she can urge in his defence she loves him   marmaduke     yes loves him tis a truth that multiplies               his guilt a thousandfold   oswald       tis most perplexing               what must be done   marmaduke     we will conduct her hither               these walls shall witness itfrom first to last               he shall reveal himself   oswald                                happy are we               who live in these disputed tracts that own               no law but what each man makes for himself               here justice has indeed a field of triumph   marmaduke     let us begone and bring her hitherhere               the truth shall be laid open his guilt proved               before her face the rest be left to me  oswald        you will be firm but though we well may trust               the issue to the justice of the cause               caution must not be flung aside remember               yours is no common life selfstationed here               upon these savage confines we have seen you               stand like an isthmus twixt two stormy seas               that oft have checked their fury at your bidding               mid the deep holds of solways mossy waste               your single virtue has transformed a band               of fierce barbarians into ministers               of peace and order aged men with tears               have blessed their steps the fatherless retire               for shelter to their banners but it is               as you must needs have deeply felt it is               in darkness and in tempest that we seek               the majesty of him who rules the world               benevolence that has not heart to use               the wholesome ministry of pain and evil               becomes at last weak and contemptible               your generous qualities have won due praise               but vigorous spirits look for something more               than youths spontaneous products and today               you will not disappoint them and hereafter   marmaduke     you are wasting words hear me then once for all               you are a manand therefore if compassion               which to our kind is natural as life               be known unto you you will love this woman               even as i do but i should loathe the light               if i could think one weak or partial feeling   oswald        you will forgive me   marmaduke                            if i ever knew               my heart could penetrate its inmost core               tis at this momentoswald i have loved               to be the

oswald                yes they               men who are little given to sift and weigh               would wreak on us the passion of the moment   marmaduke     the cloud will soon

remote from any town                 a cave that opened to the road presented                 a friendly shelter and we entered in   idonea          and i was with you   old pilgrim

               with rotten boughs and leaves such as the winds                 of many autumns in the cave had piled                 meanwhile the storm fell heavy on the woods                 our little fire sent forth a cheering warmth                 and we were comforted and talked of comfort                 but twas an angry night and oer our heads                 the thunder rolled in

long commotions have been seized               his power is this way tending it befits us               to stand upon our guard and with our swords               defend the innocent   marmaduke

nakedness               then grasp our swords and rush upon a cure               that flatters us because it asks not thought               the deeper malady is better hid               the world is

penury to yield him up her daughter               a little infant and instruct the babe               prattling upon his knee to call him father   lacy          why if his heart be tender that offence               i could forgive him   marmaduke going on                                    and should he make the child               an instrument of falsehood should he teach her               to stretch her arms and dim the gladsome light               of infant playfulness with piteous looks               of misery that was not  lacy                                        troth tis hard

poor babe and taught its innocent tongue               to lisp the name of fathercould he look               to the unnatural harvest of that time               when he should give her up a woman grown               to him who bid the highest in the market               of foul pollution   lacy                               the whole visible world               contains not such a monster   marmaduke                                   for this purpose               should he resolve to taint her soul by means               which bathe the limbs in sweat to think of them               should he by tales which would draw tears from iron               work on her nature and so turn compassion               and gratitude to ministers of vice               and make the spotless spirit

      the obstinate bolt of a small iron door               detained them near the gateway of the castle               by a dim lanterns light i saw that wreaths               of flowers were in their hands as if designed               for festive decoration and they said               with brutal laughter and most foul allusion               that they should share the banquet with their lord

           and therefore chose this solitary moor               here to impart the tale of which last night               i strove to ease my mind when our two comrades               commissioned by

heaven               and did not want glimmerings of quiet hope               so from the court i passed and down the brook               led by its murmur to the ancient oak               i came and when i felt its cooling shade               i sate me down and cannot but believe               while in my lap i held my little babe               and clasped her to my heart my heart that ached

the darling               of every tongueas you are now youve heard               that i embarked for syria on our voyage               was hatched among the crew a foul conspiracy

he struck me and that instant had i killed him               and put an end to his insolence but my comrades               rushed in between us then did i insist               all hated him and i was

not one of which could help him while alive               or mourn him dead   marmaduke                        a man by men cast off               left without burial nay not dead nor dying

all that multitude of hearts was still               and followed on through woods of gloomy cedar               into deep chasms troubled by roaring streams               or from the top of lebanon surveyed               the moonlight desert and the moonlight sea               in these my lonely wanderings i perceived               what mighty objects do impress their forms               to elevate our intellectual being               and felt if aught on earth deserves a curse               tis that worst principle of ill which dooms               a thing so great to perish selfconsumed

perceived               that we are praised only as men in us               do recognise some image of themselves               an abject counterpart of what they are               or the empty thing that they would wish to be               i felt that merit has no surer test               than obloquy that if we wish to serve               the world in substance not deceive by show

with storm               i had been out in search of a stray heifer               returning late i heard a moaning sound               then thinking that my fancy had deceived me               i hurried on when straight a second moan               a human voice distinct struck on my ear               so guided distant a few steps i found               an aged man and such as you describe

if a human hand were there               to pull the cord i guess he must have heard it               and it had led him towards the precipice               to climb up to the spot whence the sound came               but he had failed through weakness from his hand               his staff had dropped and close upon the brink               of a small pool of water he was laid               as if

                                   but few words               he only spake to me of a dear daughter               who so he feared would never see him more               and of a stranger to him one by whom               he had been sore misused but he forgave               the wrong and the wrongdoer you are troubled               perhaps you are his son   marmaduke

tell you that i feel myself a   little man by his side and yet i do not think myself a less man than   i formerly thought myself his drama is absolutely wonderful you know   i do not commonly speak in such abrupt and unmingled phrases and   therefore will the more readily believe me there are in the piece   those profound touches of the human heart which i find three or four   times in the robbers of schiller and often in shakspeare but in w   there are no inequalities   on august 6 1800 charles lamb wrote to coleridge    i would pay fiveandforty thousand carriages to read ws tragedy   of which i have heard so much and seen so little shortly afterwards   august 26 he wrote to coleridge i have a sort of a recollection   that somebody i think you promised me a sight of wordsworths   tragedy i shall be very glad of it just now for i have got manning   with me and should like to read it with him but this i confess   is a refinement under any circumstances alone in coldbath prison   or in the desert island just when prospero and his crew had set off   with caliban in a cage to milan it would be a treat to me to read   that play manning has read it so has lloyd and all lloyds family   but i could not get him to betray his trust by giving me a sight of   it lloyd is sadly deficient in some of those virtuous vicesed                                             variants on the text

1797published 1800     written 1801 or 1802 this arose out of my observations of the   affecting music of these birds hanging in this way in the london   streets during the freshness and stillness of the spring morningi   f  placed by wordsworth among his poems of the imaginationed  the preceding fenwick note to this poem is manifestly inaccurate as to date since the poem is printed in the lyrical ballads of 1800 in the edition of 1836 the date of composition is given as 1797 and this date is followed by mr carter the editor of 1857 miss wordsworths journal gives no date and as the fenwick note is certainly incorrectand the poem must have been written before the edition of 1800 came outit seems best to trust to the date sanctioned by wordsworth himself in 1836 and followed by his literary executor in 1857 i think it probable that the poem was written during the short visit which wordsworth and his sister paid to their brother richard in london in 1797 when he tried to get his tragedy

met within   the area of goodrich castle in the year 1793 having left the isle of   wight and crost salisbury plain as mentioned in the preface to   guilt and sorrow i proceeded by bristol up the wye and so on to n   wales to the vale of clwydd where i spent my summer under the roof of   the father of my friend robert jones    in reference to this poem i will here mention one of the most   remarkable facts in my own poetic history and that of mr coleridge   in the spring of the year 1798 he my sister and myself started   from alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon with a view to visit   linton and the valley of stones near it and as our united funds were   very small we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a   poem to be sent to the new monthly magazine set up by philips the   bookseller and edited by dr aikin accordingly we set off and   proceeded along the quantock hills towards watchet and in the course   of this walk was planned the poem of the ancient mariner founded on   a dream as mr coleridge said of his friend mr cruikshank much the   greatest part of the story was mr coleridges invention but certain   parts i myself suggested for example some crime was to be committed   which should bring upon the old navigator as coleridge afterwards   delighted to call him the spectral persecution as a consequence of   that crime and his own wanderings i had been reading in shelvockes   voyages a day or two before that while doubling cape horn they   frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude the largest sort of   seafowl some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet   suppose said i you represent him as having killed one of these   birds on entering the south sea and that the tutelary spirits of   these regions take upon them to avenge the crime the incident was   thought fit for the purpose and adopted accordingly i also suggested   the navigation of the ship by the dead men but do not recollect that   i had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem the gloss with   which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of   us at the time at least not a hint of it was given to me and i have   no doubt it was a gratuitous afterthought we began the composition   together on that to me memorable evening i furnished two or three   lines at the beginning of the poem in particular      and listend like a three years child     the mariner had his will    these trifling contributions all but one which mr c has with   unnecessary scrupulosity recorded slipt out of his mind as well   they might as we endeavoured to proceed conjointly i speak of the   same evening our respective manners proved so widely different that   it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but   separate from an undertaking upon which i could only have been a clog   we returned after a few days from a delightful tour of which i have   many pleasant and some of them droll enough recollections we   returned by dulverton to alfoxden the ancient mariner grew and grew   till it became too important for our first object which was limited   to our expectation of five pounds and we began to talk of a volume   which was to consist as mr coleridge has told the world of poems   chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life but looked at as   much as might be through an imaginative medium accordingly i wrote   the idiot boy her eyes are wild etc we are seven the   thorn and some others to return to we are seven the piece that   called forth this note i composed it while walking in the grove at   alfoxden my friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that   while walking to and fro i composed the last stanza first having   begun with the last line when it was all but finished i came in and   recited it to mr coleridge and my sister and said a prefatory   stanza must be added and i should sit down to our little teameal   with greater pleasure if my task was finished i mentioned in   substance what i wished to be expressed and coleridge immediately   threw off the stanza thus      a little child dear brother jem    i objected to the rhyme dear brother jem as being ludicrous but   we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend james tobins name   who was familiarly called jem he was the brother of the dramatist   and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to   notice the said jem got a sight of the lyrical ballads as it was   going through the press at bristol during which time i was residing   in that city one evening he came to me with a grave face and said   wordsworth i have seen the volume that coleridge and you are about   to publish there is one poem in it which i earnestly entreat you will   cancel for if published it will make you everlastingly ridiculous   i answered that i felt much obliged by the interest he took in my   good name as a writer and begged to know what was the unfortunate   piece he alluded to he said it is called we are seven nay   said i that shall take its chance however and he left me in   despair i have only to add that in the spring a of 1841 i   revisited goodrich castle not having seen that part of the wye since   i met the little girl there in 1793 it would have given me greater   pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who   had interested me so much but that was impossible as unfortunately i   did not even know her name the ruin from its position and features   is a most impressive object i could not but deeply regret that its   solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new castle set up on a   projection of the same ridge as if to show how far modern art can go   in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with   their united graces remembrances and associations i could have   almost wished for power so much the contrast vexed me to blow away   sirmeyricks impertinent structure and all the fopperies it   containsi f

this was suggested in front of alfoxden the boy was a son of my   friend basil montagu who had been two or three years under our care   the name of kilve is from a village on the bristol channel about a   mile from alfoxden and the name of liswyn farm was taken from a   beautiful spot on the wye where mr coleridge my sister and i had   been visiting the famous john thelwall who had taken refuge from   politics after a trial for high treason with a view to bring up his   family by the profits of agriculture which proved as unfortunate a   speculation as that he had fled from coleridge and he had both been   public lecturers coleridge mingling with his politics theology   from which the other elocutionist abstained unless it was for the   sake of a sneer this quondam community of public employment induced   thelwall to visit coleridge at nether stowey where he fell in my way   he really was a man of extraordinary talent an affectionate husband   and a good father though brought up in the city on a tailors board   he was truly sensible of the beauty of natural objects i remember   once when coleridge he and i were seated together upon the turf on   the brink of a stream in the most beautiful part of the most beautiful   glen of alfoxden coleridge exclaimed this is a place to reconcile   one to all the jarrings and conflicts of the wide world nay said   thelwall to make one forget them altogether the visit of this man   to coleridge was as i believe coleridge has related the occasion of   a spy being sent by government to watch our proceedings which were i   can say with

the thorn   composed march 19 1798published 1798   in the editions of 18001805 wordsworth added the following note to this poem    this poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory poem which   i have been prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a   mood when it was probable that i should write it wellthe character   which i have here introduced speaking is sufficiently common the   reader will perhaps have a general notion of it if he has ever known   a man a captain of a small trading vessel for example who being past   the middle age of life had retired upon an annuity or small   independent income to some village or country town of which he was not   a native or in which he had not been accustomed to live such men   having little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence and   from the same cause and other predisposing causes by which it is   probable that such men may have been affected they are prone to   superstition on which account it appeared to me proper to select a   character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which   superstition acts upon the mind superstitious men are almost always   men of slow faculties and deep feelings their minds are not loose but   adhesive they have a reasonable share of imagination by which word i   mean the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple   elements but they are utterly destitute of fancy the power by which   pleasure and surprise are excited by sudden varieties of situation and   by accumulated imagery    it was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men   cleave to the same ideas and to follow the turns of passion always   different yet not palpably different by which their conversation is   swayed i had two objects to attain first to represent a picture   which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character   that should describe it secondly while i adhered to the style in   which such persons describe to take care that words which in their   minds are impregnated with passion should likewise convey passion to   readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that   manner or using such language it seemed to me that this might be done   by calling in the assistance of lyrical and rapid metre it was   necessary that the poem to be natural should in reality move slowly   yet i hoped that by the aid of the metre to those who should at all   enter into the spirit of the poem it would appear to move quickly   the reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as i am sensible   that an introductory poem is necessary to give this poem its full   effect    upon this occasion i will request permission to add a few words   closely connected with the thorn and many other poems in these   volumes there is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the   same words cannot be repeated without tautology this is a great   error virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different   words when the meaning is exactly the same words a poets words more   particularly ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not   measured by the space which they occupy upon paper for the reader   cannot be too often reminded that poetry is passion it is the history   or science of feelings now every man must know that an attempt is   rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of   an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers   or the deficiencies of language during such efforts there will be a   craving in the mind and as long as it is unsatisfied the speaker will   cling to the same words or words of the same character there are   also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are   frequently beauties of the highest kind among the chief of these   reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words not only as   symbols of the passion but as things active and efficient which   are of themselves part of the passion and further from a spirit of   fondness exultation and gratitude the mind luxuriates in the   repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its   feelings the truth of these remarks might be shown by innumerable   passages from the bible and from the impassioned poetry of every   nation      awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and     lead captivity captive thou son of abinoam      at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he     fell where he bowed there he fell down dead

poem of the thorn as the reader will soon discover is not   supposed to be spoken in the authors own person the character of the   loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the   story  w w advertisement to lyrical ballads 1798                                          alfoxden 1798 arose out of my observing on the ridge of quantock   hill on a stormy day a thorn which i had often past in calm and   bright weather without noticing it i said to myself cannot i by   some invention do as much to make this thorn permanently as an   impressive object as the storm has made it to my eyes at this moment   i began the poem accordingly and composed it with great rapidity sir   george beaumont painted a picture from it which wilkie thought his   best he gave it me though when he saw it several times at rydal   mount afterwards he said i could make a better and would like to   paint the same subject over again the sky in this picture is nobly   done but it reminds one too much of wilson the only fault however   of any consequence is the female figure which is too old and decrepit   for one likely to frequent an eminence on such a calli f                                        the thorn was always placed among the poems of the imaginationed                                         the poem   i         there is a thornit looks so old           in truth youd find it hard to say           how it could ever have been young           it looks so old and grey           not higher than a two years child                     5           it stands erect this aged thorn           no leaves it has no prickly 1 points           it is a mass of knotted joints           a wretched thing forlorn           it stands erect and like a stone                     10           with lichens is it overgrown 2   ii        like rock or stone it is oergrown           with lichens to the very top           and hung with heavy tufts of moss           a melancholy crop                                    15           up from the earth these mosses creep           and this poor thorn they clasp it round           so close youd say that they are 3 bent           with plain and manifest intent           to drag it to the ground                             20           and all have 4 joined in one endeavour           to bury this poor thorn for ever   iii       high on a mountains highest ridge           where oft the stormy winter gale           cuts like a scythe while through the clouds          25           it sweeps from vale to vale           not five yards from the mountain path           this thorn you on your left espy           and to the left three yards beyond           you see a little muddy pond                           30           of waternever dry           though but of compass small and bare           to thirsty suns and parching air 5 a   iv        and close beside this aged thorn           there is a fresh and lovely sight                    35           a beauteous heap a hill of moss           just half a foot in height           all lovely colours there you see           all colours that were ever seen           and mossy network too is there                       40           as if by hand of lady fair           the work had woven been           and cups the darlings of the eye           so deep is their vermilion dye   v         ah me what lovely tints are there                   45           of olive green and scarlet bright           in spikes in branches and in stars           green red and pearly white           this heap of earth oergrown with moss           which close beside the thorn you see                 50           so fresh in all its beauteous dyes           is like an infants grave in size           as like as like can be           but never never any where           an infants grave was half so fair                   55   vi        now would you see this aged thorn           this pond and beauteous hill of moss           you must take care and choose your time           the mountain when to cross           for oft there sits between the heap                   60           so like 6 an infants grave in size           and that same pond of which i spoke           a woman in a scarlet cloak           and to herself she cries           oh misery oh misery                                65           oh woe is me oh misery   vii       at all times of the day and night           this wretched woman thither goes           and she is known to every star           and every wind that blows                            70           and there beside the thorn she sits           when the blue daylights in the skies           and when the whirlwinds on the hill           or frosty air is keen and still           and to herself she cries                             75           oh misery oh misery           oh woe is me oh misery   viii      now wherefore thus by day and night           in rain in tempest and in snow           thus to the dreary mountaintop                       80           does this poor woman go           and why sits she beside the thorn           when the blue daylights in the sky           or when the whirlwinds on the hill           or frosty air is keen and still                      85           and wherefore does she cry           o wherefore wherefore tell me why           does she repeat that doleful cry   ix        i cannot tell i wish i could           for the true reason no one knows                     90           but would you 7 gladly view the spot           the spot to which she goes           the hillock like 8 an infants grave           the pondand thorn so old and grey           pass by her doortis seldom shut                 95           and if you see her in her hut           then to the spot away           i never heard of such as dare           approach the spot when she is there   x         but wherefore to the mountaintop                   100           can this unhappy woman go           whatever star is in the skies           whatever wind may blow 9           full twenty years are past and gone 10           since she her name is martha ray                   105           gave with a maidens true goodwill           her company to stephen hill           and she was blithe and gay           while friends and kindred all approved           of him whom tenderly she loved 11                 110   xi        and they had fixed the wedding day           the morning that must wed them both           but stephen to another maid           had sworn another oath           and with this other maid to church                 115           unthinking stephen went           poor martha on that woeful day           a pang of pitiless dismay           into her soul was sent           a fire was kindled in her breast                    121           which might not burn itself to rest 12   xii       they say full six months after this           while yet the summer leaves were green           she to the mountaintop would go                    125           and there was often seen           what could she seekor wish to hide           her state to any eye was plain 13           she was with child and she was mad           yet often was she 14 sober sad                     130           from her exceeding pain           o guilty fatherwould that death           had saved him from that breach of faith 15   xiii      sad case for such a brain to hold           communion with a stirring child                     135           sad case as you may think for one           who had a brain so wild           last christmaseve we talked of this           and greyhaired wilfred of the glen           held that the unborn infant wrought 16             140           about its mothers heart and brought           her senses back again           and when at last her time drew near           her looks were calm her senses clear   xiv       more know i not i wish i did                      145           and it should all be told to you 17           for what became of this poor child           no mortal ever knew 18           nayif a child to her was born           no earthly tongue could ever tell 19              150           and if twas born alive or dead           far less could this with proof be said 20           but some remember well           that martha ray about this time           would up the mountain often climb                   155   xv        and all that winter when at night           the wind blew from the mountainpeak           twas worth your while though in the dark           the churchyard path to seek           for many a time and oft were heard                   160           cries coming from the mountain head           some plainly living voices were           and others ive heard many swear           were voices of the dead           i cannot think whateer they say                   165           they had to do with martha ray   xvi       but that she goes to this old thorn           the thorn which i described 21 to you           and there sits in a scarlet cloak           i will be sworn is true                             170           for one day with my telescope           to view the ocean wide and bright           when to this country first i came           ere i had heard of marthas name           i climbed the mountains height                  175           a storm came on and i could see           no object higher than my knee   xvii      twas mist and rain and storm and rain           no screen no fence could i discover           and then the wind in sooth 22 it was             180           a wind full ten times over           i looked around i thought i saw           a jutting cragand off i ran           headforemost through the driving rain           the shelter of the crag to gain                     185           and as i am a man           instead of jutting crag i found           a woman seated on the ground   xviii     i did not speaki saw her face           her faceit was 23 enough for me                190           i turned about and heard her cry           oh misery oh misery           and there she sits until the moon           through half the clear blue sky will go           and when the little breezes make                    195           the waters of the pond to shake           as all the country know           she shudders and you hear her cry           oh misery oh misery   xix       but whats the thorn and what the pond            200           and what the hill of moss to her           and what the creeping breeze that comes 24           the little pond to stir           i cannot tell but some will say           she hanged her baby on the tree                     205           some say she drowned it in the pond           which is a little step beyond           but all and each agree           the little babe was buried there           beneath that hill of moss so fair                   210   xx        ive heard the moss is spotted red 25           with drops of that poor infants blood           but kill a newborn infant thus           i do not think she could           some say if to the pond you go                     215           and fix on it a steady view           the shadow of a babe you trace           a baby and a babys face           and that it looks at you           wheneer you look on it tis plain                  220           the baby looks at you again   xxi       and some had sworn an oath that she           should be to public justice brought           and for the little infants bones           with spades they would have sought                  225           but instantly the hill of moss 26           before their eyes began to stir           and for full fifty yards around           the grassit shook upon the ground           yet 27 all do still aver                           230           the little babe lies 28 buried there           beneath that hill of moss so fair   xxii      i cannot tell how this may be           but plain it is the thorn is bound           with heavy tufts of moss that strive                 235           to drag it to the ground           and this i know full many a time           when she was on the mountain high           by day and in the silent night           when all the stars shone clear and bright           240           that i have heard her cry           oh misery oh misery           oh woe is me oh misery

separated from each other and at the foot of   one of them a beautiful poplar was a hillock of moss such as the   poet of grasmere has described in the motto to our chapter so soon as   she arrived at this spot madge wildfire joining her hands above her   head with a loud scream that resembled laughter flung herself all at   once upon the spot and remained there lying motionless    jeanies first idea was to take the opportunity of flight but her   desire to escape yielded for a moment to apprehension for the poor   insane being who she thought might perish for want of relief with   an effort which in her circumstances might be termed heroic she   stooped down spoke in a soothing tone and tried to raise up the   forlorn creature she effected this with difficulty and as she placed   her against the tree in a sitting posture she observed with surprise   that her complexion usually florid was now deadly pale and that her   face was bathed in tears notwithstanding her own extreme danger   jeanie was affected by the situation of her companion and the rather   that through the whole train of her wavering and inconsistent state   of mind and line of conduct she discerned a general

tullis narrated by an italian signer l storgosi in a work called il narratore italiano    i received good information of the truth of the following case which   was published a few years ago in the newspapers a young farmer in   warwickshire finding his hedges broke and the sticks carried away   during a frosty season determined to watch for the thief he lay many   cold hours under a haystack and at length an old woman like a witch   in a play approached and began to pull up the hedge he waited till   she had tied up her bundle of sticks and was carrying them off that   he might convict her of the theft and then springing from his   concealment he seized his prey with violent threats after some   altercation in which her load was left upon the ground she kneeled   upon her bundle of sticks and raising her arms to heaven beneath the   bright moon then at the full spoke to the farmer already shivering   with cold heaven grant that thou mayest never know again the   blessing to be warm he complained of cold all the next day and wore   an upper coat and in a few days another and in a fortnight took to   his bed always saying nothing made him warm he covered himself with   many blankets and had a sieve over his face as he lay and from this   one insane idea he kept his bed above twenty years for fear of the   cold air till at length he died  in the advertisement to the first edition of lyrical ballads wordsworth says the tale of goody blake and harry gill is founded on a wellauthenticated fact which happened in warwickshire  the following curious letter appeared in the ipswich magazine of april 1799    ipswich april 2 1799    to the editors of the ipswich magazine    gentlementhe scarcity of coal at this time and the piercing cold   of the weather cannot fail to be some apology for the depredations   daily committed on the hedges in the neighbourhood if ever it be   permitted it ought in the present season should there be any farmer   more rigorous than the rest let him attend to the poetical story   inserted in page 118 of this magazine and tremble at the fate of   farmer gill who was about to prosecute a poor old woman for a similar   offence the thing is a fact and told by one of the first physicians   of the present day as having happened in the south of england and   which has a short time since been turned by a lyric poet into   that excellent ballad  from 1815 to 1843 this poem was classed among those of the imagination in 1845 it was transferred to the list of miscellaneous poemsed                                        the poem     oh whats the

                 20   old 1 goody blake was old and poor   ill fed she was and thinly clad   and any man who passed her door   might see how poor a hut she had    all day she spun in her poor dwelling                        25   and then her three hours work at night   alas twas hardly worth the telling   it would not pay for candlelight   remote from sheltered villagegreen   on a hills northern side she dwelt                          30   where from seablasts the hawthorns lean   and hoary dews are slow to melt 2    by the same fire to boil their pottage   two poor old dames as i have known   will often live in one small cottage                         35   but she poor woman housed 3 alone   twas well enough when summer came   the long warm lightsome summerday   then at her door the canty dame   would sit as any linnet gay                                40    but when the ice our streams did fetter   oh then how her old bones would shake   you would have said if you had met her   twas a hard time for goody blake   her evenings then were dull and dead                         45   sad case it was as you may think   for very cold to go to bed   and then for cold not sleep a wink    o joy for her wheneer in winter   the winds at night had made a rout                           50   and scattered many a lusty splinter   and many a rotten bough about   yet never had she well or sick   as every man who knew her says   a pile beforehand turf 4 or stick                         55   enough to warm her for three days    now when the frost was past enduring   and made her poor old bones to ache   could anything be more alluring   than an old hedge to goody blake                             60   and now and then it must be said   when her old bones were cold and chill   she left her fire or left her bed   to seek the hedge of harry gill    now harry he had long suspected                               65   this trespass of old goody blake   and vowed that she should be detected   that 5 he on her would vengeance take   and oft from his warm fire hed go   and to the fields his road would take                        70   and there at night in frost and snow   he watched to seize old goody blake    and once behind a rick of barley   thus looking out did harry stand   the moon was full and shining clearly                        75   and crisp with frost the stubble land  he hears a noisehes all awake   againon tiptoe down the hill   he softly creepstis goody blake   shes at the hedge of harry gill                             80    right glad was he when he beheld her   stick after stick did goody pull   he stood behind a bush of elder   till she had filled her apron full   when with her load she turned about                          85   the byway 6 back again to take   he started forward with a shout   and sprang upon poor goody blake    and fiercely by the arm he took her   and by the arm he held her fast                              90   and fiercely by the arm he shook her   and cried ive caught you then at last   then goody who had nothing said   her bundle from her lap let fall   and kneeling on the sticks she prayed                       95   to god that is the judge of all    she prayed her withered hand uprearing   while harry held her by the arm   god who art never out of hearing   o may he never more be warm                                100   the cold cold moon above her head   thus on her knees did goody pray   young harry heard what she had said   and icy cold he turned away    he went complaining all the morrow                           105   that he was cold and very chill   his face was gloom his heart was sorrow   alas that day for harry gill   that day he wore a ridingcoat   but not a whit the warmer he                                110   another was on thursday brought   and ere the sabbath he had three    twas all in vain a useless matter   and blankets were about him pinned   yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter                   115   like a loose casement in the wind   and harrys flesh it fell away   and all who see him say tis plain   that live as long as live he may   he never will be warm again                                 120    no word to any man he utters   abed or up to young or old   but ever to himself he mutters   poor harry gill is very cold   abed or up by night or day

composed while i was sitting by the side of the brook that   runs down from the comb in which stands the village of alford   through the grounds of alfoxden it was a chosen resort of mine the   brook ran down a sloping rock so as to make a waterfall considerable   for that county and across the pool below had fallen a treean ash   if i rightly rememberfrom which rose perpendicularly boughs in   search of the light intercepted by the deep shade above the boughs   bore leaves of green that for want of sunshine had faded into almost   lilywhite and from the underside of this natural sylvan bridge   depended long and beautiful tresses of ivy which waved gently in the   breeze that might poetically speaking be called the breath of the   waterfall this motion varied of course in proportion to the power of   water in the brook when with dear friends i revisited this spot   after an interval of more than forty years a this interesting   feature of the scene was gone to the owner of the place i could not   but regret that the beauty of this retired part of the grounds had not   tempted him to make it more accessible by a path not broad or   obtrusive but sufficient for persons who love such scenes to creep   along without difficultyi f   these lines were included among the poems of sentiment and reflectioned                                        the poem     i heard a thousand

                          15   it seemed a thrill of pleasure    the budding twigs spread out their fan   to catch the breezy air   and i must think do all i can   that there was pleasure there

ash   unsunnd and damp whose few poor yellow leaves   neer tremble in the gale yet tremble still   fanned by the waterfall  of all the localities around alfoxden this grove is the one chiefly associated with wordsworth there was no path to the waterfall as suggested by the poet to the owner of the place in 1840 but in 1880 i found the natural sylvan bridge restored an ash tree having

montagu the larch mentioned in the   first stanza was standing when i revisited the place in may 1841 more   than forty years after i was disappointed that it had not improved in   appearance as to size nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of   age which even though less perhaps than any other tree the larch   sometimes does a few score yards from this tree grew when we   inhabited alfoxden one of the most remarkable beechtrees ever seen   the ground sloped both towards and from it it was of immense size   and threw out arms that struck into the soil like those of the   banyantree and rose again from it two of the branches thus inserted   themselves twice which gave to each the appearance of a serpent   moving along by gathering itself up in folds one of the large boughs   of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left alfoxden   but five remained in 1841 we could barely find the spot where the   tree had stood so remarkable a production of nature

the stars they were among my dreams 1             in rustling conflict through the skies 2             5             i heard i saw the flashes drive 3             and yet they are upon my eyes             and yet i am alive             before i see another day             oh let my body die away                               10   ii          my fire is dead it knew no pain             yet is it dead and i remain             all stiff with ice the ashes lie             and they are dead and i will die             when i was well i wished to live                     15             for clothes for warmth for food and fire             but they to me no joy can give             no pleasure now and no desire             then here contented will i lie             alone i cannot fear to die                           20   iii         alas ye 4 might have dragged me on             another day a single one             too soon i yielded to despair             why did ye listen to my prayer 5             when ye 6 were gone my limbs were stronger          25             and oh how grievously i rue             that afterwards a little longer             my friends i did not follow you             for strong and without pain i lay             dear friends when ye 7 were gone away              30   iv          my child they gave thee to another             a woman who was not thy mother

           as if he strove to be a man             that he might pull the sledge for me             and then he stretched his arms how wild             oh mercy like a helpless child 9                   40   v           my little joy my little pride             in two days more i must have died             then do not weep and grieve for me             i feel i must have died with thee

countries have i been 1             and yet i have not often seen             a healthy man a man full grown             weep in the public roads alone             but such a one on english ground                    5             and in the broad highway i met             along the broad highway he came             his cheeks with tears were wet             sturdy he seemed though he was sad             and in his arms a lamb he had                       10   ii          he saw me and he turned aside             as if he wished himself to hide             and with his coat did then essay 2             to wipe those briny tears away             i followed him and said my friend                15             what ails you wherefore weep you so            shame on me sir this lusty lamb             he makes my tears to flow             today i fetched him from the rock             he is the last of all my flock                      20   iii         when i was young a single man             and after youthful follies ran             though little given to care and thought             yet so it was an ewe 3 i bought             and other sheep from her i raised                   25             as healthy sheep as you might see             and then i married and was rich             as i could wish to be             of sheep i numbered a full score             and every year increased my store                   30   iv          year after year my stock it grew             and from this one this single ewe             full fifty comely sheep i raised             as fine 4 a flock as ever grazed             upon the quantock hills they fed 5                35             they throve and we at home did thrive            this lusty lamb of all my store             is all that is alive             and now i care not if we die             and perish all of poverty                           40   v           six 6 children sir had i to feed             hard labour in a time of need             my pride was tamed and in our grief             i of the parish asked relief             they said i was a wealthy man                      45             my sheep upon the uplands 7 fed             and it was fit that thence i took             whereof to buy us bread             do this how can we give to you             they cried what to the poor is due               50   vi          i sold a sheep as they had said             and bought my little children bread             and they were healthy with their food             for meit never did me good             a woeful time it was for me                         55             to see the end of all my gains             the pretty flock which i had reared             with all my care and pains             to see it melt like snow away             for me it was a woeful day                          60   vii         another still and still another             a little lamb and then its mother             it was a vein that never stopped             like blooddrops from my heart they dropped             till thirty were not left alive                     65             they dwindled dwindled one by one             and i may say that many a time             i wished they all were gone             reckless of what might come at last             were but the bitter struggle past 8               70   viii        to wicked deeds i was inclined             and wicked fancies crossed my mind             and every man i chanced to see             i thought he knew some ill of me             no peace no comfort could i find                   75             no ease within doors or without             and crazily and wearily             i went my work about             and oft was moved to flee from home             and hide my head where wild beasts roam9          80   ix          sir twas a precious flock to me             as dear as my own children be             for daily with my growing store             i

i loved my children less             and every week and every day             my flock it seemed to melt away                     90   x           they dwindled sir sad sight to see             from ten to five from five to three             a lamb a wether and a ewe             and then at last from three to two             and of my fifty yesterday                          95             i had

         20   as if her very life would fail    theres not a house within a mile   no hand to help them in distress   old susan lies abed in pain   and sorely puzzled are the twain                              25   for what she ails they cannot guess    and bettys husbands at the wood   where by the week he doth abide   a woodman in the distant vale   theres none to help poor susan gale                          30   what must be done what will betide    and betty from the lane has fetched   her pony that is mild and good   whether he be in joy or pain   feeding at will along the lane                                35   or bringing faggots from the wood    and he is all in travelling trim   and by the moonlight betty foy   has on the wellgirt saddle set 5   the like was never heard of yet

the town                               45   or she will die old susan gale    there is no need of boot or spur   there is no need of whip or wand   for johnny has his hollybough   and with a hurlyburly now                                   50   he shakes the green bough in his hand    and betty oer and oer has told   the boy who is her best delight   both what to follow what to shun   what do and what to leave undone                             55   how turn to left and how to right    and bettys most especial charge   was johnny johnny mind that you   come home again nor stop at all   come home again whateer befal                               60   my johnny do i pray you do    to this did johnny answer make   both with his head and with his hand   and proudly shook the bridle too   and then his words were not a few                            65   which betty well could understand    and now that johnny is just going   though bettys in a mighty flurry   she gently pats the ponys side   on which her idiot boy must ride                              70   and seems no longer in a hurry    but when the pony moved his legs   oh then for the poor idiot boy   for joy he cannot hold the bridle   for joy his head and heels are idle                           75   hes idle all for very joy    and while the pony moves his legs   in johnnys left hand you may see   the green bough 7 motionless and dead   the moon that shines above his head                            80   is not more still and mute than he    his heart it was so full of glee   that till full fifty yards were gone   he quite forgot his holly whip   and all his skill in horsemanship                             85   oh happy happy happy john    and while the mother at the door   stands fixed her face with joy oerflows 8   proud of herself and proud of him   she sees him in his travelling trim                           90   how quietly her johnny goes    the silence of her idiot boy   what hopes it sends to bettys heart   hes at the guideposthe turns right   she watches till hes out of sight                            95   and betty will not then depart    burr burrnow johnnys lips they burr   as loud as any mill or near it   meek as a lamb the pony moves   and johnny makes the noise he loves                          100   and betty listens glad to hear it    away she hies to susan gale   her messengers in merry tune 9   the owlets hoot the owlets curr   and johnnys lips they burr burr burr                      105   as 10 on he goes beneath the moon    his steed and he right well agree   for of this pony theres a rumour   that should he lose his eyes and ears   and should he live a thousand years                          110   he never will be out of humour    but then he is a horse that thinks   and when he thinks his pace is slack   now though he knows poor johnny well   yet for his life he cannot tell                             115   what he has got upon his back    so through the moonlight lanes they go   and far into the moonlight dale   and by the church and oer the down   to bring a doctor from the town                              120   to comfort poor old susan gale    and betty now at susans side   is in the middle of her story   what speedy help her boy will bring 11   with many a most diverting thing                             125   of johnnys wit and johnnys glory    and betty still at susans side   by this time is not quite so flurried 12   demure with porringer and plate   she sits as if in susans fate                               130   her life and soul were buried    but betty poor good woman she   you plainly in her face may read it   could lend out of that moments store   five years of happiness or more                               135   to any that might need it    but yet i guess that now and then   with betty all was not so well   and to the road she turns her ears   and thence full many a sound she hears                       140   which she to susan will not tell    poor susan moans poor susan groans   as sure as theres a moon in heaven   cries betty hell be back again   theyll both be heretis almost ten                      145   both will be 13 here before eleven    poor susan moans poor susan groans   the clock gives warning for eleven   tis on the strokehe must be near   quoth betty and will soon be here 14                     150   as sure as theres a moon in heaven    the clock is on the stroke of twelve   and johnny is not yet in sight  the moons in heaven as betty sees   but betty is not quite at ease                               155   and susan has a dreadful night    and betty half an hour ago   on johnny vile reflections cast   a little idle sauntering thing   with other names an endless string                          160   but now that time is gone and past    and bettys drooping at the heart   that happy time all past and gone   how can it be he is so late   the doctor he has made him wait                             165   susan theyll both be here anon    and susans growing worse and worse   and bettys in a sad quandary   and then theres nobody to say   if she must go or she must stay                             170  shes in a sad quandary    the clock is on the stroke of one   but neither doctor nor his guide   appears 15 along the moonlight road   theres neither horse nor man abroad                         175   and bettys still at susans side    and susan now begins to fear 16   of sad mischances not a few   that johnny may perhaps be drowned   or lost perhaps and never found                            180   which they must both for ever rue    she prefaced half a hint of this   with god forbid it should be true   at the first word that susan said   cried betty rising from the bed                             185   susan id gladly stay with you    i must be gone i must away   consider johnnys but halfwise   susan we must take care of him   if he is hurt in life or limb                             190   oh god forbid poor susan cries    what can i do says betty going   what can i do to ease your pain   good susan tell me and ill stay   i fear youre in a dreadful way                              195   but i shall soon be back again    nay betty 17 go good betty go   theres nothing that can ease my pain   then off she hies but with a prayer   that god poor susans life would spare                       200   till she comes back again    so through the moonlight lane she goes   and far into the moonlight dale   and how she ran and how she walked   and all that to herself she talked                           205   would surely be a tedious tale    in high and low above below   in great and small in round and square   in tree and tower was johnny seen   in bush and brake in black and green                        210   twas johnny johnny every where    and while she crossed the bridge there came   a thought with which her heart is sore18   johnny perhaps his horse forsook   to hunt the moon within the brook 19                       215   and never will be heard of more    now is she high 20 upon the down   alone amid a prospect wide   theres neither johnny nor his horse   among the fern or in the gorse                               220   theres neither doctor nor his guide    oh saints what is become of him   perhaps hes climbed into an oak   where he will stay till he is dead   or sadly he has been misled                                 225   and joined the wandering gipsyfolk    or him that wicked ponys carried   to the dark cave the goblins hall   or in the castle hes pursuing   among the ghosts his own undoing                             230   or playing with the waterfall    at poor old susan then she railed   while to the town she posts away   if susan had not been so ill   alas i should have had him still                            235   my johnny till my dying day    poor betty in this sad distemper   the doctors self could 21 hardly spare   unworthy things she talked and wild   even he of cattle the most mild                             240   the pony had his share    but now shes fairly in the town 22   and to the doctors door she hies   tis silence all on every side   the town so long the town so wide                           245   is silent as the skies    and now shes at the doctors door   she lifts the knocker rap rap rap   the doctor at the casement shows   his glimmering eyes that peep and doze                       250   and one hand rubs his old nightcap    oh doctor doctor wheres my johnny   im here what ist you want with me   oh sir you know im betty foy   and i have lost my poor dear boy                             255   you know himhim you often see    hes not so wise as some folks be   the devil take his wisdom said   the doctor looking somewhat grim   what woman should i know of him                          260   and grumbling he went back to bed    o woe is me o woe is me   here will i die here will i die   i thought to find my lost one here 23   but he is neither far nor near                               265   oh what a wretched mother i    she stops she stands she looks about   which way to turn she cannot tell   poor betty it would ease her pain   if she had heart to knock again                              270  the clock strikes threea dismal knell    then up along the town she hies   no wonder if her senses fail   this piteous news so much it shocked her   she quite forgot to send the doctor                          275   to comfort poor old susan gale    and now shes high upon the down   and she can see a mile of road   o cruel im almost threescore   such night as this was neer before                          280   theres not a single soul abroad    she listens but she cannot hear   the foot of horse the voice of man   the streams with softest sound are flowing   the grass you almost hear it growing                         285   you hear it now if eer you can    the owlets through the long blue night   are shouting to each other still   fond lovers yet not quite hob nob   they lengthen out the tremulous sob                          290   that echoes far from hill to hill    poor betty now has lost all hope   her thoughts are bent on deadly sin   a greengrown pond she just has past   and from the brink she hurries fast                          295   lest she should drown herself therein    and now she sits her down and weeps   such tears she never shed before   oh dear dear pony my sweet joy   oh carry back my idiot boy                                   300   and we will neer oerload thee more    a thought is come into her head   the pony he is mild and good   and we have always used him well   perhaps hes gone along the dell                             305   and carried johnny to the wood    then up she springs as if on wings   she thinks no more of deadly sin   if betty fifty ponds should see   the last of all her thoughts would be                         310   to drown herself therein    o reader now that i might tell   what johnny and his horse are doing   what theyve been doing all this time   oh could i put it into rhyme                                 315   a most delightful tale pursuing    perhaps and no unlikely thought   he with his pony now doth roam   the cliffs and peaks so high that are   to lay his hands upon a star                                 320   and in his pocket bring it home    perhaps hes turned himself about   his face unto his horses tail   and still and mute in wonder lost   all silent as a horsemanghost                               325   he travels slowly down the vale 24    and now perhaps is hunting 25 sheep   a fierce and dreadful hunter he   yon valley now so trim 26 and green   in five months time should he be seen                      330   a desert wilderness will be    perhaps with head and heels on fire   and like the very soul of evil   hes galloping away away   and so will gallop 27 on for aye                           335   the bane of all that dread the devil    i to the muses have been bound   these fourteen years by strong indentures a   o gentle muses let me tell   but half of what to him befel                                340   he surely met 28 with strange adventures    o gentle muses is this kind   why will ye thus my suit repel   why of your further aid bereave me   and can ye thus unfriended 29 leave me                     345   ye muses whom i love so well    whos yon that near the waterfall   which thunders down with headlong force   beneath the moon yet shining fair   as careless as if nothing were                               350   sits upright on a feeding horse    unto his horsethere feeding 30 free   he seems i think the rein to give   of moon or stars he takes no heed   of such we in romances read                                  355  tis johnny johnny as i live    and thats the very pony too   where is she where is betty foy   she hardly can sustain her fears   the roaring waterfall she hears                              360   and cannot find her idiot boy    your ponys worth his weight in gold   then calm your terrors betty foy   shes coming from among the trees   and now all full in view she sees                             365   him whom she loves her idiot boy    and betty sees the pony too   why stand you thus good betty foy   it is no goblin tis no ghost   tis he whom you so long have lost                           370   he whom you love your idiot boy    she looks againher arms are up   she screamsshe cannot move for joy   she darts as with a torrents force   she almost has oerturned the horse                          375   and fast she holds her idiot boy    and johnny burrs and laughs aloud   whether in cunning or in joy   i cannot tell but while he laughs   betty a drunken pleasure quaffs                               380   to hear again her idiot boy    and now shes at the ponys tail   and now is 31 at the ponys head   on that side now and now on this   and almost stifled with her bliss                           385   a few sad tears does betty shed    she kisses oer and oer again   him whom she loves her idiot boy   shes happy here is happy there 32   she is uneasy every where                                    390   her limbs are all alive with joy    she pats the pony where or when   she knows not happy betty foy   the little pony glad may be   but he is milder far than she                                395   you hardly can perceive his joy    oh johnny never mind the doctor   youve done your best and that is all   she took the reins when this was said   and gently turned the ponys head                             400   from the loud waterfall    by this the stars were almost gone   the moon was setting on the hill   so pale you scarcely looked at her   the little birds began to stir                               405   though yet their tongues were still    the pony betty and her boy   wind slowly through the woody dale   and who is she betimes abroad   that hobbles up the steep rough road                         410   who is it but old susan gale    long time lay susan lost in thought 33   and many dreadful fears beset her   both for her messenger and nurse   and as her mind grew worse and worse                        415   her bodyit grew better    she turned she tossed herself in bed   on all sides doubts and terrors met her   point after point did she discuss   and while her mind was fighting thus                        420   her body still grew better    alas what is become of them   these fears can never be endured   ill to the woodthe word scarce said   did susan rise up from her bed                               425   as if by magic cured    away she goes 34 up hill and down   and to the wood at length is come   she spies her friends she shouts a greeting   oh me it is a merry meeting                                  430   as ever was in christendom    the owls have hardly sung their last   while our four travellers homeward wend   the owls have hooted all night long   and with the owls began my song                              435   and with the owls must end    for while they all were travelling home   cried betty tell us johnny do   where all this long night you have been   what you have heard what you have seen                      440   and johnny mind you tell us true    now johnny all night long had heard   the owls in tuneful concert strive   no doubt too he the moon had seen   for in the moonlight he had been                              445   from eight oclock till five    and thus to bettys question he   made answer like a traveller bold   his very words i give to you   the cocks did crow towhoo towhoo                         450   and the sun did shine so cold  thus answered johnny in his glory   and that was all his travels story                                        variants on the text

referring to the period of old ageed                                        the poem     i saw an aged beggar in my walk   and he was seated by the highway side   on a low structure of rude masonry   built at the foot of a huge hill that they   who lead their horses down the steep rough road                  5   may thence remount at ease the aged man   had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone   that overlays the pile and from a bag   all white with flour the dole of village dames   he drew his scraps and fragments one by one                   10   and scanned them with a fixed and serious look   of idle computation in the sun   upon the second step of that small pile   surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills   he sat and ate 1 his food in solitude                       15   and ever scattered from his palsied hand   that still attempting to prevent the waste   was baffled still the crumbs in little showers   fell on the ground and the small mountain birds   not venturing yet to peck their destined meal                  20   approached within the length of half his staff    him from my childhood have i known and then   he was so old he seems not older now   he travels on a solitary man   so helpless in appearance that for him                         25   the sauntering horseman throws not with a slack   and careless hand 2 his alms upon the ground   but stopsthat he may safely lodge the coin   within the old mans hat nor quits him so   but still when he has given his horse the rein                30   watches the aged beggar with a look 3   sidelong and halfreverted she who tends   the tollgate when in summer at her door   she turns her wheel if on the road she sees   the aged beggar coming quits her work                         35   and lifts the latch for him that he may pass   the postboy when his rattling wheels oertake   the aged beggar in the woody lane   shouts to him from behind and if thus warned 4   the old man does not change his course the boy                 40   turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside   and passes gently by without a curse   upon his lips or anger at his heart    he travels on a solitary man   his age has no companion on the ground                         45   his eyes are turned and as he moves along   they move along the ground and evermore   instead of common and habitual sight   of fields with rural works of hill and dale   and the blue sky one little span of earth                      50   is all his prospect thus from day to day   bowbent his eyes for ever on the ground 5   he plies his weary journey seeing still   and seldom 6 knowing that he sees some straw   some scattered leaf or marks which in one track              55   the nails of cart or chariotwheel have left   impressed on the white roadin the same line   at distance still the same poor traveller   his staff trails with him scarcely do his feet 7   disturb the summer dust he is so still                         60   in

addressing you had not the circumstance of my having accompanied you amongst the alps seemed to give this dedication a propriety sufficient to do away any scruples which your modesty might otherwise have suggested  in inscribing this little work to you i consult my heart you know well how great is the difference between two companions lolling in a post chaise and two travellers plodding slowly along the road side by side each with his little knapsack of necessaries upon his shoulders how much more of heart between the two latter  i am happy in being conscious i shall have one reader who will approach the conclusion of these few pages with regret you they must certainly interest in reminding you of moments to which you can hardly look back without a pleasure not the less dear from a shade of melancholy you will meet with few images without recollecting the spot where we observed them together consequently whatever is feeble in my design or spiritless in my colouring will be amply supplied by your own memory  with still greater propriety i might have inscribed to you a description of some of the features of your native mountains through which we have wandered together in the same manner with so much pleasure but the seasunsets which give such splendour to the vale of clwyd snowdon the chair of idris the quiet village of bethkelert menai and her druids the alpine steeps of the conway and the still more interesting windings of the wizard stream of the dee remain yet untouched apprehensive that my pencil may never be exercised on these subjects i cannot let slip this

any of my readers should ever visit the lake of como i recommend it to him to take a stroll along this charming little pathway he must chuse the evening as it is on the western side of the lake we

river along whose banks you descend in crossing the alps by the semplon pass from the striking contrast of its features this pass i should imagine to be the most interesting among the alps   footnote j most of the bridges among the alps are of wood and covered these bridges have a heavy appearance and rather injure the effect of the scenery in some places   footnote k    red came the river down

like the roman tombs along the road side   footnote m crosses commemorative of the deaths of travellers by the fall of snow and other accidents very common along this dreadful road   footnote n the houses in the more retired swiss valleys are all built of wood   footnote o i had once given to these sketches the title of picturesque but the alps are insulted in applying to them that term whoever in attempting to describe their sublime features should confine himself to the cold rules of painting would give his reader but a very imperfect idea of those emotions which they have the irresistible power of communicating to the most impassive imaginations the fact is that controuling influence which distinguishes the alps from all other scenery is derived from images which disdain the pencil had i wished to make a picture of this scene i had thrown much less light into it but i consulted nature and my feelings the ideas excited by the stormy sunset i am here describing owed their sublimity to that deluge of light or rather of fire in which nature had wrapped the immense forms around me any intrusion of shade by destroying the unity of the impression had necessarily diminished its grandeur   footnote p pike is a word very commonly used in the north of england to signify a high mountain of the conic form as langdale pike etc   footnote q for most of the images in the next sixteen verses i am indebted to m raymonds interesting observations annexed to his translation of coxes tour in switzerland   footnote r the rays of the sun drying the rocks frequently produce on their surface a dust so subtile and slippery that the wretched chamoischasers are obliged to bleed themselves in the legs and feet in order to secure a footing   footnote s the people of this canton are supposed to be of a more melancholy disposition than the other inhabitants of the alps this if true may proceed from their living more secluded   footnote t these summer hamlets are most probably as i have seen observed by a critic in the gentlemans magazine what virgil alludes to in the expression castella in tumulis   footnote u sugh a scotch word expressive of the sound of the wind through the trees   footnote v this wind which announces the spring to the swiss is called in their language foen and is according to m raymond the syroco of the italians   footnote w this tradition of the golden age of the alps as m raymond observes is highly interesting interesting not less to the philosopher than to the poet here i cannot help remarking that the superstitions of the alps appear to be far from possessing that poetical character which so eminently distinguishes those of scotland and the other mountainous northern countries the devil with his horns etc seems to be in their idea the principal agent that brings about the sublime natural revolutions that take place daily before their eyes   footnote x alluding to several battles which the swiss in very small numbers have gained over their oppressors the house of austria and in particular to one fought at naeffels near glarus where three hundred and thirty men defeated an army of between fifteen and twenty thousand austrians scattered over the valley are to be found eleven stones with this inscription 1388 the year the battle was fought marking out as i was told upon the spot the several places where the austrians attempting to make a stand were repulsed anew   footnote y as schreckhorn the pike of terror wetterhorn the pike of storms etc etc   footnote z the effect of the famous air called in french ranz des vaches upon the swiss troops removed from their native country is well known as also the injunction of not playing it on pain of death before the regiments of that nation in the service of france and holland

footnote cc rude fountains built and covered with sheds for the accommodation of the pilgrims in their ascent of the mountain under these sheds the sentimental traveller and the philosopher may find

extent of marsh so called near the lake of neufchatel   footnote hh this as may be supposed was written before france became the seat of war   footnote ii an insect so called which emits a short melancholy cry heard at the close of the summer evenings on the banks of the loire   footnote jj the river loiret which has the honour of giving name to a department rises out of the earth at a place called la source a league and a half southeast of orleans and taking at once the character of a considerable stream winds under a most delicious bank on its left with a flat country of meadows woods and vineyards on its right till it falls into the loire about three or four leagues below orleans the hand of false taste has committed on its banks those outrages which the abbé de lille so pathetically deprecates in those charming verses descriptive of the seine visiting in secret the retreat of his friend watelet much as the loiret in its short course suffers from injudicious ornament yet are there spots to be found upon its banks as soothing as meditation could wish for the curious traveller may meet with some of them where it loses itself among the mills in the neighbourhood of the villa called la fontaine the walks of la source where it takes its rise may in the eyes of some people derive an additional interest from the recollection that they were the retreat of bolingbroke during his exile and that here it was that his philosophical works were chiefly composed the inscriptions of which he speaks in one of his letters to swift descriptive of this spot are not i believe now extant the gardens have been modelled within these twenty years according to a plan evidently not dictated by the taste of the friend of pope   footnote kk the duties upon many parts of the french

ancles they are swoln and thick   his legs are thin and dry   when he was young he little knew   of husbandry or tillage   and now hes forced to work though weak  the weakest in the village    he all the country could outrun   could leave both man and horse behind   and often ere the race was done   he reeled and was stoneblind   and still theres something in the world   at which his heart rejoices   for when the chiming hounds are out   he dearly loves their voices    old ruth works out of doors with him   and does what simon cannot do   for she not over stout of limb   is stouter of
