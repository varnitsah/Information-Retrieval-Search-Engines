53547744	the golden bowl volume i  henry james  1904   book first the prince  part first                               i  the prince had always liked his london when it had come to him he was one of the modern romans who find by the thames a more convincing image of the truth of the ancient state than any they have left by the tiber brought up on the legend of the city to which the world paid tribute he recognised in the present london much more than in contemporary rome the real dimensions of such a case if it was a question of an imperium he said to himself and if one wished as a roman to recover a little the sense of that the place to do so was on london bridge or even on a fine afternoon in may at hyde park corner it was not indeed to either of those places that these grounds of his predilection after all sufficiently vague had at the moment we are concerned with him guided his steps he had strayed simply enough into bond street where his imagination working at comparatively short range caused him now and then to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish in silver and gold in the forms to which precious stones contribute or in leather steel brass applied to a hundred uses and abuses were as tumbled together as if in the insolence of the empire they had been the loot of faroff victories the young mans movements however betrayed no consistency of attentionnot even for that matter when one of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded as they passed him on the pavement by huge beribboned hats or more delicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at perverse angles in waiting victorias and the princes undirected thought was not a little symptomatic since though the turn of the season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade the possibilities of faces on the august afternoon were still one of the notes of the scene he was too restlessthat was the factfor any concentration and the last idea that would just now have occurred to him in any connection was the idea of pursuit  he had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before and what had actually unsteadied him as we join him was the sense of how he had been justified capture had crowned the pursuitor success as he would otherwise have put it had rewarded virtue whereby the consciousness of these things made him for the hour rather serious than gay a sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his handsome face constructively regular and grave yet at the same time oddly and as might be functionally almost radiant with its dark blue eyes its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply foreign to an english view than to have caused it sometimes to be observed of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a refined irishman what had happened was that shortly before at three oclock his fate had practically been sealed and that even when one pretended to no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a crunched key in the strongest lock that could be made there was nothing to do as yet further but feel what one had done and our personage felt it while he aimlessly wandered it was already as if he were married so definitely had the solicitors at three oclock enabled the date to be fixed and by so few days was that date now distant he was to dine at halfpast eight oclock with the young lady on whose behalf and on whose fathers the london lawyers had reached an inspired harmony with his own man of business poor calderoni fresh from rome and now apparently in the wondrous situation of being shown london before promptly leaving it again by mr verver himself mr verver whose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose in the arrangements the principle of reciprocity the reciprocity with which the prince was during these minutes most struck was that of calderonis bestowal of his company for a view of the lions if there was one thing in the world the young man at this juncture clearly intended it was to be much more decent as a soninlaw than lots of fellows he could think of had shown themselves in that character he thought of these fellows from whom he was so to differ in english he used mentally the english term to describe his difference for familiar with the tongue from his earliest years so that no note of strangeness remained with him either for lip or for ear he found it convenient in life for the greatest number of relations he found it convenient oddly even for his relation with himselfthough not unmindful that there might still as time went on be others including a more intimate degree of that one that would seek possibly with violence the larger or the finer issuewhich was itof the vernacular miss verver had told him he spoke english too well it was his only fault and he had not been able to speak worse even to oblige her when i speak worse you see i speak french he had said intimating thus that there were discriminations doubtless of the invidious kind for which that language was the most apt the girl had taken this she let him know as a reflection on her own french which she had always so dreamed of making good of making better to say nothing of his evident feeling that the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to the princes answer to such remarksgenial charming like every answer the parties to his new arrangement had yet had from himwas that he was practising his american in order to converse properly on equal terms as it were with mr verver his prospective fatherinlaw had a command of it he said that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion besides whichwell besides which he had made to the girl the observation that positively of all his observations yet had most finely touched her  you know i think hes a real galantuomoand no mistake there are plenty of sham ones about he seems to me simply the best man ive ever seen in my life  well my dear why shouldnt he be the girl had gaily inquired  it was this precisely that had set the prince to think the things or many of them that had made mr verver what he was seemed practically to bring a charge of waste against the other things that with the other people known to the young man had failed of such a result why his form he had returned might have made one doubt  fathers form she hadnt seen it it strikes me he hasnt got any  he hasnt got minehe hasnt even got yours  thank you for even the girl had laughed at him oh yours my dear is tremendous but your father has his own ive made that out so dont doubt it its where it has brought him out thats the point  its his goodness that has brought him out our young woman had at this objected  ah darling goodness i think never brought anyone out goodness when its real precisely rather keeps people in he had been interested in his discrimination which amused him no its his way it belongs to him  but she had wondered still its the american way thats all  exactlyits all its all i say it fits himso it must be good for something  do you think it would be good for you maggie verver had smilingly asked  to which his reply had been just of the happiest i dont feel my dear if you really want to know that anything much can now either hurt me or help me such as i ambut youll see for yourself say however i am a galantuomowhich i devoutly hope im like a chicken at best chopped up and smothered in sauce cooked down as a creme de volaille with half the parts left out your fathers the natural fowl running about the bassecour his feathers movements his soundsthose are the parts that with me are left out  all as a matter of coursesince you cant eat a chicken alive  the prince had not been annoyed at this but he had been positive well im eating your father alivewhich is the only way to taste him i want to continue and as its when he talks american that he is most alive so i must also cultivate it to get my pleasure he couldnt make one like him so much in any other language  it mattered little that the girl had continued to demurit was the mere play of her joy i think he could make you like him in chinese  it would be an unnecessary trouble what i mean is that hes a kind of result of his inevitable tone my liking is accordingly for the tonewhich has made him possible  oh youll hear enough of it she laughed before youve done with us  only this in truth had made him frown a little  what do you mean please by my having done with you  why found out about us all there is to find  he had been able to take it indeed easily as a joke ah love i began with that i know enough i feel never to be surprised its you yourselves meanwhile he continued who really know nothing there are two parts of meyes he had been moved to go on one is made up of the history the doings the marriages the crimes the follies the boundless betises of other people especially of their infamous waste of money that might have come to me those things are writtenliterally in rows of volumes in libraries are as public as theyre abominable everybody can get at them and youve both of you wonderfully looked them in the face but theres another part very much smaller doubtless which such as it is represents my single self the unknown unimportant unimportantunimportant save to youpersonal quantity about this youve found out nothing  luckily my dear the girl had bravely said for what then would become please of the promised occupation of my future  the young man remembered even now how extraordinarily clearhe couldnt call it anything elseshe had looked in her prettiness as she had said it he also remembered what he had been moved to reply the happiest reigns we are taught you know are the reigns without any history  oh im not afraid of history she had been sure of that call it the bad part if you likeyours certainly sticks out of you what was it else maggie verver had also said that made me originally think of you it wasntas i should suppose you must have seenwhat you call your unknown quantity your particular self it was the generations behind you the follies and the crimes the plunder and the wastethe wicked pope the monster most of all whom so many of the volumes in your family library are all about if ive read but two or three yet i shall give myself up but the moreas soon as i have timeto the rest where thereforeshe had put it to him againwithout your archives annals infamies would you have been  he recalled what to this he had gravely returned i might have been in a somewhat better pecuniary situation but his actual situation under the head in question positively so little mattered to them that having by that time lived deep into the sense of his advantage he had kept no impression of the girls rejoinder it had but sweetened the waters in which he now floated tinted them as by the action of some essence poured from a goldtopped phial for making ones bath aromatic no one before him nevernot even the infamous popehad so sat up to his neck in such a bath it showed for that matter how little one of his race could escape after all from history what was it but history and of their kind very much to have the assurance of the enjoyment of more money than the palacebuilder himself could have dreamed of  this was the element that bore him up and into which maggie scattered on occasion her exquisite colouring drops they were of the colourof what on earth of what but the extraordinary american good faith they were of the colour of her innocence and yet at the same time of her imagination with which their relation his and these peoples was all suffused what he had further said on the occasion of which we thus represent him as catching the echoes from his own thoughts while he loiteredwhat he had further said came back to him for it had been the voice itself of his luck the soothing sound that was always with him you americans are almost incredibly romantic  of course we are thats just what makes everything so nice for us  everything he had wondered  well everything thats nice at all the world the beautiful worldor everything in it that is beautiful i mean we see so much  he had looked at her a momentand he well knew how she had struck him in respect to the beautiful world as one of the beautiful the most beautiful things but what he had answered was you see too muchthats what may sometimes make you difficulties when you dont at least he had amended with a further thought see too little but he had quite granted that he knew what she meant and his warning perhaps was needless  he had seen the follies of the romantic disposition but there seemed somehow no follies in theirsnothing one was obliged to recognise but innocent pleasures pleasures without penalties their enjoyment was a tribute to others without being a loss to themselves only the funny thing he had respectfully submitted was that her father though older and wiser and a man into the bargain was as badthat is as goodas herself  oh hes better the girl had freely declared that is hes worse his relation to the things he cares forand i think it beautifulis absolutely romantic so is his whole life over hereits the most romantic thing i know  you mean his idea for his native place  yesthe collection the museum with which he wishes to endow it and of which he thinks more as you know than of anything in the world its the work of his life and the motive of everything he does  the young man in his actual mood could have smiled again smiled delicately as he had then smiled at her has it been his motive in letting me have you  yes my dear positivelyor in a manner she had said  american city isnt by the way his native town for though hes not old its a young thing compared with hima younger one he started there he has a feeling about it and the place has grown as he says like the programme of a charity performance youre at any rate a part of his collection she had explainedone of the things that can only be got over here youre a rarity an object of beauty an object of price youre not perhaps absolutely unique but youre so curious and eminent that there are very few others like youyou belong to a class about which everything is known youre what they call a morceau de musee  i see i have the great sign of it he had riskedthat i cost a lot of money  i havent the least idea she had gravely answered what you costand he had quite adored for the moment her way of saying it he had felt even for the moment vulgar but he had made the best of that wouldnt you find out if it were a question of parting with me my value would in that case be estimated  she had looked at him with her charming eyes as if his value were well before her yes if you mean that id pay rather than lose you  and then there came again what this had made him say dont talk about meits you who are not of this age youre a creature of a braver and finer one and the cinquecento at its most golden hour wouldnt have been ashamed of you it would of me and if i didnt know some of the pieces your father has acquired i should rather fear for american city the criticism of experts would it at all events be your idea he had then just ruefully asked to send me there for safety  well we may have to come to it  ill go anywhere you want  we must see firstit will be only if we have to come to it there are things she had gone on that father puts awaythe bigger and more cumbrous of course which he stores has already stored in masses here and in paris in italy in spain in warehouses vaults banks safes wonderful secret places weve been like a pair of piratespositively stage pirates the sort who wink at each other and say haha when they come to where their treasure is buried ours is buried pretty well everywhere except what we like to see what we travel with and have about us these the smaller pieces are the things we take out and arrange as we can to make the hotels we stay at and the houses we hire a little less ugly of course its a danger and we have to keep watch but father loves a fine piece loves as he says the good of it and its for the company of some of his things that hes willing to run his risks and weve had extraordinary luckmaggie had made that point weve never lost anything yet and the finest objects are often the smallest values in lots of cases you must know have nothing to do with size but theres nothing however tiny she had wound up that weve missed  i like the class he had laughed for this in which you place me i shall be one of the little pieces that you unpack at the hotels or at the worst in the hired houses like this wonderful one and put out with the family photographs and the new magazines but its something not to be so big that i have to be buried  oh she had returned you shall not be buried my dear till youre dead unless indeed you call it burial to go to american city  before i pronounce i should like to see my tomb so he had had after his fashion the last word in their interchange save for the result of an observation that had risen to his lips at the beginning which he had then checked and which now came back to him good bad or indifferent i hope theres one thing you believe about me  he had sounded solemn even to himself but she had taken it gaily ah dont fix me down to one i believe things enough about you my dear to have a few left if most of them even go to smash ive taken care of that ive divided my faith into watertight compartments we must manage not to sink  you do believe im not a hypocrite you recognise that i dont lie or dissemble or deceive is that watertight  the question to which he had given a certain intensity had made her he remembered stare an instant her colour rising as if it had sounded to her still stranger than he had intended he had perceived on the spot that any serious discussion of veracity of loyalty or rather of the want of them practically took her unprepared as if it were quite new to her he had noticed it before it was the english the american sign that duplicity like love had to be joked about it couldnt be gone into so the note of his inquiry waswell to call it nothing else premature a mistake worth making however for the almost overdone drollery in which her answer instinctively sought refuge  watertightthe biggest compartment of all why its the best cabin and the main deck and the engineroom and the stewards pantry its the ship itselfits the whole line its the captains table and all ones luggageones reading for the trip she had images like that that were drawn from steamers and trains from a familiarity with lines a command of own cars from an experience of continents and seas that he was unable as yet to emulate from vast modern machineries and facilities whose acquaintance he had still to make but as to which it was part of the interest of his situation as it stood that he could quite without wincing feel his future likely to bristle with them  it was in fact content as he was with his engagement and charming as he thought his affianced bride his view of that furniture that mainly constituted our young mans romanceand to an extent that made of his inward state a contrast that he was intelligent enough to feel he was intelligent enough to feel quite humble to wish not to be in the least hard or voracious not to insist on his own side of the bargain to warn himself in short against arrogance and greed odd enough of a truth was his sense of this last dangerwhich may illustrate moreover his general attitude toward dangers from within personally he considered he hadnt the vices in questionand that was so much to the good his race on the other hand had had them handsomely enough and he was somehow full of his race its presence in him was like the consciousness of some inexpugnable scent in which his clothes his whole person his hands and the hair of his head might have been steeped as in some chemical bath the effect was nowhere in particular yet he constantly felt himself at the mercy of the cause he knew his antenatal history knew it in every detail and it was a thing to keep causes well before him what was his frank judgment of so much of its ugliness he asked himself but a part of the cultivation of humility what was this so important step he had just taken but the desire for some new history that should so far as possible contradict and even if need be flatly dishonour the old if what had come to him wouldnt do he must make something different he perfectly recognisedalways in his humilitythat the material for the making had to be mr ververs millions there was nothing else for him on earth to make it with he had tried beforehad had to look about and see the truth humble as he was at the same time he was not so humble as if he had known himself frivolous or stupid he had an ideawhich may amuse his historianthat when you were stupid enough to be mistaken about such a matter you did know it therefore he wasnt mistakenhis future might be might be scientific there was nothing in himself at all events to prevent it he was allying himself to science for it was science but the absence of prejudice backed by the presence of money his life would be full of machinery which was the antidote to superstition which was in its turn too much the consequence or at least the exhalation of archives he thought of theseof his not being at all events futile and of his absolute acceptance of the developments of the coming age to redress the balance of his being so differently considered the moments when he most winced were those at which he found himself believing that really futility would have been forgiven him even with it in that absurd view he would have been good enough such was the laxity in the ververs of the romantic spirit they didnt indeed poor dears know what in that linethe line of futilitythe real thing meant he did having seen it having tried it having taken its measure this was a memory in fact simply to screen outmuch as just in front of him while he walked the iron shutter of a shop closing early to the stale summer day rattled down at the turn of some crank there was machinery again just as the plate glass all about him was money was power the power of the rich peoples well he was of them now of the rich peoples he was on their sideif it wasnt rather the pleasanter way of putting it that they were on his  something of this sort was in any case the moral and the murmur of his walk it would have been ridiculoussuch a moral from such a sourceif it hadnt all somehow fitted to the gravity of the hour that gravity the oppression of which i began by recording another feature was the immediate nearness of the arrival of the contingent from home he was to meet them at charing cross on the morrow his younger brother who had married before him but whose wife of hebrew race with a portion that had gilded the pill was not in a condition to travel his sister and her husband the most anglicised of milanesi his maternal uncle the most shelved of diplomatists and his roman cousin don ottavio the most disponible of exdeputies and of relativesa scant handful of the consanguineous who in spite of maggies plea for hymeneal reserve were to accompany him to the altar it was no great array yet it was apparently to be a more numerous muster than any possible to the bride herself having no wealth of kinship to choose from and making it up on the other hand by loose invitations he had been interested in the girls attitude on the matter and had wholly deferred to it giving him as it did a glimpse distinctly pleasing of the kind of ruminations she would in general be governed bywhich were quite such as fell in with his own taste they hadnt natural relations she and her father she had explained so they wouldnt try to supply the place by artificial by makebelieve ones by any searching of highways and hedges oh yes they had acquaintances enoughbut a marriage was an intimate thing you asked acquaintances when you had your kith and kinyou asked them over and above but you didnt ask them alone to cover your nudity and look like what they werent she knew what she meant and what she liked and he was all ready to take from her finding a good omen in both of the facts he expected her desired her to have character his wife should have it and he wasnt afraid of her having much he had had in his earlier time to deal with plenty of people who had had it notably with the three four ecclesiastics his greatuncle the cardinal above all who had taken a hand and played a part in his education the effect of all of which had never been to upset him he was thus fairly on the lookout for the characteristic in this most intimate as she was to come of his associates he encouraged it when it appeared  he felt therefore just at present as if his papers were in order as if his accounts so balanced as they had never done in his life before and he might close the portfolio with a snap it would open again doubtless of itself with the arrival of the romans it would even perhaps open with his dining tonight in portland place where mr verver had pitched a tent suggesting that of alexander furnished with the spoils of darius but what meanwhile marked his crisis as i have said was his sense of the immediate two or three hours he paused on corners at crossings there kept rising for him in waves that consciousness sharp as to its source while vague as to its end which i began by speaking ofthe consciousness of an appeal to do something or other before it was too late for himself by any friend to whom he might have mentioned it the appeal could have been turned to frank derision for what for whom indeed but himself and the high advantages attached was he about to marry an extraordinarily charming girl whose prospects of the solid sort were as guaranteed as her amiability he wasnt to do it assuredly all for her the prince as happened however was so free to feel and yet not to formulate that there rose before him after a little definitely the image of a friend whom he had often found ironic he withheld the tribute of attention from passing faces only to let his impulse accumulate youth and beauty made him scarcely turn but the image of mrs assingham made him presently stop a hansom her youth her beauty were things more or less of the past but to find her at home as he possibly might would be doing what he still had time for would put something of a reason into his restlessness and thereby probably soothe it to recognise the propriety of this particular pilgrimageshe lived far enough off in long cadogan placewas already in fact to work it off a little a perception of the propriety of formally thanking her and of timing the act just as he happened to be doingthis he made out as he went was obviously all that had been the matter with him it was true that he had mistaken the mood of the moment misread it rather superficially as an impulse to look the other waythe other way from where his pledges had accumulated mrs assingham precisely represented embodied his pledgeswas in her pleasant person the force that had set them successively in motion she had made his marriage quite as truly as his papal ancestor had made his familythough he could scarce see what she had made it for unless because she too was perversely romantic he had neither bribed nor persuaded her had given her nothing scarce even till now articulate thanks so that her profitto think of it vulgarlymust have all had to come from the ververs  yet he was far he could still remind himself from supposing that she had been grossly remunerated he was wholly sure she hadnt for if there were people who took presents and people who didnt she would be quite on the right side and of the proud class only then on the other hand her disinterestedness was rather awfulit implied that is such abysses of confidence she was admirably attached to maggiewhose possession of such a friend might moreover quite rank as one of her assets but the great proof of her affection had been in bringing them with her design together meeting him during a winter in rome meeting him afterwards in paris and liking him as she had in time frankly let him know from the first she had marked him for her young friends own and had then unmistakably presented him in a light but the interest in maggiethat was the pointwould have achieved but little without her interest in him on what did that sentiment unsolicited and unrecompensed rest what good againfor it was much like his question about mr ververshould he ever have done her the princes notion of a recompense to womensimilar in this to his notion of an appealwas more or less to make love to them now he hadnt as he believed made love the least little bit to mrs assinghamnor did he think she had for a moment supposed it he liked in these days to mark them off the women to whom he hadnt made love it represented and that was what pleased him in ita different stage of existence from the time at which he liked to mark off the women to whom he had neither with all this had mrs assingham herself been either aggressive or resentful on what occasion ever had she appeared to find him wanting these things the motives of such people were obscurea little alarmingly so they contributed to that element of the impenetrable which alone slightly qualified his sense of his good fortune he remembered to have read as a boy a wonderful tale by allan poe his prospective wifes countrymanwhich was a thing to show by the way what imagination americans could have the story of the shipwrecked gordon pym who drifting in a small boat further toward the north poleor was it the souththan anyone had ever done found at a given moment before him a thickness of white air that was like a dazzling curtain of light concealing as darkness conceals yet of the colour of milk or of snow there were moments when he felt his own boat move upon some such mystery the state of mind of his new friends including mrs assingham herself had resemblances to a great white curtain he had never known curtains but as purple even to blacknessbut as producing where they hung a darkness intended and ominous when they were so disposed as to shelter surprises the surprises were apt to be shocks  shocks however from these quite different depths were not what he saw reason to apprehend what he rather seemed to himself not yet to have measured was something that seeking a name for it he would have called the quantity of confidence reposed in him he had stood still at many a moment of the previous month with the thought freshly determined or renewed of the general expectationto define it roughlyof which he was the subject what was singular was that it seemed not so much an expectation of anything in particular as a large bland blank assumption of merits almost beyond notation of essential quality and value it was as if he had been some old embossed coin of a purity of gold no longer used stamped with glorious arms mediaeval wonderful of which the worth in mere modern change sovereigns and half crowns would be great enough but as to which since there were finer ways of using it such taking to pieces was superfluous that was the image for the security in which it was open to him to rest he was to constitute a possession yet was to escape being reduced to his component parts what would this mean but that practically he was never to be tried or tested what would it mean but that if they didnt change him they really wouldnt knowhe wouldnt know himselfhow many pounds shillings and pence he had to give these at any rate for the present were unanswerable questions all that was before him was that he was invested with attributes he was taken seriously lost there in the white mist was the seriousness in them that made them so take him it was even in mrs assingham in spite of her having as she had frequently shown a more mocking spirit all he could say as yet was that he had done nothing so far as to break any charm what should he do if he were to ask her frankly this afternoon what was morally speaking behind their veil it would come to asking what they expected him to do she would answer him probably oh you know its what we expect you to be on which he would have no resource but to deny his knowledge would that break the spell his saying he had no idea what idea in fact could he have he also took himself seriously made a point of it but it wasnt simply a question of fancy and pretension his own estimate he saw ways at one time and another of dealing with but theirs sooner or later say what they might would put him to the practical proof as the practical proof accordingly would naturally be proportionate to the cluster of his attributes one arrived at a scale that he was not honestly the man to calculate who but a billionaire could say what was fair exchange for a billion that measure was the shrouded object but he felt really as his cab stopped in cadogan place a little nearer the shroud he promised himself virtually to give the latter a twitch                                ii  theyre not good days you know he had said to fanny assingham after declaring himself grateful for finding her and then with his cup of tea putting her in possession of the latest newsthe documents signed an hour ago de part et dautre and the telegram from his backers who had reached paris the morning before and who pausing there a little poor dears seemed to think the whole thing a tremendous lark were very simple folk mere country cousins compared with you he had also observed and paris for my sister and her husband is the end of the world london therefore will be more or less another planet it has always been as with so many of us quite their mecca but this is their first real caravan theyve mainly known old england as a shop for articles in indiarubber and leather in which theyve dressed themselves as much as possible which all means however that youll see them all of them wreathed in smiles we must be very easy with them maggies too wonderful her preparations are on a scale she insists on taking in the sposi and my uncle the others will come to me ive been engaging their rooms at the hotel and with all those solemn signatures of an hour ago that brings the case home to me  do you mean youre afraid his hostess had amusedly asked  terribly afraid ive now but to wait to see the monster come theyre not good days theyre neither one thing nor the other ive really got nothing yet ive everything to lose one doesnt know what still may happen  the way she laughed at him was for an instant almost irritating it came out for his fancy from behind the white curtain it was a sign that is of her deep serenity which worried instead of soothing him and to be soothed after all to be tided over in his mystic impatience to be told what he could understand and believethat was what he had come for marriage then said mrs assingham is what you call the monster i admit its a fearful thing at the best but for heavens sake if thats what youre thinking of dont run away from it  ah to run away from it would be to run away from you the prince replied and ive already told you often enough how i depend on you to see me through he so liked the way she took this from the corner of her sofa that he gave his sincerity for it was sincerityfuller expression im starting on the great voyageacross the unknown sea my ships all rigged and appointed the cargos stowed away and the company complete but what seems the matter with me is that i cant sail alone my ship must be one of a pair must have in the waste of waters awhat do you call ita consort i dont ask you to stay on board with me but i must keep your sail in sight for orientation i dont in the least myself know i assure you the points of the compass but with a lead i can perfectly follow you must be my lead  how can you be sure she asked where i should take you  why from your having brought me safely thus far i should never have got here without you youve provided the ship itself and if youve not quite seen me aboard youve attended me ever so kindly to the dock your own vessel is all conveniently in the next berth and you cant desert me now  she showed him again her amusement which struck him even as excessive as if to his surprise he made her also a little nervous she treated him in fine as if he were not uttering truths but making pretty figures for her diversion my vessel dear prince she smiled what vessel in the world have i this little house is all our ship bobs and mineand thankful we are now to have it weve wandered far living as you may say from hand to mouth without rest for the soles of our feet but the time has come for us at last to draw in  he made at this the young man an indignant protest you talk about restits too selfishwhen youre just launching me on adventures  she shook her head with her kind lucidity not adventures heaven forbid youve had yoursas ive had mine and my idea has been all along that we should neither of us begin again my own last precisely has been doing for you all you so prettily mention but it consists simply in having conducted you to rest you talk about ships but theyre not the comparison your tossings are overyoure practically in port the port she concluded of the golden isles  he looked about to put himself more in relation with the place then after an hesitation seemed to speak certain words instead of certain others oh i know where i am i do decline to be left but what i came for of course was to thank you if today has seemed for the first time the end of preliminaries i feel how little there would have been any at all without you the first were wholly yours  well said mrs assingham they were remarkably easy ive seen them ive had them she smiled more difficult everything you must feel went of itself so you must feel everything still goes  the prince quickly agreed oh beautifully but you had the conception  ah prince so had you  he looked at her harder a moment you had it first you had it most  she returned his look as if it had made her wonder i liked it if thats what you mean but you liked it surely yourself i protest that i had easy work with you i had only at lastwhen i thought it was timeto speak for you  all that is quite true but youre leaving me all the same youre leaving meyoure washing your hands of me he went on however that wont be easy i wont be left and he had turned his eyes about again taking in the pretty room that she had just described as her final refuge the place of peace for a world worn couple to which she had lately retired with bob i shall keep this spot in sight say what you will i shall need you im not you know he declared going to give you up for anybody  if youre afraidwhich of course youre notare you trying to make me the same she asked after a moment  he waited a minute too then answered her with a question you say you liked it your undertaking to make my engagement possible it remains beautiful for me that you did its charming and unforgettable but still more its mysterious and wonderful why you dear delightful woman did you like it  i scarce know what to make she said of such an inquiry if you havent by this time found out yourself what meaning can anything i say have for you dont you really after all feel she added while nothing came from himarent you conscious every minute of the perfection of the creature of whom ive put you into possession  every minutegratefully conscious but thats exactly the ground of my question it wasnt only a matter of your handing me overit was a matter of your handing her it was a matter of her fate still more than of mine you thought all the good of her that one woman can think of another and yet by your account you enjoyed assisting at her risk  she had kept her eyes on him while he spoke and this was what visibly determined a repetition for her are you trying to frighten me  ah thats a foolish viewi should be too vulgar you apparently cant understand either my good faith or my humility im awfully humble the young man insisted thats the way ive been feeling today with everything so finished and ready and you wont take me for serious  she continued to face him as if he really troubled her a little oh you deep old italians  there you are he returnedits what i wanted you to come to thats the responsible note  yes she went onif youre humble you must be dangerous  she had a pause while he only smiled then she said i dont in the least want to lose sight of you but even if i did i shouldnt think it right  thank you for thatits what i needed of you im sure after all that the more youre with me the more i shall understand its the only thing in the world i want im excellent i really think all roundexcept that im stupid i can do pretty well anything i see but ive got to see it first and he pursued his demonstration i dont in the least mind its having to be shown mein fact i like that better therefore it is that i want that i shall always want your eyes through them i wish to lookeven at any risk of their showing me what i maynt like for then he wound up i shall know and of that i shall never be afraid  she might quite have been waiting to see what he would come to but she spoke with a certain impatience what on earth are you talking about  but he could perfectly say of my real honest fear of being off some day of being wrong without knowing it thats what i shall always trust you forto tell me when i am nowith you people its a sense we havent got itnot as you have therefore but he had said enough ecco he simply smiled  it was not to be concealed that he worked upon her but of course she had always liked him i should be interested she presently remarked to see some sense you dont possess  well he produced one on the spot the moral dear mrs assingham i mean always as you others consider it ive of course something that in our poor dear backward old rome sufficiently passes for it but its no more like yours than the tortuous stone staircasehalfruined into the bargainin some castle of our quattrocento is like the lightning elevator in one of mr ververs fifteenstorey buildings your moral sense works by steamit sends you up like a rocket ours is slow and steep and unlighted with so many of the steps missing that well that its as short in almost any case to turn round and come down again  trusting mrs assingham smiled to get up some other way  yesor not to have to get up at all however he added i told you that at the beginning  machiavelli she simply exclaimed  you do me too much honour i wish indeed i had his genius however if you really believe i have his perversity you wouldnt say it but its all right he gaily enough concluded i shall always have you to come to  on this for a little they sat face to face after which without comment she asked him if he would have more tea all she would give him he promptly signified and he developed making her laugh his idea that the tea of the english race was somehow their morality made with boiling water in a little pot so that the more of it one drank the more moral one would become his drollery served as a transition and she put to him several questions about his sister and the others questions as to what bob in particular colonel assingham her husband could do for the arriving gentlemen whom by the princes leave he would immediately go to see he was funny while they talked about his own people too whom he described with anecdotes of their habits imitations of their manners and prophecies of their conduct as more rococo than anything cadogan place would ever have known this mrs assingham professed was exactly what would endear them to her and that in turn drew from her visitor a fresh declaration of all the comfort of his being able so to depend on her he had been with her at this point some twenty minutes but he had paid her much longer visits and he stayed now as if to make his attitude prove his appreciation he stayed moreoverthat was really the sign of the hourin spite of the nervous unrest that had brought him and that had in truth much rather fed on the scepticism by which she had apparently meant to soothe it she had not soothed him and there arrived remarkably a moment when the cause of her failure gleamed out he had not frightened her as she called ithe felt that yet she was herself not at ease she had been nervous though trying to disguise it the sight of him following on the announcement of his name had shown her as disconcerted this conviction for the young man deepened and sharpened yet with the effect too of making him glad in spite of it it was as if in calling he had done even better than he intended for it was somehow importantthat was what it wasthat there should be at this hour something the matter with mrs assingham with whom in all their acquaintance so considerable now there had never been the least little thing the matter to wait thus and watch for it was to know of a truth that there was something the matter with him since strangely with so little to go uponhis heart had positively begun to beat to the tune of suspense it fairly befell at last for a climax that they almost ceased to pretendto pretend that is to cheat each other with forms the unspoken had come up and there was a crisisneither could have said how long it lastedduring which they were reduced for all interchange to looking at each other on quite an inordinate scale they might at this moment in their positively portentous stillness have been keeping it up for a wager sitting for their photograph or even enacting a tableauvivant  the spectator of whom they would thus well have been worthy might have read meanings of his own into the intensity of their communionor indeed even without meanings have found his account aesthetically in some gratified play of our modern sense of type so scantly to be distinguished from our modern sense of beauty type was there at the worst in mrs assinghams dark neat head on which the crisp black hair made waves so fine and so numerous that she looked even more in the fashion of the hour than she desired full of discriminations against the obvious she had yet to accept a flagrant appearance and to make the best of misleading signs her richness of hue her generous nose her eyebrows marked like those of an actress these things with an added amplitude of person on which middle age had set its seal seemed to present her insistently as a daughter of the south or still more of the east a creature formed by hammocks and divans fed upon sherbets and waited upon by slaves she looked as if her most active effort might be to take up as she lay back her mandolin or to share a sugared fruit with a pet gazelle she was in fact however neither a pampered jewess nor a lazy creole new york had been recordedly her birthplace and europe punctually her discipline she wore yellow and purple because she thought it better as she said while one was about it to look like the queen of sheba than like a revendeuse she put pearls in her hair and crimson and gold in her teagown for the same reason it was her theory that nature itself had overdressed her and that her only course was to drown as it was hopeless to try to chasten the overdressing so she was covered and surrounded with things which were frankly toys and shams a part of the amusement with which she rejoiced to supply her friends these friends were in the game that of playing with the disparity between her aspect and her character her character was attested by the second movement of her face which convinced the beholder that her vision of the humours of the world was not supine not passive she enjoyed she needed the warm air of friendship but the eyes of the american city looked out somehow for the opportunity of it from under the lids of jerusalem with her false indolence in short her false leisure her false pearls and palms and courts and fountains she was a person for whom life was multitudinous detail detail that left her as it at any moment found her unappalled and unwearied  sophisticated as i may appearit was her frequent phraseshe had found sympathy her best resource it gave her plenty to do it made her as she also said sit up she had in her life two great holes to fill and she described herself as dropping social scraps into them as she had known old ladies in her early american time drop morsels of silk into the baskets in which they collected the material for some eventual patchwork quilt  one of these gaps in mrs assinghams completeness was her want of children the other was her want of wealth it was wonderful how little either in the fulness of time came to show sympathy and curiosity could render their objects practically filial just as an english husband who in his military years had run everything in his regiment could make economy blossom like the rose colonel  bob had a few years after his marriage left the army which had clearly by that time done its laudable all for the enrichment of his personal experience and he could thus give his whole time to the gardening in question there reigned among the younger friends of this couple a legend almost too venerable for historical criticism that the marriage itself the happiest of its class dated from the far twilight of the age a primitive period when such thingssuch things as american girls accepted as good enoughhad not begun to beso that the pleasant pair had been as to the risk taken on either side bold and original honourably marked for the evening of life as discoverers of a kind of hymeneal northwest passage mrs assingham knew better knew there had been no historic hour from that of pocahontas down when some young englishman hadnt precipitately believed and some american girl hadnt with a few more gradations availed herself to the full of her incapacity to doubt but she accepted resignedly the laurel of the founder since she was in fact pretty well the doyenne above ground of her transplanted tribe and since above all she had invented combinations though she had not invented bobs own it was he who had done that absolutely puzzled it out by himself from his first odd glimmerresting upon it moreover through the years to come as proof enough in him by itself of the higher cleverness if she kept her own cleverness up it was largely that he should have full credit there were moments in truth when she privately felt how littlestriking out as he had donehe could have afforded that she should show the common limits but mrs assinghams cleverness was in truth tested when her present visitor at last said to her i dont think you know that youre treating me quite right youve something on your mind that you dont tell me  it was positive too that her smile in reply was a trifle dim am i obliged to tell you everything i have on my mind  it isnt a question of everything but its a question of anything that may particularly concern me then you shouldnt keep it back you know with what care i desire to proceed taking everything into account and making no mistake that may possibly injure her  mrs assingham at this had after an instant an odd interrogation her  her and him both our friends either maggie or her father  i have something on my mind mrs assingham presently returned something has happened for which i hadnt been prepared but it isnt anything that properly concerns you  the prince with immediate gaiety threw back his head what do you mean by properly i somehow see volumes in it its the way people put a thing when they put itwell wrong i put things right what is it that has happened for me  his hostess the next moment had drawn spirit from his tone  oh i shall be delighted if youll take your share of it charlotte stant is in london she has just been here  miss stant oh really the prince expressed clear surprisea transparency through which his eyes met his friends with a certain hardness of concussion she has arrived from america he then quickly asked  she appears to have arrived this nooncoming up from southampton at an hotel she dropped upon me after luncheon and was here for more than an hour  the young man heard with interest though not with an interest too great for his gaiety you think then ive a share in it what is my share  why any you likethe one you seemed just now eager to take it was you yourself who insisted  he looked at her on this with conscious inconsistency and she could now see that he had changed colour but he was always easy  i didnt know then what the matter was  you didnt think it could be so bad  do you call it very bad the young man asked only she smiled because thats the way it seems to affect you  he hesitated still with the trace of his quickened colour still looking at her still adjusting his manner but you allowed you were upset  to the extentyesof not having in the least looked for her any more said mrs assingham than i judge maggie to have done  the prince thought then as if glad to be able to say something very natural and true noquite right maggie hasnt looked for her but im sure he added shell be delighted to see her  that certainlyand his hostess spoke with a different shade of gravity  shell be quite overjoyed the prince went on has miss stant now gone to her  she has gone back to her hotel to bring her things here i cant have her said mrs assingham alone at an hotel  no i see  if shes here at all she must stay with me he quite took it in so shes coming now  i expect her at any moment if you wait youll see her  oh he promptly declaredcharming but this word came out as if a little in sudden substitution for some other it sounded accidental whereas he wished to be firm that accordingly was what he next showed himself if it wasnt for whats going on these next days maggie would certainly want to have her in fact he lucidly continued isnt whats happening just a reason to make her want to mrs assingham for answer only looked at him and this the next instant had apparently had more effect than if she had spoken for he asked a question that seemed incongruous what has she come for  it made his companion laugh why for just what you say for your marriage  minehe wondered  maggiesits the same thing its for your great event and then said mrs assingham shes so lonely  has she given you that as a reason  i scarcely remembershe gave me so many she abounds poor dear in reasons but theres one that whatever she does i always remember for myself  and which is that he looked as if he ought to guess but couldnt  why the fact that she has no homeabsolutely none whatever shes extraordinarily alone  again he took it in and also has no great means  very small ones which is not however with the expense of railways and hotels a reason for her running to and fro  on the contrary but she doesnt like her country  hers my dear manits little enough hers the attribution for the moment amused his hostess she has rebounded nowbut she has had little enough else to do with it  oh i say hers the prince pleasantly explained very much as at this time of day i might say mine i quite feel i assure you as if the great place already more or less belonged to me  thats your good fortune and your point of view you ownor you soon practically will ownso much of it charlotte owns almost nothing in the world she tells me but two colossal trunksonly one of which i have given her leave to introduce into this house shell depreciate to you mrs assingham added your property  he thought of these things he thought of every thing but he had always his resource at hand of turning all to the easy has she come with designs upon me and then in a moment as if even this were almost too grave he sounded the note that had least to do with himself estelle toujours aussi belle that was the furthest point somehow to which charlotte stant could be relegated  mrs assingham treated it freely just the same the person in the world to my sense whose looks are most subject to appreciation its all in the way she affects you one admires her if one doesnt happen not to so as well one criticises her  ah thats not fair said the prince  to criticise her then there you are youre answered  im answered he took it humorously as his lessonsank his previous selfconsciousness with excellent effect in grateful docility i only meant that there are perhaps better things to be done with miss stant than to criticise her when once you begin that with anyone he was vague and kind  i quite agree that its better to keep out of it as long as one can but when one must do it  yes he asked as she paused then know what you mean  i see perhaps he smiled i dont know what i mean  well its what just now in all ways you particularly should know mrs assingham however made no more of this having before anything else apparently a scruple about the tone she had just used i quite understand of course that given her great friendship with maggie she should have wanted to be present she has acted impulsivelybut she has acted generously  she has acted beautifully said the prince  i say generously because i mean she hasnt in any way counted the cost shell have it to count in a manner now his hostess continued but that doesnt matter  he could see how little youll look after her  ill look after her  so its all right  its all right said mrs assingham   then why are you troubled  it pulled her upbut only for a minute im notany more than you  the princes dark blue eyes were of the finest and on occasion precisely resembled nothing so much as the high windows of a roman palace of an historic front by one of the great old designers thrown open on a feastday to the golden air his look itself at such times suggested an imagethat of some very noble personage who expected acclaimed by the crowd in the street and with old precious stuffs falling over the sill for his support had gaily and gallantly come to show himself always moreover less in his own interest than in that of spectators and subjects whose need to admire even to gape was periodically to be considered the young mans expression became after this fashion something vivid and concretea beautiful personal presence that of a prince in very truth a ruler warrior patron lighting up brave architecture and diffusing the sense of a function it had been happily said of his face that the figure thus appearing in the great frame was the ghost of some proudest ancestor whoever the ancestor now at all events the prince was for mrs assinghams benefit in view of the people he seemed leaning on crimson damask to take in the bright day he looked younger than his years he was beautiful innocent vague  oh well im not he rang out clear  i should like to see you sir she said for you wouldnt have a shadow of excuse he showed how he agreed that he would have been at a loss for one and the fact of their serenity was thus made as important as if some danger of its opposite had directly menaced them the only thing was that if the evidence of their cheer was so established mrs assingham had a little to explain her original manner and she came to this before they dropped the question my first impulse is always to behave about everything as if i feared complications but i dont fear them i really like them theyre quite my element   he deferred for her to this account of herself but still he said if were not in the presence of a complication  she hesitated a handsome clever odd girl staying with one is always a complication  the young man weighed it almost as if the question were new to him and will she stay very long  his friend gave a laugh how in the world can i know ive scarcely asked her  ah yes you cant  but something in the tone of it amused her afresh do you think you could  i he wondered  do you think you could get it out of her for methe probable length of her stay  he rose bravely enough to the occasion and the challenge i daresay if you were to give me the chance  here it is then for you she answered for she had heard within the minute the stop of a cab at her door shes back                                iii  it had been said as a joke but as after this they awaited their friend in silence the effect of the silence was to turn the time to gravitya gravity not dissipated even when the prince next spoke he had been thinking the case over and making up his mind a handsome clever odd girl staying with one was a complication mrs assingham so far was right but there were the factsthe good relations from schooldays of the two young women and the clear confidence with which one of them had arrived she can come you know at any time to us  mrs assingham took it up with an irony beyond laughter youd like her for your honeymoon  oh no you must keep her for that but why not after  she had looked at him a minute then at the sound of a voice in the corridor they had got up why not youre splendid charlotte stant the next minute was with them ushered in as she had alighted from her cab and prepared for not finding mrs assingham alonethis would have been to be noticedby the butlers answer on the stairs to a question put to him she could have looked at her hostess with such straightness and brightness only from knowing that the prince was also therethe discrimination of but a moment yet which let him take her in still better than if she had instantly faced him he availed himself of the chance thus given him for he was conscious of all these things what he accordingly saw for some seconds with intensity was a tall strong charming girl who wore for him at first exactly the look of her adventurous situation a suggestion in all her person in motion and gesture in free vivid yet altogether happy indications of dress from the becoming compactness of her hat to the shade of tan in her shoes of winds and waves and customhouses of far countries and long journeys the knowledge of how and where and the habit founded on experience of not being afraid he was aware at the same time that of this combination the strongminded note was not as might have been apprehended the basis he was now sufficiently familiar with englishspeaking types he had sounded attentively enough such possibilities for a quick vision of differences he had besides his own view of this young ladys strength of mind it was great he had ground to believe but it would never interfere with the play of her extremely personal her always amusing taste this last was the thing in herfor she threw it out positively on the spot like a lightthat she might have reappeared during these moments just to cool his worried eyes with he saw her in her light that immediate exclusive address to their friend was like a lamp she was holding aloft for his benefit and for his pleasure it showed him everythingabove all her presence in the world so closely so irretrievably contemporaneous with his own a sharp sharp fact sharper during these instants than any other at all even than that of his marriage but accompanied in a subordinate and controlled way with those others facial physiognomic that mrs assingham had been speaking of as subject to appreciation so they were these others as he met them again and that was the connection they instantly established with him if they had to be interpreted this made at least for intimacy there was but one way certainly for himto interpret them in the sense of the already known  making use then of clumsy terms of excess the face was too narrow and too long the eyes not large and the mouth on the other hand by no means small with substance in its lips and a slight the very slightest tendency to protrusion in the solid teeth otherwise indeed well arrayed and flashingly white but it was strangely as a cluster of possessions of his own that these things in charlotte stant now affected him items in a full list items recognised each of them as if for the long interval they had been stored wrapped up numbered put away in a cabinet while she faced mrs assingham the door of the cabinet had opened of itself he took the relics out one by one and it was more and more each instant as if she were giving him time he saw again that her thick hair was vulgarly speaking brown but that there was a shade of tawny autumn leaf in it for appreciationa colour indescribable and of which he had known no other case something that gave her at moments the sylvan head of a huntress he saw the sleeves of her jacket drawn to her wrists but he again made out the free arms within them to be of the completely rounded the polished slimness that florentine sculptors in the great time had loved and of which the apparent firmness is expressed in their old silver and old bronze he knew her narrow hands he knew her long fingers and the shape and colour of her fingernails he knew her special beauty of movement and line when she turned her back and the perfect working of all her main attachments that of some wonderful finished instrument something intently made for exhibition for a prize he knew above all the extraordinary fineness of her flexible waist the stem of an expanded flower which gave her a likeness also to some long loose silk purse well filled with gold pieces but having been passed empty through a fingerring that held it together it was as if before she turned to him he had weighed the whole thing in his open palm and even heard a little the chink of the metal when she did turn to him it was to recognise with her eyes what he might have been doing she made no circumstance of thus coming upon him save so far as the intelligence in her face could at any moment make a circumstance of almost anything if when she moved off she looked like a huntress she looked when she came nearer like his notion perhaps not wholly correct of a muse but what she said was simply you see youre not rid of me how is dear maggie  it was to come soon enough by the quite unforced operation of chance the young mans opportunity to ask her the question suggested by mrs assingham shortly before her entrance the license had he chosen to embrace it was within a few minutes all therethe license given him literally to inquire of this young lady how long she was likely to be with them for a matter of the mere domestic order had quickly determined on mrs assinghams part a withdrawal of a few moments which had the effect of leaving her visitors free mrs bettermans there she had said to charlotte in allusion to some member of the household who was to have received her and seen her belongings settled to which charlotte had replied that she had encountered only the butler who had been quite charming she had deprecated any action taken on behalf of her effects but her hostess rebounding from accumulated cushions evidently saw more in mrs bettermans nonappearance than could meet the casual eye what she saw in short demanded her intervention in spite of an earnest let me go from the girl and a prolonged smiling wail over the trouble she was giving the prince was quite aware at this moment that departure for himself was indicated the question of miss stants installation didnt demand his presence it was a case for one to go awayif one hadnt a reason for staying he had a reason howeverof that he was equally aware and he had not for a good while done anything more conscious and intentional than not quickly to take leave his visible insistencefor it came to thateven demanded of him a certain disagreeable effort the sort of effort he had mostly associated with acting for an idea his idea was there his idea was to find out something something he wanted much to know and to find it out not tomorrow not at some future time not in short with waiting and wondering but if possible before quitting the place this particular curiosity moreover confounded itself a little with the occasion offered him to satisfy mrs assinghams own he wouldnt have admitted that he was staying to ask a rude questionthere was distinctly nothing rude in his having his reasons it would be rude for that matter to turn ones back without a word or two on an old friend  well as it came to pass he got the word or two for mrs assinghams preoccupation was practically simplifying the little crisis was of shorter duration than our account of it duration naturally would have forced him to take up his hat he was somehow glad on finding himself alone with charlotte that he had not been guilty of that inconsequence not to be flurried was the kind of consistency he wanted just as consistency was the kind of dignity and why couldnt he have dignity when he had so much of the good conscience as it were on which such advantages rested he had done nothing he oughtnthe had in fact done nothing at all once more as a man conscious of having known many women he could assist as he would have called it at the recurrent the predestined phenomenon the thing always as certain as sunrise or the coming round of saints days the doing by the woman of the thing that gave her away she did it ever inevitably infalliblyshe couldnt possibly not do it it was her nature it was her life and the man could always expect it without lifting a finger this was his the mans any mans position and strengththat he had necessarily the advantage that he only had to wait with a decent patience to be placed in spite of himself it might really be said in the right just so the punctuality of performance on the part of the other creature was her weakness and her deep misfortunenot less no doubt than her beauty it produced for the man that extraordinary mixture of pity and profit in which his relation with her when he was not a mere brute mainly consisted and gave him in fact his most pertinent ground of being always nice to her nice about her nice for her she always dressed her act up of course she muffled and disguised and arranged it showing in fact in these dissimulations a cleverness equal to but one thing in the world equal to her abjection she would let it be known for anything for everything but the truth of which it was made that was what precisely charlotte stant would be doing now that was the present motive and support to a certainty of each of her looks and motions she was the twentieth woman she was possessed by her doom but her doom was also to arrange appearances and what now concerned him was to learn how she proposed he would help her would arrange with her to any point in reason the only thing was to know what appearance could best be produced and best be preserved produced and preserved on her part of course since on his own there had been luckily no folly to cover up nothing but a perfect accord between conduct and obligation  they stood there together at all events when the door had closed behind their friend with a conscious strained smile and very much as if each waited for the other to strike the note or give the pitch the young man held himself in his silent suspenseonly not more afraid because he felt her own fear she was afraid of herself however whereas to his gain of lucidity he was afraid only of her would she throw herself into his arms or would she be otherwise wonderful she would see what he would doso their queer minute without words told him and she would act accordingly but what could he do but just let her see that he would make anything everything for her as honourably easy as possible even if she should throw herself into his arms he would make that easyeasy that is to overlook to ignore not to remember and not by the same token either to regret this was not what in fact happened though it was also not at a single touch but by the finest gradations that his tension subsided its too delightful to be back she said at last and it was all she definitely gave himbeing moreover nothing but what anyone else might have said yet with two or three other things that on his response followed it it quite pointed the path while the tone of it and her whole attitude were as far removed as need have been from the truth of her situation the abjection that was present to him as of the essence quite failed to peep out and he soon enough saw that if she was arranging she could be trusted to arrange goodit was all he asked and all the more that he could admire and like her for it  the particular appearance she would as they said go in for was that of having no account whatever to give himit would be in fact that of having none to give anybodyof reasons or of motives of comings or of goings she was a charming young woman who had met him before but she was also a charming young woman with a life of her own she would take it highup up up ever so high well then he would do the same no height would be too great for them not even the dizziest conceivable to a young person so subtle the dizziest seemed indeed attained when after another moment she came as near as she was to come to an apology for her abruptness  ive been thinking of maggie and at last i yearned for her i wanted to see her happyand it doesnt strike me i find you too shy to tell me i shall  of course shes happy thank god only its almost terrible you know the happiness of young good generous creatures it rather frightens one but the blessed virgin and all the saints said the prince have her in their keeping  certainly they have shes the dearest of the dear but i neednt tell you the girl added  ah he returned with gravity i feel that ive still much to learn about her to which he subjoined shell rejoice awfully in your being with us  oh you dont need me charlotte smiled its her hour its a great hour one has seen often enough with girls what it is but that she said is exactly why why ive wanted i mean not to miss it  he bent on her a kind comprehending face you mustnt miss anything he had got it the pitch and he could keep it now for all he had needed was to have it given him the pitch was the happiness of his wife that was to bethe sight of that happiness as a joy for an old friend it was yes magnificent and not the less so for its coming to him suddenly as sincere as nobly exalted something in charlottes eyes seemed to tell him this seemed to plead with him in advance as to what he was to find in it he was eagerand he tried to show her that tooto find what she liked mindful as he easily could be of what the friendship had been for maggie it had been armed with the wings of young imagination young generosity it had been he believedalways counting out her intense devotion to her fatherthe liveliest emotion she had known before the dawn of the sentiment inspired by himself she had not to his knowledge invited the object of it to their wedding had not thought of proposing to her for a matter of a couple of hours an arduous and expensive journey but she had kept her connected and informed from week to week in spite of preparations and absorptions oh ive been writing to charlottei wish you knew her better he could still hear from recent weeks this record of the fact just as he could still be conscious not otherwise than queerly of the gratuitous element in maggies wish which he had failed as yet to indicate to her older and perhaps more intelligent at any rate why shouldnt charlotte respondand be quite free to respondto such fidelities with something more than mere formal good manners the relations of women with each other were of the strangest it was true and he probably wouldnt have trusted here a young person of his own race he was proceeding throughout on the ground of the immense differencedifficult indeed as it might have been to disembroil in this young person her race quality nothing in her definitely placed her she was a rare a special product her singleness her solitude her want of means that is her want of ramifications and other advantages contributed to enrich her somehow with an odd precious neutrality to constitute for her so detached yet so aware a sort of small social capital it was the only one she hadit was the only one a lonely gregarious girl could have since few surely had in anything like the same degree arrived at it and since this one indeed had compassed it but through the play of some gift of nature to which you could scarce give a definite name  it wasnt a question of her strange sense for tongues with which she juggled as a conjuror at a show juggled with balls or hoops or lighted brandsit wasnt at least entirely that for he had known people almost as polyglot whom their accomplishment had quite failed to make interesting he was polyglot himself for that matteras was the case too with so many of his friends and relations for none of whom more than for himself was it anything but a common convenience the point was that in this young woman it was a beauty in itself and almost a mystery so certainly he had more than once felt in noting on her lips that rarest among the barbarians of all civil graces a perfect felicity in the use of italian he had known strangersa few and mostly menwho spoke his own language agreeably but he had known neither man nor woman who showed for it charlottes almost mystifying instinct he remembered how from the first of their acquaintance she had made no display of it quite as if english between them his english so matching with hers were their inevitable medium he had perceived all by accidentby hearing her talk before him to somebody else that they had an alternative as good an alternative in fact as much better as the amusement for him was greater in watching her for the slips that never came her account of the mystery didnt suffice her recall of her birth in florence and florentine childhood her parents from the great country but themselves already of a corrupt generation demoralised falsified polyglot well before her with the tuscan balia who was her first remembrance the servants of the villa the dear contadini of the poder the little girls and the other peasants of the next podere all the rather shabby but still ever so pretty human furniture of her early time including the good sisters of the poor convent of the tuscan hills the convent shabbier than almost anything else but prettier too in which she had been kept at school till the subsequent phase the phase of the much grander institution in paris at which maggie was to arrive terribly frightened and as a smaller girl three years before her own ending of her period of five such reminiscences naturally gave a ground but they had not prevented him from insisting that some strictly civil ancestorgenerations back and from the tuscan hills if she wouldmade himself felt ineffaceably in her blood and in her tone she knew nothing of the ancestor but she had taken his theory from him gracefully enough as one of the little presents that make friendship flourish these matters however all melted together now though a sense of them was doubtless concerned not unnaturally in the next thing of the nature of a surmise that his discretion let him articulate you havent i rather gather particularly liked your country they would stick for the time to their english  it doesnt i fear seem particularly mine and it doesnt in the least matter over there whether one likes it or notthat is to anyone but ones self but i didnt like it said charlotte stant  thats not encouraging then to me is it the prince went on  do you mean because youre going  oh yes of course were going ive wanted immensely to go she hesitated but nowimmediately  in a month or twoit seems to be the new idea on which there was something in her faceas he imaginedthat made him say didnt maggie write to you  not of your going at once but of course you must go and of course you must staycharlotte was easily clearas long as possible  is that what you did he laughed you stayed as long as possible  well it seemed to me sobut i hadnt interests youll have themon a great scale its the country for interests said charlotte if i had only had a few i doubtless wouldnt have left it  he waited an instant they were still on their feet yours then are rather here  oh minethe girl smiled they take up little room wherever they are  it determined in him the way this came from her and what it somehow did for herit determined in him a speech that would have seemed a few minutes before precarious and in questionable taste the lead she had given him made the difference and he felt it as really a lift on finding an honest and natural word rise by its license to his lips nothing surely could be for both of them more in the note of a high bravery ive been thinking it all the while so probable you know that you would have seen your way to marrying  she looked at him an instant and just for these seconds he feared for what he might have spoiled to marrying whom  why some good kind clever rich american  again his security hung in the balancethen she was as he felt admirable  i tried everyone i came across i did my best i showed i had come quite publicly for that perhaps i showed it too much at any rate it was no use i had to recognise it no one would have me then she seemed to show as sorry for his having to hear of her anything so disconcerting she pitied his feeling about it if he was disappointed she would cheer him up existence you know all the same doesnt depend on that i mean she smiled on having caught a husband  ohexistence the prince vaguely commented you think i ought to argue for more than mere existence she asked i dont see why my existenceeven reduced as much as you like to being merely mineshould be so impossible there are things of sorts i should be able to havethings i should be able to be the position of a single woman today is very favourable you know  favourable to what  why just to existencewhich may contain after all in one way and another so much it may contain at the worst even affections affections in fact quite particularly fixed that is on ones friends im extremely fond of maggie for instance i quite adore her how could i adore her more if i were married to one of the people you speak of  the prince gave a laugh you might adore him more  ah but it isnt is it she asked a question of that  my dear friend he returned its always a question of doing the best for ones self one canwithout injury to others he felt by this time that they were indeed on an excellent basis so he went on again as if to show frankly his sense of its firmness i venture therefore to repeat my hope that youll marry some capital fellow and also to repeat my belief that such a marriage will be more favourable to you as you call it than even the spirit of the age  she looked at him at first only for answer and would have appeared to take it with meekness had she not perhaps appeared a little more to take it with gaiety thank you very much she simply said but at that moment their friend was with them again it was undeniable that as she came in mrs assingham looked with a certain smiling sharpness from one of them to the other the perception of which was perhaps what led charlotte for reassurance to pass the question on the prince hopes so much i shall still marry some good person  whether it worked for mrs assingham or not the prince was himself at this more than ever reassured he was safe in a wordthat was what it all meant and he had required to be safe he was really safe enough for almost any joke its only he explained to their hostess because of what miss stant has been telling me dont we want to keep up her courage if the joke was broad he had at least not begun itnot that is as a joke which was what his companions address to their friend made of it she has been trying in america she says but hasnt brought it off  the tone was somehow not what mrs assingham had expected but she made the best of it well then she replied to the young man if you take such an interest you must bring it off  and you must help dear charlotte said unperturbedas youve helped so beautifully in such things before with which before mrs assingham could meet the appeal she had addressed herself to the prince on a matter much nearer to him your mar riage is on fridayon saturday  oh on friday no for what do you take us theres not a vulgar omen were neglecting on saturday please at the oratory at three oclockbefore twelve assistants exactly  twelve including me  it struck himhe laughed youll make the thirteenth it wont do  not said charlotte if youre going in for omens should you like me to stay away  dear nowell manage well make the round numberwell have in some old woman they must keep them there for that dont they  mrs assinghams return had at last indicated for him his departure he had possessed himself again of his hat and approached her to take leave but he had another word for charlotte i dine tonight with mr verver have you any message  the girl seemed to wonder a little for mr verver  for maggieabout her seeing you early that i know is what shell like  then ill come earlythanks  i daresay he went on shell send for you i mean send a carriage  oh i dont require that thanks i can go for a penny cant i she asked of mrs assingham in an omnibus  oh i say said the prince while mrs assingham looked at her blandly  yes loveand ill give you the penny she shall get there the good lady added to their friend  but charlotte as the latter took leave of her thought of something else theres a great favour prince that i want to ask of you i want between this and saturday to make maggie a marriagepresent  oh i say the young man again soothingly exclaimed  ah but i must she went on its really almost for that i came back it was impossible to get in america what i wanted  mrs assingham showed anxiety what is it then dear you want  but the girl looked only at their companion thats what the prince if hell be so good must help me to decide  cant i mrs assingham asked help you to decide  certainly darling we must talk it well over and she kept her eyes on the prince but i want him if he kindly will to go with me to look i want him to judge with me and choose that if you can spare the hour she said is the great favour i mean  he raised his eyebrows at herhe wonderfully smiled what you came back from america to ask ah certainly then i must find the hour he wonderfully smiled but it was rather more after all than he had been reckoning with it went somehow so little with the rest that directly for him it wasnt the note of safety it preserved this character at the best but by being the note of publicity quickly quickly however the note of publicity struck him as better than any other in another moment even it seemed positively what he wanted for what so much as publicity put their relation on the right footing by this appeal to mrs assingham it was established as right and she immediately showed that such was her own understanding  certainly prince she laughed you must find the hour and it was really so express a license from her as representing friendly judgment public opinion the moral law the margin allowed a husband about to be or whatever that after observing to charlotte that should she come to portland place in the morn ing he would make a point of being there to see her and so easily arrange with her about a time he took his departure with the absolutely confirmed impression of knowing as he put it to himself where he was which was what he had prolonged his visit for he was where he could stay                                 iv  i dont quite see my dear colonel assingham said to his wife the night of charlottes arrival i dont quite see im bound to say why you take it even at the worst so ferociously hard it isnt your fault after all is it ill be hanged at any rate if its mine  the hour was late and the young lady who had disembarked at southampton that morning to come up by the steamer special and who had then settled herself at an hotel only to resettle herself a couple of hours later at a private house was by this time they might hope peacefully resting from her exploits there had been two men at dinner rather battered brothersinarms of his own period casually picked up by her host the day before and when the gentlemen after the meal rejoined the ladies in the drawingroom charlotte pleading fatigue had already excused herself the beguiled warriors however had stayed till after elevenmrs assingham though finally quite without illusions as she said about the military character was always beguiling to old soldiers and as the colonel had come in before dinner only in time to dress he had not till this moment really been summoned to meet his companion over the situation that as he was now to learn their visitors advent had created for them it was actually more than midnight the servants had been sent to bed the rattle of the wheels had ceased to come in through a window still open to the august air and robert assingham had been steadily learning all the while what it thus behoved him to know but the words just quoted from him presented themselves for the moment as the essence of his spirit and his attitude he disengaged he would be damned if he didntthey were both phrases he repeatedly usedhis responsibility the simplest the sanest the most obliging of men he habitually indulged in extravagant language his wife had once told him in relation to his violence of speech that such excesses on his part made her think of a retired general whom she had once seen playing with toy soldiers fighting and winning battles carrying on sieges and annihilating enemies with little fortresses of wood and little armies of tin her husbands exaggerated emphasis was his box of toy soldiers his military game it harmlessly gratified in him for his declining years the military instinct bad words when sufficiently numerous and arrayed in their might could represent battalions squadrons tremendous cannonades and glorious charges of cavalry it was natural it was delightfulthe romance and for her as well of camp life and of the perpetual booming of guns it was fighting to the end to the death but no one was ever killed  less fortunate than she nevertheless in spite of his wealth of expression he had not yet found the image that described her favourite game all he could do was practically to leave it to her emulating her own philosophy he had again and again sat up late to discuss those situations in which her finer consciousness abounded but he had never failed to deny that anything in life anything of hers could be a situation for himself she might be in fifty at once if she likedand it was what women did like at their ease after all there always being when they had too much of any some man as they were well aware to get them out he wouldnt at any price have one of any sort whatever of his own or even be in one along with her he watched her accordingly in her favourite element very much as he had sometimes watched at the aquarium the celebrated lady who in a slight though tight bathingsuit turned somersaults and did tricks in the tank of water which looked so cold and uncomfortable to the nonamphibious he listened to his companion tonight while he smoked his last pipe he watched her through her demonstration quite as if he had paid a shilling but it was true that this being the case he desired the value of his money what was it in the name of wonder that she was so bent on being responsible for what did she pretend was going to happen and what at the worst could the poor girl do even granting she wanted to do anything what at the worst for that matter could she be conceived to have in her head  if she had told me the moment she got here mrs assingham replied i shouldnt have my difficulty in finding out but she wasnt so obliging and i see no sign at all of her becoming so whats certain is that she didnt come for nothing she wants she worked it out at her leisureto see the prince again that isnt what troubles me i mean that such a fact as a fact isnt but what i ask myself is what does she want it for  whats the good of asking yourself if you know you dont know the colonel sat back at his own ease with an ankle resting on the other knee and his eyes attentive to the good appearance of an extremely slender foot which he kept jerking in its neat integument of finespun black silk and patent leather it seemed to confess this member to consciousness of military discipline everything about it being as polished and perfect as straight and tight and trim as a soldier on parade it went so far as to imply that someone or other would have got something or other confinement to barracks or suppression of pay if it hadnt been just as it was bob assingham was distinguished altogether by a leanness of person a leanness quite distinct from physical laxity which might have been determined on the part of superior powers by views of transport and accommodation and which in fact verged on the abnormal he did himself as well as his friends mostly knew yet remained hungrily thin with facial with abdominal cavities quite grim in their effect and with a consequent looseness of apparel that combined with a choice of queer light shades and of strange strawlike textures of the aspect of chinese mats provocative of wonder at his sources of supply suggested the habit of tropic islands a continual canebottomed chair a governorship exercised on wide verandahs his smooth round head with the particular shade of its white hair was like a silver pot reversed his cheekbones and the bristle of his moustache were worthy of attila the hun the hollows of his eyes were deep and darksome but the eyes within them were like little blue flowers plucked that morning he knew everything that could be known about life which he regarded as for far the greater part a matter of pecuniary arrangement his wife accused him of a want alike of moral and of intellectual reaction or rather indeed of a complete incapacity for either he never went even so far as to understand what she meant and it didnt at all matter since he could be in spite of the limitation a perfectly social creature the infirmities the predicaments of men neither surprised nor shocked him and indeedwhich was perhaps his only real loss in a thrifty career scarce even amused he took them for granted without horror classifying them after their kind and calculating results and chances he might in old bewildering climates in old campaigns of cruelty and license have had such revelations and known such amazements that he had nothing more to learn but he was wholly content in spite of his fondness in domestic discussion for the superlative degree and his kindness in the oddest way seemed to have nothing to do with his experience he could deal with things perfectly for all his needs without getting near them  this was the way he dealt with his wife a large proportion of whose meanings he knew he could neglect he edited for their general economy the play of her mind just as he edited savingly with the stump of a pencil her redundant telegrams the thing in the world that was least of a mystery to him was his club which he was accepted as perhaps too completely managing and which he managed on lines of perfect penetration his connection with it was really a masterpiece of editing this was in fact to come back very much the process he might have been proposing to apply to mrs assinghams view of what was now before them that is to their connection with charlotte stants possibilities they wouldnt lavish on them all their little fortune of curiosity and alarm certainly they wouldnt spend their cherished savings so early in the day he liked charlotte moreover who was a smooth and compact inmate and whom he felt as with her instincts that made against waste much more of his own sort than his wife he could talk with her about fanny almost better than he could talk with fanny about charlotte however he made at present the best of the latter necessity even to the pressing of the question he has been noted as having last uttered if you cant think what to be afraid of wait till you can think then youll do it much better or otherwise if thats waiting too long find out from her dont try to find out from me ask her herself  mrs assingham denied as we know that her husband had a play of mind so that she could on her side treat these remarks only as if they had been senseless physical gestures or nervous facial movements she overlooked them as from habit and kindness yet there was no one to whom she talked so persistently of such intimate things its her friendship with maggie thats the immense complication because that she audibly mused is so natural  then why cant she have come out for it  she came out mrs assingham continued to meditate because she hates america there was no place for her thereshe didnt fit in she wasnt in sympathyno more were the people she saw then its hideously dear she cant on her means begin to live there not at all as she can in a way here  in the way you mean of living with us  of living with anyone she cant live by visits aloneand she doesnt want to shes too good for it even if she could but she willshe must sooner or laterstay with them maggie will want hermaggie will make her besides shell want to herself  then why wont that do the colonel asked for you to think its what she has come for  how will it do howshe went on as without hearing him  thats what one keeps feeling  why shouldnt it do beautifully  that anything of the past she brooded should come back now how will it do how will it do  it will do i daresay without your wringing your hands over it when my dear the colonel pursued as he smoked have you ever seen anything of yoursanything that youve donenot do  ah i didnt do this it brought her answer straight i didnt bring her back  did you expect her to stay over there all her days to oblige you  not a bitfor i shouldnt have minded her coming after their marriage its her coming this way before to which she added with inconsequence im too sorry for herof course she cant enjoy it but i dont see what perversity rides her she neednt have looked it all so in the faceas she doesnt do it i suppose simply for discipline its almostthats the bore of itdiscipline to me  perhaps then said bob assingham thats what has been her idea take it for gods sake as discipline to you and have done with it it will do he added for discipline to me as well  she was far however from having done with it it was a situation with such different sides as she said and to none of which one could in justice be blind it isnt in the least you know for instance that i believe shes bad never never mrs assingham declared i dont think that of her  then why isnt that enough  nothing was enough mrs assingham signified but that she should develop her thought she doesnt deliberately intend she doesnt consciously wish the least complication its perfectly true that she thinks maggie a dearas who doesnt shes incapable of any plan to hurt a hair of her head yet here she isand there they are she wound up  her husband again for a little smoked in silence what in the world between them ever took place  between charlotte and the prince why nothingexcept their having to recognise that nothing could that was their little romanceit was even their little tragedy  but what the deuce did they do  do they fell in love with each otherbut seeing it wasnt possible gave each other up  then where was the romance  why in their frustration in their having the courage to look the facts in the face  what facts the colonel went on  well to begin with that of their neither of them having the means to marry if she had had even a littlea little i mean for twoi believe he would bravely have done it after which as her husband but emitted an odd vague sound she corrected herself i mean if he himself had had only a littleor a little more than a little a little for a prince they would have done what they couldshe did them justiceif there had been a way but there wasnt a way and charlotte quite to her honour i consider understood it he had to have moneyit was a question of life and death it wouldnt have been a bit amusing either to marry him as a pauperi mean leaving him one that was what she hadas he hadthe reason to see  and their reason is what you call their romance  she looked at him a moment what do you want more  didnt he the colonel inquired want anything more or didnt for that matter poor charlotte herself  she kept her eyes on him there was a manner in it that half answered they were thoroughly in love she might have been his she checked herself she even for a minute lost herself she might have been anything she likedexcept his wife  but she wasnt said the colonel very smokingly  she wasnt mrs assingham echoed  the echo not loud but deep filled for a little the room he seemed to listen to it die away then he began again how are you sure  she waited before saying but when she spoke it was definite there wasnt time  he had a small laugh for her reason he might have expected some other does it take so much time  she herself however remained serious it takes more than they had  he was detached but he wondered what was the matter with their time after which as remembering it all living it over and piecing it together she only considered you mean that you came in with your idea he demanded  it brought her quickly to the point and as if also in a measure to answer herself not a bit of itthen but you surely recall she went on the way a year ago everything took place they had parted before he had ever heard of maggie  why hadnt he heard of her from charlotte herself  because she had never spoken of her  is that also the colonel inquired what she has told you  im not speaking his wife returned of what she has told me thats one thing im speaking of what i know by myself thats another  you feel in other words that she lies to you bob assingham more sociably asked  she neglected the question treating it as gross she never so much at the time as named maggie  it was so positive that it appeared to strike him its he then who has told you  she after a moment admitted it its he  and he doesnt lie  noto do him justice i believe he absolutely doesnt if i hadnt believed it mrs assingham declared for her general justification i would have had nothing to do with himthat is in this connection hes a gentlemani mean all as much of one as he ought to be and he had nothing to gain that helps she added even a gentleman it was i who named maggie to hima year from last may he had never heard of her before  then its grave said the colonel  she hesitated do you mean grave for me  oh that everythings grave for you is what we take for granted and are fundamentally talking about its graveit was for charlotte and its grave for maggie that is it waswhen he did see her or when she did see him  you dont torment me as much as you would like she presently went on because you think of nothing that i havent a thousand times thought of and because i think of everything that you never will it would all she recognised have been grave if it hadnt all been right you cant make out she contended that we got to rome before the end of february  he more than agreed theres nothing in life my dear that i can make out  well there was nothing in life apparently that she at real need couldnt charlotte who had been there that year from early quite from november left suddenly youll quite remember about the 10th of april she was to have stayed onshe was to have stayed naturally more or less for us and she was to have stayed all the more that the ververs due all winter but delayed week after week in paris were at last really coming they were comingthat is maggie waslargely to see her and above all to be with her there it was all alteredby charlottes going to florence she went from one day to the otheryou forget everything she gave her reasons but i thought it odd at the time i had a sense that something must have happened the difficulty was that though i knew a little i didnt know enough i didnt know her relation with him had been as you say a near thingthat is i didnt know how near the poor girls departure was a flightshe went to save herself  he had listened more than he showedas came out in his tone to save herself  well also really i think to save him too i saw it afterwardsi see it all now he would have been sorryhe didnt want to hurt her  oh i daresay the colonel laughed they generally dont  at all events his wife pursued she escapedthey both did for they had had simply to face it their marriage couldnt be and if that was so the sooner they put the apennines between them the better it had taken them it is true some time to feel this and to find it out they had met constantly and not always publicly all that winter they had met more than was known though it was a good deal known more certainly she said than i then imaginedthough i dont know what difference it would after all have made with me i liked him i thought him charming from the first of our knowing him and now after more than a year he has done nothing to spoil it and there are things he might have donethings that many men easily would therefore i believe in him and i was right at first in knowing i was going to so i haventand she stated it as she might have quoted from a slate after adding up the items the sum of a column of figuresso i havent i say to myself been a fool  well are you trying to make out that ive said you have all their case wants at any rate bob assingham declared is that you should leave it well alone its theirs now theyve bought it over the counter and paid for it it has ceased to be yours  of which case she asked are you speaking  he smoked a minute then with a groan lord are there so many  theres maggies and the princes and theres the princes and charlottes  oh yes and then the colonel scoffed theres charlottes and the princes  theres maggies and charlottes she went onand theres also maggies and mine i think too that theres charlottes and mine yes she mused charlottes and mine is certainly a case in short you see there are plenty but i mean she said to keep my head  are we to settle them all he inquired tonight  i should lose it if things had happened otherwiseif i had acted with any folly she had gone on in her earnestness unheeding of his question i shouldnt be able to bear that now but my good conscience is my strength no one can accuse me the ververs came on to rome alonecharlotte after their days with her in florence had decided about america maggie i daresay had helped her she must have made her a present and a handsome one so that many things were easy charlotte left them came to england joined somebody or other sailed for new york i have still her letter from milan telling me i didnt know at the moment all that was behind it but i felt in it nevertheless the undertaking of a new life certainly in any case it cleared that airi mean the dear old roman in which we were steeped it left the field freeit gave me a free hand there was no question for me of anybody else when i brought the two others together more than that there was no question for them so you see she concluded where that puts me she got up on the words very much as if they were the blue daylight towards which through a darksome tunnel she had been pushing her way and the elation in her voice combined with her recovered alertness might have signified the sharp whistle of the train that shoots at last into the open she turned about the room she looked out a moment into the august night she stopped here and there before the flowers in bowls and vases yes it was distinctly as if she had proved what was needing proof as if the issue of her operation had been almost unexpectedly a success old arithmetic had perhaps been fallacious but the new settled the question her husband oddly however kept his place without apparently measuring these results as he had been amused at her intensity so he was not uplifted by her relief his interest might in fact have been more enlisted than he allowed do you mean he presently asked that he had already forgot about charlotte  she faced round as if he had touched a spring he wanted to naturallyand it was much the best thing he could do she was in possession of the main case as it truly seemed she had it all now he was capable of the effort and he took the best way remember too what maggie then seemed to us  shes very nice but she always seems to me more than anything else the young woman who has a million a year if you mean that thats what she especially seemed to him you of course place the thing in your light the effort to forget charlotte couldnt i grant you have been so difficult  this pulled her up but for an instant i never said he didnt from the firsti never said that he doesnt more and morelike maggies money  i never said i shouldnt have liked it myself bob assingham returned he made no movement he smoked another minute how much did maggie know  how much she seemed to consideras if it were between quarts and gallonshow best to express the quantity she knew what charlotte in florence had told her  and what had charlotte told her  very little  what makes you so sure  why thisthat she couldnt tell her and she explained a little what she meant there are things my dearhavent you felt it yourself coarse as you arethat no one could tell maggie there are things that upon my word i shouldnt care to attempt to tell her now  the colonel smoked on it shed be so scandalised  shed be so frightened shed be in her strange little way so hurt she wasnt born to know evil she must never know it bob assingham had a queer grim laugh the sound of which in fact fixed his wife before him were taking grand ways to prevent it  but she stood there to protest were not taking any ways the ways are all taken they were taken from the moment he came up to our carriage that day in villa borghesethe second or third of her days in rome when as you remember you went off somewhere with mr verver and the prince who had got into the carriage with us came home with us to tea they had met they had seen each other well they were in relation the rest was to come of itself and as it could it began practically i recollect in our drive maggie happened to learn by some other mans greeting of him in the bright roman way from a streetcorner as we passed that one of the princes baptismal names the one always used for him among his relations was amerigo which as you probably dont know however even after a lifetime of me was the name four hundred years ago or whenever of the pushing man who followed across the sea in the wake of columbus and succeeded where columbus had failed in becoming godfather or namefather to the new continent so that the thought of any connection with him can even now thrill our artless breasts  the colonels grim placidity could always quite adequately meet his wifes not infrequent imputation of ignorances on the score of the land of her birth unperturbed and unashamed and these dark depths were even at the present moment not directly lighted by an inquiry that managed to be curious without being apologetic but where does the connection come in  his wife was prompt by the womenthat is by some obliging woman of old who was a descendant of the pushing man the makebelieve discoverer and whom the prince is therefore luckily able to refer to as an ancestress a branch of the other family had become greatgreat enough at least to marry into his and the name of the navigator crowned with glory was very naturally to become so the fashion among them that some son of every generation was appointed to wear it my point is at any rate that i recall noticing at the time how the prince was from the start helped with the dear ververs by his wearing it the connection became romantic for maggie the moment she took it in she filled out in a flash every link that might be vague by that sign i quite said to myself hell conquerwith his good fortune of course of having the other necessary signs too it really said mrs assingham was practically the fine side of the wedge which struck me as also she wound up a lovely note for the candour of the ververs  the colonel took in the tale but his comment was prosaic he knew amerigo what he was about and i dont mean the old one  i know what you mean his wife bravely threw off  the old onehe pointed his effect isnt the only discoverer in the family  oh as much as you like if he discovered americaor got himself honoured as if he hadhis successors were in due time to discover the americans and it was one of them in particular doubtless who was to discover how patriotic we are  wouldnt this be the same one the colonel asked who really discovered what you call the connection  she gave him a look the connections a true thingthe connections perfectly historic your insinuations recoil upon your cynical mind dont you understand she asked that the history of such people is known root and branch at every moment of its course  oh its all right said bob assingham  go to the british museum his companion continued with spirit  and what am i to do there  theres a whole immense room or recess or department or whatever filled with books written about his family alone you can see for yourself  have you seen for your self  she faltered but an instant certainlyi went one day with maggie we looked him up so to say they were most civil and she fell again into the current her husband had slightly ruffled the effect was produced the charm began to work at all events in rome from that hour of the princes drive with us my only course afterwards had to be to make the best of it it was certainly good enough for that mrs assingham hastened to add and i didnt in the least see my duty in making the worst in the same situation today i wouldnt act differently i entered into the case as it then appeared to meand as for the matter of that it still does i liked it i thought all sorts of good of it and nothing can even now she said with some intensity make me think anything else  nothing can ever make you think anything you dont want to the colonel still in his chair remarked over his pipe youve got a precious power of thinking whatever you do want you want also from moment to moment to think such desperately different things what happened he went on was that you fell violently in love with the prince yourself and that as you couldnt get me out of the way you had to take some roundabout course you couldnt marry him any more than charlotte couldthat is not to yourself but you could to somebody elseit was always the prince it was always marriage you could to your little friend to whom there were no objections  not only there were no objections but there were reasons positive onesand all excellent all charming she spoke with an absence of all repudiation of his exposure of the spring of her conduct and this abstention clearly and effectively conscious evidently cost her nothing it is always the prince and it is always thank heaven marriage and these are the things god grant that it will always be that i could help a year ago most assuredly made me happy and it continues to make me happy  then why arent you quiet  i am quiet said fanny assingham  he looked at her with his colourless candour still in his place she moved about again a little emphasising by her unrest her declaration of her tranquillity he was as silent at first as if he had taken her answer but he was not to keep it long what do you make of it that by your own show charlotte couldnt tell her all what do you make of it that the prince didnt tell her anything say one understands that there are things she cant be toldsince as you put it she is so easily scared and shocked he produced these objections slowly giving her time by his pauses to stop roaming and come back to him but she was roaming still when he concluded his inquiry if there hadnt been anything there shouldnt have been between the pair before charlotte boltedin order precisely as you say that there shouldnt be why in the world was what there had been too bad to be spoken of  mrs assingham after this question continued still to circulatenot directly meeting it even when at last she stopped  i thought you wanted me to be quiet  so i doand im trying to make you so much so that you wont worry more cant you be quiet on that  she thought a momentthen seemed to try to relate that she had to bolt for the reasons we speak  of even though the bolting had done for her what she wishedthat i can perfectly feel charlottes not wanting to do  ah then if it has done for her what she wished but the colonels conclusion hung by the if which his wife didnt take up so it hung but the longer when he presently spoke again all one wonders in that case is why then she has come back to him  say she hasnt come back to him not really to him  ill say anything you like but that wont do me the same good as your saying it  nothing my dear will do you good mrs assingham returned you dont care for anything in itself you care for nothing but to be grossly amused because i dont keep washing my hands  i thought your whole argument was that everything is so right that this is precisely what you do  but his wife as it was a point she had often made could go on as she had gone on before youre perfectly indifferent really youre perfectly immoral youve taken part in the sack of cities and im sure youve done dreadful things yourself but i dont trouble my head if you like so now there she laughed  he accepted her laugh but he kept his way well i back poor charlotte  back her  to know what she wants  ah then so do i she does know what she wants and mrs assingham produced this quantity at last on the girls behalf as the ripe result of her late wanderings and musings she had groped through their talk for the thread and now she had got it she wants to be magnificent  she is said the colonel almost cynically  she wantshis wife now had it fast to be thoroughly superior and shes capable of that  of wanting to  of carrying out her idea  and what is her idea  to see maggie through  bob assingham wondered through what  through everything she knows the prince  and maggie doesnt no dear thingmrs assingham had to recognise itshe doesnt  so that charlotte has come out to give her lessons  she continued fanny assingham to work out her thought she has done this great thing for him that is a year ago she practically did it she practically at any rate helped him to do it himselfand helped me to help him she kept off she stayed away she left him free and what moreover were her silences to maggie but a direct aid to him if she had spoken in florence if she had told her own poor story if she had come back at any timetill within a few weeks ago if she hadnt gone to new york and hadnt held out there if she hadnt done these things all that has happened since would certainly have been different therefore shes in a position to be consistent now she knows the prince mrs assingham repeated it involved even again her former recognition and maggie dear thing doesnt  she was high she was lucid she was almost inspired and it was but the deeper drop therefore to her husbands flat common sense in other words maggie is by her ignorance in danger then if shes in danger there is danger  there wont bewith charlottes understanding of it thats where she has had her conception of being able to be heroic of being able in fact to be sublime she is she will bethe good lady by this time glowed so she sees itto become for her best friend an element of positive safety  bob assingham looked at it hard which of them do you call her best friend  she gave a toss of impatience ill leave you to discover but the grand truth thus made out she had now completely adopted its for us therefore to be hers  hers  you and i its for us to be charlottes its for us on our side to see her through  through her sublimity  through her noble lonely life onlythats essentialit mustnt be lonely it will be all right if she marries  so were to marry her  were to marry her it will be mrs assingham continued the great thing i can do she made it out more and more it will make up  make up for what as she said nothing however his desire for lucidity renewed itself if everythings so all right what is there to make up for  why if i did do either of them by any chance a wrong if i made a mistake  youll make up for it by making another and then as she again took her time i thought your whole point is just that youre sure  one can never be ideally sure of anything there are always possibilities  then if we can but strike so wild why keep meddling  it made her again look at him where would you have been my dear if i hadnt meddled with you  ah that wasnt meddlingi was your own i was your own said the colonel from the moment i didnt object  well these people wont object they are my own tooin the sense that im awfully fond of them also in the sense she continued that i think theyre not so very much less fond of me our relation all round existsits a reality and a very good one were mixed up so to speak and its too late to change it we must live in it and with it therefore to see that charlotte gets a good husband as soon as possiblethat as i say will be one of my ways of living it will cover she said with conviction all the ground and then as his own conviction appeared to continue as little to match the ground i mean of any nervousness i may ever feel it will be in fact my duty and i shant rest till my dutys performed she had arrived by this time at something like exaltation i shall give for the next year or two if necessary my life to it i shall have done in that case what i can  he took it at last as it came you hold theres no limit to what you can  i dont say theres no limit or anything of the sort i say there are good chancesenough of them for hope why shouldnt there be when a girl is after all all that she is  by after all you mean after shes in love with somebody else  the colonel put his question with a quietude doubtless designed to be fatal but it scarcely pulled her up shes not too much in love not herself to want to marry she would now particularly like to  has she told you so  not yet its too soon but she will meanwhile however i dont require the information her marrying will prove the truth  and what truth  the truth of everything i say  prove it to whom  well to myself to begin with that will be enough for meto work for her what it will prove mrs assingham presently went on will be that shes cured that she accepts the situation  he paid this the tribute of a long pull at his pipe the situation of doing the one thing she can that will really seem to cover her tracks  his wife looked at him the good dry man as if now at last he was merely vulgar the one thing she can do that will really make new tracks altogether the thing that before any other will be wise and right the thing that will best give her her chance to be magnificent  he slowly emitted his smoke and best give you by the same token yours to be magnificent with her  i shall be as magnificent at least as i can  bob assingham got up and you call me immoral  she hesitated ill call you stupid if you prefer but stupidity pushed to a certain point is you know immorality just so what is morality but high intelligence this he was unable to tell her which left her more definitely to conclude besides its all at the worst great fun  oh if you simply put it at that  his implication was that in this case they had a common ground yet even thus he couldnt catch her by it oh i dont mean she said from the threshold the fun that you mean goodnight in answer to which as he turned out the electric light he gave an odd short groan almost a grunt he had apparently meant some particular kind                                v  well now i must tell you for i want to be absolutely honest so charlotte spoke a little ominously after they had got into the park i dont want to pretend and i cant pretend a moment longer you may think of me what you will but i dont care i knew i shouldnt and i find now how little i came back for this not really for anything else for this she repeated as under the influence of her tone the prince had already come to a pause  for this he spoke as if the particular thing she indicated were vague to himor were rather a quantity that couldnt at the most be much  it would be as much however as she should be able to make it to have one hour alone with you it had rained heavily in the night and though the pavements were now dry thanks to a cleansing breeze the august morning with its hovering thickdrifting clouds and freshened air was cool and grey the multitudinous green of the park had been deepened and a wholesome smell of irrigation purging the place of dust and of odours less acceptable rose from the earth charlotte had looked about her with expression from the first of their coming in quite as if for a deep greeting for general recognition the day was even in the heart of london of a rich lowbrowed weatherwashed english type it was as if it had been waiting for her as if she knew it placed it loved it as if it were in fact a part of what she had come back for so far as this was the case the impression of course could only be lost on a mere vague italian it was one of those for which you had to be blessedly an americanas indeed you had to be blessedly an american for all sorts of things so long as you hadnt blessedly or not to remain in america the prince had by halfpast tenas also by definite appointmentcalled in cadogan place for mrs assinghams visitor and then after brief delay the two had walked together up sloane street and got straight into the park from knightsbridge the understanding to this end had taken its place after a couple of days as inevitably consequent on the appeal made by the girl during those first moments in mrs assinghams drawingroom it was an appeal the couple of days had done nothing to invalidateeverything much rather to place in a light and as to which obviously it wouldnt have fitted that anyone should raise an objection who was there for that matter to raise one from the moment mrs assingham informed and apparently not disapproving didnt intervene this the young man had asked himselfwith a very sufficient sense of what would have made him ridiculous he wasnt going to beginthat at least was certainby showing a fear even had fear at first been sharp in him moreover it would already not a little have dropped so happy all round so propitious he quite might have called it had been the effect of this rapid interval  the time had been taken up largely by his active reception of his own weddingguests and by maggies scarce less absorbed entertainment of her friend whom she had kept for hours together in portland place whom she had not as wouldnt have been convenient invited altogether as yet to migrate but who had been present with other persons his contingent at luncheon at tea at dinner at perpetual repastshe had never in his life it struck him had to reckon with so much eatingwhenever he had looked in if he had not again till this hour save for a minute seen charlotte alone so positively all the while he had not seen even maggie and if therefore he had not seen even maggie nothing was more natural than that he shouldnt have seen charlotte the exceptional minute a mere snatch at the tail of the others on the huge portland place staircase had sufficiently enabled the girl to remind himso ready she assumed him to be of what they were to do time pressed if they were to do it at all everyone had brought gifts his relations had brought wondershow did they still have where did they still find such treasures she only had brought nothing and she was ashamed yet even by the sight of the rest of the tribute she wouldnt be put off she would do what she could and he was unknown to maggie he must remember to give her his aid he had prolonged the minute so far as to take time to hesitate for a reason and then to risk bringing his reason out the risk was because he might hurt herhurt her pride if she had that particular sort but she might as well be hurt one way as another and besides that particular sort of pride was just what she hadnt so his slight resistance while they lingered had been just easy enough not to be impossible  i hate to encourage youand for such a purpose after allto spend your money  she had stood a stair or two below him where while she looked up at him beneath the high domed light of the hall she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenthcentury english because you think i must have so little ive enough at any rateenough for us to take our hour enough she had smiled is as good as a feast and then she had said it isnt of course a question of anything expensive gorged with treasure as maggie is it isnt a question of competing or outshining what naturally in the way of the priceless hasnt she got mine is to be the offering of the poorsomething precisely thatno rich person could ever give her and that being herself too rich ever to buy it she would therefore never have charlotte had spoken as if after so much thought only as it cant be fine it ought to be funnyand thats the sort of thing to hunt for hunting in london besides is amusing in itself  he recalled even how he had been struck with her word funny oh i dont mean a comic toyi mean some little thing with a charm but absolutely right in its comparative cheapness thats what i call funny she had explained you used she had also added to help me to get things cheap in rome you were splendid for beating down i have them all still i neednt saythe little bargains i there owed you there are bargains in london in august  ah but i dont understand your english buying and i confess i find it dull so much as that while they turned to go up together he had objected i understood my poor dear romans  it was they who understood youthat was your pull she had laughed our amusement here is just that they dont understand us we can make it amusing youll see  if he had hesitated again it was because the point permitted the amusement surely will be to find our present  certainlyas i say  well if they dont come down  then well come up theres always something to be done besides prince she had gone on im not if you come to that absolutely a pauper im too poor for some things she had saidyet strange as she was lightly enough but im not too poor for others and she had paused again at the top ive been saving up  he had really challenged it in america  yes even therewith my motive and we oughtnt you know she had wound up to leave it beyond tomorrow  that definitely with ten words more was what had passedhe feeling all the while how any sort of beggingoff would only magnify it he might get on with things as they were but he must do anything rather than magnify besides which it was pitiful to make her beg of him he was making hershe had begged and this for a special sensibility in him didnt at all do that was accordingly in fine how they had come to where they were he was engaged as hard as possible in the policy of not magnifying he had kept this up even on her making a pointand as if it were almost the whole pointthat maggie of course was not to have an idea half the interest of the thing at least would be that she shouldnt suspect therefore he was completely to keep it from heras charlotte on her side wouldthat they had been anywhere at all together or had so much as seen each other for five minutes alone the absolute secrecy of their little excursion was in short of the essence she appealed to his kindness to let her feel that he didnt betray her there had been something frankly a little disconcerting in such an appeal at such an hour on the very eve of his nuptials it was one thing to have met the girl casually at mrs assinghams and another to arrange with her thus for a morning practically as private as their old mornings in rome and practically not less intimate he had immediately told maggie the same evening of the minutes that had passed between them in cadogan placethough not mentioning those of mrs assinghams absence any more than he mentioned the fact of what their friend had then with such small delay proposed but what had briefly checked his assent to any present to any positive making of mysterywhat had made him while they stood at the top of the stairs demur just long enough for her to notice itwas the sense of the resemblance of the little plan before him to occasions of the past from which he was quite disconnected from which he could only desire to be this was like beginning something over which was the last thing he wanted the strength the beauty of his actual position was in its being wholly a fresh start was that what it began would be new altogether these items of his consciousness had clustered so quickly that by the time charlotte read them in his face he was in presence of what they amounted to she had challenged them as soon as read them had met them with a do you want then to go and tell her that had somehow made them ridiculous it had made him promptly fall back on minimizing itthat is on minimizing fuss apparent scruples were obviously fuss and he had on the spot clutched in the light of this truth at the happy principle that would meet every case  this principle was simply to be with the girl always simple and with the very last simplicity that would cover everything it had covered then and there certainly his immediate submission to the sight of what was clearest this was really that what she asked was little compared to what she gave what she gave touched him as she faced him for it was the full tune of her renouncing she really renouncedrenounced everything and without even insisting now on what it had all been for her her only insistence was her insistence on the small matter of their keeping their appointment to themselves that in exchange for everything everything she gave up was verily but a trifle he let himself accordingly be guided he so soon assented for enlightened indulgence to any particular turn she might wish the occasion to take that the stamp of her preference had been well applied to it even while they were still in the park the application in fact presently required that they should sit down a little really to see where they were in obedience to which propriety they had some ten minutes of a quality quite distinct in a couple of pennychairs under one of the larger trees they had taken for their walk to the cropped rainfreshened grass after finding it already dry and the chairs turned away from the broad alley the main drive and the aspect of park lane looked across the wide reaches of green which seemed in a manner to refine upon their freedom they helped charlotte thus to make her positionher temporary positionstill more clear and it was for this purpose obviously that abruptly on seeing her opportunity she sat down he stood for a little before her as if to mark the importance of not wasting time the importance she herself had previously insisted on but after she had said a few words it was impossible for him not to resort again to goodnature he marked as he could by this concession that if he had finally met her first proposal for what would be amusing in it so any idea she might have would contribute to that effect he had consequently in all consistencyto treat it as amusing that she reaffirmed and reaffirmed again the truth that was her truth  i dont care what you make of it and i dont ask anything whatever of youanything but this i want to have said it thats all i want not to have failed to say it to see you once and be with you to be as we are now and as we used to be for one small houror say for twothats what i have had for weeks in my head i mean of course to get it beforebefore what youre going to do so all the while you see she went on with her eyes on him it was a question for me if i should be able to manage it in time if i couldnt have come now i probably shouldnt have come at allperhaps even ever now that im here i shall stay but there were moments over there when i despaired it wasnt easythere were reasons but it was either this or nothing so i didnt struggle you see in vain after oh i didnt want that i dont mean she smiled that it wouldnt have been delightful to see you even thento see you at any time but i would never have come for it this is different this is what i wanted this is what ive got this is what i shall always have this is what i should have missed of course she pursued if you had chosen to make me miss it if you had thought me horrid had refused to come i should naturally have been immensely sold i had to take the risk well youre all i could have hoped thats what i was to have said i didnt want simply to get my time with you but i wanted you to know i wanted youshe kept it up slowly softly with a small tremor of voice but without the least failure of sense or sequencei wanted you to understand i wanted you that is to hear i dont care i think whether you understand or not if i ask nothing of you i donti mayntask even so much as that what you may think of methat doesnt in the least matter what i want is that it shall always be with youso that youll never be able quite to get rid of itthat i did i wont say that you didyou may make as little of that as you like but that i was here with you where we are and as we arei just saying this giving myself in other words awayand perfectly willing to do it for nothing thats all  she paused as if her demonstration was completeyet for the moment without moving as if in fact to give it a few minutes to sink in into the listening air into the watching space into the conscious hospitality of nature so far as nature was all londonised all vulgarised with them there or even for that matter into her own open ears rather than into the attention of her passive and prudent friend his attention had done all that attention could do his handsome slightly anxious yet still more definitely amused face sufficiently played its part he clutched however at what he could best clutch atthe fact that she let him off definitely let him off she let him off it seemed even from so much as answering so that while he smiled back at her in return for her information he felt his lips remain closed to the successive vaguenesses of rejoinder of objection that rose for him from within charlotte herself spoke again at lastyou may want to know what i get by it but thats my own affair he really didnt want to know even thisor continued for the safest plan quite to behave as if he didnt which prolonged the mere dumbness of diversion in which he had taken refuge he was glad when finallythe point she had wished to make seeming established to her satisfactionthey brought to what might pass for a close the moment of his life at which he had had least to say movement and progress after this with more impersonal talk were naturally a relief so that he was not again during their excursion at a loss for the right word the air had been as it were cleared they had their errand itself to discuss and the opportunities of london the sense of the wonderful place the pleasures of prowling there the question of shops of possibilities of particular objects noticed by each in previous prowls each professed surprise at the extent of the others knowledge the prince in especial wondered at his friends possession of her london he had rather prized his own possession the guidance he could really often give a cabman it was a whim of his own a part of his anglomania and congruous with that feature which had after all so much more surface than depth when his companion with the memory of other visits and other rambles spoke of places he hadnt seen and things he didnt know he actually felt againas half the effectjust a shade humiliated he might even have felt a trifle annoyedif it hadnt been on this spot for his being even more interested it was a fresh light on charlotte and on her curious worldquality of which in rome he had had his due sense but which clearly would show larger on the big london stage rome was in comparison a village a familyparty a little oldworld spinnet for the fingers of one hand by the time they reached the marble arch it was almost as if she were showing him a new side and that in fact gave amusement a new and a firmer basis the right tone would be easy for putting himself in her hands should they disagree a littlefrankly and fairlyabout directions and chances values and authenticities the situation would be quite gloriously saved they were none the less as happened much of one mind on the article of their keeping clear of resorts with which maggie would be acquainted charlotte recalled it as a matter of course named it in time as a conditionthey would keep away from any place to which he had already been with maggie  this made indeed a scant difference for though he had during the last month done few things so much as attend his future wife on her making of purchases the antiquarii as he called them with charlotte had not been the great affair except in bond street really maggie had had no use for them her situation indeed in connection with that order of traffic was full of consequences produced by her fathers mr verver one of the great collectors of the world hadnt left his daughter to prowl for herself he had little to do with shops and was mostly as a purchaser approached privately and from afar great people all over europe sought introductions to him high personages incredibly high and more of them than would ever be known solemnly sworn as everyone was in such cases to discretion high personages made up to him as the one man on the short authentic list likely to give the price it had therefore been easy to settle as they walked that the tracks of the ververs daughters as well as fathers were to be avoided the importance only was that their talk about it led for a moment to the first words they had as yet exchanged on the subject of maggie charlotte still in the park proceeded to themfor it was she who beganwith a serenity of appreciation that was odd certainly as a sequel to her words of ten minutes before this was another note on herwhat he would have called another lightfor her companion who though without giving a sign admired for what it was the simplicity of her transition a transition that took no trouble either to trace or to explain itself she paused again an instant on the grass to make it she stopped before him with a sudden anything of course dear as she is will do for her i mean if i were to give her a pincushion from the bakerstreet bazaar  thats exactly what i meantthe prince laughed out this allusion to their snatch of talk in portland place its just what i suggested  she took however no notice of the reminder she went on in her own way but it isnt a reason in that case one would never do anything for her i mean charlotte explained if one took advantage of her character  of her character  we mustnt take advantage of her character the girl again unheeding pursued one mustnt if not for her at least for ones self she saves one such trouble  she had spoken thoughtfully with her eyes on her friends she might have been talking preoccupied and practical of someone with whom he was comparatively unconnected she certainly gives one no trouble said the prince and then as if this were perhaps ambiguous or inadequate shes not selfishgod forgive herenough  thats what i mean charlotte instantly said shes not selfish enough theres nothing absolutely that one need do for her shes so modest she developedshe doesnt miss things i mean if you love heror rather i should say if she loves you she lets it go  the prince frowned a littleas a tribute after all to seriousness she lets what  anythinganything that you might do and that you dont she lets everything go but her own disposition to be kind to you its of herself that she asks effortsso far as she ever has to ask them she hasnt much she does everything herself and thats terrible  the prince had listened but always with propriety he didnt commit himself terrible  well unless one is almost as good as she it makes too easy terms for one it takes stuff within one so far as ones decency is concerned to stand it and nobody charlotte continued in the same manner is decent enough good enough to stand itnot without help from religion or something of that kind not without prayer and fastingthat is without taking great care certainly she said such people as you and i are not  the prince obligingly thought an instant not good enough to stand it  well not good enough not rather to feel the strain we happen each i think to be of the kind that are easily spoiled  her friend again for propriety followed the argument oh i dont know may not ones affection for her do something more for ones decency as you call it than her own generosityher own affection her decencyhas the unfortunate virtue to undo  ah of course it must be all in that  but she had made her question all the same interesting to him what it comes toone can see what you meanis the way she believes in one that is if she believes at all  yes thats what it comes to said charlotte stant  and why he asked almost soothingly should it be terrible he couldnt at the worst see that  because its always sothe idea of having to pity people  not when theres also with it the idea of helping them  yes but if we cant help them  we canwe always can that is he competently added if we care for them and thats what were talking about  yesshe on the whole assented it comes back then to our absolutely refusing to be spoiled  certainly but everything the prince laughed as they went on all your decency i meancomes back to that  she walked beside him a moment its just what i meant she then reasonably said                                vi  the man in the little shop in which well after this they lingered longest the small but interesting dealer in the bloomsbury street who was remarkable for an insistence not importunate inasmuch as it was mainly mute but singularly intensely coercivethis personage fixed on his visitors an extraordinary pair of eyes and looked from one to the other while they considered the object with which he appeared mainly to hope to tempt them they had come to him last for their time was nearly up an hour of it at least from the moment of their getting into a hansom at the marble arch having yielded no better result than the amusement invoked from the first the amusement of course was to have consisted in seeking but it had also involved the idea of finding which latter necessity would have been obtrusive only if they had found too soon the question at present was if they were finding and they put it to each other in the bloomsbury shop while they enjoyed the undiverted attention of the shopman he was clearly the master and devoted to his businessthe essence of which in his conception might precisely have been this particular secret that he possessed for worrying the customer so little that it fairly made for their relations a sort of solemnity he had not many things none of the redundancy of rot they had elsewhere seen and our friends had on entering even had the sense of a muster so scant that as high values obviously wouldnt reign the effect might be almost pitiful then their impression had changed for though the show was of small pieces several taken from the little window and others extracted from a cupboard behind the counterdusky in the rather lowbrowed place despite its glass doorseach bid for their attention spoke however modestly for itself and the pitch of their entertainers pretensions was promptly enough given his array was heterogeneous and not at all imposing still it differed agreeably from what they had hitherto seen  charlotte after the incident was to be full of impressions of several of which later on she gave her companionalways in the interest of their amusementthe benefit and one of the impressions had been that the man himself was the greatest curiosity they had looked at the prince was to reply to this that he himself hadnt looked at him as precisely in the general connection charlotte had more than once from other days noted for his advantage her consciousness of how below a certain social plane he never saw one kind of shopman was just like another to himwhich was oddly inconsequent on the part of a mind that where it did notice noticed so much he took throughout always the meaner sort for grantedthe night of their meanness or whatever name one might give it for him made all his cats grey he didnt no doubt want to hurt them but he imaged them no more than if his eyes acted only for the level of his own high head her own vision acted for every relationthis he had seen for himself she remarked beggars she remembered servants she recognised cabmen she had often distinguished beauty when out with him in dirty children she had admired type in faces at hucksters stalls therefore on this occasion she had found their antiquario interesting partly because he cared so for his things and partly because he cared well so for them he likes his thingshe loves them she was to say and it isnt onlyit isnt perhaps even at allthat he loves to sell them i think he would love to keep them if he could and he prefers at any rate to sell them to right people we clearly were right peoplehe knows them when he sees them and thats why as i say you could make out or at least i could that he cared for us didnt you seeshe was to ask it with an insistencethe way he looked at us and took us in i doubt if either of us have ever been so well looked at before yes hell remember usshe was to profess herself convinced of that almost to uneasiness but it was after allthis was perhaps reassuringbecause given his taste since he has taste he was pleased with us he was struckhe had ideas about us well i should think people might were beautifularent weand he knows then also he has his way for that way of saying nothing with his lips when hes all the while pressing you so with his face which shows how he knows you feel itthat is a regular way  of

completed the discreet cluster in which however even after tentative reinforcement from several quaint rings intaglios amethysts carbuncles each of which had found a home in the ancient sallow satin of some weaklysnapping little box there was in spite of the due proportion of faint poetry no great force of persuasion they looked the visitors they touched they vaguely pretended to consider but with scepticism so far as courtesy permitted in the quality of their attention it was impossible they shouldnt after a little tacitly agree as to the absurdity of carrying to maggie a token from such a stock it would bethat was the difficultypretentious without being good too usual as a treasure to have been an inspiration of the giver and yet too primitive to be taken as tribute welcome on any terms they had been out more than two hours and evidently had found nothing it forced from charlotte a kind of admission  it ought really if it should be a thing of this sort to take its little value from having belonged to ones self  ecco said the princejust triumphantly enough there you are  behind the dealer were sundry small cupboards in the wall two or three of these charlotte had seen him open so that her eyes found themselves resting on those he had not visited but she completed her admission theres nothing here she could wear  it was only after a moment that her companion rejoined is there anythingdo you thinkthat you could  it made her just start she didnt at all events look at the objects she but looked for an instant very directly at him no  ah the prince quietly exclaimed  would it be charlotte asked your idea to offer me something  well why notas a small ricordo  but a ricordo of what  why of thisas you yourself say of this little hunt  oh i say itbut hasnt my whole point been that i dont ask you to therefore she demandedbut smiling at him now wheres the logic  oh the logic he laughed  but logics everything that at least is how i feel it a ricordo from youfrom you to meis a ricordo of nothing it has no reference  ah my dear he vaguely protested their entertainer meanwhile stood there with his eyes on them and the girl though at this minute more interested in her passage with her friend than in anything else again met his gaze it was a comfort to her that their foreign tongue covered what they said and they might have appeared of course as the prince now had one of the snuffboxes in his hand to be discussing a purchase  you dont refer she went on to her companion i refer  he had lifted the lid of his little box and he looked into it hard do you mean by that then that you would be free  free  to offer me something  this gave her a longer pause and when she spoke again she might have seemed oddly to be addressing the dealer would you allow me  no said the prince into his little box  you wouldnt accept it from me  no he repeated in the same way  she exhaled a long breath that was like a guarded sigh but youve touched an idea that has been mine its what ive wanted then she added it was what i hoped  he put down his boxthis had drawn his eyes he made nothing clearly of the little mans attention its what you brought me out for  well thats at any rate she returned my own affair but it wont do  it wont do cara mia  its impossible  its impossible and he took up one of the brooches  she had another pause while the shopman only waited if i were to accept from you one of these charming little ornaments as you suggest what should i do with it  he was perhaps at last a little irritated he evenas if he might understandlooked vaguely across at their host wear it per bacco  where then please under my clothes  wherever you like but it isnt then if you will he added worth talking about  its only worth talking about mio caro she smiled from your having begun it my question is only reasonableso that your idea may stand or fall by your answer to it if i should pin one of these things on for you would it be to your mind that i might go home and show it to maggie as your present  they had had between them often in talk the refrain jocosely descriptively applied of old roman it had been as a pleasantry in the other time his explanation to her of everything but nothing truly had even seemed so oldroman as the shrug in which he now indulged why in the world not  becauseon our basisit would be impossible to give her an account of the pretext  the pretext he wondered  the occasion this ramble that we shall have had together and that were not to speak of  oh yes he said after a moment i remember were not to speak of it  that of course youre pledged to and the one thing you see goes with the other so you dont insist  he had again at random laid back his trinket with which he quite turned to her a little wearily at lasteven a little impatiently i dont insist  it disposed for the time of the question but what was next apparent was that it had seen them no further the shopman who had not stirred stood there in his patiencewhich his mute intensity helping had almost the effect of an ironic comment the prince moved to the glass door and his back to the others as with nothing more to contribute lookedthough not less patientlyinto the street then the shopman for charlotte momentously broke silence youve seen disgraziatamente signora principessa he sadly said too muchand it made the prince face about for the effect of the momentous came if not from the sense from the sound of his words which was that of the suddenest sharpest italian charlotte exchanged with her friend a glance that matched it and just for the minute they were held in check but their glance had after all by that time said more than one thing had both exclaimed on the apprehension by the wretch of their intimate conversation let alone of her possible her impossible title and remarked for mutual reassurance that it didnt all the same matter the prince remained by the door but immediately addressing the speaker from where he stood  youre italian then are you  but the reply came in english oh dear no  youre english  to which the answer was this time with a smile in briefest italian che the dealer waived the questionhe practically disposed of it by turning straightway toward a receptacle to which he had not yet resorted and from which after unlocking it he extracted a square box of some twenty inches in height covered with wornlooking leather he placed the box on the counter pushed back a pair of small hooks lifted the lid and removed from its nest a drinkingvessel larger than a common cup yet not of exorbitant size and formed to appearance either of old fine gold or of some material once richly gilt he handled it with tenderness with ceremony making a place for it on a small satin mat my golden bowl he observedand it sounded on his lips as if it said everything he left the important objectfor as important it did somehow present itselfto produce its certain effect simple but singularly elegant it stood on a circular foot a short pedestal with a slightly spreading base and though not of signal depth justified its title by the charm of its shape as well as by the tone of its surface it might have been a large goblet diminished to the enhancement of its happy curve by half its original height as formed of solid gold it was impressive it seemed indeed to warn off the prudent admirer charlotte with care immediately took it up while the prince who had after a minute shifted his position again regarded it from a distance  it was heavier than charlotte had thought gold really gold she asked of their companion  he hesitated look a little and perhaps youll make out  she looked holding it up in both her fine hands turning it to the light it may be cheap for what it is but it will be dear im afraid for me  well said the man i can part with it for less than its value i got it you see for less  for how much then  again he waited always with his serene stare do you like it then  charlotte turned to her friend do you like it he came no nearer he looked at their companion cose  well signori miei if you must know its just a perfect crystal  of course we must know per dio said the prince but he turned away againhe went back to his glass door  charlotte set down the bowl she was evidently taken do you mean its cut out of a single crystal  if it isnt i think i can promise you that youll never find any joint or any piecing  she wondered even if i were to scrape off the gold  he showed though with due respect that she amused him you couldnt scrape it offit has been too well put on put on i dont know when and i dont know how but by some very fine old worker and by some beautiful old process  charlotte frankly charmed with the cup smiled back at him now a lost art  call it a lost art  but of what time then is the whole thing  well say also of a lost time  the girl considered then if its so precious how comes it to be cheap  her interlocutor once more hung fire but by this time the prince had lost patience ill wait for you out in the air he said to his companion and though he spoke without irritation he pointed his remark by passing immediately into the street where during the next minutes the others saw him his back to the shopwindow philosophically enough hover and light a fresh cigarette charlotte even took a little her time she was aware of his funny italian taste for london streetlife  her host meanwhile at any rate answered her question ah ive had it a long time without selling it i think i must have been keeping it madam for you  youve kept it for me because youve thought i mightnt see whats the matter with it  he only continued to face herhe only continued to appear to follow the play of her mind what is the matter with it  oh its not for me to say its for you honestly to tell me of course i know something must be  but if its something you cant find out isnt it as good as if it were nothing  i probably should find out as soon as i had paid for it  not her host lucidly insisted if you hadnt paid too much  what do you call she asked little enough  well what should you say to fifteen pounds  i should say said charlotte with the utmost promptitude that its altogether too much  the dealer shook his head slowly and sadly but firmly its my price madamand if you admire the thing i think it really might be yours its not too much its too little its almost nothing i cant go lower  charlotte wondering but resisting bent over the bowl again then its impossible its more than i can afford  ah the man returned one can sometimes afford for a present more than one can afford for ones self he said it so coaxingly that she found herself going on without as might be said putting him in his place oh of course it would be only for a present  then it would be a lovely one  does one make a present she asked of an object that contains to ones knowledge a flaw  well if one knows of it one has only to mention it the good faith the man smiled is always there  and leave the person to whom one gives the thing you mean to discover it  he wouldnt discover itif youre speaking of a gentleman  im not speaking of anyone in particular charlotte said  well whoever it might be he might knowand he might try but he wouldnt find  she kept her eyes on him as if though unsatisfied mystified she yet had a fancy for the bowl not even if the thing should come to pieces and then as he was silent not even if he should have to say to me the golden bowl is broken  he was still silent after which he had his strangest smile ah if anyone should want to smash it  she laughed she almost admired the little mans expression you mean one could smash it with a hammer  yes if nothing else would do or perhaps even by dashing it with violencesay upon a marble floor  oh marble floors but she might have been thinkingfor they were a connection marble floors a connection with many things with her old rome and with his with the palaces of his past and a little of hers with the possibilities of his future with the sumptuosities of his marriage with the wealth of the ververs all the same however there were other things and they all together held for a moment her fancy does crystal then breakwhen it is crystal i thought its beauty was its hardness  her friend in his way discriminated its beauty is its being crystal but its hardness is certainly its safety it doesnt break he went on like vile glass it splitsif there is a split  ahcharlotte breathed with interest if there is a split and she looked down again at the bowl there is a split eh crystal does split eh  on lines and by laws of its own  you mean if theres a weak place  for all answer after an hesitation he took the bowl up again holding it aloft and tapping it with a key it rang with the finest sweetest sound where is the weak place  she then did the question justice well for me only the price im poor you seevery poor but i thank you and ill think the prince on the other side of the shopwindow had finally faced about and as to see if she hadnt done was trying to reach with his eyes the comparatively dim interior i like it she saidi want it but i must decide what i can do  the man not ungraciously resigned himself well ill keep it for you  the small quarterofanhour had had its marked odditythis she felt even by the time the open air and the bloomsbury aspects had again in their protest against the truth of her gathered impression made her more or less their own yet the oddity might have been registered as small as compared to the other effect that before they had gone much further she had with her companion to take account of this latter was simply the effect of their having by some tacit logic some queer inevitability quite dropped the idea of a continued pursuit they didnt say so but it was on the line of giving up maggies present that they practically proceededthe line of giving it up without more reference to it the princes first reference was in fact quite independently made i hope you satisfied yourself before you had done of what was the matter with that bowl  no indeed i satisfied myself of nothing of nothing at least but that the more i looked at it the more i liked it and that if you werent so unaccommodating this would be just the occasion for your giving me the pleasure of accepting it  he looked graver for her at this than he had looked all the morning do you propose it seriouslywithout wishing to play me a trick  she wondered what trick would it be  he looked at her harder you mean you really dont know  but know what  why whats the matter with it you didnt see all the while  she only continued however to stare how could you seeout in the street  i saw before i went out it was because i saw that i did go out i didnt want to have another scene with you before that rascal and i judged you would presently guess for yourself  is he a rascal charlotte asked his price is so moderate she waited but a moment five pounds really so little  five pounds  he continued to look at her five pounds  he might have been doubting her word but he was only it appeared gathering emphasis it would be dearto make a gift ofat five shillings if it had cost you even but five pence i wouldnt take it from you  then she asked what is the matter  why it has a crack  it sounded on his lips so sharp it had such an authority that she almost started while her colour at the word rose it was as if he had been right though his assurance was wonderful you answer for it without having looked  i did look i saw the object itself it told its story no wonder its cheap  but its exquisite charlotte as if with an interest in it now made even tenderer and stranger found herself moved to insist  of course its exquisite thats the danger then a light visibly came to hera light in which her friend suddenly and intensely showed the reflection of it as she smiled at him was in her own face the dangeri seeis because youre superstitious  per dio im superstitious a crack is a crackand an omens an omen  youd be afraid  per bacco  for your happiness  for my happiness  for your safety  for my safety  she just paused for your marriage  for my marriage for everything  she thought again thank goodness then that if there be a crack we know it but if we may perish by cracks in things that we dont know and she smiled with the sadness of it we can never then give each other anything  he considered but he met it ah but one does know i do at leastand by instinct i dont fail that will always protect me  it was funny the way he said such things yet she liked him really the more for it they fell in for her with a general or rather with a special vision but she spoke with a mild despair  what then will protect me  where im concerned i will from me at least youve nothing to fear he now quite amiably responded anything you consent to accept from me but he paused  well  well shall be perfect  thats very fine she presently answered its vain after all for you to talk of my accepting things when youll accept nothing from me  ah there better still he could meet her you attach an impossible condition that i mean of my keeping your gift so to myself  well she looked before him there at the conditionthen abruptly with a gesture she gave it up she had a headshake of disenchantmentso far as the idea had appealed to her it all appeared too difficult oh my conditioni dont hold to it you may cry it on the housetopsanything i ever do  ah well then this made he laughed all the difference  but it was too late oh i dont care now i should have liked the bowl but if that wont do theres nothing  he considered this he took it in looking graver again but after a moment he qualified yet i shall want some day to give you something  she wondered at him what day  the day you marry for you will marry you mustseriously marry  she took it from him but it determined in her the only words she was to have uttered all the morning that came out as if a spring had been pressed to make you feel better  well he replied frankly wonderfullyit will but here he added is your hansom  he had signalledthe cab was charging she put out no hand for their separation but she prepared to get in before she did so however she said what had been gathering while she waited well i would marry i think to have something from you in all freedom    part second                             vii  adam verver at fawns that autumn sunday might have been observed to open the door of the billiardroom with a certain freedommight have been observed that is had there been a spectator in the field the justification of the push he had applied however and of the push equally sharp that to shut himself in he again appliedthe ground of this energy was precisely that he might here however briefly find himself alone alone with the handful of letters newspapers and other unopened missives to which during and since breakfast he had lacked opportunity to give an eye the vast square clean apartment was empty and its large clear windows looked out into spaces of terrace and garden of park and woodland and shining artificial lake of richlycondensed horizon all dark blue upland and churchtowered village and strong cloudshadow which were together a thing to create the sense with everyone else at church of ones having the world to ones self we share this world none the less for the hour with mr verver the very fact of his striking as he would have said for solitude the fact of his quiet flight almost on tiptoe through tortuous corridors investing him with an interest that makes our attentiontender indeed almost to compassionqualify his achieved isolation for it may immediately be mentioned that this amiable man bethought himself of his personal advantage in general only when it might appear to him that other advantages those of other persons had successfully put in their claim it may be mentioned also that he always figured other personssuch was the law of his natureas a numerous array and that though conscious of but a single near tie one affection one duty deepestrooted in his life it had never for many minutes together been his portion not to feel himself surrounded and committed never quite been his refreshment to make out where the manycoloured human appeal represented by gradations of tint diminishing concentric zones of intensity of importunity really faded to the blessed impersonal whiteness for which his vision sometimes ached it shaded off the appealhe would have admitted that but he had as yet noted no point at which it positively stopped  thus had grown in him a little habithis innermost secret not confided even to maggie though he felt she understood it as she understood to his view everythingthus had shaped itself the innocent trick of occasionally making believe that he had no conscience or at least that blankness in the field of duty did reign for an hour a small game to which the few persons near enough to have caught him playing it and of whom mrs assingham for instance was one attached indulgently that idea of quaintness quite in fact that charm of the pathetic involved in the preservation by an adult of one of childhoods toys when he took a rare moment off he did so with the touching confessing eyes of a man of fortyseven caught in the act of handling a relic of infancysticking on the head of a broken soldier or trying the lock of a wooden gun it was essentially in him the imitation of depravitywhich for amusement as might have been he practised keeping up in spite of practice he was still imperfect for these so artlesslyartful interludes were condemned by the nature of the case to brevity he had fatally stamped himselfit was his own faulta man who could be interrupted with impunity the greatest of wonders moreover was exactly in this that so interrupted a man should ever have got as the phrase was should above all have got so early to where he was it argued a special genius he was clearly a case of that the spark of fire the point of light sat somewhere in his inward vagueness as a lamp before a shrine twinkles in the dark perspective of a church and while youth and early middleage while the stiff american breeze of example and opportunity were blowing upon it hard had made of the chamber of his brain a strange workshop of fortune this establishment mysterious and almost anonymous the windows of which at hours of highest pressure never seemed for starers and wonderers perceptibly to glow must in fact have been during certain years the scene of an unprecedented a miraculous whiteheat the receipt for producing which it was practically felt that the master of the forge could not have communicated even with the best intentions  the essential pulse of the flame the very action of the cerebral temperature brought to the highest point yet extraordinarily containedthese facts themselves were the immensity of the result they were one with perfection of machinery they had constituted the kind of acquisitive power engendered and applied the necessary triumph of all operations a dim explanation of phenomena once vivid must at all events for the moment suffice us it being obviously no account of the matter to throw on our friends amiability alone the weight of the demonstration of his economic history amiability of a truth is an aid to success it has even been known to be the principle of large accumulations but the link for the mind is none the less fatally missing between proof on such a scale of continuity if of nothing more insolent in one field and accessibility to distraction in every other variety of imaginationwhat is that but fatal in the world of affairs unless so disciplined as not to be distinguished from monotony mr verver then for a fresh full period a period betraying extraordinarily no wasted year had been inscrutably monotonous behind an iridescent cloud the cloud was his native envelopethe soft looseness so to say of his temper and tone not directly expressive enough no doubt to figure an amplitude of folds but of a quality unmistakable for sensitive feelers he was still reduced in fine to getting his rare moments with himself by feigning a cynicism his real inability to maintain the pretence however had perhaps not often been better instanced than by his acceptance of the inevitable todayhis acceptance of it on the arrival at the end of a quarterofan hour of that element of obligation with which he had all the while known he must reckon a quarterofan hour of egoism was about as much as he taking one situation with another usually got mrs rance opened the doormore tentatively indeed than he himself had just done but on the other hand as if to make up for this she pushed forward even more briskly on seeing him than he had been moved to do on seeing nobody then with force it came home to him that he had definitely a week before established a precedent he did her at least that justiceit was a kind of justice he was always doing someone he had on the previous sunday liked to stop at home and he had exposed himself thereby to be caught in the act to make this possible that is mrs rance had only had to like to do the samethe trick was so easily played it had not occurred to him to plan in any way for her absencewhich would have destroyed somehow in principle the propriety of his own presence if persons under his roof hadnt a right not to go to church what became for a fair mind of his own right his subtlest manoeuvre had been simply to change from the library to the billiardroom it being in the library that his guest or his daughters or the guest of the miss lutcheshe scarce knew in which light to regard herhad then and not unnaturally of course joined him it was urged on him by his memory of the duration of the visit she had that time as it were paid him that the law of recurrence would already have got itself enacted she had spent the whole morning with him was still there in the library when the others came backthanks to her having been tepid about their taking mr verver and she a turn outside it had been as if she looked on that as a kind of subterfugealmost as a form of disloyalty yet what was it she had in mind what did she wish to make of him beyond what she had already made a patient punctilious host mindful that she had originally arrived much as a stranger arrived not at all deliberately or yearningly invitedso that one positively had her possible susceptibilities the more on ones conscience the miss lutches the sisters from the middle west were there as friends of maggies friends of the earlier time but mrs rance was there or at least had primarily appearedonly as a friend of the miss lutches  this lady herself was not of the middle westshe rather insisted on itbut of new jersey rhode island or delaware one of the smallest and most intimate states he couldnt remember which though she insisted too on that it was not in himwe may say it for himto go so far as to wonder if their group were next to be recruited by some friend of her own and this partly because she had struck him verily rather as wanting to get the miss lutches themselves away than to extend the actual circle and partly as well as more essentially because such connection as he enjoyed with the ironic question in general resided substantially less in a personal use of it than in the habit of seeing it as easy to others he was so framed by nature as to be able to keep his inconveniences separate from his resentments though indeed if the sum of these latter had at the most always been small that was doubtless in some degree a consequence of the fewness of the former his greatest inconvenience he would have admitted had he analyzed was in finding it so taken for granted that as he had money he had force it pressed upon him hard and all round assuredly this attribution of power everyone had need of ones power whereas ones own need at the best would have seemed to be but some trick for not communicating it the effect of a reserve so merely so meanly defensive would in most cases beyond question sufficiently discredit the cause wherefore though it was complicating to be perpetually treated as an infinite agent the outrage was not the greatest of which a brave man might complain complaint besides was a luxury and he dreaded the imputation of greed the other the constant imputation that of being able to do would have no ground if he hadnt been to start withthis was the pointprovably luxurious his lips somehow were closedand by a spring connected moreover with the action of his eyes themselves the latter showed him what he had done showed him where he had come out quite at the top of his hill of difficulty the tall sharp spiral round which he had begun to wind his ascent at the age of twenty and the apex of which was a platform looking down if one would on the kingdoms of the earth and with standingroom for but halfadozen others  his eyes in any case now saw mrs rance approach with an instant failure to attach to the fact any grossness of avidity of mrs rances ownor at least to descry any triumphant use even for the luridest impression of her intensity what was virtually supreme would be her vision of his having attempted by his desertion of the library to mislead herwhich in point of fact barely escaped being what he had designed it was not easy for him in spite of accumulations fondly and funnily regarded as of systematic practice not now to be ashamed the one thing comparatively easy would be to gloss over his course the billiardroom was not at the particular crisis either a natural or a graceful place for the nominally main occupant of so large a house to retire toand this without prejudice either to the fact that his visitor wouldnt as he apprehended explicitly make him a scene should she frankly denounce him for a sneak he would simply go to pieces but he was after an instant not afraid of that wouldnt she rather as emphasising their communion accept and in a manner exploit the anomaly treat it perhaps as romantic or possibly even as comicshow at least that they neednt mind even though the vast table draped in brown holland thrust itself between them as an expanse of desert sand she couldnt cross the desert but she could and did beautifully get round it so that for him to convert it into an obstacle he would have had to cause himself as in some childish game or unbecoming romp to be pursued to be genially hunted this last was a turn he was well aware the occasion should on no account take and there loomed before himfor the mere moment the prospect of her fairly proposing that they should knock about the balls that danger certainly it struck him he should manage in some way to deal with why too for that matter had he need of defences material or otherhow was it a question of dangers really to be called such the deep danger the only one that made him as an idea positively turn cold would have been the possibility of her seeking him in marriage of her bringing up between them that terrible issue here fortunately she was powerless it being apparently so provable against her that she had a husband in undiminished existence  she had him it was true only in america only in texas in nebraska in arizona or somewheresomewhere that at old fawns house in the county of kent scarcely counted as a definite place at all it showed somehow from afar as so lost so indistinct and illusory in the great alkali desert of cheap divorce she had him even in bondage poor man had him in contempt had him in remembrance so imperfect as barely to assert itself but she had him none the less in existence unimpeached the miss lutches had seen him in the fleshas they had appeared eager to mention though when they were separately questioned their descriptions failed to tally he would be at the worst should it come to the worst mrs rances difficulty and he served therefore quite enough as the stout bulwark of anyone else this was in truth logic without a flaw yet it gave mr verver less comfort than it ought he feared not only dangerhe feared the idea of danger or in other words feared hauntedly himself it was above all as a symbol that mrs rance actually rose before hima symbol of the supreme effort that he should have sooner or later as he felt to make this effort would be to say nohe lived in terror of having to he should be proposed to at a given momentit was only a question of timeand then he should have to do a thing that would be extremely disagreeable he almost wished on occasion that he wasnt so sure he would do it he knew himself however well enough not to doubt he knew coldly quite bleakly where he would at the crisis draw the line it was maggies marriage and maggies finer happiness happy as he had supposed her beforethat had made the difference he hadnt in the other time it now seemed to him had to think of such things they hadnt come up for him and it was as if she positively had herself kept them down she had only been his childwhich she was indeed as much as ever but there were sides on which she had protected him as if she were more than a daughter she had done for him more than he knew much and blissfully as he always had known if she did at present more than ever through having what she called the change in his life to make up to him for his situation still all the same kept pace with her activityhis situation being simply that there was more than ever to be done  there had not yet been quite so much on all the showing as since their return from their twenty months in america as since their settlement again in england experimental though it was and the consequent sense now quite established for him of a domestic air that had cleared and lightened producing the effect for their common personal life of wider perspectives and large waiting spaces it was as if his soninlaws presence even from before his becoming his soninlaw had somehow filled the scene and blocked the futurevery richly and handsomely when all was said not at all inconveniently or in ways not to have been desired inasmuch as though the prince his measure now practically taken was still pretty much the same big fact the sky had lifted the horizon receded the very foreground itself expanded quite to match him quite to keep everything in comfortable scale at first certainly their decent little oldtime union maggies and his own had resembled a good deal some pleasant public square in the heart of an old city into which a great palladian church saysomething with a grand architectural fronthad suddenly been dropped so that the rest of the place the space in front the way round outside to the east end the margin of street and passage the quantity of overarching heaven had been temporarily compromised not even then of a truth in a manner disconcertinggiven that is for the critical or at least the intelligent eye the great style of the facade and its high place in its class the phenomenon that had since occurred whether originally to have been pronounced calculable or not had not naturally been the miracle of a night but had taken place so gradually quietly easily that from this vantage of wide wooded fawns with its eighty rooms as they said with its spreading park with its acres and acres of garden and its majesty of artificial lake though that for a person so familiar with the great ones might be rather ridiculousno visibility of transition showed no violence of adjustment in retrospect emerged the palladian church was always there but the piazza took care of itself the sun stared down in his fulness the air circulated and the public not less the limit stood off the way round was easy the east end was as fine in its fashion as the west and there were also side doors for entrance between the twolarge monumental ornamental in their styleas for all proper great churches by some such process in fine had the prince for his fatherin law while remaining solidly a feature ceased to be at all ominously a block  mr verver it may further be mentioned had taken at no moment sufficient alarm to have kept in detail the record of his reassurance but he would none the less not have been unable not really have been indisposed to impart in confidence to the right person his notion of the history of the matter the right personit is equally distincthad not for this illumination been wanting but had been encountered in the form of fanny assingham not for the first time indeed admitted to his counsels and who would have doubtless at present in any case from plenitude of interest and with equal guarantees repeated his secret it all came then the great clearance from the one prime fact that the prince by good fortune hadnt proved angular he clung to that description of his daughters husband as he often did to terms and phrases in the human the social connection that he had found for himself it was his way to have times of using these constantly as if they just then lighted the world or his own path in it for himeven when for some of his interlocutors they covered less ground it was true that with mrs assingham he never felt quite sure of the ground anything covered she disputed with him so little agreed with him so much surrounded him with such systematic consideration such predetermined tenderness that it was almostwhich he had once told her in irritation as if she were nursing a sick baby he had accused her of not taking him seriously and she had repliedas from her it couldnt frighten himthat she took him religiously adoringly she had laughed again as she had laughed before on his producing for her that good right word about the happy issue of his connection with the princewith an effect the more odd perhaps as she had not contested its value she couldnt of course however be at the best as much in love with his discovery as he was himself he was so much so that he fairly worked itto his own comfort came in fact sometimes near publicly pointing the moral of what might have occurred if friction so to speak had occurred he pointed it frankly one day to the personage in question mentioned to the prince the particular justice he did him was even explicit as to the danger that in their remarkable relation they had thus escaped oh if he had been angularwho could say what might then have happened he spokeand it was the way he had spoken to mrs assingham tooas if he grasped the facts without exception for which angularity stood  it figured for him clearly as a final idea a conception of the last vividness he might have been signifying by it the sharp corners and hard edges all the stony pointedness the grand right geometry of his spreading palladian church just so he was insensible to no feature of the felicity of a contact that beguilingly almost confoundingly was a contact but with practically yielding lines and curved surfaces youre round my boy he had saidyoure all youre variously and inexhaustibly round when you might by all the chances have been abominably square im not sure for that matter he had added that youre not square in the general masswhether abominably or not the abomination isnt a question for youre inveterately roundthats what i meanin the detail its the sort of thing in you that one feelsor at least i dowith ones hand say you had been formed all over in a lot of little pyramidal lozenges like that wonderful side of the ducal palace in veniceso lovely in a building but so damnable for rubbing against in a man and especially in a near relation i can see them all from hereeach of them sticking out by itselfall the architectural cut diamonds that would have scratched ones softer sides one would have been scratched by diamondsdoubtless the neatest way if one was to be scratched at allbut one would have been more or less reduced to a hash as it is for living with youre a pure and perfect crystal i give you my ideai think you ought to have itjust as it has come to me the prince had taken the idea in his way for he was well accustomed by this time to taking and nothing perhaps even could more have confirmed mr ververs account of his surface than the manner in which these golden drops evenly flowed over it they caught in no interstice they gathered in no concavity the uniform smoothness betrayed the dew but by showing for the moment a richer tone the young man in other words unconfusedly smiledthough indeed as if assenting from principle and habit to more than he understood he liked all signs that things were well but he cared rather less why they were  in regard to the people among whom he had since his marriage been living the reasons they so frequently gaveso much oftener than he had ever heard reasons given beforeremained on the whole the element by which he most differed from them and his fatherin law and his wife were after all only first among the people among whom he had been living he was never even yet sure of how at this that or the other point he would strike them they felt remarkably so often things he hadnt meant and missed not less remarkably and not less often things he had he had fallen back on his general explanationwe havent the same values by which he understood the same measure of importance his curves apparently were important because they had been unexpected or still more unconceived whereas when one had always as in his relegated old world taken curves and in much greater quantities too for granted one was no more surprised at the resulting feasibility of intercourse than one was surprised at being upstairs in a house that had a staircase he had in fact on this occasion disposed alertly enough of the subject of mr ververs approbation the promptitude of his answer we may in fact well surmise had sprung not a little from a particular kindled remembrance this had given his acknowledgment its easiest turn oh if im a crystal im delighted that im a perfect one for i believe that they sometimes have cracks and flawsin which case theyre to be had very cheap he had stopped short of the emphasis it would have given his joke to add that there had been certainly no having him cheap and it was doubtless a mark of the good taste practically reigning between them that mr verver had not on his side either taken up the opportunity it is the latters relation to such aspects however that now most concerns us and the bearing of his pleased view of this absence of friction upon amerigos character as a representative precious object representative precious objects great ancient pictures and other works of art fine eminent pieces in gold in silver in enamel majolica ivory bronze had for a number of years so multiplied themselves round him and as a general challenge to acquisition and appreciation so engaged all the faculties of his mind that the instinct the particular sharpened appetite of the collector had fairly served as a basis for his acceptance of the princes suit  over and above the signal fact of the impression made on maggie herself the aspirant to his daughters hand showed somehow the great marks and signs stood before him with the high authenticities he had learned to look for in pieces of the first order adam verver knew by this time knew thoroughly no man in europe or in america he privately believed was less capable in such estimates of vulgar mistakes he had never spoken of himself as infallibleit was not his way but apart from the natural affections he had acquainted himself with no greater joy of the intimately personal type than the joy of his originally coming to feel and all so unexpectedly that he had in him the spirit of the connoisseur he had like many other persons in the course of his reading been struck with keatss sonnet about stout cortez in the presence of the pacific but few persons probably had so devoutly fitted the poets grand image to a fact of experience it consorted so with mr ververs consciousness of the way in which at a given moment he had stared at his  pacific that a couple of perusals of the immortal lines had sufficed to stamp them in his memory his peak in darien was the sudden hour that had transformed his life the hour of his perceiving with a mute inward gasp akin to the low moan of apprehensive passion that a world was left him to conquer and that he might conquer it if he tried it had been a turning of the page of the book of lifeas if a leaf long inert had moved at a touch and eagerly reversed had made such a stir of the air as sent up into his face the very breath of the golden isles to rifle the golden isles had on the spot become the business of his future and with the sweetness of itwhat was most wondrous of allstill more even in the thought than in the act the thought was that of the affinity of genius or at least of taste with something in himselfwith the dormant intelligence of which he had thus almost violently become aware and that affected him as changing by a mere revolution of the screw his whole intellectual plane he was equal somehow with the great seers the invokers and encouragers of beautyand he didnt after all perhaps dangle so far below the great producers and creators he had been nothing of that kind beforetoo decidedly too dreadfully not but now he saw why he had been what he had why he had failed and fallen short even in huge success now he read into his career in one single magnificent night the immense meaning it had waited for  it was during his first visit to europe after the death of his wife when his daughter was ten years old that the light in his mind had so brokenand he had even made out at that time why on an earlier occasion the journey of his honeymoon year it had still been closely covered he had bought then so far as he had been able but he had bought almost wholly for the frail fluttered creature at his side who had had her fancies decidedly but all for the art then wonderful to both of them of the rue de la paix the costly authenticities of dressmakers and jewellers her flutterpale disconcerted ghost as she actually was a broken white flower tied round almost grotesquely for his present sense with a huge satin bow of the boulevardher flutter had been mainly that of ribbons frills and fine fabrics all funny pathetic evidence for memory of the bewilderments overtaking them as a bridal pair confronted with opportunity he could wince fairly still as he remembered the sense in which the poor girls pressure had under his fond encouragement indeed been exerted in favour of purchase and curiosity these were wandering images out of the earlier dusk that threw her back for his pity into a past more remote than he liked their common past their young affection to appear it would have had to be admitted to an insistent criticism that maggies mother all too strangely had not so much failed of faith as of the right application of it since she had exercised it eagerly and restlessly made it a pretext for innocent perversities in respect to which philosophic time was at last to reduce all groans to gentleness and they had loved each other so that his own intelligence on the higher line had temporarily paid for it the futilities the enormities the depravities of decoration and ingenuity that before his sense was unsealed she had made him think lovely musing reconsidering little man that he was and addicted to silent pleasuresas he was accessible to silent painshe even sometimes wondered what would have become of his intelligence in the sphere in which it was to learn more and more exclusively to play if his wifes influence upon it had not been in the strange scheme of things so promptly removed would she have led him altogether attached as he was to her into the wilderness of mere mistakes would she have prevented him from ever scaling his vertiginous peakor would she otherwise have been able to accompany him to that eminence where he might have pointed out to her as cortez to his companions the revelation vouchsafed no companion of cortez had presumably been a real lady mr verver allowed that historic fact to determine his inference                                  viii  what was at all events not permanently hidden from him was a truth much less invidious about his years of darkness it was the strange scheme of things again the years of darkness had been needed to render possible the years of light a wiser hand than he at first knew had kept him hard at acquisition of one sort as a perfect preliminary to acquisition of another and the preliminary would have been weak and wanting if the good faith of it had been less his comparative blindness had made the good faith which in its turn had made the soil propitious for the flower of the supreme idea he had had to like forging and sweating he had had to like polishing and piling up his arms they were things at least he had had to believe he liked just as he had believed he liked transcendent calculation and imaginative gambling all for themselves the creation of interests that were the extinction of other interests the livid vulgarity even of getting in or getting out first that had of course been so far from really the casewith the supreme idea all the while growing and striking deep under everything in the warm rich earth he had stood unknowing he had walked and worked where it was buried and the fact itself the fact of his fortune would have been a barren fact enough if the first sharp tender shoot had never struggled into day there on one side was the ugliness his middle time had been spared there on the other from all the portents was the beauty with which his age might still be crowned he was happier doubtless than he deserved but that when one was happy at all it was easy to be he had wrought by devious ways but he had reached the place and what would ever have been straighter in any mans life than his way now of occupying it it hadnt merely his plan all the sanctions of civilization it was positively civilization condensed concrete consummate set down by his hands as a house on a rocka house from whose open doors and windows open to grateful to thirsty millions the higher the highest knowledge would shine out to bless the land in this house designed as a gift primarily to the people of his adoptive city and native state the urgency of whose release from the bondage of ugliness he was in a position to measurein this museum of museums a palace of art which was to show for compact as a greek temple was compact a receptacle of treasures sifted to positive sanctity his spirit today almost altogether lived making up as he would have said for lost time and haunting the portico in anticipation of the final rites  these would be the opening exercises the august dedication of the place his imagination he was well aware got over the ground faster than his judgment there was much still to do for the production of his first effect foundations were laid and walls were rising the structure of the shell all determined but raw haste was forbidden him in a connection so intimate with the highest effects of patience and piety he should belie himself by completing without a touch at least of the majesty of delay a monument to the religion he wished to propagate the exemplary passion the passion for perfection at any price he was far from knowing as yet where he would end but he was admirably definite as to where he wouldnt begin he wouldnt begin with a small showhe would begin with a great and he could scarce have indicated even had he wished to try the line of division he had drawn he had taken no trouble to indicate it to his fellow citizens purveyors and consumers in his own and the circumjacent commonwealths of comic matter in large lettering diurnally set up printed published folded and delivered at the expense of his presumptuous emulation of the snail the snail had become for him under this ironic suggestion the loveliest beast in nature and his return to england of which we are present witnesses had not been unconnected with the appreciation so determined it marked what he liked to mark that he needed on the matter in question instruction from no one on earth a couple of years of europe again of renewed nearness to changes and chances refreshed sensibility to the currents of the market would fall in with the consistency of wisdom the particular shade of enlightened conviction that he wished to observe it didnt look like much for a whole family to hang about waiting they being now since the birth of his grandson a whole family and there was henceforth only one ground in all the world he felt on which the question of appearance would ever really again count for him he cared that a work of art of price should look like the master to whom it might perhaps be deceitfully attributed but he had ceased on the whole to know any matter of the rest of life by its looks  he took life in general higher up the stream so far as he was not actually taking it as a collector he was taking it decidedly as a grandfather in the way of precious small pieces he had handled nothing so precious as the principino his daughters firstborn whose italian designation endlessly amused him and whom he could manipulate and dandle already almost toss and catch again as he couldnt a correspondingly rare morsel of an earlier pate tendre he could take the small clutching child from his nurses arms with an iteration grimly discountenanced in respect to their contents by the glass doors of high cabinets something clearly beatific in this new relation had moreover without doubt confirmed for him the sense that none of his silent answers to public detraction to local vulgarity had ever been so legitimately straight as the mere element of attitudereduce it he said to thatin his easy weeks at fawns the element of attitude was all he wanted of these weeks and he was enjoying it on the spot even more than he had hoped enjoying it in spite of mrs rance and the miss lutches in spite of the small worry of his belief that fanny assingham had really something for him that she was keeping back in spite of his full consciousness overflowing the cup like a wine too generously poured that if he had consented to marry his daughter and thereby to make as it were the difference what surrounded him now was exactly consent vivified marriage demonstrated the difference in fine definitely made he could call back his prior his own wedded consciousnessit was not yet out of range of vague reflection he had supposed himself above all he had supposed his wife as married as anyone could be and yet he wondered if their state had deserved the name or their union worn the beauty in the degree to which the couple now before him carried the matter in especial since the birth of their boy in new yorkthe grand climax of their recent american period brought to so right an issuethe happy pair struck him as having carried it higher deeper further to where it ceased to concern his imagination at any rate to follow them extraordinary beyond question was one branch of his characteristic mute wondermentit characterised above all with its subject before it his modesty the strange dim doubt waking up for him at the end of the years of whether maggies mother had after all been capable of the maximum the maximum of tenderness he meantas the terms existed for him the maximum of immersion in the fact of being married maggie herself was capable maggie herself at this season was exquisitely divinely the maximum such was the impression that positively holding off a little for the practical the tactful consideration it inspired in him a respect for the beauty and sanctity of it almost amounting to awe such was the impression he daily received from her she was her mother oh yesbut her mother and something more it becoming thus a new light for him and in such a curious way too that anything more than her mother should prove at this time of day possible  he could live over again at almost any quiet moment the long process of his introduction to his present interestsan introduction that had depended all on himself like the cheek of the young man who approaches a boss without credentials or picks up an acquaintance makes even a real friend by speaking to a passer in the street his real friend in all the business was to have been his own mind with which nobody had put him in relation he had knocked at the door of that essentially private house and his call in truth had not been immediately answered so that when after waiting and coming back he had at last got in it was twirling his hat as an embarrassed stranger or trying his keys as a thief at night he had gained confidence only with time but when he had taken real possession of the place it had been never again to come away all of which success represented it must be allowed his one principle of pride pride in the mere original spring pride in his money would have been pride in something that had come in comparison so easily the right ground for elation was difficulty mastered and his difficultythanks to his modestyhad been to believe in his facility this was the problem he had worked out to its solutionthe solution that was now doing more than all else to make his feet settle and his days flush and when he wished to feel good as they said at american city he had but to retrace his immense development that was what the whole thing came back tothat the development had not been somebodys else passing falsely accepted too ignobly for his to think how servile he might have been was absolutely to respect himself was in fact as much as he liked to admire himself as free the very finest spring that ever responded to his touch was always there to pressthe memory of his freedom as dawning upon him like a sunrise all pink and silver during a winter divided between florence rome and naples some three years after his wifes death it was the hushed daybreak of the roman revelation in particular that he could usually best recover with the way that there above all where the princes and popes had been before him his divination of his faculty most went to his head he was a plain american citizen staying at an hotel where sometimes for days together there were twenty others like him but no pope no prince of them all had read a richer meaning he believed into the character of the patron of art he was ashamed of them really if he wasnt afraid and he had on the whole never so climbed to the tiptop as in judging over a perusal of hermann grimm where julius ii and leo x were placed by their treatment of michael angelo far below the plain american citizenin the case at least in which this personage happened not to be too plain to be adam verver going to our friends head  moreover some of the results of such comparisons may doubtless be described as having stayed there his freedom to seeof which the comparisons were partwhat could it do but steadily grow and grow  it came perhaps even too much to stand to him for all freedom since for example it was as much there as ever at the very time of mrs rances conspiring against him at fawns with the billiardroom and the sunday morning on the occasion round which we have perhaps drawn our circle too wide mrs rance at least controlled practically each other license of the present and the near future the license to pass the hour as he would have found convenient the license to stop remembering for a little that though if proposed toand not only by this aspirant but by any otherhe wouldnt prove foolish the proof of wisdom was none the less in such a fashion rather cruelly conditioned the license in especial to proceed from his letters to his journals and insulate orientate himself afresh by the sound over his gained interval of the manymouthed monster the exercise of whose lungs he so constantly stimulated mrs rance remained with him till the others came back from church and it was by that time clearer than ever that his ordeal when it should arrive would be really most unpleasant his impressionthis was the pointtook somehow the form not so much of her wanting to press home her own advantage as of her building better than she knew that is of her symbolising with virtual unconsciousness his own special deficiency his unfortunate lack of a wife to whom applications could be referred the applications the contingencies with which mrs rance struck him as potentially bristling were not of a sort really to be met by ones self and the possibility of them when his visitor said or as good as said im restrained you see because of mr rance and also because im proud and refined but if it wasnt for mr rance and for my refinement and my pridethe possibility of them i say turned to a great murmurous rustle of a volume to fill the future a rustle of petticoats of scented manypaged letters of voices as to which distinguish themselves as they might from each other it mattered little in what part of the resounding country they had learned to make themselves prevail the assinghams and the miss lutches had taken the walk through the park to the little old church on the property that our friend had often found himself wishing he were able to transport as it stood for its simple sweetness in a glass case to one of his exhibitory halls while maggie had induced her husband not inveterate in such practices to make with her by carriage the somewhat longer pilgrimage to the nearest altar modest though it happened to be of the faithher own as it had been her mothers and as mr verver himself had been loosely willing always to let it be taken for hiswithout the solid ease of which making the stage firm and smooth the drama of her marriage might not have been acted out  what at last appeared to have happened however was that the divided parties coming back at the same moment had met outside and then drifted together from empty room to room yet not in mere aimless quest of the pair of companions they had left at home the quest had carried them to the door of the billiard room and their appearance as it opened to admit them determined for adam verver in the oddest way in the world a new and sharp perception it was really remarkable this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened the breath for that matter was more than anything else the look in his daughters eyesthe look with which he saw her take in exactly what had occurred in her absence mrs rances pursuit of him to this remote locality the spirit and the very form perfectly characteristic of his acceptance of the complicationthe seal set in short unmistakably on one of maggies anxieties the anxiety it was true would have been even though not imparted separately shared for fanny assinghams face was by the same stroke not at all thickly veiled for him and a queer light of a colour quite to match fairly glittered in the four fine eyes of the miss lutches each of these personscounting out that is the prince and the colonel who didnt care and who didnt even see that the others didknew something or had at any rate had her idea the idea precisely that this was what mrs rance artfully biding her time would do the special shade of apprehension on the part of the miss lutches might indeed have suggested the vision of an energy supremely asserted it was droll in truth if one came to that the position of the miss lutches they had themselves brought they had guilelessly introduced mrs rance strong in the fact of mr rances having been literally beheld of them and it was now for them positively as if their handful of flowerssince mrs rance was a handfulhad been but the vehicle of a dangerous snake mr verver fairly felt in the air the miss lutches imputationin the intensity of which really his own propriety might have been involved  that none the less was but a flicker what made the real difference as i have hinted was his mute passage with maggie his daughters anxiety alone had depths and it opened out for him the wider that it was altogether new when in their common past when till this moment had she shown a fear however dumbly for his individual life they had had fears together just as they had had joys but all of hers at least had been for what equally concerned them here of a sudden was a question that concerned him alone and the soundless explosion of it somehow marked a date he was on her mind he was even in a manner on her handsas a distinct thing that is from being where he had always been merely deep in her heart and in her life too deep down as it were to be disengaged contrasted or opposed in short objectively presented but time finally had done it their relation was altered he saw again the difference lighted for her this marked it to himselfand it wasnt a question simply of a mrs rance the more or the less for maggie too at a stroke almost beneficently their visitor had from being an inconvenience become a sign they had made vacant by their marriage his immediate foreground his personal precinctthey being the princess and the prince they had made room in it for othersso others had become aware he became aware himself for that matter during the minute maggie stood there before speaking and with the sense moreover of what he saw her see he had the sense of what she saw him this last it may be added would have been his intensest perception had there not the next instant been more for him in fanny assingham her face couldnt keep it from him she had seen on top of everything in her quick way what they both were seeing                                  ix  so much mute communication was doubtless all this time marvellous and we may confess to having perhaps read into the scene prematurely a critical character that took longer to develop yet the quiet hour of reunion enjoyed that afternoon by the father and the daughter did really little else than deal with the elements definitely presented to each in the vibration produced by the return of the churchgoers nothing allusive nothing at all insistent passed between them either before or immediately after luncheonexcept indeed so far as their failure soon again to meet might be itself an accident charged with reference the hour or two after luncheonand on sundays with especial rigour for one of the domestic reasons of which it belonged to maggie quite multitudinously to take accountwere habitually spent by the princess with her little boy in whose apartment she either frequently found her father already established or was sooner or later joined by him his visit to his grandson at some hour or other held its place in his day against all interventions and this without counting his grandsons visits to him scarcely less ordered and timed and the odd bits as he called them that they picked up together when they couldcommunions snatched for the most part on the terrace in the gardens or the park while the principino with much pomp and circumstance of perambulator parasol fine lace overveiling and incorruptible female attendance took the air in the private apartments which occupying in the great house the larger part of a wing of their own were not much more easily accessible than if the place had been a royal palace and the small child an heirapparentin the nursery of nurseries the talk at these instituted times was always so prevailingly with or about the master of the scene that other interests and other topics had fairly learned to avoid the slighting and inadequate notice there taken of them they came in at the best but as involved in the little boys future his past or his comprehensive present never getting so much as a chance to plead their own merits or to complain of being neglected nothing perhaps in truth had done more than this united participation to confirm in the elder parties that sense of a life not only uninterrupted but more deeply associated more largely combined of which on adam ververs behalf we have made some mention it was of course an old story and a familiar idea that a beautiful baby could take its place as a new link between a wife and a husband but maggie and her father had with every ingenuity converted the precious creature into a link between a mamma and a grandpapa the principino for a chance spectator of this process might have become by an untoward stroke a hapless halforphan with the place of immediate male parent swept bare and open to the next nearest sympathy  they had no occasion thus the conjoined worshippers to talk of what the prince might be or might do for his sonthe sum of service in his absence so completely filled itself out it was not in the least moreover that there was doubt of him for he was conspicuously addicted to the manipulation of the child in the frank italian way at such moments as he judged discreet in respect to other claims conspicuously indeed that is for maggie who had more occasion on the whole to speak to her husband of the extravagance of her father than to speak to her father of the extravagance of her husband adam verver had all round in this connection his own serenity he was sure of his soninlaws auxiliary admirationadmiration he meant of his grandson since to begin with what else had been at work but the instinctor it might fairly have been the traditionof the latters making the child so solidly beautiful as to have to be admired what contributed most to harmony in this play of relations however was the way the young man seemed to leave it to be gathered that tradition for tradition the grandpapas own was not in any estimate to go for nothing a tradition or whatever it was that had flowered prelusively in the princess herselfwell amerigos very discretions were his way of taking account of it his discriminations in respect to his heir were in fine not more angular than any others to be observed in him and mr verver received perhaps from no source so distinct an impression of being for him an odd and important phenomenon as he received from this impunity of appropriation these unchallenged nursery hours it was as if the grandpapas special show of the character were but another side for the observer to study another item for him to note it came back this latter personage knew to his own previous perceptionthat of the princes inability in any matter in which he was concerned to conclude the idiosyncrasy for him at each stage had to be demonstratedon which however he admirably accepted it this last was after all the point he really worked poor young man for acceptance since he worked so constantly for comprehension and how when you came to that could you know that a horse wouldnt shy at a brassband in a country road because it didnt shy at a tractionengine it might have been brought up to tractionengines without having been brought up to brassbands little by little thus from month to month the prince was learning what his wifes father had been brought up to and now it could be checked offhe had been brought up to the romantic view of principini who would have thought it and where would it all stop the only fear somewhat sharp for mr verver was a certain fear of disappointing him for strangeness he felt that the evidence he offered thus viewed was too much on the positive side he didnt knowhe was learning and it was funny for himto how many things he had been brought up if the prince could only strike something to which he hadnt this wouldnt it seemed to him ruffle the smoothness and yet might a little add to the interest  what was now clear at all events for the father and the daughter was their simply knowing they wanted for the time to be togetherat any cost as it were and their necessity so worked in them as to bear them out of the house in a quarter hidden from that in which their friends were gathered and cause them to wander unseen unfollowed along a covered walk in the old garden as it was called old with an antiquity of formal things high box and shaped yew and expanses of brick wall that had turned at once to purple and to pink they went out of a door in the wall a door that had a slab with a date set above it 1713 but in the old multiplied lettering and then had before them a small white gate intensely white and clean amid all the greenness through which they gradually passed to where some of the grandest trees spaciously clustered and where they would find one of the quietest places a bench had been placed long ago beneath a great oak that helped to crown a mild eminence and the ground sank away below it to rise again opposite at a distance sufficient to enclose the solitude and figure a bosky horizon summer blissfully was with them yet and the low sun made a splash of light where it pierced the looser shade maggie coming down to go out had brought a parasol which as over her charming bare head she now handled it gave with the big straw hat that her father in these days always wore a good deal tipped back definite intention to their walk they knew the bench it was sequesteredthey had praised it for that together before and liked the word and after they had begun to linger there they could have smiled if they hadnt been really too serious and if the question hadnt so soon ceased to matter over the probable wonder of the others as to what would have become of them  the extent to which they enjoyed their indifference to any judgment of their want of ceremony what did that of itself speak but for the way that as a rule they almost equally had others on their mind they each knew that both were full of the superstition of not hurting but might precisely have been asking themselves asking in fact each other at this moment whether that was to be after all the last word of their conscientious development certain it was at all events that in addition to the assinghams and the lutches and mrs rance the attendance at tea just in the right place on the west terrace might perfectly comprise the four or five personsamong them the very pretty the typically irish miss maddock vaunted announced and now broughtfrom the couple of other houses near enough one of these the minor residence of their proprietor established thriftily while he hired out his ancestral home within sight and sense of his profit it was not less certain either that for once in a way the group in question must all take the case as they found it fanny assingham at any time for that matter might perfectly be trusted to see mr verver and his daughter to see their reputation for a decent friendliness through any momentary danger might be trusted even to carry off their absence for amerigo for amerigos possible funny italian anxiety amerigo always being as the princess was well aware conveniently amenable to this friends explanations beguilements reassurances and perhaps in fact rather more than less dependent on them as his new lifesince that was his own name for itopened out it was no secret to maggieit was indeed positively a public joke for herthat she couldnt explain as mrs assingham did and that the prince liking explanations liking them almost as if he collected them in the manner of bookplates or postagestamps for themselves his requisition of this luxury had to be met he didnt seem to want them as yet for userather for ornament and amusement innocent amusement of the kind he most fancied and that was so characteristic of his blessed beautiful general slightly indolent lack of more dissipated or even just of more sophisticated tastes  however that might be the dear woman had come to be frankly and gaily recognisedand not least by herselfas filling in the intimate little circle an office that was not always a sinecure it was almost as if she had taken with her kind melancholy colonel at her heels a responsible engagement to be within call as it were for all those appeals that sprang out of talk that sprang not a little doubtless too out of leisure it naturally led her position in the household as she called it to considerable frequency of presence to visits from the good couple freely repeated and prolonged and not so much as under form of protest she was there to keep him quietit was amerigos own description of her influence and it would only have needed a more visible disposition to unrest in him to make the account perfectly fit fanny herself limited indeed she minimised her office you didnt need a jailor she contended for a domesticated lamb tied up with pink ribbon this was not an animal to be controlledit was an animal to be at the most educated she admitted accordingly that she was educativewhich maggie was so aware that she herself inevitably wasnt so it came round to being true that what she was most in charge of was his mere intelligence this left goodness knew plenty of different calls for maggie to meetin a case in which so much pink ribbon as it might be symbolically named was lavished on the creature what it all amounted to at any rate was that mrs assingham would be keeping him quiet now while his wife and his fatherinlaw carried out their own little frugal picnic quite moreover doubtless not much less neededly in respect to the members of the circle that were with them there than in respect to the pair they were missing almost for the first time it was present to maggie that the prince could bear when he was with his wife almost any queerness on the part of people strange english types who bored him beyond convenience by being so little as he himself was for this was one of the ways in which a wife was practically sustaining but she was as positively aware that she hadnt yet learned to see him as meeting such exposure in her absence how did he move and talk how above all did he or how would he lookhe who with his so nobly handsome face could look such wonderful thingsin case of being left alone with some of the subjects of his wonder there were subjects for wonder among these very neighbours only maggie herself had her own odd waywhich didnt moreover the least irritate himof really liking them in proportion as they could strike her as strange it came out in her by heredity he amused himself with declaring this love of chinoiseries but she actually this evening didnt mindhe might deal with her chinese as he could  maggie indeed would always have had for such moments had they oftener occurred the impression made on her by a word of mrs assinghams a word referring precisely to that appetite in amerigo for the explanatory which we have just found in our path it wasnt that the princess could be indebted to another person even to so clever a one as this friend for seeing anything in her husband that she mightnt see unaided but she had ever hitherto been of a nature to accept with modest gratitude any better description of a felt truth than her little limits terribly marked she knew in the direction of saying the right thingsenabled her to make thus it was at any rate that she was able to live more or less in the light of the fact expressed so lucidly by their common comforterthe fact that the prince was saving up for some very mysterious but very fine eventual purpose all the wisdom all the answers to his questions all the impressions and generalisations he gathered putting them away and packing them down because he wanted his great gun to be loaded to the brim on the day he should decide to let it off he wanted first to make sure of the whole of the subject that was unrolling itself before him after which the innumerable facts he had collected would find their use he knew what he was about trust him at last therefore to make and to some effect his big noise and mrs assingham had repeated that he knew what he was about it was the happy form of this assurance that had remained with maggie it could always come in for her that amerigo knew what he was about he might at moments seem vague seem absent seem even bored this when away from her father with whom it was impossible for him to appear anything but respectfully occupied he let his native gaiety go in outbreaks of song or even of quite whimsical senseless sound either expressive of intimate relaxation or else fantastically plaintive he might at times reflect with the frankest lucidity on the circumstance that the case was for a good while yet absolutely settled in regard to what he still had left at home of his very own in regard to the main seat of his affection the house in rome the big black palace the palazzo nero as he was fond of naming it and also on the question of the villa in the sabine hills which she had at the time of their engagement seen and yearned over and the castello proper described by him always as the perched place that had as she knew formerly stood up on the pedestal of its mountainslope showing beautifully blue from afar as the head and front of the princedom he might rejoice in certain moods over the so longestranged state of these properties not indeed all irreclaimably alienated but encumbered with unending leases and charges with obstinate occupants with impossibilities of useall without counting the cloud of mortgages that had from far back buried them beneath the ashes of rage and remorse a shroud as thick as the layer once resting on the towns at the foot of vesuvius and actually making of any present restorative effort a process much akin to slow excavation just so he might with another turn of his humour almost wail for these brightest spots of his lost paradise declaring that he was an idiot not to be able to bring himself to face the sacrificessacrifices resting if definitely anywhere with mr ververnecessary for winning them back  one of the most comfortable things between the husband and the wife meanwhileone of those easy certitudes they could be merely gay aboutwas that she never admired him so much or so found him heartbreakingly handsome clever irresistible in the very degree in which he had originally and fatally dawned upon her as when she saw other women reduced to the same passive pulp that had then begun once for all to constitute her substance there was really nothing they had talked of together with more intimate and familiar pleasantry than of the license and privilege the boundless happy margin thus established for each she going so far as to put it that even should he some day get drunk and beat her the spectacle of him with hated rivals would after no matter what extremity always for the sovereign charm of it charm of it in itself and as the exhibition of him that most deeply moved her suffice to bring her round what would therefore be more open to him than to keep her in love with him he agreed with all his heart at these light moments that his course wouldnt then be difficult inasmuch as so simply constituted as he was on all the precious questionand why should he be ashamed of ithe knew but one way with the fair they had to be fairand he was fastidious and particular his standard was high but when once this was the case what relation with them was conceivable what relation was decent rudimentary properly human but that of a plain interest in the fairness his interest she always answered happened not to be plain and plainness all round had little to do with the matter which was marked on the contrary by the richest variety of colour but the working basis at all events had been settledthe miss maddocks of life been assured of their importance for him how conveniently assured maggieto take him too into the jokehad more than once gone so far as to mention to her father since it fell in easily with the tenderness of her disposition to remember she might occasionally make him happy by an intimate confidence this was one of her rulesfull as she was of little rules considerations provisions there were things she of course couldnt tell him in so many words about amerigo and herself and about their happiness and their union and their deepest depthsand there were other things she neednt but there were also those that were both true and amusing both communicable and real and of these with her so conscious so delicately cultivated scheme of conduct as a daughter she could make her profit at will a pleasant hush for that matter had fallen on most of the elements while she lingered apart with her companion it involved this serenity innumerable complete assumptions since so ordered and so splendid a rest all the tokens spreading about them of confidence solidly supported might have suggested for persons of poorer pitch the very insolence of facility still they werent insolentthey werent our pair could reflect they were only blissful and grateful and personally modest not ashamed of knowing with competence when great things were great when good things were good and when safe things were safe and not therefore placed below their fortune by timidity which would have been as bad as being below it by impudence worthy of it as they were and as each appears under our last possible analysis to have wished to make the other feel that they were what they most finally exhaled into the evening air as their eyes mildly met may well have been a kind of helplessness in their felicity their rightness the justification of everythingsomething they so felt the pulse ofsat there with them but they might have been asking themselves a little blankly to what further use they could put anything so perfect they had created and nursed and established it they had housed it here in dignity and crowned it with comfort but mightnt the moment possibly count for themor count at least for us while we watch them with their fate all before themas the dawn of the discovery that it doesnt always meet all contingencies to be right otherwise why should maggie have found a word of definite doubtthe expression of the fine pang determined in her a few hours beforerise after a time to her lips she took so for granted moreover her companions intelligence of her doubt that the mere vagueness of her question could say it all what is it after all that they want to do to you they were for the princess too the hovering forces of which mrs rance was the symbol and her father only smiling back now at his ease took no trouble to appear not to know what she meant what she meantwhen once she had spokencould come out well enough though indeed it was nothing after they had come to the point that could serve as ground for a great defensive campaign the waters of talk spread a little and maggie presently contributed an idea in saying what has really happened is that the proportions for us are altered he accepted equally for the time this somewhat cryptic remark he still failed to challenge her even when she added that it wouldnt so much matter if he hadnt been so terribly young he uttered a sound of protest only when she went to declare that she ought as a daughter in common decency to have waited yet by that time she was already herself admitting that she should have had to wait longif she waited that is till he was old but there was a way since you are an irresistible youth weve got to face it that somehow is what that woman has made me feel therell be others                                  x  to talk of it thus appeared at last a positive relief to him yes therell be others but youll see me through  she hesitated do you mean if you give in  oh no through my holding out  maggie waited again but when she spoke it had an effect of abruptness why should you hold out forever  he gave none the less no startand this as from the habit of taking anything taking everything from her as harmonious but it was quite written upon him too for that matter that holding out wouldnt be so very completely his natural or at any rate his acquired form his appearance would have testified that he might have to do so a long timefor a man so greatly beset this appearance that is spoke but little as yet of short remainders and simplified sensesand all in spite of his being a small spare slightly stale person deprived of the general prerogative of presence it was not by mass or weight or vulgar immediate quantity that he would in the future any more than he had done in the past insist or resist or prevail there was even something in him that made his position on any occasion made his relation to any scene or to any group a matter of the back of the stage of an almost visibly conscious want of affinity with the footlights he would have figured less than anything the stagemanager or the author of the play who most occupy the foreground he might be at the best the financial backer watching his interests from the wing but in rather confessed ignorance of the mysteries of mimicry barely taller than his daughter he pressed at no point on the presumed propriety of his greater stoutness he had lost early in life much of his crisp closelycurling hair the fineness of which was repeated in a small neat beard too compact to be called full though worn equally as for a mark where other marks were wanting on lip and cheek and chin his neat colourless face provided with the merely indispensable features suggested immediately for a description that it was clear and in this manner somewhat resembled a small decent room cleanswept and unencumbered with furniture but drawing a particular advantage as might presently be noted from the outlook of a pair of ample and uncurtained windows there was something in adam ververs eyes that both admitted the morning and the evening in unusual quantities and gave the modest area the outward extension of a view that was big even when restricted to stars deeply and changeably blue though not romantically large they were yet youthfully almost strangely beautiful with their ambiguity of your scarce knowing if they most carried their possessors vision out or most opened themselves to your own whatever you might feel they stamped the place with their importance as the houseagents say so that on one side or the other you were never out of their range were moving about for possible community opportunity the sight of you scarce knew what either before them or behind them if other importances not to extend the question kept themselves down they were in no direction less obtruded than in that of our friends dress adopted once for all as with a sort of sumptuary scruple he wore every day of the year whatever the occasion the same little black cut away coat of the fashion of his younger time he wore the same coollooking trousers chequered in black and whitethe proper harmony with which he inveterately considered was a sprigged blue satin necktie and over his concave little stomach quaintly indifferent to climates and seasons a white duck waistcoat should you really he now asked like me to marry he spoke as if coming from his daughter herself it might be an idea which for that matter he would be ready to carry out should she definitely say so  definite however just yet she was not prepared to be though it seemed to come to her with force as she thought that there was a truth in the connection to utter what i feel is that there is somehow something that used to be right and that ive made wrong it used to be right that you hadnt married and that you didnt seem to want to it used alsoshe continued to make out to seem easy for the question not to come up thats what ive made different it does come up it will come up  you dont think i can keep it down mr ververs tone was cheerfully pensive  well ive given you by my move all the trouble of having to  he liked the tenderness of her idea and it made him as she sat near him pass his arm about her i guess i dont feel as if you had moved very far youve only moved next door  well she continued i dont feel as if it were fair for me just to have given you a push and left you so if ive made the difference for you i must think of the difference  then what darling he indulgently asked do you think  thats just what i dont yet know but i must find out we must think togetheras weve always thought what i mean she went on after a moment is that it strikes me that i ought to at least offer you some alternative i ought to have worked one out for you  an alternative to what  well to your simply missing what youve lostwithout anything being done about it  but what have i lost  she thought a minute as if it were difficult to say yet as if she more and more saw it well whatever it was that before kept us from thinking and kept you really as you might say in the market it was as if you couldnt be in the market when you were married to me or rather as if i kept people off innocently by being married to you now that im married to some one else youre as in consequence married to nobody therefore you may be married to anybody to everybody people dont see why you shouldnt be married to them  isnt it enough of a reason he mildly inquired that i dont want to be  its enough of a reason yes but to be enough of a reason it has to be too much of a trouble i mean for you it has to be too much of a fight you ask me what youve lost maggie continued to explain the not having to take the trouble and to make the fightthats what youve lost the advantage the happiness of being just as you werebecause i was just as i wasthats what you miss  so that you think her father presently said that i had better get married just in order to be as i was before  the detached tone of itdetached as if innocently to amuse her by showing his desire to accommodatewas so far successful as to draw from her gravity a short light laugh well what i dont want you to feel is that if you were to i shouldnt understand i should understand thats all said the princess gently  her companion turned it pleasantly over you dont go so far as to wish me to take somebody i dont like  ah father she sighed you know how far i gohow far i could go but i only wish that if you ever should like anybody you may never doubt of my feeling how ive brought you to it youll always know that i know that its my fault  you mean he went on in his contemplative way that it will be you wholl take the consequences  maggie just considered ill leave you all the good ones but ill take the bad  well thats handsome he emphasised his sense of it by drawing her closer and holding her more tenderly its about all i could expect of you so far as youve wronged me therefore well call it square ill let you know in time if i see a prospect of your having to take it up but am i to understand meanwhile he soon went on that ready as you are to see me through my collapse youre not ready or not as ready to see me through my resistance ive got to be a regular martyr before youll be inspired  she demurred at his way of putting it why if you like it you know it wont be a collapse  then why talk about seeing me through at all i shall only collapse if i do like it but what i seem to feel is that i dont want to like it that is he amended unless i feel surer i do than appears very probable i dont want to have to think i like it in a case when i really shant ive had to do that in some cases he confessedwhen it has been a question of other things i dont want he wound up to be made to make a mistake  ah but its too dreadful she returned that you should even have to fearor just nervously to dreamthat you may be what does that show after all she asked but that you do really well within feel a want what does it show but that youre truly susceptible  well it may show thathe defended himself against nothing but it shows also i think that charming women are in the kind of life were leading now numerous and formidable  maggie entertained for a moment the proposition under cover of which however she passed quickly from the general to the particular do you feel mrs rance to be charming  well i feel her to be formidable when they cast a spell it comes to the same thing i think shed do anything  oh well id help you the princess said with decision as against herif thats all you require its too funny she went on before he again spoke that mrs rance should be here at all but if you talk of the life we lead much of it is altogether im bound to say too funny the thing is maggie developed under this impression that i dont think we lead as regards other people any life at all we dont at any rate it seems to me lead half the life we might and so it seems i think to amerigo so it seems also im sure to fanny assingham  mr ververas if from due regard for these personsconsidered a little what life would they like us to lead  oh its not a question i think on which they quite feel together she thinks dear fanny that we ought to be greater  greater he echoed it vaguely and amerigo too you say  ah yesher reply was prompt but amerigo doesnt mind he doesnt care i mean what we do its for us he considers to see things exactly as we wish fanny herself maggie pursued thinks hes magnificent magnificent i mean for taking everything as it is for accepting the social limitations of our life for not missing what we dont give him  mr verver attended then if he doesnt miss it his magnificence is easy  it is easythats exactly what i think if there were things he did miss and if in spite of them he were always sweet then no doubt he would be a more or less unappreciated hero he could be a herohe will be one if its ever necessary but it will be about something better than our dreariness i know the princess declared where hes magnificent and she rested a minute on that she ended however as she had begun were not all the same committed to anything stupid if we ought to be grander as fanny thinks we can be grander theres nothing to prevent  is it a strict moral obligation adam verver inquired  noits for the amusement  for whose for fannys own  for everyonesthough i dare say fannys would be a large part she hesitated she had now it might have appeared something more to bring out which she finally produced for yours in particular sayif you go into the question she even bravely followed it up i havent really after all had to think much to see that much more can be done for you than is done  mr verver uttered an odd vague sound dont you think a good deal is done when you come out and talk to me this way  ah said his daughter smiling at him we make too much of that and then to explain thats good and its naturalbut it isnt great we forget that were as free as air  well thats great mr verver pleaded great if we act on it not if we dont  she continued to smile and he took her smile wondering again a little by this time however struck more and more by an intensity in it that belied a light tone what do you want he demanded to do to me and he added as she didnt say youve got something in your mind it had come to him within the minute that from the beginning of their session there she had been keeping something back and that an impression of this had more than once in spite of his general theoretic respect for her present right to personal reserves and mysteries almost ceased to be vague in him there had been from the first something in her anxious eyes in the way she occasionally lost herself that it would perfectly explain he was therefore now quite sure  youve got something up your sleeve  she had a silence that made him right well when i tell you youll understand its only up my sleeve in the sense of being in a letter i got this morning all day yesit has been in my mind ive been asking myself if it were quite the right moment or in any way fair to ask you if you could stand just now another woman  it relieved him a little yet the beautiful consideration of her manner made it in a degree portentous stand one  well mind her coming  he staredthen he laughed it depends on who she is  thereyou see ive at all events been thinking whether youd take this particular person but as a worry the more whether that is youd go so far with her in your notion of having to be kind  he gave at this the quickest shake to his foot how far would she go in her notion of it  well his daughter returned you know how far in a general way charlotte stant goes  charlotte is she coming  she writes me practically that shed like to if were so good as to ask her  mr verver continued to gaze but rather as if waiting for more then as everything appeared to have come his expression had a drop if this was all it was simple then why in the world not  maggies face lighted anew but it was now another light it isnt a want of tact  to ask her  to propose it to you  that i should ask her  he put the question as an effect of his remnant of vagueness but this had also its own effect maggie wondered an instant after which as with a flush of recognition she took it up it would be too beautiful if you would  this clearly had not been her first ideathe chance of his words had prompted it do you mean write to her myself  yesit would be kind it would be quite beautiful of you that is of course said maggie if you sincerely can  he appeared to wonder an instant why he sincerely shouldnt and indeed for that matter where the question of sincerity came in this virtue between him and his daughters friend had surely been taken for granted my dear child he returned i dont think im afraid of charlotte  well thats just what its lovely to have from you from the moment youre notthe least little bitill immediately invite her  but where in the world is she he spoke as if he had not thought of charlotte nor so much as heard her name pronounced for a very long time he quite in fact amicably almost amusedly woke up to her  shes in brittany at a little bathingplace with some people i dont know shes always with people poor dearshe rather has to be even when as is sometimes the case theyre people she doesnt immensely like  well i guess she likes us said adam verver yesfortunately she likes us and if i wasnt afraid of spoiling it for you maggie added id even mention that youre not the one of our number she likes least  why should that spoil it for me  oh my dear you know what else have we been talking about it costs you so much to be liked thats why i hesitated to tell you of my letter  he stared a momentas if the subject had suddenly grown out of recognition but charlotteon other visitsnever used to cost me anything  noonly her keep maggie smiled  then i dont think i mind her keepif thats all the princess however it was clear wished to be thoroughly conscientious well it may not be quite all if i think of its being pleasant to have her its because she will make a difference  well whats the harm in that if its but a difference for the better  ah thenthere you are and the princess showed in her smile her small triumphant wisdom if you acknowledge a possible difference for the better were not after all so tremendously right as we are i mean were notas satisfied and amused we do see there are ways of being grander  but will charlotte stant her father asked with surprise make us grander  maggie on this looking at him well had a remarkable reply yes i think really grander  he thought for if this was a sudden opening he wished but the more to meet it because shes so handsome  no father and the princess was almost solemn because shes so great  great  great in nature in character in spirit great in life  so mr verver echoed what has she donein life  well she has been brave and bright said maggie that maynt sound like much but she has been so in the face of things that might well have made it too difficult for many other girls she hasnt a creature in the world reallythat is nearlybelonging to her only acquaintances who in all sorts of ways make use of her and distant relations who are so afraid shell make use of them that they seldom let her look at them  mr verver was struckand as usual to some purpose if we get her here to improve us dont we too then make use of her  it pulled the princess up however but an instant were old old friendswe do her good too i should always even at the worstspeaking for myselfadmire her still more than i used her  i see that always does good  maggie hesitated certainlyshe knows it she knows i mean how great i think her courage and her cleverness shes not afraidnot of anything and yet she no more ever takes a liberty with you than if she trembled for her life and then shes interestingwhich plenty of other people with plenty of other merits never are a bit in which fine flicker of vision the truth widened to the princesss view i myself of course dont take liberties but then i do always by nature tremble for my life thats the way i live  oh i say love her father vaguely murmured  yes i live in terror she insisted im a small creeping thing  youll not persuade me that youre not as good as charlotte stant he still placidly enough remarked  i may be as good but im not so greatand thats what were talking about she has a great imagination she has in every way a great attitude she has above all a great conscience more perhaps than ever in her life before maggie addressed her father at this moment with a shade of the absolute in her tone she had never come so near telling him what he should take it from her to believe she has only twopence in the worldbut that has nothing to do with it or rather indeedshe quickly corrected herselfit has everything for she doesnt care i never saw her do anything but laugh at her poverty her life has been harder than anyone knows  it was moreover as if thus unprecedentedly positive his child had an effect upon him that mr verver really felt as a new thing why then havent you told me about her before  well havent we always known  i should have thought he submitted that we had already pretty well sized her up  certainlywe long ago quite took her for granted but things change with time and i seem to know that after this interval im going to like her better than ever ive lived more myself im older and one judges better yes im going to see in charlotte said the princessand speaking now as with high and free expectationmore than ive ever seen  then ill try to do so too she wasit came back to mr verver morethe one of your friends i thought the best for you  his companion however was so launched in her permitted liberty of appreciation that she for the moment scarce heard him she was lost in the case she made out the vision of the different ways in which charlotte had distinguished herself  she would have liked for instanceim sure she would have liked extremelyto marry and nothing in general is more ridiculous even when it has been pathetic than a woman who has tried and has not been able  it had all mr ververs attention she has tried  she has seen cases where she would have liked to  but she has not been able  well there are more cases in europe in which it doesnt come to girls who are poor than in which it does come to them especially said maggie with her continued competence when theyre americans  well her father now met her and met her cheerfully on all sides unless you mean he suggested that when the girls are american there are more cases in which it comes to the rich than to the poor  she looked at him goodhumouredly that may bebut im not going to be smothered in my case it ought to make meif i were in danger of being a foolall the nicer to people like charlotte its not hard for me she practically explained not to be ridiculousunless in a very different way i might easily be ridiculous i suppose by behaving as if i thought i had done a great thing charlotte at any rate has done nothing and anyone can see it and see also that its rather strange and yet no oneno one not awfully presumptuous or offensive would like or would dare to treat her just as she is as anything but quite right thats what it is to have something about you that carries things off  mr ververs silence on this could only be a sign that she had caused her story to interest him though the sign when he spoke was perhaps even sharper and is it also what you mean by charlottes being great  well said maggie its one of her ways but she has many  again for a little her father considered and who is it she has tried to marry  maggie on her side as well waited as if to bring it out with effect but she after a minute either renounced or encountered an obstacle im afraid im not sure  then how do you know  well i dont knowand qualifying again she was earnestly emphatic i only make it out for myself  but you must make it out about someone in particular  she had another pause i dont think i want even for myself to put names and times to pull away any veil ive an idea there has been more than once somebody im not acquainted withand neednt be or want to be in any case its all over and beyond giving her credit for everything its none of my business  mr verver deferred yet he discriminated i dont see how you can give credit without knowing the facts  cant i give itgenerallyfor dignity dignity i mean in misfortune  youve got to postulate the misfortune first  well said maggie i can do that isnt it always a misfortune to bewhen youre so fineso wasted and yet she went on not to wail about it not to look even as if you knew it  mr verver seemed at first to face this as a large question and then after a little solicited by another view to let the appeal drop well she mustnt be wasted we wont at least have waste  it produced in maggies face another gratitude then dear sir thats all i want  and it would apparently have settled their question and ended their talk if her father had not after a little shown the disposition to revert how many times are you supposing that she has tried  once more at this and as if she hadnt been couldnt be hated to be in such delicate matters literal she was moved to attenuate oh i dont say she absolutely ever tried  he looked perplexed but if she has so absolutely failed what then had she done  she has sufferedshe has done that and the princess added she has lovedand she has lost  mr verver however still wondered but how many times  maggie hesitated but it cleared up once is enough enough that is for one to be kind to her  her father listened yet not challengingonly as with a need of some basis on which under these new lights his bounty could be firm but has she told you nothing  ah thank goodness no  he stared then dont young women tell  because you mean its just what theyre supposed to do she looked at him flushed again now with which after another hesitation do young men tell she asked  he gave a short laugh how do i know my dear what young men do  then how do i know father what vulgar girls do  i seei see he quickly returned  but she spoke the next moment as if she might odiously have been sharp what happens at least is that where theres a great deal of pride theres a great deal of silence i dont know i admit what i should do if i were lonely and sorefor what sorrow to speak of have i ever had in my life i dont know even if im proudit seems to me the question has never come up for me  oh i guess youre proud mag her father cheerfully interposed i mean i guess youre proud enough  well then i hope im humble enough too i might at all events for all i know be abject under a blow how can i tell do you realise father that ive never had the least blow  he gave her a long quiet look who should realise if i dont  well youll realise when i have one she exclaimed with a short laugh that resembled as for good reasons his own of a minute before i wouldnt in any case have let her tell me what would have been dreadful to me for such wounds and shames are dreadful at least she added catching herself up i suppose they are for what as i say do i know of them i dont want to knowshe spoke quite with vehemence there are things that are sacred whether theyre joys or pains but one can always for safety be kind she kept on one feels when thats right  she had got up with these last words she stood there before him with that particular suggestion in her aspect to which even the long habit of their life together had not closed his sense kept sharp year after year by the collation of types and signs the comparison of fine object with fine object of one degree of finish of one form of the exquisite with anotherthe appearance of some slight slim draped antique of vatican or capitoline halls late and refined rare as a note and immortal as a link set in motion by the miraculous infusion of a modern impulse and yet for all the sudden freedom of folds and footsteps forsaken after centuries by their pedestal keeping still the quality the perfect felicity of the statue the blurred absent eyes the smoothed elegant nameless head the impersonal flit of a creature lost in an alien age and passing as an image in worn relief round and round a precious vase she had always had odd moments of striking him daughter of his very own though she was as a figure thus simplified generalised in its grace a figure with which his human connection was fairly interrupted by some vague analogy of turn and attitude something shyly mythological and nymphlike the trick he was not uncomplacently aware was mainly of his own mind it came from his caring for precious vases only less than for precious daughters and what was more to the point still it often operated while he was quite at the same time conscious that maggie had been described even in her prettiness as primmrs rance herself had enthusiastically used the word of her while he remembered that when once she had been told before him familiarly that she resembled a nun she had replied that she was delighted to hear it and would certainly try to while also finally it was present to him that discreetly heedless thanks to her long association with nobleness in art to the leaps and bounds of fashion she brought her hair down very straight and flat over her temples in the constant manner of her mother who had not been a bit mythological nymphs and nuns were certainly separate types but mr verver when he really amused himself let consistency go the play of vision was at all events so rooted in him that he could receive impressions of sense even while positively thinking he was positively thinking while maggie stood there and it led for him to yet another questionwhich in its turn led to others still do you regard the condition as hers then that you spoke of a minute ago  the condition  why that of having loved so intensely that shes as you say beyond everything  maggie had scarcely to reflecther answer was so prompt oh no shes beyond nothing for she has had nothing  i see you must have had things to be them its a kind of law of perspective  maggie didnt know about the law but she continued definite shes not for example beyond help  oh well then she shall have all we can give her ill write to her he said with pleasure  angel she answered as she gaily and tenderly looked at him  true as this might be however there was one thing morehe was an angel with a human curiosity has she told you she likes me much  certainly she has told mebut i wont pamper you let it be enough for you it has always been one of my reasons for liking her  then shes indeed not beyond everything mr verver more or less humorously observed  oh it isnt thank goodness that shes in love with you its not as i told you at first the sort of thing for you to fear  he had spoken with cheer but it appeared to drop before this reassurance as if the latter overdid his alarm and that should be corrected oh my dear ive always thought of her as a little girl  ah shes not a little girl said the princess  then ill write to her as a brilliant woman  its exactly what she is  mr verver had got up as he spoke and for a little before retracing their steps they stood looking at each other as if they had really arranged something they had come out together for themselves but it had produced something more what it had produced was in fact expressed by the words with which he met his companions last emphasis well she has a famous friend in you princess  maggie took this init was too plain for a protest do you know what im really thinking of she asked  he wondered with her eyes on himeyes of contentment at her freedom now to talk and he wasnt such a fool he presently showed as not suddenly to arrive at it why of your finding her at last yourself a husband  good for you maggie smiled but it will take she added some looking  then let me look right here with you her father said as they walked on                                 xi  mrs assingham and the colonel quitting fawns before the end of september had come back later on and now a couple of weeks after they were again interrupting their stay but this time with the question of their return left to depend on matters that were rather hinted at than importunately named the lutches and mrs rance had also by the action of charlotte stants arrival ceased to linger though with hopes and theories as to some promptitude of renewal of which the lively expression awakening the echoes of the great stonepaved oakpanelled galleried hall that was not the least interesting feature of the place seemed still a property of the air it was on this admirable spot that before her october afternoon had waned fanny assingham spent with her easy host a few moments which led to her announcing her own and her husbands final secession at the same time as they tempted her to point the moral of all vain reverberations the double door of the house stood open to an effect of hazy autumn sunshine a wonderful windless waiting golden hour under the influence of which adam verver met his genial friend as she came to drop into the postbox with her own hand a thick sheaf of letters they presently thereafter left the house together and drew out halfanhour on the terrace in a manner they were to revert to in thought later on as that of persons who really had been taking leave of each other at a parting of the ways he traced his impression on coming to consider back to a mere three words she had begun by using about charlotte stant she simply cleared them outthose had been the three words thrown off in reference to the general golden peace that the kentish october had gradually ushered in the halcyon days the full beauty of which had appeared to shine out for them after charlottes arrival for it was during these days that mrs rance and the miss lutches had been observed to be gathering themselves for departure and it was with that difference made that the sense of the whole situation showed most fairthe sense of how right they had been to engage for so ample a residence and of all the pleasure so fruity an autumn there could hold in its lap this was what had occurred that their lesson had been learned and what mrs assingham had dwelt upon was that without charlotte it would have been learned but half it would certainly not have been taught by mrs rance and the miss lutches if these ladies had remained with them as long as at one time seemed probable charlottes light intervention had thus become a cause operating covertly but none the less actively and fanny assinghams speech which she had followed up a little echoed within him fairly to startle him as the indication of something irresistible he could see now how this superior force had worked and he fairly liked to recover the sightlittle harm as he dreamed of doing little ill as he dreamed of wishing the three ladies whom he had after all entertained for a stiffish series of days she had been so vague and quiet about it wonderful charlotte that he hadnt known what was happening happening that is as a result of her influence their fires as they felt her turned to smoke mrs assingham remarked which he was to reflect on indeed even while they strolled he had retained since his long talk with maggiethe talk that had settled the matter of his own direct invitation to her friendan odd little taste as he would have described it for hearing things said about this young woman hearing so to speak what could be said about her almost as it her portrait by some eminent hand were going on so that he watched it grow under the multiplication of touches mrs assingham it struck him applied two or three of the finest in their discussion of their young friendso different a figure now from that early playmate of maggies as to whom he could almost recall from of old the definite occasions of his having paternally lumped the two children together in the recommendation that they shouldnt make too much noise nor eat too much jam his companion professed that in the light of charlottes prompt influence she had not been a stranger to a pang of pity for their recent visitors i felt in fact privately so sorry for them that i kept my impression to myself while they were herewishing not to put the rest of you on the scent neither maggie nor the prince nor yourself nor even charlotte herself if you didnt happen to notice since you didnt apparently i perhaps now strike you as extravagant but im noti followed it all one saw the consciousness i speak of come over the poor things very much as i suppose people at the court of the borgias may have watched each other begin to look queer after having had the honour of taking wine with the heads of the family my comparisons only a little awkward for i dont in the least mean that charlotte was consciously dropping poison into their cup she was just herself their poison in the sense of mortally disagreeing with thembut she didnt know it  ah she didnt know it mr verver had asked with interest  well i think she didntmrs assingham had to admit that she hadnt pressingly sounded her i dont pretend to be sure in every connection of what charlotte knows she doesnt certainly like to make people suffernot in general as is the case with so many of us even other women she likes much rather to put them at their ease with her she likes that isas all pleasant people doto be liked  ah she likes to be liked her companion had gone on  she did at the same time no doubt want to help usto put us at our ease that is she wanted to put youand to put maggie about you so far as that went she had a plan but it was only afterit was not before i really believethat she saw how effectively she could work  again as mr verver felt he must have taken it up ah she wanted to help uswanted to help me  why mrs assingham asked after an instant should it surprise you  he just thought oh it doesnt  she saw of course as soon as she came with her quickness where we all were she didnt need each of us to go by appointment to her room at night or take her out into the fields for our palpitating tale no doubt even she was rather impatient  of the poor things mr verver had here inquired while he waited  well of your not yourselves being soand of your not in particular i havent the least doubt in the world par exemple that she thinks you too meek  oh she thinks me too meek  and she had been sent for on the very face of it to work right in all she had to do after all was to be nice to you  toame said adam verver  he could remember now that his friend had positively had a laugh for his tone to you and to every one she had only to be what she isand to be it all round if shes charming how can she help it so it was and so only that she actedas the borgia wine used to act one saw it come over themthe extent to which in her particular way a woman a woman other and so other than themselves could be charming one saw them understand and exchange looks then one saw them lose heart and decide to move for what they had to take home was that its she whos the real thing  ah its she whos the real thing as he had not hitherto taken it home as completely as the miss lutches and mrs rance so doubtless he had now a little appeared to offer submission in his appeal i see i seehe could at least simply take it home now yet as not without wanting at the same time to be sure of what the real thing was and what would it beadefinitely that you understand by that  she had only for an instant not found it easy to say why exactly what those women themselves want to be and what her effect on them is to make them recognise that they never will  ohof course never  it not only remained and abode with them it positively developed and deepened after this talk that the luxurious side of his personal existence was now again furnished socially speaking with the thing classed and stamped as realjust as he had been able to think of it as not otherwise enriched in consequence of his daughters marriage the note of reality in so much projected light continued to have for him the charm and the importance of which the maximum had occasionally been reached in his great findscontinued beyond any other to keep him attentive and gratified nothing perhaps might affect us as queerer had we time to look into it than this application of the same measure of value to such different pieces of property as old persian carpets say and new human acquisitions all the more indeed that the amiable man was not without an inkling on his own side that he was as a taster of life economically constructed he put into his one little glass everything he raised to his lips and it was as if he had always carried in his pocket like a tool of his trade this receptacle a little glass cut with a fineness of which the art had long since been lost and kept in an old morocco case stamped in uneffaceable gilt with the arms of a deposed dynasty as it had served him to satisfy himself so to speak both about amerigo and about the bernadino luini he had happened to come to knowledge of at the time he was consenting to the announcement of his daughters betrothal so it served him at present to satisfy himself about charlotte stant and an extraordinary set of oriental tiles of which he had lately got wind to which a provoking legend was attached and as to which he had made out contentedly that further news was to be obtained from a certain mr gutermannseuss of brighton it was all at bottom in him the aesthetic principle planted where it could burn with a cold still flame where it fed almost wholly on the material directly involved on the idea followed by appropriation of plastic beauty of the thing visibly perfect in its kind where in short in spite of the general tendency of the devouring element to spread the rest of his spiritual furniture modest scattered and tended with unconscious care escaped the consumption that in so many cases proceeds from the undue keepingup of profane altarfires adam verver had in other words learnt the lesson of the senses to the end of his own little book without having for a day raised the smallest scandal in his economy at large being in this particular not unlike those fortunate bachelors or other gentlemen of pleasure who so manage their entertainment of compromising company that even the austerest housekeeper occupied and competent below stairs never feels obliged to give warning  that figure has however a freedom that the occasion doubtless scarce demands though we may retain it for its rough negative value it was to come to pass by a pressure applied to the situation wholly from within that before the first ten days of november had elapsed he found himself practically alone at fawns with his young friend amerigo and maggie having with a certain abruptness invited his assent to their going abroad for a month since his amusement was now scarce less happily assured than his security an impulse eminently natural had stirred within the prince his life as for some time established was deliciously dull and thereby on the whole what he best liked but a small gust of yearning had swept over him and maggie repeated to her father with infinite admiration the pretty terms in which after it had lasted a little he had described to her this experience he called it a serenade a low music that outside one of the windows of the sleeping house disturbed his rest at night timid as it was and plaintive he yet couldnt close his eyes for it and when finally rising on tiptoe he had looked out he had recognised in the figure below with a mandolin all duskily draped in her grace the raised appealing eyes and the one irresistible voice of the evertobeloved italy sooner or later that way one had to listen it was a hovering haunting ghost as of a creature to whom one had done a wrong a dim pathetic shade crying out to be comforted for this there was obviously but one wayas there were doubtless also many words for the simple fact that so prime a roman had a fancy for again seeing rome they would accordinglyhadnt they bettergo for a little maggie meanwhile making the tooabsurdly artful point with her father so that he repeated it in his amusement to charlotte stant to whom he was by this time conscious of addressing many remarks that it was absolutely when she came to think the first thing amerigo had ever asked of her she doesnt count of course his having asked of her to marry him this was mr ververs indulgent criticism but he found charlotte equally touched by the ingenuous maggie in easy agreement with him over the question if the prince had asked something of his wife every day in the year this would be still no reason why the poor dear man should not in a beautiful fit of homesickness revisit without reproach his native country  what his fatherinlaw frankly counselled was that the reasonable the really too reasonable pair should while they were about it take three or four weeks of paris as wellparis being always for mr verver in any stress of sympathy a suggestion that rose of itself to the lips if they would only do that on their way back or however they preferred it charlotte and he would go over to join them there for a small lookthough even then assuredly as he had it at heart to add not in the least because they should have found themselves bored at being left together the fate of this last proposal indeed was that it reeled for the moment under an assault of destructive analysis from maggie whohaving as she granted to choose between being an unnatural daughter or an unnatural mother and electing for the formerwanted to know what would become of the principino if the house were cleared of everyone but the servants her question had fairly resounded but it had afterwards like many of her questions dropped still more effectively than it had risen the highest moral of the matter being before the couple took their departure that mrs noble and dr brady must mount unchallenged guard over the august little crib if she hadnt supremely believed in the majestic value of the nurse whose experience was in itself the amplest of pillows just as her attention was a spreading canopy from which precedent and reminiscence dropped as thickly as parted curtainsif she hadnt been able to rest in this confidence she would fairly have sent her husband on his journey without her in the same manner if the sweetestfor it was so she qualified himof little country doctors hadnt proved to her his wisdom by rendering irresistible especially on rainy days and in direct proportion to the frequency of his calls adapted to all weathers that she should converse with him for hours over causes and consequences over what he had found to answer with his little five at home she would have drawn scant support from the presence of a mere grandfather and a mere brilliant friend these persons accordingly her own predominance having thus for the time given way could carry with a certain ease and above all with mutual aid their consciousness of a charge so far as their office weighed they could help each other with itwhich was in fact to become as mrs noble herself loomed larger for them not a little of a relief and a diversion  mr verver met his young friend at certain hours in the daynursery very much as he had regularly met the childs fond mothercharlotte having as she clearly considered given maggie equal pledges and desiring never to fail of the last word for the daily letter she had promised to write she wrote with high fidelity she let her companion know and the effect of it was remarkably enough that he himself didnt write the reason of this was partly that charlotte told all about himwhich she also let him know she didand partly that he enjoyed feeling as a consequence that he was generally quite systematically eased and as they said done for committed as it were to this charming and clever young woman who by becoming for him a domestic resource had become for him practically a new person and committed especially in his own house which somehow made his sense of it a deeper thinghe took an interest in seeing how far the connection could carry him could perhaps even lead him and in thus putting to the test for pleasant verification what fanny assingham had said at the last about the difference such a girl could make she was really making one now in their simplified existence and a very considerable one though there was no one to compare her with as there had been so usefully for fannyno mrs rance no kitty no dotty lutch to help her to be felt according to fannys diagnosis as real she was real decidedly from other causes and mr verver grew in time even a little amused at the amount of machinery mrs assingham had seemed to see needed for pointing it she was directly and immediately real real on a pleasantly reduced and intimate scale and at no moments more so than during thoseat which we have just glancedwhen mrs noble made them both together feel that she she alone in the absence of the queenmother was regent of the realm and governess of the heir treated on such occasions as at best a pair of dangling and merely nominal courtfunctionaries picturesque hereditary triflers entitled to the petites entrees but quite external to the state which began and ended with the nursery they could only retire in quickened sociability to what was left them of the palace there to digest their gilded insignificance and cultivate in regard to the true executive such snufftaking ironies as might belong to rococo chamberlains moving among china lapdogs  every evening after dinner charlotte stant played to him seated at the piano and requiring no music she went through his favourite thingsand he had many favouriteswith a facility that never failed or that failed but just enough to pick itself up at a touch from his fitful voice she could play anything she could play everythingalways shockingly she of course insisted but always by his own vague measure very much as if she might slim sinuous and strong and with practised passion have been playing lawntennis or endlessly and rhythmically waltzing his love of music unlike his other loves owned to vaguenesses but while on his comparatively shaded sofa and smoking smoking always smoking in the great fawns drawingroom as everywhere the cigars of his youth rank with associationswhile i say he so listened to charlottes piano where the score was ever absent but between the lighted candles the picture distinct the vagueness spread itself about him like some boundless carpet a surface delightfully soft to the pressure of his interest it was a manner of passing the time that rather replaced conversation but the air at the end none the less before they separated had a way of seeming full of the echoes of talk they separated in the hushed house not quite easily yet not quite awkwardly either with tapers that twinkled in the large dark spaces and for the most part so late that the last solemn servant had been dismissed for the night  late as it was on a particular evening toward the end of october there had been a full word or two dropped into the stillstirring sea of other voicesa word or two that affected our friend even at the moment and rather oddly as louder and rounder than any previous sound and then he had lingered under pretext of an opened window to be made secure after taking leave of his companion in the hall and watching her glimmer away up the staircase he had for himself another impulse than to go to bed picking up a hat in the hall slipping his arms into a sleeveless cape and lighting still another cigar he turned out upon the terrace through one of the long drawingroom windows and moved to and fro there for an hour beneath the sharp autumn stars it was where he had walked in the afternoon sun with fanny assingham and the sense of that other hour the sense of the suggestive woman herself was before him again as in spite of all the previous degustation we have hinted at it had not yet been he thought in a loose an almost agitated order of many things the power that was in them to agitate having been part of his conviction that he should not soon sleep he truly felt for a while that he should never sleep again till something had come to him some light some idea some mere happy word perhaps that he had begun to want but had been till now and especially the last day or two vainly groping for can you really then come if we start earlythat was practically all he had said to the girl as she took up her bedroom light and why in the world not when ive nothing else to do and should besides so immensely like itthis had as definitely been on her side the limit of the little scene there had in fact been nothing to call a scene even of the littlest at allthough he perhaps didnt quite know why something like the menace of one hadnt proceeded from her stopping halfway upstairs to turn and say as she looked down on him that she promised to content herself for their journey with a toothbrush and a sponge there hovered about him at all events while he walked appearances already familiar as well as two or three that were new and not the least vivid of the former connected itself with that sense of being treated with consideration which had become for him as we have noted one of the minor yet so far as there were any such quite one of the compensatory incidents of being a fatherinlaw it had struck him up to now that this particular balm was a mixture of which amerigo as through some hereditary privilege alone possessed the secret so that he found himself wondering if it had come to charlotte who had unmistakably acquired it through the young mans having amiably passed it on she made use for her so quietly grateful host however this might be of quite the same shades of attention and recognition was mistress in an equal degree of the regulated the developed art of placing him high in the scale of importance that was even for his own thought a clumsy way of expressing the element of similarity in the agreeable effect they each produced on him and it held him for a little only because this coincidence in their felicity caused him vaguely to connect or associate them in the matter of tradition training tact or whatever else one might call it it might almost have beenif such a link between them was to be imaginedthat amerigo had a little coached or incited their young friend or perhaps rather that she had simply as one of the signs of the general perfection fanny assingham commended in her profited by observing during her short opportunity before the start of the travellers the pleasant application by the prince of his personal system he might wonder what exactly it was that they so resembled each other in treating him likefrom what noble and propagated convention in cases in which the exquisite importance was to be neither too grossly attributed nor too grossly denied they had taken their specific lesson but the difficulty was here of course that one could really never knowcouldnt know without having been ones self a personage whether a pope a king a president a peer a general or just a beautiful author  before such a question as before several others when they recurred he would come to a pause leaning his arms on the old parapet and losing himself in a far excursion he had as to so many of the matters in hand a divided view and this was exactly what made him reach out in his unrest for some idea lurking in the vast freshness of the night at the breath of which disparities would submit to fusion and so spreading beneath him make him feel that he floated what he kept finding himself return to disturbingly enough was the reflection deeper than anything else that in forming a new and intimate tie he should in a manner abandon or at the best signally relegate his daughter he should reduce to definite form the idea that he had lost heras was indeed inevitableby her own marriage he should reduce to definite form the idea of his having incurred an injury or at the best an inconvenience that required some makeweight and deserved some amends and he should do this the more which was the great point that he should appear to adopt in doing it the sentiment in fact the very conviction entertained and quite sufficiently expressed by maggie herself in her beautiful generosity as to what he had sufferedputting it with extravaganceat her hands if she put it with extravagance the extravagance was yet sincere for it camewhich she put with extravagance toofrom her persistence always in thinking feeling talking about him as young he had had glimpses of moments when to hear her thus in her absolutely unforced compunction one would have supposed the special edge of the wrong she had done him to consist in his having still before him years and years to groan under it she had sacrificed a parent the pearl of parents no older than herself it wouldnt so much have mattered if he had been of common parental age that he wasnt that he was just her extraordinary equal and contemporary this was what added to her act the long train of its effect light broke for him at last indeed quite as a consequence of the fear of breathing a chill upon this luxuriance of her spiritual garden as at a turn of his labyrinth he saw his issue which opened out so wide for the minute that he held his breath with wonder he was afterwards to recall how just then the autumn night seemed to clear to a view in which the whole place everything round him the wide terrace where he stood the others with their steps below the gardens the park the lake the circling woods lay there as under some strange midnight sun it all met him during these instants as a vast expanse of discovery a world that looked so lighted extraordinarily new and in which familiar objects had taken on a distinctness that as if it had been a loud a spoken pretension to beauty interest importance to he scarce knew what gave them an inordinate quantity of character and verily an inordinate size this hallucination or whatever he might have called it was brief but it lasted long enough to leave him gasping the gasp of admiration had by this time however lost itself in an intensity that quickly followedthe way the wonder of it since wonder was in question truly had been the strange delay of his vision he had these several days groped and groped for an object that lay at his feet and as to which his blindness came from his stupidly looking beyond it had sat all the while at his hearth stone whence it now gazed up in his face  once he had recognised it there everything became coherent the sharp point to which all his light converged was that the whole call of his future to him as a father would be in his so managing that maggie would less and less appear to herself to have forsaken him and it not only wouldnt be decently humane decently possible not to make this relief easy to herthe idea shone upon him more than that as exciting inspiring uplifting it fell in so beautifully with what might be otherwise possible it stood there absolutely confronted with the material way in which it might be met the way in which it might be met was by his putting his child at peace and the way to put her at peace was to provide for his futurethat is for hersby marriage by a marriage as good speaking proportionately as hers had been as he fairly inhaled this measure of refreshment he tasted the meaning of recent agitations he had seen that charlotte could contributewhat he hadnt seen was what she could contribute to when it had all supremely cleared up and he had simply settled this service to his daughter well before him as the proper direction of his young friends leisure the cool darkness had again closed round him but his moral lucidity was constituted it wasnt only moreover that the word with a click so fitted the riddle but that the riddle in such perfection fitted the word he might have been equally in want and yet not have had his remedy oh if charlotte didnt accept him of course the remedy would fail but as everything had fallen together it was at least there to be tried and success would be greatthat was his last throbif the measure of relief effected for maggie should at all prove to have been given by his own actual sense of felicity he really didnt know when in his life he had thought of anything happier to think of it merely for himself would have been even as he had just lately felt even doing all justice to that conditionyes impossible but there was a grand difference in thinking of it for his child                                 xii  it was at brighton above all that this difference came out it was during the three wonderful days he spent there with charlotte that he had acquainted himself furtherthough doubtless not even now quite completelywith the merits of his majestic scheme and while moreover to begin with he still but held his vision in place steadying it fairly with his hands as he had often steadied for inspection a precarious old pot or kept a glazed picture in its right relation to the light the other the outer presumptions in his favour those independent of what he might himself contribute and that therefore till he should speak remained necessarily vaguethat quantity i say struck him as positively multiplying as putting on in the fresh brighton air and on the sunny brighton front a kind of tempting palpability he liked in this preliminary stage to feel that he should be able to speak and that he would the word itself being romantic pressing for him the spring of association with stories and plays where handsome and ardent young men in uniforms tights cloaks highboots had it in soliloquies ever on their lips and the sense on the first day that he should probably have taken the great step before the second was over conduced already to make him say to his companion that they must spend more than their mere night or two at his ease on the ground of what was before him he at all events definitely desired to be and it was strongly his impression that he was proceeding step by step he was actingit kept coming back to thatnot in the dark but in the high golden morning not in precipitation flurry fever dangers these of the path of passion properly so called but with the deliberation of a plan a plan that might be a thing of less joy than a passion but that probably would in compensation for that loss be found to have the essential property to wear even the decent dignity of reaching further and of providing for more contingencies the season was in local parlance on the elements were assembled the big windy hotel the draughty social hall swarmed with types in charlottes constant phrase and resounded with a din in which the wild music of gilded and befrogged bands croatian dalmatian carpathian violently exotic and nostalgic was distinguished as struggling against the perpetual popping of corks much of this would decidedly have disconcerted our friends if it hadnt all happened more preponderantly to give them the brighter surprise the noble privacy of fawns had left themhad left mr verver at least with a little accumulated sum of tolerance to spend on the high pitch and high colour of the public sphere fawns as it had been for him and as maggie and fanny assingham had both attested was out of the world whereas the scene actually about him with the very sea a mere big booming medium for excursions and aquariums affected him as so plump in the conscious centre that nothing could have been more complete for representing that pulse of life which they had come to unanimity at home on the subject of their advisedly not hereafter forgetting the pulse of life was what charlotte in her way at home had lately reproduced and there were positively current hours when it might have been open to her companion to feel himself again indebted to her for introductions he had brought her to put it crudely but it was almost as if she were herself in her greater gaiety her livelier curiosity and intensity her readier happier irony taking him about and showing him the place no one really when he came to think had ever taken him about beforeit had always been he of old who took others and who in particular took maggie this quickly fell into its relation with him as part of an experiencemarking for him no doubt what people call considerately a time of life a new and pleasant order a flattered passive state that might becomewhy shouldnt it one of the comforts of the future  mr gutermannseuss proved on the second dayour friend had waited till thena remarkably genial a positively lustrous young man occupying a small neat house in a quarter of the place remote from the front and living as immediate and striking signs testified in the bosom of his family our visitors found themselves introduced by the operation of close contiguity to a numerous group of ladies and gentlemen older and younger and of children larger and smaller who mostly affected them as scarce less anointed for hospitality and who produced at first the impression of a birthday party of some anniversary gregariously and religiously kept though they subsequently fell into their places as members of one quiet domestic circle preponderantly and directly indebted for their being in fact to mr gutermannseuss to the casual eye a mere smart and shining youth of less than thirty summers faultlessly appointed in every particular he yet stood among his progenyeleven in all as he confessed without a sigh eleven little brown clear faces yet with such impersonal old eyes astride of such impersonal old noseswhile he entertained the great american collector whom he had so long hoped he might meet and whose charming companion the handsome frank familiar young lady presumably mrs verver noticed the graduated offspring noticed the fat earringed aunts and the glossy cockneyfied familiar uncles inimitable of accent and assumption and of an attitude of cruder intention than that of the head of the firm noticed the place in short noticed the treasure produced noticed everything as from the habit of a person finding her account at any time according to a wisdom well learned of life in almost any funny impression it really came home to her friend on the spot that this free range of observation in her picking out the frequent funny with extraordinary promptness would verily henceforth make a different thing for him of such experiences of the customary hunt for the possible prize the inquisitive play of his accepted monomania which different thing could probably be a lighter and perhaps thereby a somewhat more boisterously refreshing form of sport such omens struck him as vivid in any case when mr gutermannseuss with a sharpness of discrimination he had at first scarce seemed to promise invited his eminent couple into another room before the threshold of which the rest of the tribe unanimously faltering dropped out of the scene the treasure itself here the objects on behalf of which mr ververs interest had been booked established quickly enough their claim to engage the latters attention yet at what point of his past did our friends memory looking back and back catch him in any such place thinking so much less of wares artfully paraded than of some other and quite irrelevant presence such places were not strange to him when they took the form of bourgeois back parlours a trifle ominously grey and grim from their north light at wateringplaces prevailingly homes of humbug or even when they wore some aspect still less if not perhaps still more insidious he had been everywhere pried and prowled everywhere going on occasion so far as to risk he believed life health and the very bloom of honour but where while precious things extracted one by one from thricelocked yet often vulgar drawers and soft satchels of old oriental ilk were impressively ranged before him had he till now let himself in consciousness wander like one of the vague  he didnt betray itah that he knew but two recognitions took place for him at once and one of them suffered a little in sweetness by the confusion mr gutermannseuss had truly for the crisis the putting down of his cards a rare manner he was perfect master of what not to say to such a personage as mr verver while the particular importance that dispenses with chatter was diffused by his movements themselves his repeated act of passage between a featureless mahogany meuble and a table so virtuously disinterested as to look fairly smug under a cotton cloth of faded maroon and indigo all redolent of patriarchal teas the damascene tiles successively and oh so tenderly unmuffled and revealed lay there at last in their full harmony and their venerable splendour but the tribute of appreciation and decision was while the spectator considered simplified to a point that but just failed of representing levity on the part of a man who had always acknowledged without shame in such affairs the intrinsic charm of what was called discussion the infinitely ancient the immemorial amethystine blue of the glaze scarcely more meant to be breathed upon it would seem than the cheek of royaltythis property of the ordered and matched array had inevitably all its determination for him but his submission was perhaps for the first time in his life of the quick mind alone the process really itself in its way as fine as the perfection perceived and admired every inch of the rest of him being given to the foreknowledge that an hour or two later he should have spoken the burning of his ships therefore waited too near to let him handle his opportunity with his usual firm and sentient fingerswaited somehow in the predominance of charlottes very person in her being there exactly as she was capable as mr gutermannseuss himself was capable of the right felicity of silence but with an embracing ease through it all that made deferred criticism as fragrant as some joy promised a lover by his mistress or as a big bridal bouquet held patiently behind her he couldnt otherwise have explained surely why he found himself thinking to his enjoyment of so many other matters than the felicity of his acquisition and the figure of his cheque quite equally high any more than why later on with their return to the room in which they had been received and the renewed encompassment of the tribe he felt quite merged in the elated circle formed by the girls free response to the collective caress of all the shining eyes and by her genial acceptance of the heavy cake and port wine that as she was afterwards to note added to their transaction for a finish the touch of some mystic rite of old jewry  this characterisation came from her as they walked awaywalked together in the waning afternoon back to the breezy sea and the bustling front back to the nimble and the flutter and the shining shops that sharpened the grin of solicitation on the mask of night they were walking thus as he felt nearer and nearer to where he should see his ships burn and it was meanwhile for him quite as if this red glow would impart at the harmonious hour a lurid grandeur to his good faith it was meanwhile too a sign of the kind of sensibility often playing up in him that fabulous as this truth may soundhe found a sentimental link an obligation of delicacy or perhaps even one of the penalties of its opposite in his having exposed her to the north light the quite properly hard businesslight of the room in which they had been alone with the treasure and its master she had listened to the name of the sum he was capable of looking in the face given the relation of intimacy with him she had already beyond all retractation accepted the stir of the air produced at the other place by that high figure struck him as a thing that from the moment she had exclaimed or protested as little as he himself had apologised left him but one thing more to do a man of decent feeling didnt thrust his money a huge lump of it in such a way under a poor girls nosea girl whose poverty was after a fashion the very basis of her enjoyment of his hospitality without seeing logically a responsibility attached and this was to remain none the less true for the fact that twenty minutes later after he had applied his torch applied it with a sign or two of insistence what might definitely result failed to be immediately clear he had spokenspoken as they sat together on the outoftheway bench observed during one of their walks and kept for the previous quarter of the present hour well in his memorys eye the particular spot to which between intense pauses and intenser advances he had all the while consistently led her below the great consolidated cliff well on to where the city of stucco sat most architecturally perched with the rumbling beach and the rising tide and the freshening stars in front and above the safe sense of the whole place yet prevailed in lamps and seats and flagged walks hovering also overhead in the close neighbourhood of a great replete community about to assist anew at the removal of dishcovers  weve had as it seems to me such quite beautiful days together that i hope it wont come to you too much as a shock when i ask if you think you could regard me with any satisfaction as a husband as if he had known she wouldnt she of course couldnt at all gracefully and whether or no reply with a rush he had said a little morequite as he had felt he must in thinking it out in advance he had put the question on which there was no going back and which represented thereby the sacrifice of his vessels and what he further said was to stand for the redoubled thrust of flame that would make combustion sure this isnt sudden to me and ive wondered at moments if you havent felt me coming to it ive been coming ever since we left fawnsi really started while we were there he spoke slowly giving her as he desired time to think all the more that it was making her look at him steadily and making her also in a remarkable degree look well while she did soa large and so far a happy consequence she wasnt at all events shockedwhich he had glanced at but for a handsome humilityand he would give her as many minutes as she liked you mustnt think im forgetting that im not young  oh that isnt so its i that am old you are young this was what she had at first answeredand quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes it had not been wholly to the point but it had been kindwhich was what he most wanted and she kept for her next words to kindness kept to her clear lowered voice and unshrinking face to me too it thoroughly seems that these days have been beautiful i shouldnt be grateful to them if i couldnt more or less have imagined their bringing us to this she affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still it only meant however doubtless that she was gravely and reasonably thinkingas he exactly desired to make her if she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him it seems to me she went on that its for you to be sure  ah but i am sure said adam verver on matters of importance i never speak when im not so if you can yourself face such a union you neednt in the least trouble  she had another pause and she might have been felt as facing it while through lamplight and dusk through the breath of the mild slightly damp southwest she met his eyes without evasion yet she had at the end of another minute debated only to the extent of saying i wont pretend i dont think it would be good for me to marry good for me i mean she pursued because im so awfully unattached i should like to be a little less adrift i should like to have a home i should like to have an existence i should like to have a motive for one thing more than anothera motive outside of myself in fact she said so sincerely that it almost showed pain yet so lucidly that it almost showed humour in fact you know i want to be married itswell its the condition  the condition he was just vague  its the state i mean i dont like my own miss among us all is too dreadfulexcept for a shopgirl i dont want to be a horrible english oldmaid  oh you want to be taken care of very well then ill do it  i dare say its very much that only i dont see why for what i speak of she smiledfor a mere escape from my statei need do quite so much  so much as marry me in particular  her smile was as for true directness i might get what i want for less  you think it so much for you to do  yes she presently said i think its a great deal  then it was that though she was so gentle so quite perfect with him and he felt he had come on farthen it was that of a sudden something seemed to fail and he didnt quite know where they were there rose for him with this the fact to be sure of their disparity deny it as mercifully and perversely as she would he might have been her father of course yesthats my disadvantage im not the natural im so far from being the ideal match to your youth and your beauty ive the drawback that youve seen me always so inevitably in such another light  but she gave a slow headshake that made contradiction softmade it almost sad in fact as from having to be so complete and he had already before she spoke the dim vision of some objection in her mind beside which the one he had named was light and which therefore must be strangely deep you dont understand me its of all that it is for you to doits of that im thinking  oh with this for him the thing was clearer then you neednt think i know enough what it is for me to do  but she shook her head again i doubt if you know i doubt if you can  and why not pleasewhen ive had you so before me that im old has at least that fact about it to the goodthat ive known you long and from far back  do you think youve known me asked charlotte stant he hesitatedfor the tone of it and her look with it might have made him doubt just these things in themselves however with all the rest with his fixed purpose now his committed deed the fine pink glow projected forward of his ships behind him definitely blazing and cracklingthis quantity was to push him harder than any word of her own could warn him all that she was herself moreover was so lighted to its advantage by the pink glow he wasnt rabid but he wasnt either as a man of a proper spirit to be frightened what is that thenif i accept itbut as strong a reason as i can want for just learning to know you  she faced him alwayskept it up as for honesty and yet at the same time in her odd way as for mercy how can you tell whether if you did you would  it was ambiguous for an instant as she showed she felt i mean when its a question of learning one learns sometimes too late  i think its a question he promptly enough made answer of liking you the more just for your saying these things you should make something he added of my liking you  i make everything but are you sure of having exhausted all other ways  this of a truth enlarged his gaze but what other ways  why youve more ways of being kind than anyone i ever knew  take it then he answered that im simply putting them all together for you she looked at him on this long againstill as if it shouldnt be said she hadnt given him time or had withdrawn from his view so to speak a single inch of her surface this at least she was fully to have exposed it represented her as oddly conscientious and he scarce knew in what sense it affected him on the whole however with admiration youre very very honourable  its just what i want to be i dont see she added why youre not right i dont see why youre not happy as you are i can not ask myself i can not ask you she went on if youre really as much at liberty as your universal generosity leads you to assume oughtnt we she asked to think a little of others oughtnt i at least in loyaltyat any rate in delicacyto think of maggie with which intensely gentle so as not to appear too much to teach him his duty she explained shes everything to youshe has always been are you so certain that theres room in your life  for another daughteris that what you mean she had not hung upon it long but he had quickly taken her up  he had not however disconcerted her for another young woman very much of her age and whose relation to her has always been so different from what our marrying would make it for another companion said charlotte stant  cant a man be all his life then he almost fiercely asked anything but a father but he went on before she could answer you talk about differences but theyve been already madeas no one knows better than maggie she feels the one she made herself by her own marriagemade i mean for me she constantly thinks of itit allows her no rest to put her at peace is therefore he explained what im trying with you to do i cant do it alone but i can do it with your help you can make her he said positively happy about me  about you she thoughtfully echoed but what can i make her about herself  oh if shes at ease about me the rest will take care of itself the case he declared is in your hands youll effectually put out of her mind that i feel she has abandoned me  interest certainly now was what he had kindled in her face but it was all the more honourable to her as he had just called it that she should want to see each of the steps of his conviction if youve been driven to the likes of me maynt it show that youve felt truly forsaken  well im willing to suggest that if i can show at the same time that i feel consoled  but have you she demanded really felt so he hesitated  consoled  forsaken  noi havent but if its her idea if it was her idea in short that was enough this enunciation of motive the next moment however sounded to him perhaps slightly thin so that he gave it another touch that is if its my idea i happen you see to like my idea  well its beautiful and wonderful but isnt it possibly charlotte asked not quite enough to marry me for  why so my dear child isnt a mans idea usually what he does marry for  charlotte considering looked as if this might perhaps be a large question or at all events something of an extension of one they were immediately concerned with doesnt that a good deal depend on the sort of thing it may be she suggested that about marriage ideas as he called them might differ with which however giving no more time to it she sounded another question dont you appear rather to put it to me that i may accept your offer for maggies sake somehowshe turned it overi dont so clearly see her quite so much finding reassurance or even quite so much needing it  do you then make nothing at all of her having been so ready to leave us  ah charlotte on the contrary made much she was ready to leave us because she had to be from the moment the prince wanted it she could only go with him  perfectlyso that if you see your way she will be able to go with him in future as much as she likes  charlotte appeared to examine for a minute in maggies interest this privilegethe result of which was a limited concession youve certainly worked it out  of course ive worked it outthats exactly what i have done she hadnt for a long time been so happy about anything as at your being there with me  i was to be with you said charlotte for her security  well adam verver rang out this is her security youve only if you cant see it to ask her  ask herthe girl echoed it in wonder certainlyin so many words telling her you dont believe me  still she debated do you mean write it to her  quite so immediately tomorrow  oh i dont think i can write it said charlotte stant when i write to herand she looked amused for so different a shade its about the principinos appetite and dr bradys visits  very good thenput it to her face to face well go straight to paris to meet them  charlotte at this rose with a movement that was like a small cry but her unspoken sense lost itself while she stood with her eyes on himhe keeping his seat as for the help it gave him a little to make his appeal go up presently however a new sense had come to her and she covered him kindly with the expression of it i do think you know you must rather like me  thank you said adam verver you will put it to her yourself then  she had another hesitation we go over you say to meet them  as soon as we can get back to fawns and wait there for them if necessary till they come  waitaat fawns  wait in paris that will be charming in itself  you take me to pleasant places she turned it over you propose to me beautiful things  it rests but with you to make them beautiful and pleasant youve made brighton  ahshe almost tenderly protested with what im doing now  youre promising me now what i want arent you promising me he pressed getting up arent you promising me to abide by what maggie says  oh she wanted to be sure she was do you mean shell ask it of me  it gave him indeed as by communication a sense of the propriety of being himself certain yet what was he but certain shell speak to you shell speak to you for me  this at last then seemed to satisfy her very good may we wait again to talk of it till she has done so he showed with his hands down in his pockets and his shoulders expressively up a certain disappointment soon enough none the less his gentleness was all back and his patience once more exemplary of course i give you time especially he smiled as its time that i shall be spending with you our keeping on together will help you perhaps to see to see i mean how i need you  i already see said charlotte how youve persuaded yourself you do but she had to repeat it that isnt unfortunately all  well then how youll make maggie right  right she echoed it as if the word went far and ooh she still critically murmured as they moved together away                                xiii  he had talked to her of their waiting in paris a week later but on the spot there this period of patience suffered no great strain he had written to his daughter not indeed from brighton but directly after their return to fawns where they spent only fortyeight hours before resuming their journey and maggies reply to his news was a telegram from rome delivered to him at noon of their fourth day and which he brought out to charlotte who was seated at that moment in the court of the hotel where they had agreed that he should join her for their proceeding together to the noontide meal his letter at fawnsa letter of several pages and intended lucidly unreservedly in fact all but triumphantly to informhad proved on his sitting down to it and a little to his surprise not quite so simple a document to frame as even his due consciousness of its weight of meaning had allowed him to assume this doubtless however only for reasons naturally latent in the very wealth of that consciousness which contributed to his message something of their own quality of impatience the main result of their talk for the time had been a difference in his relation to his young friend as well as a difference equally sensible in her relation to himself and this in spite of his not having again renewed his undertaking to speak to her so far even as to tell her of the communication despatched to rome delicacy a delicacy more beautiful still all the delicacy she should want reigned between themit being rudimentary in their actual order that she mustnt be further worried until maggie should have put her at her ease  it was just the delicacy however that in pariswhich suggestively was brighton at a hundredfold higher pitchmade between him and his companion the tension made the suspense made what he would have consented perhaps to call the provisional peculiarity of present conditions these elements acted in a manner of their own imposing and involving under one head many abstentions and precautions twenty anxieties and reminders things verily he would scarce have known how to express and yet creating for them at every step an acceptance of their reality he was hanging back with charlotte till another person should intervene for their assistance and yet they had by what had already occurred been carried on to something it was out of the power of other persons to make either less or greater common conventionsthat was what was oddhad to be on this basis more thought of those common conventions that previous to the passage by the brighton strand he had so enjoyed the sense of their overlooking the explanation would have been he supposed or would have figured it with less of unrestthat paris had in its way deeper voices and warnings so that if you went at all far there it laid bristling traps as they might have been viewed all smothered in flowers for your going further still there were strange appearances in the air and before you knew it you might be unmistakably matching them since he wished therefore to match no appearance but that of a gentleman playing with perfect fairness any game in life he might be called to he found himself on the receipt of maggies missive rejoicing with a certain inconsistency the announcement made her from home had in the act cost some biting of his pen to sundry parts of him his personal modesty his imagination of her prepared state for so quick a jump it didnt much matter whichand yet he was more eager than not for the drop of delay and for the quicker transitions promised by the arrival of the imminent pair there was after all a hint of offence to a man of his age in being taken as they said at the shops on approval maggie certainly would have been as far as charlotte herself from positively desiring this and charlotte on her side as far as maggie from holding him light as a real value she made him fidget thus poor girl but from generous rigour of conscience  these allowances of his spirit were all the same consistent with a great gladness at the sight of the term of his ordeal for it was the end of his seeming to agree that questions and doubts had a place the more he had inwardly turned the matter over the more it had struck him that they had in truth only an ugliness what he could have best borne as he now believed would have been charlottes simply saying to him that she didnt like him enough this he wouldnt have enjoyed but he would quite have understood it and been able ruefully to submit she did like him enoughnothing to contradict that had come out for him so that he was restless for her as well as for himself she looked at him hard a moment when he handed her his telegram and the look for what he fancied a dim shy fear in it gave him perhaps his best moment of conviction thatas a man so to speakhe properly pleased her he said nothingthe words sufficiently did it for him doing it again better still as charlotte who had left her chair at his approach murmured them out we start tonight to bring you all our love and joy and sympathy there they were the words and what did she want more she didnt however as she gave him back the little unfolded leaf say they were enough though he saw the next moment that her silence was probably not disconnected from her having just visibly turned pale her extraordinarily fine eyes as it was his present theory that he had always thought them shone at him the more darkly out of this change of colour and she had again with it her apparent way of subjecting herself for explicit honesty and through her willingness to face him to any view he might take all at his ease and even to wantonness of the condition he produced in her as soon as he perceived that emotion kept her soundless he knew himself deeply touched since it proved that little as she professed she had been beautifully hoping they stood there a minute while he took in from this sign that yes then certainly she liked him enoughliked him enough to make him old as he was ready to brand himself flush for the pleasure of it the pleasure of it accordingly made him speak first do you begin a little to be satisfied  still however she had to think weve hurried them you see why so breathless a start  because they want to congratulate us they want said adam verver to see our happiness  she wondered againand this time also for him as publicly as possible so much as that  do you think its too much  she continued to think plainly they werent to have started for another week  well what then isnt our situation worth the little sacrifice well go back to rome as soon as you like with them  this seemed to hold heras he had previously seen her held just a trifle inscrutably by his allusions to what they would do together on a certain contingency worth it the little sacrifice for whom for us naturallyyes she said we want to see themfor our reasons that is she rather dimly smiled you do  and you do my dear too he bravely declared yes theni do too she after an instant ungrudging enough acknowledged for us however something depends on it  rather but does nothing depend on it for them  what canfrom the moment that as appears they dont want to nip us in the bud i can imagine their rushing up to prevent us but an enthusiasm for us that can wait so very littlesuch intense eagerness i confess she went on more than a little puzzles me you may think me she also added ungracious and suspicious but the prince cant at all want to come back so soon he wanted quite too intensely to get away  mr verver considered well hasnt he been away  yes just long enough to see how he likes it besides said charlotte he may not be able to join in the rosy view of our case that you impute to her it cant in the least have appeared to him hitherto a matter of course that you should give his wife a bouncing stepmother  adam verver at this looked grave im afraid then hell just have to accept from us whatever his wife accepts and accept it if he can imagine no better reasonjust because she does that he declared will have to do for him  his tone made her for a moment meet his face after which let me she abruptly said see it againtaking from him the folded leaf that she had given back and he had kept in his hand isnt the whole thing she asked when she had read it over perhaps but a way like another for their gaining time  he again stood staring but the next minute with that upward spring of his shoulders and that downward pressure of his pockets which she had already more than once at disconcerted moments determined in him he turned sharply away and wandered from her in silence he looked about in his small despair he crossed the hotel court which overarched and glazed muffled against loud sounds and guarded against crude sights heated gilded draped almost carpeted with exotic trees in tubs exotic ladies in chairs the general exotic accent and presence suspended as with wings folded or feebly fluttering in the superior the supreme the inexorably enveloping parisian medium resembled some critical apartment of large capacity some dental medical surgical waitingroom a scene of mixed anxiety and desire preparatory for gathered barbarians to the due amputation or extraction of excrescences and redundancies of barbarism he went as far as the portecochere took counsel afresh of his usual optimism sharpened even somehow just here by the very air he tasted and then came back smiling to charlotte it is incredible to you that when a man is still as much in love as amerigo his most natural impulse should be to feel what his wife feels to believe what she believes to want what she wantsin the absence that is of special impediments to his so doing the manner of it operatedshe acknowledged with no great delay this natural possibility nonothing is incredible to me of people immensely in love  well isnt amerigo immensely in love  she hesitated but as for the right expression of her sense of the degreebut she after all adopted mr ververs immensely  then there you are  she had another smile howevershe wasnt there quite yet that isnt all thats wanted  but what more  why that his wife shall have made him really believe that she really believes with which charlotte became still more lucidly logical the reality of his belief will depend in such a case on the reality of hers the prince may for instance now she went on have made out to his satisfaction that maggie may mainly desire to abound in your sense whatever it is you do he may remember that he has never seen her do anything else  well said adam verver what kind of a warning will he have found in that to what catastrophe will he have observed such a disposition in her to lead  just to this one with which she struck him as rising straighter and clearer before him than she had done even yet  our little question itself her appearance had in fact at the moment such an effect on him that he could answer but in marvelling mildness hadnt we better wait a while till we call it a catastrophe  her rejoinder to this was to waitthough by no means as long as he meant when at the end of her minute she spoke however it was mildly too what would you like dear friend to wait for it lingered between them in the air this demand and they exchanged for the time a look which might have made each of them seem to have been watching in the other the signs of its overt irony these were indeed immediately so visible in mr ververs face that as if a little ashamed of having so markedly produced themand as if also to bring out at last under pressure something she had all the while been keeping backshe took a jump to pure plain reason you havent noticed for yourself but i cant quite help noticing that in spite of what you assumewe assume if you likemaggie wires her joy only to you she makes no sign of its overflow to me  it was a pointand staring a moment he took account of it but he had as before his presence of mindto say nothing of his kindly humour why you complain of the very thing thats most charmingly conclusive she treats us already as one  clearly now for the girl in spite of lucidity and logic there was something in the way he said things she faced him in all her desire to please him and then her word quite simply and definitely showed it i do like you you know  well what could this do but stimulate his humour i see whats the matter with you you wont be quiet till youve heard from the prince himself i think the happy man added that ill go and secretly wire to him that youd like reply paid a few words for yourself  it could apparently but encourage her further to smile reply paid for him you meanor for me  oh ill pay with pleasure anything back for youas many words as you like and he went on to keep it up not requiring either to see your message  she could take it visibly as he meant it should you require to see the princes  not a bit you can keep that also to yourself  on his speaking however as if his transmitting the hint were a real question she appeared to considerand almost as if for good tastethat the joke had gone far enough it doesnt matter unless he speaks of his own movement and why should it be she asked a thing that would occur to him  i really think mr verver concurred that it naturally wouldnt he doesnt know youre morbid  she just wonderedbut she agreed nohe hasnt yet found it out perhaps he will but he hasnt yet and im willing to give him meanwhile the benefit of the doubt so with this the situation to her view would appear to have cleared had she not too quickly had one of her restless relapses maggie however does know im morbid she hasnt the benefit  well said adam verver a little wearily at last i think i feel that youll hear from her yet it had even fairly come over him under recurrent suggestion that his daughters omission was surprising and maggie had never in her life been wrong for more than three minutes  oh it isnt that i hold that ive a right to it charlotte the next instant rather oddly qualifiedand the observation itself gave him a further push  very welli shall like it myself  at this then as if moved by his way of constantlyand more or less against his own contentioncoming round to her she showed how she could also always and not less gently come half way i speak of it only as the missing gracethe grace thats in everything that maggie does it isnt my dueshe kept it up but taking from you that we may still expect it it will have the touch it will be beautiful  then come out to breakfast  mr verver had looked at his watch it will be here when we get back  if it isntand charlotte smiled as she looked about for a feather boa that she had laid down on descending from her room if it isnt it will have had but that slight fault  he saw her boa on the arm of the chair from which she had moved to meet him and after he had fetched it raising it to make its charming softness brush his facefor it was a wondrous product of paris purchased under his direct auspices the day beforehe held it there a minute before giving it up will you promise me then to be at peace  she looked while she debated at his admirable present i promise you  quite for ever  quite for ever  remember he went on to justify his demand remember that in wiring you shell naturally speak even more for her husband than she has done in wiring me  it was only at a word that charlotte had a demur naturally  why our marriage puts him for you you seeor puts you for himinto a new relation whereas it leaves his relation to me unchanged it therefore gives him more to say to you about it  about its making me his stepmotherinlawor whatever i should become over which for a little she not undivertedly mused yes there may easily be enough for a gentleman to say to a young woman about that  well amerigo can always be according to the case either as funny or as serious as you like and whichever he may be for you in sending you a message hell be it all and then as the girl with one of her so deeply and oddly yet so tenderly critical looks at him failed to take up the remark he found himself moved as by a vague anxiety to add a question dont you think hes charming  oh charming said charlotte stant if he werent i shouldnt mind  no more should i her friend harmoniously returned  ah but you dont mind you dont have to you dont have to i mean as i have its the last folly ever to care in an anxious way the least particle more than one is absolutely forced if i were you she went onif i had in my life for happiness and power and peace even a small fraction of what you have it would take a great deal to make me waste my worry i dont know she said what in the worldthat didnt touch my lucki should trouble my head about  i quite understand youyet doesnt it just depend mr verver asked on what you call ones luck its exactly my luck that im talking about i shall be as sublime as you like when youve made me all right its only when one is right that one really has the things you speak of it isnt they he explained that make one so its the something else i want that makes them right if youll give me what i ask youll see  she had taken her boa and thrown it over her shoulders and her eyes while she still delayed had turned from him engaged by another interest though the court was by this time the hour of dispersal for luncheon so forsaken that they would have had it for free talk should they have been moved to loudness quite to themselves she was ready for their adjournment but she was also aware of a pedestrian youth in uniform a visible emissary of the postes et telegraphes who had approached from the street the small stronghold of the concierge and who presented there a missive taken from the little cartridgebox slung over his shoulder the portress meeting him on the threshold met equally across the court charlottes marked attention to his visit so that within the minute she had advanced to our friends with her capstreamers flying and her smile of announcement as ample as her broad white apron she raised aloft a telegraphic message and as she delivered it sociably discriminated cette foisci pour madamewith which she as genially retreated leaving charlotte in possession charlotte taking it held it at first unopened her eyes had come back to her companion who had immediately and triumphantly greeted it ah there you are  she broke the envelope then in silence and for a minute as with the message he himself had put before her studied its contents without a sign he watched her without a question and at last she looked up ill give you she simply said what you ask  the expression of her face was strangebut since when had a womans at moments of supreme surrender not a right to be he took it in with his own long look and his grateful silenceso that nothing more for some instants passed between them their understanding sealed itselfhe already felt that she had made him right but he was in presence too of the fact that maggie had made her so and always therefore without maggie where in fine would he be she united them brought them together as with the click of a silver spring and on the spot with the vision of it his eyes filled charlotte facing him meanwhile with her expression made still stranger by the blur of his gratitude through it all however he smiled what my child does for me  through it all as well that is still through the blur he saw charlotte rather than heard her reply she held her paper wide open but her eyes were all for his it isnt maggie its the prince  i sayhe gaily rang out then its best of all  its enough  thank you for thinking so to which he added its enough for our question but it isntis it quite enough for our breakfast dejeunons  she stood there however in spite of this appeal her document always before them dont you want to read it  he thought not if it satisfies you i dont require it  but she gave him as for her conscience another chance you can if you like  he hesitated afresh but as for amiability not for curiosity is it funny  thus finally she again dropped her eyes on it drawing in her lips a little noi call it grave  ah then i dont want it  very grave said charlotte stant  well what did i tell you of him he asked rejoicing as they started a question for all answer to which before she took his arm the girl thrust her paper crumpled into the pocket of her coat    part third                              xiv  charlotte half way up the monumental staircase had begun by waiting alonewaiting to be rejoined by her companion who had gone down all the way as in common kindness bound and who his duty performed would know where to find her she was meanwhile though extremely apparent not perhaps absolutely advertised but she would not have cared if she had beenso little was it by this time her first occasion of facing society with a consciousness materially with a confidence quite splendidly enriched for a couple of years now she had known as never before what it was to look wellto look that is as well as she had always felt from far back that in certain conditions she might on such an evening as this that of a great official party in the full flush of the london springtime the conditions affected her her nerves her senses her imagination as all profusely present so that perhaps at no moment yet had she been so justified of her faith as at the particular instant of our being again concerned with her that of her chancing to glance higher up from where she stood and meeting in consequence the quiet eyes of colonel assingham who had his elbows on the broad balustrade of the great gallery overhanging the staircase and who immediately exchanged with her one of his most artlessly familiar signals this simplicity of his visual attention struck her even with the other things she had to think about as the quietest note in the whole high pitchmuch in fact as if she had pressed a finger on a chord or a key and created for the number of seconds an arrest of vibration a more muffled thump the sight of him suggested indeed that fanny would be there though so far as opportunity went she had not seen her this was about the limit of what it could suggest  the air however had suggestions enoughit abounded in them many of them precisely helping to constitute those conditions with which for our young woman the hour was brilliantly crowned she was herself in truth crowned and it all hung together melted together in light and colour and sound the unsurpassed diamonds that her head so happily carried the other jewels the other perfections of aspect and arrangement that made her personal scheme a success the proved private theory that materials to work with had been all she required and that there were none too precious for her to understand and useto which might be added lastly as the strongscented flower of the total sweetness an easy command a high enjoyment of her crisis for a crisis she was ready to take it and this ease it was doubtless that helped her while she waited to the right assurance to the right indifference to the right expression and above all as she felt to the right view of her opportunity for happinessunless indeed the opportunity itself rather were in its mere strange amplitude the producing the precipitating cause the ordered revellers rustling and shining with sweep of train and glitter of star and clink of sword and yet for all this but so imperfectly articulate so vaguely vocalthe double stream of the coming and the going flowing together where she stood passed her brushed her treated her to much crude contemplation and now and then to a spasm of speech an offered hand even in some cases to an unencouraged pause but she missed no countenance and invited no protection she fairly liked to be so long as she might just as she wasexposed a little to the public no doubt in her unaccompanied state but even if it were a bit brazen careless of queer reflections on the dull polish of london faces and exposed since it was a question of exposure to much more competent recognitions of her own she hoped no one would stopshe was positively keeping herself it was her idea to mark in a particular manner the importance of something that had just happened she knew how she should mark it and what she was doing there made already a beginning  when presently therefore from her standpoint she saw the prince come back she had an impression of all the place as higher and wider and more appointed for great moments with its dome of lustres lifted its ascents and descents more majestic its marble tiers more vividly overhung its numerosity of royalties foreign and domestic more unprecedented its symbolism of state hospitality both emphasised and refined this was doubtless a large consequence of a fairly familiar cause a considerable inward stir to spring from the mere vision striking as that might be of amerigo in a crowd but she had her reasons she held them there she carried them in fact responsibly and overtly as she carried her head her high tiara her folded fan her indifferent unattended eminence and it was when he reached her and she could taking his arm show herself as placed in her relation that she felt supremely justified it was her notion of course that she gave a glimpse of but few of her grounds for this discriminationindeed of the most evident alone yet she would have been half willing it should be guessed how she drew inspiration drew support in quantity sufficient for almost anything from the individual value that through all the picture her husbands soninlaw kept for the eye deriving it from his fine unconscious way in the swarming social sum of outshining overlooking and overtopping it was as if in separation even the shortest she half forgot or disbelieved how he affected her sight so that reappearance had in him each time a virtue of its owna kind of disproportionate intensity suggesting his connection with occult sources of renewal what did he do when he was away from her that made him always come back only looking as she would have called it more so superior to any shade of cabotinage he yet almost resembled an actor who between his moments on the stage revisits his dressingroom and before the glass pressed by his need of effect retouches his makeup the prince was at present for instance though he had quitted her but ten minutes before still more than then the person it pleased her to be left witha truth that had all its force for her while he made her his care for their conspicuous return together to the upper rooms conspicuous beyond any wish they could entertain was what poor wonderful man he couldnt help making it and when she raised her eyes again on the ascent to bob assingham still aloft in his gallery and still looking down at her she was aware that in spite of hovering and warning inward voices she even enjoyed the testimony rendered by his lonely vigil to the lustre she reflected  he was always lonely at great parties the dear colonelit wasnt in such places that the seed he sowed at home was ever reaped by him but nobody could have seemed to mind it less to brave it with more bronzed indifference so markedly that he moved about less like one of the guests than like some quite presentable person in charge of the police arrangements or the electric light to mrs verver as will be seen he represented with the perfect good faith of his apparent blankness something definite enough though her bravery was not thereby too blighted for her to feel herself calling him to witness that the only witchcraft her companion had used within the few minutes was that of attending maggie who had withdrawn from the scene to her carriage notified at all events of fannys probable presence charlotte was for a while after this divided between the sense of it as a fact somehow to reckon with and deal with which was a perception that made in its degree for the prudence the pusillanimity of postponement of avoidanceand a quite other feeling an impatience that presently ended by prevailing an eagerness really to be suspected sounded veritably arraigned if only that she might have the bad moment over if only that she might prove to herself let alone to mrs assingham also that she could convert it to good if only in short to be square as they said with her question for herself indeed particularly it wasnt a question but something in her bones told her that fanny would treat it as one and there was truly nothing that from this friend she was not bound in decency to take she might hand things back with every tender precaution with acknowledgments and assurances but she owed it to them in any case and it to all mrs assingham had done for her not to get rid of them without having well unwrapped and turned them over  tonight as happenedand she recognised it more and more with the ebbing minutes as an influence of everything about her tonight exactly she would no doubt since she knew why be as firm as she might at any near moment again hope to be for going through that process with the right temper and tone she said after a little to the prince stay with me let no one take you for i want her yes i do want her to see us together and the sooner the bettersaid it to keep her hand on him through constant diversions and made him in fact by saying it profess a momentary vagueness she had to explain to him that it was fanny assingham she wanted to seewho clearly would be there since the colonel never either stirred without her or once arrived concerned himself for her fate and she had further after amerigo had met her with see us together why in the world hasnt she often seen us together to inform him that what had elsewhere and otherwise happened didnt now matter and that she at any rate well knew for the occasion what she was about youre strange cara mia he consentingly enough dropped but for whatever strangeness he kept her as they circulated from being waylaid even remarking to her afresh as he had often done before on the help rendered in such situations by the intrinsic oddity of the london squash a thing of vague slow senseless eddies revolving as in fear of some menace of conversation suspended over it the drop of which with some consequent refreshing splash or spatter yet never took place of course she was strange this as they went charlotte knew for herself how could she be anything else when the situation holding her and holding him for that matter just as much had so the stamp of it she had already accepted her consciousness as we have already noted that a crisis for them all was in the air and when such hours were not depressing which was the form indeed in which she had mainly known them they were apparently in a high degree exhilarating  later on in a corner to which at sight of an empty sofa mrs assingham had after a single attentive arrest led her with a certain earnestness this vision of the critical was much more sharpened than blurred fanny had taken it from her yes she was there with amerigo alone maggie having come with them and then within ten minutes changed her mind repented and departed so youre staying on together without her the elder woman had asked and it was charlottes answer to this that had determined for them quite indeed according to the latters expectation the need of some seclusion and her companions pounce at the sofa they were staying on together alone andoh distinctlyit was alone that maggie had driven away her father as usual not having managed to come as usual mrs assingham had seemed to wonder mr ververs reluctances not having she in fact quite intimated hitherto struck her charlotte responded at any rate that his indisposition to go out had lately much increasedeven though tonight as she admitted he had pleaded his not feeling well maggie had wished to stay with himfor the prince and she dining out had afterwards called in portland place whence in the event they had brought her charlotte on maggie had come but to oblige her fathershe had urged the two others to go without her then she had yielded for the time to mr ververs persuasion but here when they had after the long wait in the carriage fairly got in here once up the stairs with the rooms before them remorse had ended by seizing her she had listened to no other remonstrance and at present therefore as charlotte put it the two were doubtless making together a little party at home but it was all rightso charlotte also put it there was nothing in the world they liked better than these snatched felicities little parties long talks with ill come to you tomorrow and no ill come to you makebelieve renewals of their old life they were fairly at times the dear things like children playing at paying visits playing at mr thompson and mrs fane each hoping that the other would really stay to tea charlotte was sure she should find maggie there on getting home a remark in which mrs ververs immediate response to her friends inquiry had culminated she had thus on the spot the sense of having given her plenty to think about and that moreover of liking to see it even better than she had expected she had plenty to think about herself and there was already something in fanny that made it seem still more  you say your husbands ill he felt too ill to come  no my deari think not if he had been too ill i wouldnt have left him  and yet maggie was worried mrs assingham asked  she worries you know easily shes afraid of influenzaof which he has had at different times though never with the least gravity several attacks  but youre not afraid of it  charlotte had for a moment a pause it had continued to come to her that really to have her case out as they said with the person in the world to whom her most intimate difficulties had oftenest referred themselves would help her on the whole more than hinder and under that feeling all her opportunity with nothing kept back with a thing or two perhaps even thrust forward seemed temptingly to open besides didnt fanny at bottom half expect absolutely at the bottom half want things so that she would be disappointed if after what must just have occurred for her she didnt get something to put between the teeth of her so restless rumination that cultivation of the fear of which our young woman had already had glimpses that she might have gone too far in her irrepressible interest in other lives what had just happenedit pieced itself together for charlottewas that the assingham pair drifting like everyone else had had somewhere in the gallery in the rooms an accidental concussion had it after the colonel over his balustrade had observed in the favouring high light her public junction with the prince his very dryness in this encounter had as always struck a spark from his wifes curiosity and familiar on his side with all that she saw in things he had thrown her as a fine little bone to pick some report of the way one of her young friends was going on with another he knew perfectlysuch at least was charlottes liberal assumptionthat she wasnt going on with anyone but she also knew that given the circumstances she was inevitably to be sacrificed in some form or another to the humorous intercourse of the inimitable couple the prince meanwhile had also under coercion sacrificed her the ambassador had come up to him with a message from royalty to whom he was led away after which she had talked for five minutes with sir john brinder who had been of the ambassadors company and who had rather artlessly remained with her fanny had then arrived in sight of them at the same moment as someone else she didnt know someone who knew mrs assingham and also knew sir john charlotte had left it to her friends competence to throw the two others immediately together and to find a way for entertaining her in closer quarters this was the little history of the vision in her that was now rapidly helping her to recognise a precious chance the chance that mightnt again soon be so good for the vivid making of a point her point was before her it was sharp bright true above all it was her own she had reached it quite by herself no one not even amerigoamerigo least of all who would have nothing to do with ithad given her aid to make it now with force for fanny assinghams benefit would see her further in the direction in which the light had dawned than any other spring she should yet awhile doubtless be able to press the direction was that of her greater freedomwhich was all in the world she had in mind her opportunity had accordingly after a few minutes of mrs assinghams almost imprudently interested expression of face positively acquired such a price for her that she may for ourselves while the intensity lasted rather resemble a person holding out a small mirror at arms length and consulting it with a special turn of the head it was in a word with this value of her chance that she was intelligently playing when she said in answer to fannys last question dont you remember what you told me on the occasion of something or other the other day that you believe theres nothing im afraid of so my dear dont ask me  maynt i ask you mrs assingham returned how the case stands with your poor husband  certainly dear only when you ask me as if i mightnt perhaps know what to think it seems to me best to let you see that i know perfectly what to think  mrs assingham hesitated then blinking a little she took her risk you didnt think that if it was a question of anyones returning to him in his trouble it would be better you yourself should have gone  well charlottes answer to this inquiry visibly shaped itself in the interest of the highest considerations the highest considerations were good humour candour clearness and obviously the real truth if we couldnt be perfectly frank and dear with each other it would be ever so much better wouldnt it that we shouldnt talk about anything at all which however would be dreadfuland we certainly at any rate havent yet come to it you can ask me anything under the sun you like because dont you see you cant upset me  im sure my dear charlotte fanny assingham laughed i dont want to upset you  indeed love you simply couldnt even if you thought it necessarythats all i mean nobody could for it belongs to my situation that im by no merit of my own just fixedfixed as fast as a pin stuck up to its head in a cushion im placedi cant imagine anyone more placed there i am  fanny had indeed never listened to emphasis more firmly applied and it brought into her own eyes though she had reasons for striving to keep them from betrayals a sort of anxiety of intelligence i dare saybut your statement of your position however you see it isnt an answer to my inquiry it seems to me at the same time i confess mrs assingham added to give but the more reason for it you speak of our being frank how can we possibly be anything else if maggie has gone off through finding herself too distressed to stay and if shes willing to leave you and her husband to show here without her arent the grounds of her preoccupation more or less discussable  if theyre not charlotte replied its only from their being in a way too evident theyre not grounds for methey werent when i accepted adams preference that i should come tonight without him just as i accept absolutely as a fixed rule all his preferences but that doesnt alter the fact of course that my husbands daughter rather than his wife should have felt she could after all be the one to stay with him the one to make the sacrifice of this hourseeing especially that the daughter has a husband of her own in the field with which she produced as it were her explanation ive simply to see the truth of the mattersee that maggie thinks more on the whole of fathers than of husbands and my situation is such she went on that this becomes immediately dont you understand a thing i have to count with  mrs assingham vaguely heaving panting a little but trying not to show it turned about from some inward spring in her seat if you mean such a thing as that she doesnt adore the prince  i dont say she doesnt adore him what i say is that she doesnt think of him one of those conditions doesnt always at all stages involve the other this is just how she adores him charlotte said and what reason is there in the world after all why he and i shouldnt as you say show together weve shown together my dear she smiled before  her friend for a little only looked at herspeaking then with abruptness you ought to be absolutely happy you live with such good people  the effect of it as well was an arrest for charlotte whose face however all of whose fine and slightly hard radiance it had caused the next instant further to brighten does one ever put into words anything so fatuously rash its a thing that must be said in prudence for oneby somebody whos so good as to take the responsibility the more that it gives one always a chance to show ones best manners by not contradicting it certainly youll never have the distress or whatever of hearing me complain  truly my dear i hope in all conscience not and the elder womans spirit found relief in a laugh more resonant than was quite advised by their pursuit of privacy  to this demonstration her friend gave no heed with all our absence after marriage and with the separation from her produced in particular by our so many months in america maggie has still arrears still losses to make upstill the need of showing how for so long she simply kept missing him she missed his companya large allowance of which is in spite of everything else of the first necessity to her so she puts it in when she cana little here a little there and it ends by making up a considerable amount the fact of our distinct establishments which has all the same everything in its favour charlotte hastened to declare makes her really see more of him than when they had the same house to make sure she doesnt fail of it shes always arranging for itwhich she didnt have to do while they lived together but she likes to arrange charlotte steadily proceeded it peculiarly suits her and the result of our separate households is really for them more contact and more intimacy tonight for instance has been practically an arrangement she likes him best alone and its the way said our young woman in which he best likes her its what i mean therefore by being placed and the great thing is as they say to know ones place doesnt it all strike you she wound up as rather placing the prince too  fanny assingham had at this moment the sense as of a large heaped dish presented to her intelligence and inviting it to a feastso thick were the notes of intention in this remarkable speech but she also felt that to plunge at random to help herself too freely wouldapart from there not being at such a moment time for ittend to jostle the ministering hand confound the array and more vulgarly speaking make a mess so she picked out after consideration a solitary plum so placed that you have to arrange  certainly i have to arrange  and the prince alsoif the effect for him is the same  really i think not less  and does he arrange mrs assingham asked to make up his arrears the question had risen to her lipsit was as if another morsel on the dish had tempted her the sound of it struck her own ear immediately as giving out more of her thought than she had as yet intended but she quickly saw that she must follow it up at any risk with simplicity and that what was simplest was the ease of boldness make them up i mean by coming to see you  charlotte replied however without as her friend would have phrased it turning a hair she shook her head but it was beautifully gentle he never comes  oh said fanny assingham with which she felt a little stupid there it is he might so well you know otherwise  otherwiseand fanny was still vague  it passed this time over her companion whose eyes wandering to a distance found themselves held the prince was at hand again the ambassador was still at his side they were stopped a moment by a uniformed personage a little old man of apparently the highest military character bristling with medals and orders this gave charlotte time to go on he has not been for three months and then as with her friends last word in her ear otherwiseyes he arranges otherwise and in my position she added i might too its too absurd we shouldnt meet  youve met i gather said fanny assingham tonight  yesas far as that goes but what i mean is that i might placed for it as we both arego to see him  and do you fanny asked with almost mistaken solemnity  the perception of this excess made charlotte whether for gravity or for irony hang fire a minute i have been but thats nothing she said in itself and i tell you of it only to show you how our situation works it essentially becomes one a situation for both of us the princes however is his own affairi meant but to speak of mine  your situations perfect mrs assingham presently declared  i dont say it isnt taken in fact all round i think it is and i dont as i tell you complain of it the only thing is that i have to act as it demands of me  to act said mrs assingham with an irrepressible quaver  isnt it acting my dear to accept it i do accept it what do you want me to do less  i want you to believe that youre a very fortunate person  do you call that less charlotte asked with a smile from the point of view of my freedom i call it more let it take my position any name you like  dont let it at any rateand mrs assinghams impatience prevailed at last over her presence of minddont let it make you think too much of your freedom  i dont know what you call too muchfor how can i not see it as it is youd see your own quickly enough if the colonel gave you the same libertyand i havent to tell you with your so much greater knowledge of everything what it is that gives such liberty most for yourself personally of course charlotte went on you only know the state of neither needing it nor missing it your husband doesnt treat you as of less importance to him than some other woman  ah dont talk to me of other women fanny now overtly panted do you call mr ververs perfectly natural interest in his daughter  the greatest affection of which he is capable charlotte took it up in all readiness i do distinctlyand in spite of my having done all i could think ofto make him capable of a greater ive done earnestly everything i couldive made it month after month my study but i havent succeededit has been vividly brought home to me tonight however she pursued ive hoped against hope for i recognise that as i told you at the time i was duly warned and then as she met in her friends face the absence of any such remembrance he did tell me that he wanted me just because i could be useful about her with which charlotte broke into a wonderful smile so you see i am  it was on fanny assinghams lips for the moment to reply that this was on the contrary exactly what she didnt see she came in fact within an ace of saying you strike me as having quite failed to help his idea to worksince by your account maggie has him not less but so much more on her mind how in the world with so much of a remedy comes there to remain so much of what was to be obviated but she saved herself in time conscious above all that she was in presence of still deeper things than she had yet dared to fear that there was more in it than any admission she had made representedand she had held herself familiar with admissions so that not to seem to understand where she couldnt accept and not to seem to accept where she couldnt approve and could still less with precipitation advise she invoked the mere appearance of casting no weight whatever into the scales of her young friends consistency the only thing was that as she was quickly enough to feel she invoked it rather to excess it brought her her invocation too abruptly to her feet she brushed away everything i cant conceive my dear what youre talking about  charlotte promptly rose then as might be to meet it and her colour for the first time perceptibly heightened she looked for the minute as her companion had lookedas if twenty protests blocking each others way had surged up within her but when charlotte had to make a selection her selection was always the most effective possible it was happy now above all for being made not in anger but in sorrow you give me up then  give you up  you forsake me at the hour of my life when it seems to me i most deserve a friends loyalty if you do youre not just fanny youre even i think she went on rather cruel and its least of all worthy of you to seem to wish to quarrel with me in order to cover your desertion she spoke at the same time with the noblest moderation of tone and the image of high pale lighted disappointment she meanwhile presented as of a creature patient and lonely in her splendour was an impression so firmly imposed that she could fill her measure to the brim and yet enjoy the last word as it is called in such cases with a perfection void of any vulgarity of triumph she merely completed for truths sake her demonstration what is a quarrel with me but a quarrel with my right to recognise the conditions of my bargain but i can carry them out alone she said as she turned away she turned to meet the ambassador and the prince who their colloquy with their fieldmarshal ended were now at hand and had already between them she was aware addressed her a remark that failed to penetrate the golden glow in which her intelligence was temporarily bathed she had made her point the point she had foreseen she must make she had made it thoroughly and once for all so that no more making was required and her success was reflected in the faces of the two men of distinction before her unmistakably moved to admiration by her exceptional radiance she at first but watched this reflection taking no note of any less adequate form of it possibly presented by poor fannypoor fanny left to stare at her incurred score chalked up in so few strokes on the wall then she took in what the ambassador was saying in french what he was apparently repeating to her  a desire for your presence madame has been expressed en treshaut lieu and ive let myself in for the responsibility to say nothing of the honour of seeing as the most respectful of your friends that so august an impatience is not kept waiting the greatest possible personage had in short according to the odd formula of societies subject to the greatest personages possible sent for her and she asked in her surprise what in the world does he want to do to me only to know without looking that fannys bewilderment was called to a still larger application and to hear the prince say with authority indeed with a certain prompt dryness you must go immediatelyits a summons the ambassador using authority as well had already somehow possessed himself of her hand which he drew into his arm and she was further conscious as she went off with him that though still speaking for her benefit amerigo had turned to fanny assingham he would explain afterwardsbesides which she would understand for herself to fanny however he had laughed as a mark apparently that for this infallible friend no explanation at all would be necessary                                   xv  it may be recorded none the less that the prince was the next moment to see how little any such assumption was founded alone with him now mrs assingham was incorruptible they send for charlotte through you  no my dear as you see through the ambassador  ah but the ambassador and you for the last quarterofanhour have been for them as one hes your ambassador it may indeed be further mentioned that the more fanny looked at it the more she saw in it theyve connected her with youshes treated as your appendage  oh my appendage the prince amusedly exclaimedcara mia what a name shes treated rather say as my ornament and my glory and its so remarkable a case for a motherinlaw that you surely cant find fault with it  youve ornaments enough it seems to meas youve certainly glories enoughwithout her and shes not the least little bit mrs assingham observed your motherinlaw in such a matter a shade of difference is enormous shes no relation to you whatever and if shes known in high quarters but as going about with you thenthen she failed however as from positive intensity of vision then then what he asked with perfect goodnature  she had better in such a case not be known at all  but i assure you i never just now so much as mentioned her do you suppose i asked them said the young man still amused if they didnt want to see her you surely dont need to be shown that charlotte speaks for herselfthat she does so above all on such an occasion as this and looking as she does tonight how so looking can she pass unnoticed how can she not have success besides he added as she but watched his face letting him say what he would as if she wanted to see how he would say it besides there is always the fact that were of the same connection ofwhat is your wordthe same concern were certainly not with the relation of our respective sposi simply formal acquaintances were in the same boatand the prince smiled with a candour that added an accent to his emphasis  fanny assingham was full of the special sense of his manner it caused her to turn for a moments refuge to a corner of her general consciousness in which she could say to herself that she was glad she wasnt in love with such a man as with charlotte just before she was embarrassed by the difference between what she took in and what she could say what she felt and what she could show it only appears to me of great importance thatnow that you all seem more settled herecharlotte should be known for any presentation any further circulation or introduction as in particular her husbands wife known in the least possible degree as anything else i dont know what you mean by the same boat charlotte is naturally in mr ververs boat  and pray am i not in mr ververs boat too why but for mr ververs boat i should have been by this timeand his quick italian gesture an expressive direction and motion of his forefinger pointed to deepest depthsaway down down down she knew of course what he meanthow it had taken his fatherinlaws great fortune and taken no small slice to surround him with an element in which all too fatally weighted as he had originally been he could pecuniarily float and with this reminder other things came to herhow strange it was that with all allowance for their merit it should befall some people to be so inordinately valued quoted as they said in the stockmarket so high and how still stranger perhaps that there should be cases in which for some reason one didnt mind the so frequently marked absence in them of the purpose really to represent their price she was thinking feeling at any rate for herself she was thinking that the pleasure she could take in this specimen of the class didnt suffer from his consent to be merely made buoyant partly because it was one of those pleasures he inspired them that by their nature couldnt suffer to whatever proof they were put and partly because besides he after all visibly had on his conscience some sort of return for services rendered he was a huge expense assuredlybut it had been up to now her conviction that his idea was to behave beautifully enough to make the beauty well nigh an equivalent and that he had carried out his idea carried it out by continuing to lead the life to breathe the air very nearly to think the thoughts that best suited his wife and her father this she had till lately enjoyed the comfort of so distinctly perceiving as to have even been moved more than once to express to him the happiness it gave her he had that in his favour as against other matters yet it discouraged her too and rather oddly that he should so keep moving and be able to show her that he moved on the firm ground of the truth his acknowledgment of obligation was far from unimportant but she could find in his grasp of the real itself a kind of ominous intimation the intimation appeared to peep at her even out of his next word lightly as he produced it  isnt it rather as if we had charlotte and i for bringing us together a benefactor in common and the effect for his interlocutress was still further to be deepened i somehow feel half the time as if he were her fatherinlaw too its as if he had saved us bothwhich is a fact in our lives or at any rate in our hearts to make of itself a link dont you rememberhe kept it uphow the day she suddenly turned up for you just before my wedding we so frankly and funnily talked in her presence of the advisability for her of some good marriage and then as his friends face in her extremity quite again as with charlotte but continued to fly the black flag of general repudiation well we really began then as it seems to me the work of placing her where she is we were wholly rightand so was she that it was exactly the thing is shown by its success we recommended a good marriage at almost any price so to speak and taking us at our word she has made the very best that was really what we meant wasnt it onlywhat she has gotsomething thoroughly good it would be difficult it seems to me for her to have anything betteronce you allow her the way its to be taken of course if you dont allow her that the case is different her offset is a certain decent freedom which i judge shell be quite contented with you may say that will be very good of her but she strikes me as perfectly humble about it she proposes neither to claim it nor to use it with any sort of retentissement she would enjoy it i think quite as quietly as it might be given the boat you seethe prince explained it no less considerately and lucidlyis a good deal tied up at the dock or anchored if you like out in the stream i have to jump out from time to time to stretch my legs and youll probably perceive if you give it your attention that charlotte really cant help occasionally doing the same it isnt even a question sometimes of ones getting to the dockone has to take a header and splash about in the water call our having remained here together tonight call the accident of my having put them put our illustrious friends there on my companions trackfor i grant you this as a practical result of our combinationcall the whole thing one of the harmless little plunges off the deck inevitable for each of us why not take them when they occur as inevitableand above all as not endangering life or limb we shant drown we shant sinkat least i can answer for myself mrs verver too moreoverdo her the justicevisibly knows how to swim  he could easily go on for she didnt interrupt him fanny felt now that she wouldnt have interrupted him for the world she found his eloquence precious there was not a drop of it that she didnt in a manner catch as it came for immediate bottling for future preservation the crystal flask of her innermost attention really received it on the spot and she had even already the vision of how in the snug laboratory of her afterthought she should be able chemically to analyse it there were moments positively still beyond this when with the meeting of their eyes something as yet unnamable came out for her in his look when something strange and subtle and at variance with his words something that gave them away glimmered deep down as an appeal almost an incredible one to her finer comprehension what inconceivably was it like wasnt it however gross such a rendering of anything so occult fairly like a quintessential wink a hint of the possibility of their really treating their subjectof course on some better occasionand thereby as well finding it much more interesting if this far red spark which might have been figured by her mind as the headlight of an approaching train seen through the length of a tunnel was not on her side an ignis fatuus a mere subjective phenomenon it twinkled there at the direct expense of what the prince was inviting her to understand meanwhile too however and unmistakably the real treatment of their subject did at a given moment sound this was when he proceeded with just the same perfect possession of his thoughton the manner of which he couldnt have improvedto complete his successful simile by another in fact by just the supreme touch the touch for which it had till now been waiting for mrs verver to be known to people so intensely and exclusively as her husbands wife something is wanted that you know they havent exactly got he should manage to be knownor at least to be seena little more as his wifes husband you surely must by this time have seen for yourself that he has his own habits and his own ways and that he makes more and moreas of course he has a perfect right to dohis own discriminations hes so perfect so ideal a father and doubtless largely by that very fact a generous a comfortable an admirable fatherinlaw that i should really feel it base to avail myself of any standpoint whatever to criticise him to you nevertheless i may make just one remark for youre not stupidyou always understand so blessedly what one means  he paused an instant as if even this one remark might be difficult for him should she give no sign of encouraging him to produce it nothing would have induced her however to encourage him she was now conscious of having never in her life stood so still or sat inwardly as it were so tight she felt like the horse of the adage broughtand brought by her own faultto the water but strong for the occasion in the one fact that she couldnt be forced to drink invited in other words to understand she held her breath for fear of showing she did and this for the excellent reason that she was at last fairly afraid to it was sharp for her at the same time that she was certain in advance of his remark that she heard it before it had sounded that she already tasted in fine the bitterness it would have for her special sensibility but her companion from an inward and different need of his own was presently not deterred by her silence what i really dont see is why from his own point of viewgiven that is his conditions so fortunate as they stoodhe should have wished to marry at all there it was thenexactly what she knew would come and exactly for reasons that seemed now to thump at her heart as distressing to her yet she was resolved meanwhile not to suffer as they used to say of the martyrs then and there not to suffer odiously helplessly in publicwhich could be prevented but by her breaking off with whatever inconsequence by her treating their discussion as ended and getting away she suddenly wanted to go home much as she had wanted an hour or two before to come she wanted to leave well behind her both her question and the couple in whom it had abruptly taken such vivid formbut it was dreadful to have the appearance of disconcerted flight discussion had of itself to her sense become dangersuch light as from open crevices it let in and the overt recognition of danger was worse than anything else the worst in fact came while she was thinking how she could retreat and still not overtly recognise her face had betrayed her trouble and with that she was lost im afraid however the prince said that i for some reason distress youfor which i beg your pardon weve always talked so well togetherit has been from the beginning the greatest pull for me nothing so much as such a tone could have quickened her collapse she felt he had her now at his mercy and he showed as he went on that he knew it we shall talk again all the same better than everi depend on it too much dont you remember what i told you so definitely one day before my marriagethat moving as i did in so many ways among new things mysteries conditions expectations assumptions different from any i had known i looked to you as my original sponsor my fairy godmother to see me through i beg you to believe he added that i look to you yet  his very insistence had fortunately the next moment affected her as bringing her help with which at least she could hold up her head to speak ah you are throughyou were through long ago or if you arent you ought to be  well then if i ought to be its all the more reason why you should continue to help me because very distinctly i assure you im not the new things or ever so many of themare still for me new things the mysteries and expectations and assumptions still contain an immense element that ive failed to puzzle out as weve happened so luckily to find ourselves again really taking hold together you must let me as soon as possible come to see you you must give me a good kind hour if you refuse it meand he addressed himself to her continued reservei shall feel that you deny with a stony stare your responsibility  at this as from a sudden shake her reserve proved an inadequate vessel she could bear her own her private reference to the weight on her mind but the touch of another hand made it too horribly press oh i deny responsibilityto you so far as i ever had it ive done with it  he had been all the while beautifully smiling but she made his look now penetrate her again more as to whom then do you confess it  ah mio caro thatsif to anyonemy own business  he continued to look at her hard you give me up then  it was what charlotte had asked her ten minutes before and its coming from him so much in the same way shook her in her place she was on the point of replying do you and she agree together for what youll say to mebut she was glad afterwards to have checked herself in time little as her actual answer had perhaps bettered it i think i dont know what to make of you  you must receive me at least he said  oh please not till im ready for youand though she found a laugh for it she had to turn away she had never turned away from him before and it was quite positively for her as if she were altogether afraid of him                                  xvi  later on when their hired brougham had with the long vociferation that tormented her impatience been extricated from the endless rank she rolled into the london night beside her husband as into a sheltering darkness where she could muffle herself and draw breath she had stood for the previous halfhour in a merciless glare beaten upon stared out of countenance it fairly seemed to her by intimations of her mistake for what she was most immediately feeling was that she had in the past been active for these people to ends that were now bearing fruit and that might yet bear a larger crop she but brooded at first in her corner of the carriage it was like burying her exposed face a face too helplessly exposed in the cool lap of the common indifference of the dispeopled streets of the closed shops and darkened houses seen through the window of the brougham a world mercifully unconscious and unreproachful it wouldnt like the world she had just left know sooner or later what she had done or would know it at least only if the final consequence should be some quite overwhelming publicity she fixed this possibility itself so hard however for a few moments that the misery of her fear produced the next minute a reaction and when the carriage happened while it grazed a turn to catch the straight shaft from the lamp of a policeman in the act of playing his inquisitive flash over an opposite housefront she let herself wince at being thus incriminated only that she might protest not less quickly against mere blind terror it had become for the occasion preposterously terrorof which she must shake herself free before she could properly measure her ground the perception of this necessity had in truth soon aided her since she found on trying that lurid as her prospect might hover there she could none the less give it no name the sense of seeing was strong in her but she clutched at the comfort of not being sure of what she saw not to know what it would represent on a longer view was a help in turn to not making out that her hands were embrued since if she had stood in the position of a producing cause she should surely be less vague about what she had produced this further in its way was a step toward reflecting that when ones connection with any matter was too indirect to be traced it might be described also as too slight to be deplored by the time they were nearing cadogan place she had in fact recognised that she couldnt be as curious as she desired without arriving at some conviction of her being as innocent but there had been a moment in the dim desert of eaton square when she broke into speech  its only their defending themselves so much more than they needits only that that makes me wonder its their having so remarkably much to say for themselves  her husband had as usual lighted his cigar remaining apparently as busy with it as she with her agitation you mean it makes you feel that you have nothing to which as she made no answer the colonel added what in the world did you ever suppose was going to happen the mans in a position in which he has nothing in life to do  her silence seemed to characterise this statement as superficial and her thoughts as always in her husbands company pursued an independent course he made her when they were together talk but as if for some other person who was in fact for the most part herself yet she addressed herself with him as she could never have done without him he has behaved beautifullyhe did from the first ive thought it all along wonderful of him and ive more than once when ive had a chance told him so therefore therefore but it died away as she mused  therefore he has a right for a change to kick up his heels  it isnt a question of course however she undivertedly went on of their behaving beautifully apart its a question of their doing as they should when togetherwhich is another matter  and how do you think then the colonel asked with interest that when together they should do the less they do one would say the betterif you see so much in it  his wife at this appeared to hear him i dont see in it what youd see and dont my dear she further answered think it necessary to be horrid or low about them theyre the last people really to make anything of that sort come in right  im surely never horrid or low he returned about anyone but my extravagant wife i can do with all our friendsas i see them myself what i cant do with is the figures you make of them and when you take to adding your figures up but he exhaled it again in smoke  my additions dont matter when youve not to pay the bill with which her meditation again bore her through the air the great thing was that when it so suddenly came up for her he wasnt afraid if he had been afraid he could perfectly have prevented it and if i had seen he wasif i hadnt seen he wasntso said mrs assingham could i so she declared would i its perfectly true she went onit was too good a thing for her such a chance in life not to be accepted and i liked his not keeping her out of it merely from a fear of his own nature it was so wonderful it should come to her the only thing would have been if charlotte herself couldnt have faced it then if she had not had confidence we might have talked but she had it to any amount  did you ask her how much bob assingham patiently inquired  he had put the question with no more than his usual modest hope of reward but he had pressed this time the sharpest spring of response never neverit wasnt a time to ask asking is suggestingand it wasnt a time to suggest one had to make up ones mind as quietly as possible by what one could judge and i judge as i say that charlotte felt she could face it for which she struck me at the time asfor so proud a creature almost touchingly grateful the thing i should never forgive her for would be her forgetting to whom it is her thanks have remained most due  that is to mrs assingham  she said nothing for a littlethere were after all alternatives maggie herself of courseastonishing little maggie  is maggie then astonishing tooand he gloomed out of his window  his wife on her side now as they rolled projected the same look im not sure that i dont begin to see more in her than dear little person as ive always thoughti ever supposed there was im not sure that putting a good many things together im not beginning to make her out rather extraordinary  you certainly will if you can the colonel resignedly remarked  again his companion said nothing then again she broke out in facti do begin to feel itmaggies the great comfort im getting hold of it it will be she wholl see us through in fact shell have to and shell be able  touch by touch her meditation had completed it but with a cumulative effect for her husbands general sense of her method that caused him to overflow whimsically enough in his corner into an ejaculation now frequent on his lips for the relief that especially in communion like the present it gave him and that fanny had critically traced to the quaint example the aboriginal homeliness still so delightful of mr verver oh lordy lordy  if she is however mrs assingham continued shell be extraordinary enoughand thats what im thinking of but im not indeed so very sure she added of the person to whom charlotte ought in decency to be most grateful i mean im not sure if that person is even almost the incredible little idealist who has made her his wife  i shouldnt think you would be love the colonel with some promptness responded charlotte as the wife of an incredible little idealist his cigar in short once more could alone express it  yet what is that when one thinks but just what she struck one as more or less persuaded that she herself was really going to bethis memory for the full view fanny found herself also invoking  it made her companion in truth slightly gape an incredible little idealistcharlotte herself  and she was sincere his wife simply proceeded she was unmistakably sincere the question is only how much is left of it  and thati seehappens to be another of the questions you cant ask her you have to do it all said bob assingham as if you were playing some game with its rules drawn upthough whos to come down on you if you break them i dont quite see or must you do it in three guesseslike forfeits on christmas eve to which as his ribaldry but dropped from her he further added how much of anything will have to be left for you to be able to go on with it  i shall go on fanny assingham a trifle grimly declared while theres a scrap as big as your nail but were not yet luckily reduced only to that she had another pause holding the while the thread of that larger perception into which her view of mrs ververs obligation to maggie had suddenly expanded even if her debt was not to the otherseven then it ought to be quite sufficiently to the prince himself to keep her straight for what really did the prince do she asked herself but generously trust her what did he do but take it from her that if she felt herself willing it was because she felt herself strong that creates for her upon my word mrs assingham pursued a duty of considering him of honourably repaying his trust which well which shell be really a fiend if she doesnt make the law of her conduct i mean of course his trust that she wouldnt interfere with himexpressed by his holding himself quiet at the critical time  the brougham was nearing home and it was perhaps this sense of ebbing opportunity that caused the colonels next meditation to flower in a fashion almost surprising to his wife they were united for the most part but by his exhausted patience so that indulgent despair was generally at the best his note he at present however actually compromised with his despair to the extent of practically admitting that he had followed her steps he literally asked in short an intelligent well nigh a sympathising question gratitude to the prince for not having put a spoke in her wheelthat you mean should taking it in the right way be precisely the ballast of her boat  taking it in the right way fanny catching at this gleam emphasised the proviso  but doesnt it rather depend on what she may most feel to be the right way  noit depends on nothing because theres only one wayfor duty or delicacy  ohdelicacy bob assingham rather crudely murmured  i mean the highest kindmoral charlottes perfectly capable of appreciating that by every dictate of moral delicacy she must let him alone  then youve made up your mind its all poor charlotte he asked with an effect of abruptness  the effect whether intended or not reached herbrought her face short round it was a touch at which she again lost her balance at which somehow the bottom dropped out of her recovered comfort then youve made up yours differently it really struck you that there is something  the movement itself apparently made him once more stand off he had felt on his nearer approach the high temperature of the question perhaps thats just what shes doing showing him how much shes letting him alonepointing it out to him from day to day  did she point it out by waiting for him tonight on the stair case in the manner you described to me  i really my dear described to you a manner the colonel clearly from want of habit scarce recognised himself in the imputation  yesfor once in a way in those few words we had after you had watched them come up you told me something of what you had seen you didnt tell me very muchthat you couldnt for your life but i saw for myself that strange to say you had received your impression and i felt therefore that there must indeed have been something out of the way for you so to betray it she was fully upon him now and she confronted him with his proved sensibility to the occasionconfronted him because of her own uneasy need to profit by it it came over her still more than at the time it came over her that he had been struck with something even he poor dear man and that for this to have occurred there must have been much to be struck with she tried in fact to corner him to pack him insistently down in the truth of his plain vision the very plainness of which was its value for so recorded she felt none of it would escapeshe should have it at hand for reference come my dearyou thought what you thought in the presence of what you saw you couldnt resist thinking i dont ask more of it than that and your idea is worth this time quite as much as any of mineso that you cant pretend as usual that mine has run away with me i havent caught up with you i stay where i am but i see she concluded where you are and im much obliged to you for letting me you give me a point de repere outside myselfwhich is where i like it now i can work round you  their conveyance as she spoke stopped at their door and it was on the spot another fact of value for her that her husband though seated on the side by which they must alight made no movement they were in a high degree votaries of the latchkey so that their household had gone to bed and as they were unaccompanied by a footman the coachman waited in peace it was so indeed that for a minute bob assingham waitedconscious of a reason for replying to this address otherwise than by the so obvious method of turning his back he didnt turn his face but he stared straight before him and his wife had already perceived in the fact of his not moving all the proof she could desire proof that is of her own contention she knew he never cared what she said and his neglect of his chance to show it was thereby the more eloquent leave it he at last remarked to them  leave it she wondered  let them alone theyll manage  theyll manage you mean to do everything they want ah there then you are  theyll manage in their own way the colonel almost cryptically repeated  it had its effect for her quite apart from its light on the familiar phenomenon of her husbands indurated conscience it gave her full in her face the particular evocation of which she had made him guilty it was wonderful truly then the evocation so cleverlythats your ideathat no one will be the wiser its your idea that we shall have done all thats required of us if we simply protect them  the colonel still in his place declined however to be drawn into a statement of his idea statements were too much like theories in which one lost ones way he only knew what he said and what he said represented the limited vibration of which his confirmed old toughness had been capable still none the less he had his point to makefor which he took another instant but he made it for the third time in the same fashion theyll manage in their own way with which he got out  oh yes at this for his companion it had indeed its effect and while he mounted their steps she but stared without following him at his opening of their door their hall was lighted and as he stood in the aperture looking back at her his tall lean figure outlined in darkness and with his crushhat according to his wont worn cavalierly rather diabolically askew he seemed to prolong the sinister emphasis of his meaning in general on these returns he came back for her when he had prepared their entrance so that it was now as if he were ashamed to face her in closer quarters he looked at her across the interval and still in her seat weighing his charge she felt her whole view of everything flare up wasnt it simply what had been written in the princes own face beneath what he was sayingdidnt it correspond with the mocking presence there that she had had her troubled glimpse of wasnt in fine the pledge that they would manage in their own way the thing he had been feeling for his chance to invite her to take from him her husbands tone somehow fitted amerigos lookthe one that had for her so strangely peeped from behind over the shoulder of the one in front she had not then read itbut wasnt she reading it when she now saw in it his surmise that she was perhaps to be squared she wasnt to be squared and while she heard her companion call across to her well whats the matter she also took time to remind herself that she had decided she couldnt be frightened the matterwhy it was sufficiently the matter with all this that she felt a little sick for it was not the prince that she had been prepared to regard as primarily the shaky one shakiness in charlotte she had at the most perhaps postulatedit would be she somehow felt more easy to deal with therefore if he had come so far it was a different pair of sleeves there was nothing to choose between them it made her so helpless that as the time passed without her alighting the colonel came back and fairly drew her forth after which on the pavement under the streetlamp their very silence might have been the mark of something gravetheir silence eked out for her by his giving her his arm and their then crawling up their steps quite mildly and unitedly together like some old darby and joan who have had a disappointment it almost resembled a return from a funeral unless indeed it resembled more the hushed approach to a house of mourning what indeed had she come home for but to bury as decently as possible her mistake                                 xvii  it appeared thus that they might enjoy together extraordinary freedom the two friends from the moment they should understand their position aright with the prince himself from an early stage not unnaturally charlotte had made a great point of their so understanding it she had found frequent occasion to describe to him this necessity and her resignation tempered or her intelligence at least quickened by irrepressible irony she applied at different times different names to the propriety of their case the wonderful thing was that her sense of propriety had been from the first especially alive about it there were hours when she spoke of their taking refuge in what she called the commonest tactas if this principle alone would suffice to light their way there were others when it might have seemed to listen to her that their course would demand of them the most anxious study and the most independent not to say original interpretation of signs she talked now as if it were indicated at every turn by fingerposts of almost ridiculous prominence she talked again as if it lurked in devious ways and were to be tracked through bush and briar and she even on occasion delivered herself in the sense that as their situation was unprecedented so their heaven was without stars do she once had echoed to him as the upshot of passages covertly though briefly occurring between them on her return from the visit to america that had immediately succeeded her marriage determined for her by this event as promptly as an excursion of the like strange order had been prescribed in his own case isnt the immense the really quite matchless beauty of our position that we have to do nothing in life at allnothing except the usual necessary everyday thing which consists in ones not being more of a fool than one can help thats allbut thats as true for one time as for another there has been plenty of doing and there will doubtless be plenty still but its all theirs every inch of it its all a matter of what theyve done to us and she showed how the question had therefore been only of their taking everything as everything came and all as quietly as might be nothing stranger surely had ever happened to a conscientious a wellmeaning a perfectly passive pair no more extraordinary decree had ever been launched against such victims than this of forcing them against their will into a relation of mutual close contact that they had done everything to avoid  she was to remember not a little meanwhile the particular prolonged silent look with which the prince had met her allusion to these primary efforts at escape she was inwardly to dwell on the element of the unuttered that her tone had caused to play up into his irresistible eyes and this because she considered with pride and joy that she had on the spot disposed of the doubt the question the challenge or whatever else might have been that such a look could convey he had been sufficiently off his guard to show some little wonder as to their having plotted so very hard against their destiny and she knew well enough of course what in this connection was at the bottom of his thought and what would have sounded out more or less if he had not happily saved himself from words all men were brutes enough to catch when they might at such chances for dissentfor all the good it really did them but the princes distinction was in being one of the few who could check himself before acting on the impulse this obviously was what counted in a man as delicacy if her friend had blurted or bungled he would have said in his simplicity did we do everything to avoid it when we faced your remarkable marriagequite handsomely of course using the plural taking his share of the case by way of a tribute of memory to the telegram she had received from him in paris after mr verver had despatched to rome the news of their engagement that telegram that acceptance of the prospect proposed to them an acceptance quite other than perfunctoryshe had never destroyed though reserved for no eyes but her own it was still carefully reserved she kept it in a safe placefrom which very privately she sometimes took it out to read it over a la guerre comme a la guerre thenit had been couched in the french tongue we must lead our lives as we see them but i am charmed with your courage and almost surprised at my own the message had remained ambiguous she had read it in more lights than one it might mean that even without her his career was uphill work for him a daily fightingmatter on behalf of a good appearance and that thus if they were to become neighbours again the event would compel him to live still more under arms it might mean on the other hand that he found he was happy enough and that accordingly so far as she might imagine herself a danger she was to think of him as prepared in advance as really seasoned and secure on his arrival in paris with his wife none the less she had asked for no explanation just as he himself had not asked if the document were still in her possession such an inquiry everything implied was beneath himjust as it was beneath herself to mention to him uninvited that she had instantly offered and in perfect honesty to show the telegram to mr verver and that if this companion had but said the word she would immediately have put it before him she had thereby forborne to call his attention to her consciousness that such an exposure would in all probability straightway have dished her marriage that all her future had in fact for the moment hung by the single hair of mr ververs delicacy as she supposed they must call it and that her position in the matter of responsibility was therefore inattackably straight  for the prince himself meanwhile time in its measured allowance had originally much helped himhelped him in the sense of there not being enough of it to trip him up in spite of which it was just this accessory element that seemed at present with wonders of patience to lie in wait time had begotten at first more than anything else separations delays and intervals but it was troublesomely less of an aid from the moment it began so to abound that he had to meet the question of what to do with it less of it was required for the state of being married than he had on the whole expected less strangely for the state of being married even as he was married and there was a logic in the matter he knew a logic that but gave this truth a sort of solidity of evidence mr verver decidedly helped him with itwith his wedded condition helped him really so much that it made all the difference in the degree in which he rendered it the service on mr ververs part was remarkableas indeed what service from the first of their meeting had not been he was living he had been living these four or five years on mr ververs services a truth scarcely less plain if he dealt with them for appreciation one by one than if he poured them all together into the general pot of his gratitude and let the thing simmer to a nourishing broth to the latter way with them he was undoubtedly most disposed yet he would even thus on occasion pick out a piece to taste on its own merits wondrous at such hours could seem the savour of the particular treat at his fatherinlaws expense that he more and more struck himself as enjoying he had needed months and months to arrive at a full appreciationhe couldnt originally have given offhand a name to his deepest obligation but by the time the name had flowered in his mind he was practically living at the ease guaranteed him mr verver then in a word took care of his relation to maggie as he took care and apparently always would of everything else he relieved him of all anxiety about his married life in the same manner in which he relieved him on the score of his bankaccount and as he performed the latter office by communicating with the bankers so the former sprang as directly from his good understanding with his daughter this understanding had wonderfullythat was in high evidencethe same deep intimacy as the commercial the financial association founded far down on a community of interest and the correspondence for the prince carried itself out in identities of character the vision of which fortunately rather tended to amuse than toas might have happenedirritate him those peopleand his free synthesis lumped together capitalists and bankers retired men of business illustrious collectors american fathersinlaw american fathers little american daughters little american wivesthose people were of the same large lucky group as one might say they were all at least of the same general species and had the same general instincts they hung together they passed each other the word they spoke each others language they did each other turns in this last connection it of course came up for our young man at a given moment that maggies relation with him was also on the perceived basis taken care of which was in fact the real upshot of the matter it was a funny situationthat is it was funny just as it stood their married life was in question but the solution was not less strikingly before them it was all right for himself because mr verver worked it so for maggies comfort and it was all right for maggie because he worked it so for her husbands  the fact that time however was not as we have said wholly on the princes side might have shown for particularly true one dark day on which by an odd but not unprecedented chance the reflections just noted offered themselves as his main recreation they alone it appeared had been appointed to fill the hours for him and even to fill the great square house in portland place where the scale of one of the smaller saloons fitted them but loosely he had looked into this room on the chance that he might find the princess at tea but though the fireside service of the repast was shiningly present the mistress of the table was not and he had waited for her if waiting it could be called while he measured again and again the stretch of polished floor he could have named to himself no pressing reason for seeing her at this moment and her not coming in as the halfhour elapsed became in fact quite positively however perversely the circumstance that kept him on the spot just there he might have been feeling just there he could best take his note this observation was certainly by itself meagre amusement for a dreary little crisis but his walk to and fro and in particular his repeated pause at one of the high front windows gave each of the ebbing minutes none the less after a time a little more of the quality of a quickened throb of the spirit these throbs scarce expressed however the impatience of desire any more than they stood for sharp disappointment the series together resembled perhaps more than anything else those fine waves of clearness through which for a watcher of the east dawn at last trembles into rosy day the illumination indeed was all for the mind the prospect revealed by it a mere immensity of the world of thought the material outlook was all the while a different matter the march afternoon judged at the window had blundered back into autumn it had been raining for hours and the colour of the rain the colour of the air of the mud of the opposite houses of life altogether in so grim a joke so idiotic a masquerade was an unutterable dirty brown there was at first even for the young man no faint flush in the fact of the direction taken while he happened to look out by a slowjogging fourwheeled cab which awkwardly deflecting from the middle course at the apparent instance of a person within began to make for the lefthand pavement and so at last under further instructions floundered to a full stop before the princes windows the person within alighting with an easier motion proved to be a lady who left the vehicle to wait and putting up no umbrella quickly crossed the wet interval that separated her from the house she but flitted and disappeared yet the prince from his standpoint had had time to recognise her and the recognition kept him for some minutes motionless  charlotte stant at such an hour in a shabby fourwheeler and a waterproof charlotte stant turning up for him at the very climax of his special inner vision was an apparition charged with a congruity at which he stared almost as if it had been a violence the effect of her coming to see him him only had while he stood waiting a singular intensitythough after some minutes had passed the certainty of this began to drop perhaps she had not come or had come only for maggie perhaps on learning below that the princess had not returned she was merely leaving a message writing a word on a card he should see at any rate and meanwhile controlling himself would do nothing this thought of not interfering took on a sudden force for him she would doubtless hear he was at home but he would let her visit to him be all of her own choosing and his view of a reason for leaving her free was the more remarkable that though taking no step he yet intensely hoped the harmony of her breaking into sight while the superficial conditions were so against her was a harmony with conditions that were far from superficial and that gave for his imagination an extraordinary value to her presence the value deepened strangely moreover with the rigour of his own attitudewith the fact too that listening hard he neither heard the housedoor close again nor saw her go back to her cab and it had risen to a climax by the time he had become aware with his quickened sense that she had followed the butler up to the landing from which his room opened if anything could further then have added to it the renewed pause outside as if she had said to the man wait a moment would have constituted this touch yet when the man had shown her in had advanced to the teatable to light the lamp under the kettle and had then busied himself all deliberately with the fire she made it easy for her host to drop straight from any height of tension and to meet her provisionally on the question of maggie while the butler remained it was maggie that she had come to see and maggie thatin spite of this attendants high blankness on the subject of all possibilities on that ladys partshe would cheerfully by the fire wait for as soon as they were alone together however she mounted as with the whizz and the red light of a rocket from the form to the fact saying straight out as she stood and looked at him what else my dear what in the world else can we do  it was as if he then knew on the spot why he had been feeling for hours as he had feltas if he in fact knew within the minute things he had not known even while she was panting as from the effect of the staircase at the door of the room he knew at the same time none the less that she knew still more than hein the sense that is of all the signs and portents that might count for them and his vision of alternativeshe could scarce say what to call them solutions satisfactions opened out altogether with this tangible truth of her attitude by the chimneyplace the way she looked at him as through the gained advantage of it her right hand resting on the marble and her left keeping her skirt from the fire while she held out a foot to dry he couldnt have told what particular links and gaps had at the end of a few minutes found themselves renewed and bridged for he remembered no occasion in rome from which the picture could have been so exactly copied he remembered that is none of her coming to see him in the rain while a muddy fourwheeler waited and while though having left her waterproof downstairs she was yet invested with the odd eloquencethe positive picturesqueness yes given all the rest of the matter of a dull dress and a black bowdlerised hat that seemed to make a point of insisting on their time of life and their moral intention the hats and the frocks own as well as on the irony of indifference to them practically playing in her so handsome rainfreshened face the sense of the past revived for him nevertheless as it had not yet done it made that other time somehow meet the future close interlocking with it before his watching eyes as in a long embrace of arms and lips and so handling and hustling the present that this poor quantity scarce retained substance enough scarce remained sufficiently there to be wounded or shocked  what had happened in short was that charlotte and he had by a single turn of the wrist of fateled up to indeed no doubt by steps and stages that conscious computation had missedbeen placed face to face in a freedom that partook extraordinarily of ideal perfection since the magic web had spun itself without their toil almost without their touch above all on this occasion once more there sounded through their safety as an undertone the very voice he had listened to on the eve of his marriage with such another sort of unrest dimly again and again from that period on he had seemed to hear it tell him why it kept recurring but it phrased the large music now in a way that filled the room the reason wasinto which he had lived quite intimately by the end of a quarterofanhourthat just this truth of their safety offered it now a kind of unexampled receptacle letting it spread and spread but at the same time elastically enclosing it banking it in for softness as with billows of eiderdown on that morning in the park there had been however dissimulated doubt and danger whereas the tale this afternoon was taken up with a highly emphasised confidence the emphasis for their general comfort was what charlotte had come to apply inasmuch as though it was not what she definitely began with it had soon irrepressibly shaped itself it was the meaning of the question she had put to him as soon as they were aloneeven though indeed as from not quite understanding he had not then directly replied it was the meaning of everything else down to the conscious quaintness of her ricketty growler and the conscious humility of her dress it had helped him a little the question of these eccentricities to let her immediate appeal pass without an answer he could ask her instead what had become of her carriage and why above all she was not using it in such weather  its just because of the weather she explained its my little idea it makes me feel as i used towhen i could do as i liked                                xviii  this came out so straight that he saw at once how much truth it expressed yet it was truth that still a little puzzled him but did you ever like knocking about in such discomfort  it seems to me now that i then liked everything its the charm at any rate she said from her place at the fire of trying again the old feelings they come backthey come back everything she went on comes back besides she wound up you know for yourself  he stood near her his hands in his pockets but not looking at her looking hard at the teatable ah i havent your courage moreover he laughed it seems to me that so far as that goes i do live in hansoms but you must awfully want your tea he quickly added so let me give you a good stiff cup  he busied himself with this care and she sat down on his pushing up a low seat where she had been standing so that while she talked he could bring her what she further desired he moved to and fro before her he helped himself and her visit as the moments passed had more and more the effect of a signal communication that she had come all responsibly and deliberately as on the clear show of the clockface of their situation to make the whole demonstration none the less presented itself as taking place at a very high level of debate in the cool upper air of the finer discrimination the deeper sincerity the larger philosophy no matter what were the facts invoked and arrayed it was only a question as yet of their seeing their way together to which indeed exactly the present occasion appeared to have so much to contribute its not that you havent my courage charlotte said but that you havent i rather think my imagination unless indeed it should turn out after all she added that you havent even my intelligence however i shall not be afraid of that till youve given me more proof and she made again but more clearly her point of a moment before you knew besides you knew today i would come and if you knew that you know everything so she pursued and if he didnt meanwhile if he didnt even at this take her up it might be that she was so positively fitting him again with the fair face of temporising kindness that he had given her to keep her eyes on at the other important juncture and the sense of which she might ever since have been carrying about with her like a precious medalnot exactly blessed by the pope suspended round her neck she had come back however this might be to her immediate account of herself and no mention of their great previous passage was to rise to the lips of either above all she said there has been the personal romance of it  of tea with me over the fire ah so far as that goes i dont think even my intelligence fails me  oh its further than that goes and if ive had a better day than you its perhaps when i come to think of it that i am braver you bore yourself you see but i dont i dont i dont she repeated  its precisely boring ones self without relief he protested that takes courage  passive thennot active my romance is that if you want to know ive been all day on the town literally on the townisnt that what they call it i know how it feels after which as if breaking off and you have you never been out she asked  he still stood there with his hands in his pockets what should i have gone out for  oh what should people in our case do anything for but youre wonderful all of youyou know how to live were clumsy brutes we others beside youwe must always be doing something however charlotte pursued if you had gone out you might have missed the chance of mewhich im sure though you wont confess it was what you didnt want and might have missed above all the satisfaction that look blank about it as you will ive come to congratulate you on thats really what i can at last do you cant not know at least on such a day as thisyou cant not know she said where you are she waited as for him either to grant that he knew or to pretend that he didnt but he only drew a long deep breath which came out like a moan of impatience it brushed aside the question of where he was or what he knew it seemed to keep the ground clear for the question of his visitor herself that of charlotte verver exactly as she sat there so for some moments with their long look they but treated the matter in silence with the effect indeed by the end of the time of having considerably brought it on this was sufficiently marked in what charlotte next said there it all is extraordinary beyond words it makes such a relation for us as i verily believe was never before in the world thrust upon two wellmeaning creatures havent we therefore to take things as we find them she put the question still more directly than that of a moment before but to this one as well he returned no immediate answer noticing only that she had finished her tea he relieved her of her cup carried it back to the table asked her what more she would have and then on her nothing thanks returned to the fire and restored a displaced log to position by a small but almost too effectual kick she had meanwhile got up again and it was on her feet that she repeated the words she had first frankly spoken what else can we do what in all the world else  he took them up however no more than at first where then have you been he asked as from mere interest in her adventure  everywhere i could think ofexcept to see people i didnt want peoplei wanted too much to think but ive been back at intervalsthree times and then come away again my cabman must think me crazyits very amusing i shall owe him when we come to settle more money than he has ever seen ive been my dear she went on to the british museumwhich you know i always adore and ive been to the national gallery and to a dozen old booksellers coming across treasures and ive lunched on some strange nastiness at a cookshop in holborn i wanted to go to the tower but it was too farmy old man urged that and i would have gone to the zoo if it hadnt been too wetwhich he also begged me to observe but you wouldnt believei did put in st pauls such days she wound up are expensive for besides the cab ive bought quantities of books she immediately passed at any rate to another point i cant help wondering when you must last have laid eyes on them and then as it had apparently for her companion an effect of abruptness maggie i mean and the child for i suppose you know hes with her  oh yes i know hes with her i saw them this morning  and did they then announce their programme  she told me she was taking him as usual da nonno  and for the whole day  he hesitated but it was as if his attitude had slowly shifted  she didnt say and i didnt ask  well she went on it cant have been later than halfpast teni mean when you saw them they had got to eaton square before eleven you know we dont formally breakfast adam and i we have tea in our roomsat least i have but luncheon is early and i saw my husband this morning by twelve he was showing the child a picturebook maggie had been there with them had left them settled together then she had gone outtaking the carriage for something he had been intending but that she offered to do instead  the prince appeared to confess at this to his interest  taking you mean your carriage  i dont know which and it doesnt matter its not a question she smiled of a carriage the more or the less its not a question even if you come to that of a cab its so beautiful she said that its not a question of anything vulgar or horrid which she gave him time to agree about and though he was silent it was rather remarkably as if he fell in i went outi wanted to i had my idea it seemed to me important it has beenit is important i know as i havent known before the way they feel i couldnt in any other way have made so sure of it  they feel a confidence the prince observed  he had indeed said it for her they feel a confidence and she proceeded with lucidity to the fuller illustration of it speaking again of the three different moments that in the course of her wild ramble had witnessed her returnfor curiosity and even really a little from anxietyto eaton square she was possessed of a latchkey rarely used it had always irritated adamone of the few things that didto find servants standing up so inhumanly straight when they came home in the small hours after parties so i had but to slip in each time with my cab at the door and make out for myself without their knowing it that maggie was still there i came i wentwithout their so much as dreaming what do they really suppose she asked becomes of onenot so much sentimentally or morally so to call it and since that doesnt matter but even just physically materially as a mere wandering woman as a decent harmless wife after all as the best stepmother after all that really ever was or at the least simply as a maitresse de maison not quite without a conscience they must even in their odd way she declared have some idea  oh theyve a great deal of idea said the prince and nothing was easier than to mention the quantity they think so much of us they think in particular so much of you  ah dont put it all on me she smiled  but he was putting it now where she had admirably prepared the place its a matter of your known character  ah thank you for known she still smiled  its a matter of your wonderful cleverness and wonderful charm its a matter of what those things have done for you in the worldi mean in this world and this place youre a personage for themand personages do go and come  oh no my dear there youre quite wrong and she laughed now in the happier light they had diffused thats exactly what personages dont do they live in state and under constant consideration they havent latchkeys but drums and trumpets announce them and when they go out in growlers it makes a greater noise still its you caro mio she said who so far as that goes are the personage  ah he in turn protested dont put it all on me what at any rate when you get home he added shall you say that youve been doing  i shall say beautifully that ive been here  all day  yesall day keeping you company in your solitude how can we understand anything she went on without really seeing that this is what they must like to think i do for youjust as quite as comfortably you do it for me the thing is for us to learn to take them as they are  he considered this a while in his restless way but with his eyes not turning from her after which rather disconnectedly though very vehemently he brought out how can i not feel more than anything else how they adore together my boy and then further as if slightly disconcerted she had nothing to meet this and he quickly perceived the effect they would have done the same for one of yours  ah if i could have had one i hoped and i believed said charlotte that that would happen it would have been better it would have made perhaps some difference he thought so too poor duckthat it might have been im sure he hoped and intended so its not at any rate she went on my fault there it is she had uttered these statements one by one gravely sadly and responsibly owing it to her friend to be clear she paused briefly but as if once for all she made her clearness complete and now im too sure it will never be  he waited for a moment never  never they treated the matter not exactly with solemnity but with a certain decency even perhaps urgency of distinctness it would probably have been better charlotte added but things turn out and it leaves usshe made the pointmore alone  he seemed to wonder it leaves you more alone  oh she again returned dont put it all on me maggie would have given herself to his child im sure scarcely less than he gives himself to yours it would have taken more than any child of mine she explainedit would have taken more than ten children of mine could i have had themto keep our sposi apart she smiled as for the breadth of the image but as he seemed to take it in spite of this for important she then spoke gravely enough its as strange as you like but were immensely alone he kept vaguely moving but there were moments when again with an awkward ease and his hands in his pockets he was more directly before her he stood there at these last words which had the effect of making him for a little throw back his head and as thinking something out stare up at the ceiling what will you say she meanwhile asked that youve been doing this brought his consciousness and his eyes back to her and she pointed her question i mean when she comes infor i suppose she will some time come in it seems to me we must say the same thing  well he thought again yet i can scarce pretend to have had what i havent  ah what havent you hadwhat arent you having  her question rang out as they lingered face to face and he still took it before he answered from her eyes we must at least then not to be absurd together do the same thing we must act it would really seem in concert  it would really seem her eyebrows her shoulders went up quite in gaiety as for the relief this brought her its all in the world i pretend we must act in concert heaven knows she said they do  so it was that he evidently saw and that by his admission the case could fairly be put but what he evidently saw appeared to come over him at the same time as too much for him so that he fell back suddenly to ground where she was not awaiting him the difficulty is and will always be that i dont understand them i didnt at first but i thought i should learn to that was what i hoped and it appeared then that fanny assingham might help me  oh fanny assingham said charlotte verver  he stared a moment at her tone she would do anything for us  to which charlotte at first said nothingas if from the sense of too much then indulgently enough she shook her head were beyond her  he thought a momentas of where this placed them shed do anything then for them  well so would weso that doesnt help us she has broken down she doesnt understand us and really my dear charlotte added fanny assingham doesnt matter  he wondered again unless as taking care of them  ah charlotte instantly said isnt it for us only to do that she spoke as with a flare of pride for their privilege and their duty i think we want no ones aid  she spoke indeed with a nobleness not the less effective for coming in so oddly with a sincerity visible even through the complicated twist by which any effort to protect the father and the daughter seemed necessarily conditioned for them it moved him in any case as if some spring of his own a weaker one had suddenly been broken by it these things all the while the privilege the duty the opportunity had been the substance of his own vision they formed the note he had been keeping back to show her that he was not in their so special situation without a responsible view a conception that he could name and could act on was something that now at last not to be too eminent a fool he was required by all the graces to produce and the luminous idea she had herself uttered would have been his expression of it she had anticipated him but as her expression left for positive beauty nothing to be desired he felt rather righted than wronged a large response as he looked at her came into his face a light of excited perception all his own in the glory of whichas it almost might be calledwhat he gave her back had the value of what she had given him theyre extraordinarily happy  oh charlottes measure of it was only too full beatifically  thats the great thing he went on so that it doesnt matter really that one doesnt understand besides you doenough  i understand my husband perhaps she after an instant conceded i dont understand your wife  youre of the same race at any ratemore or less of the same general tradition and education of the same moral paste there are things you have in common with them but i on my side as ive gone on trying to see if i havent some of these things tooi on my side have more and more failed there seem at last to be none worth mentioning i cant help seeing itim decidedly too different  yet youre notcharlotte made the important pointtoo different from me  i dont knowas were not married that brings things out perhaps if we were he said you would find some abyss of divergence  since it depends on that then she smiled im safeas you are anyhow moreover as one has so often had occasion to feel and even to remark theyre very very simple that makes she added a difficulty for belief but when once one has taken it in it makes less difficulty for action i have at last for myself i think taken it in im not afraid  he wondered a moment not afraid of what  well generally of some beastly mistake especially of any mistake founded on ones idea of their difference for that idea charlotte developed positively makes one so tender  ah but rather  well then there it is i cant put myself into maggies skini cant as i say its not my fiti shouldnt be able as i see it to breathe in it but i can feel that id do anythingto shield it from a bruise tender as i am for her too she went on i think im still more so for my husband hes in truth of a sweet simplicity  the prince turned over a while the sweet simplicity of mr verver well i dont know that i can choose at night all cats are grey i only see how for so many reasons we ought to stand toward themand how to do ourselves justice we do it represents for us a conscious care  of every hour literally said charlotte she could rise to the highest measure of the facts and for which we must trust each other  oh as we trust the saints in glory fortunately the prince hastened to add we can with which as for the full assurance and the pledge it involved their hands instinctively found their hands its all too wonderful  firmly and gravely she kept his hand its too beautiful  and so for a minute they stood together as strongly held and as closely confronted as any hour of their easier past even had seen them they were silent at first only facing and faced only grasping and grasped only meeting and met its sacred he said at last  its sacred she breathed back to him they vowed it gave it out and took it in drawn by their intensity more closely together then of a sudden through this tightened circle as at the issue of a narrow strait into the sea beyond everything broke up broke down gave way melted and mingled their lips sought their lips their pressure their response and their response their pressure with a violence that had sighed itself the next moment to the longest and deepest of stillnesses they passionately sealed their pledge                                xix  he had taken it from her as we have seen moreover that fanny assingham didnt now matterthe now he had even himself supplied as no more than fair to his sense of various earlier stages and though his assent remained scarce more than tacit his behaviour for the hour so fell into line that for many days he kept postponing the visit he had promised his old friend on the occasion of their talk at the foreign office with regret none the less would he have seen it quite extinguished that theory of their relation as attached pupil and kind instructress in which they had from the first almost equally found a convenience it had been he no doubt who had most put it forward since his need of knowledge fairly exceeded her mild pretension but he had again and again repeated to her that he should never without her have been where he was and she had not successfully concealed the pleasure it might give her to believe it even after the question of where he was had begun to show itself as rather more closed than open to interpretation it had never indeed before that evening come up as during the passage at the official party and he had for the first time at those moments a little disappointedly got the impression of a certain failure on the dear womans part of something he was aware of having always rather freely taken for granted in her of what exactly the failure consisted he would still perhaps have felt it a little harsh to try to say and if she had in fact as by charlottes observation broken down the details of the collapse would be comparatively unimportant they came to the same thing all such collapsesthe failure of courage the failure of friendship or the failure just simply of tact for didnt any one of them by itself amount really to the failure of witwhich was the last thing he had expected of her and which would be but another name for the triumph of stupidity it had been charlottes remark that they were at last beyond her whereas he had ever enjoyed believing that a certain easy imagination in her would keep up with him to the end he shrank from affixing a label to mrs assinghams want of faith but when he thought at his ease of the way persons who were capable really entertainedor at least with any refinementthe passion of personal loyalty he figured for them a play of fancy neither timorous nor scrupulous so would his personal loyalty if need be have accepted the adventure for the good creature herself to that definite degree that he had positively almost missed the luxury of some such call from her that was what it all came back to again with these people among whom he was marriedthat one found one used ones imagination mainly for wondering how they contrived so little to appeal to it he felt at moments as if there were never anything to do for them that was worthyto call worthyof the personal relation never any charming charge to take of any confidence deeply reposed he might vulgarly have put it that one had never to plot or to lie for them he might humourously have put it that one had never as by the higher conformity to lie in wait with the dagger or to prepare insidiously the cup these were the services that by all romantic tradition were consecrated to affection quite as much as to hate but he could amuse himself with sayingso far as the amusement wentthat they were what he had once for all turned his back on  fanny was meanwhile frequent it appeared in eaton square so much he gathered from the visitor who was not infrequent least of all at teatime during the same period in portland place though they had little need to talk of her after practically agreeing that they had outlived her to the scene of these conversations and suppressions mrs assingham herself made actually no approach her latest view of her utility seeming to be that it had found in eaton square its most urgent field it was finding there in fact everything and everyone but the prince who mostly just now kept away or who at all events on the interspaced occasions of his calling happened not to encounter the only person from whom he was a little estranged it would have been all prodigious if he had not already with charlottes aid so very considerably lived into itit would have been all indescribably remarkable this fact that with wonderful causes for it so operating on the surface nobody else as yet in the combination seemed estranged from anybody if mrs assingham delighted in maggie she knew by this time how most easily to reach her and if she was unhappy about charlotte she knew by the same reasoning how most probably to miss that vision of her on which affliction would feed it might feed of course on finding her so absent from her homejust as this particular phenomenon of her domestic detachment could be by the anxious mind best studied there fanny was however for her reasons shy of portland place itselfthis was appreciable so that she might well after all have no great light on the question of whether charlottes appearances there were frequent or not any more than on that of the account they might be keeping of the usual solitude since it came to this of the head of that house there was always to cover all ambiguities to constitute a fund of explanation for the divisions of mrs ververs day the circumstance that at the point they had all reached together mrs verver was definitely and by general acclamation in charge of the social relations of the family literally of those of the two households as to her genius for representing which in the great world and in the grand style vivid evidence had more and more accumulated it had been established in the two households at an early stage and with the highest goodhumour that charlotte was a was the social success whereas the princess though kind though punctilious though charming though in fact the dearest little creature in the world and the princess into the bargain was distinctly not would distinctly never be and might as well practically give it up whether through being above it or below it too much outside of it or too much lost in it too unequipped or too indisposed didnt especially matter what sufficed was that the whole thing call it appetite or call it patience the act of representation at large and the daily business of intercourse fell in with charlottes tested facility and not much less visibly with her accommodating her generous view of her domestic use she had come frankly into the connection to do and to be what she could no questions asked and she had taken over accordingly as it stood and in the finest practical spirit the burden of a visitinglist that maggie originally left to herself and left even more to the principino had suffered to get inordinately out of hand  she had in a word not only mounted cheerfully the london treadmillshe had handsomely professed herself for the further comfort of the three others sustained in the effort by a frivolous side if that were not too harsh a name for a pleasant constitutional curiosity there were possibilities of dulness ponderosities of practice arid social sands the bad quartersofanhour that turned up like false pieces in a debased currency of which she made on principle very nearly as light as if she had not been clever enough to distinguish the prince had on this score paid her his compliment soon after her return from her weddingtour in america where by all accounts she had wondrously borne the brunt facing brightly at her husbands side everything that came upand what had come often was beyond words just as precisely with her own interest only at stake she had thrown up the game during the visit paid before her marriage the discussion of the american world the comparison of notes impressions and adventures had been all at hand as a ground of meeting for mrs verver and her husbands soninlaw from the hour of the reunion of the two couples thus it had been in short that charlotte could for her friends appreciation so promptly make her point even using expressions from which he let her see at the hour that he drew amusement of his own what could be more simple than ones going through with everything she had asked when its so plain a part of ones contract ive got so much by my marriagefor she had never for a moment concealed from him how much she had felt it and was finding it that i should deserve no charity if i stinted my return not to do that to give back on the contrary all one can are just ones decency and ones honour and ones virtue these things henceforth if youre interested to know are my rule of life the absolute little gods of my worship the holy images set up on the wall oh yes since im not a brute she had wound up you shall see me as i am which was therefore as he had seen herdealing always from month to month from day to day and from one occasion to the other with the duties of a remunerated office her perfect her brilliant efficiency had doubtless all the while contributed immensely to the pleasant ease in which her husband and her husbands daughter were lapped it had in fact probably done something more than thisit had given them a finer and sweeter view of the possible scope of that ease they had brought her inon the crudest expression of itto do the worldly for them and she had done it with such genius that they had themselves in consequence renounced it even more than they had originally intended in proportion as she did it moreover was she to be relieved of other and humbler doings which minor matters by the properest logic devolved therefore upon maggie in whose chords and whose province they more naturally lay not less naturally by the same token they included the repair at the hands of the latter young woman of every stitch conceivably dropped by charlotte in eaton square this was homely work but that was just what made it maggies bearing in mind dear amerigo who was so much of her own great mundane feather and whom the homeliness in question didnt no doubt quite equally provide forthat would be to balance just in a manner charlottes very most charming function from the moment charlotte could be got adequately to recognise it  well that charlotte might be appraised as at last not ineffectually recognising it was a reflection that during the days with which we are actually engaged completed in the princes breast these others these images and ruminations of his leisure these gropings and fittings of his conscience and his experience that we have attempted to set in order there they bore him company not insufficientlyconsidering in especial his fuller resources in that linewhile he worked outto the last lucidity the principle on which he forbore either to seek fanny out in cadogan place or to perpetrate the error of too marked an assiduity in eaton square this error would be his not availing himself to the utmost of the convenience of any artless theory of his constitution or of charlottes that might prevail there that artless theories could and did prevail was a fact he had ended by accepting under copious evidence as definite and ultimate and it consorted with common prudence with the simplest economy of life not to be wasteful of any odd gleaning to haunt eaton square in fine would be to show that he had not like his brilliant associate a sufficiency of work in the world it was just his having that sufficiency it was just their having it together that so strangely and so blessedly made as they put it to each other everything possible what further propped up the case moreover was that the world by still another beautiful perversity of their chance included portland place without including to anything like the same extent eaton square the latter residence at the same time it must promptly be added did on occasion wake up to opportunity and as giving itself a frolic shake send out a score of invitationsone of which fitful flights precisely had before easter the effect of disturbing a little our young mans measure of his margin maggie with a proper spirit held that her father ought from time to time to give a really considered dinner and mr verver who had as little idea as ever of not meeting expectation was of the harmonious opinion that his wife ought charlottes own judgment was always that they were ideally freethe proof of which would always be she maintained that everyone they feared they might most have alienated by neglect would arrive wreathed with smiles on the merest hint of a belated signal wreathed in smiles all round truly enough these apologetic banquets struck amerigo as being they were frankly touching occasions to him marked in the great london bousculade with a small still grace of their own an investing amenity and humanity everybody came everybody rushed but all succumbed to the soft influence and the brutality of mere multitude of curiosity without tenderness was put off at the foot of the fine staircase with the overcoats and shawls the entertainment offered a few evenings before easter and at which maggie and he were inevitably present as guests was a discharge of obligations not insistently incurred and had thereby possibly all the more the note of this almost arcadian optimism a large bright dull murmurous mildeyed middleaged dinner involving for the most part very bland though very exalted immensely announceable and hierarchically placeable couples and followed without the oppression of a later contingent by a brief instrumental concert over the preparation of which the prince knew maggies anxiety had conferred with charlottes ingenuity and both had supremely revelled as it were in mr ververs solvency  the assinghams were there by prescription though quite at the foot of the social ladder and with the colonels wife in spite of her humility of position the prince was more inwardly occupied than with any other person except charlotte he was occupied with charlotte because in the first place she looked so inordinately handsome and held so high where so much else was mature and sedate the torch of responsive youth and the standard of passive grace and because of the fact that in the second the occasion so far as it referred itself with any confidence of emphasis to a hostess seemed to refer itself preferentially wellmeaningly and perversely to maggie it was not indistinguishable to him when once they were all stationed that his wife too had in perfection her own little character but he wondered how it managed so visibly to simplify itselfand this he knew in spite of any desire she entertainedto the essential air of having overmuch on her mind the felicity and indeed the very conduct and credit of the feast he knew as well the other things of which her appearance was at any timeand in eaton square especiallymade up her resemblance to her father at times so vivid and coming out in the delicate warmth of occasions like the quickened fragrance of a flower her resemblance as he had hit it off for her once in rome in the first flushed days after their engagement to a little dancinggirl at rest ever so light of movement but most often panting gently even a shade compunctiously on a bench her approximation finallyfor it was analogy somehow more than identityto the transmitted images of rather neutral and negative propriety that made up in his long line the average of wifehood and motherhood if the roman matron had been in sufficiency first and last the honour of that line maggie would no doubt at fifty have expanded have solidified to some such dignity even should she suggest a little but a cornelia in miniature a light however broke for him in season and when once it had done so it made him more than ever aware of mrs ververs vaguely yet quite exquisitely contingent participationa mere hinted or tendered discretion in short of mrs ververs indescribable unfathomable relation to the scene her placed condition her natural seat and neighbourhood her intenser presence her quieter smile her fewer jewels were inevitably all as nothing compared with the preoccupation that burned in maggie like a small flame and that had in fact kindled in each of her cheeks a little attesting but fortunately by no means unbecoming spot the party was her fathers party and its greater or smaller success was a question having for her all the importance of his importance so that sympathy created for her a sort of visible suspense under pressure of which she bristled with filial reference with little filial recalls of expression movement tone it was all unmistakable and as pretty as possible if one would and even as funny but it put the pair so together as undivided by the marriage of each that the princess il ny avait pas a diremight sit where she liked she would still always in that house be irremediably maggie verver the prince found himself on this occasion so beset with that perception that its natural complement for him would really have been to wonder if mr verver had produced on people something of the same impression in the recorded cases of his having dined with his daughter  this backward speculation had it begun to play however would have been easily arrested for it was at present to come over amerigo as never before that his remarkable fatherinlaw was the man in the world least equipped with different appearances for different hours he was simple he was a revelation of simplicity and that was the end of him so far as he consisted of an appearance at alla question that might verily for a weakness in it have been argued it amused our young man who was taking his pleasure tonight it will be seen in sundry occult ways it amused him to feel how everything else the master of the house consisted of resources possessions facilities and amiabilities amplified by the social legend depended for conveying the effect of quantity on no personal equation no mere measurable medium quantity was in the air for these good people and mr ververs estimable quality was almost wholly in that pervasion he was meagre and modest and clearbrowed and his eyes if they wandered without fear yet stayed without defiance his shoulders were not broad his chest was not high his complexion was not fresh and the crown of his head was not covered in spite of all of which he looked at the top of his table so nearly like a little boy shyly entertaining in virtue of some imposed rank that he could only be one of the powers the representative of a forcequite as an infant king is the representative of a dynasty in this generalised view of his fatherinlaw intensified tonight but always operative amerigo had now for some time taken refuge the refuge after the reunion of the two households in england had more and more offered itself as the substitute for communities from man to man that by his original calculation might have become possible but that had not really ripened and flowered he met the decent family eyes across the table met them afterwards in the musicroom but only to read in them still what he had learned to read during his first months the time of overanxious initiation a kind of apprehension in which the terms and conditions were finally fixed and absolute this directed regard rested at its ease but it neither lingered nor penetrated and was to the princes fancy much of the same order as any glance directed for due attention from the same quarter to the figure of a cheque received in the course of business and about to be enclosed to a banker it made sure of the amountand just so from time to time the amount of the prince was made sure he was being thus in renewed instalments perpetually paid in he already reposed in the bank as a value but subject in this comfortable way to repeated to infinite endorsement the net result of all of which moreover was that the young man had no wish to see his value diminish he himself after all had not fixed itthe figure was a conception all of mr ververs own certainly however everything must be kept up to it never so much as tonight had the prince felt this he would have been uncomfortable as these quiet expressions passed had the case not been guaranteed for him by the intensity of his accord with charlotte it was impossible that he should not now and again meet charlottes eyes as it was also visible that she too now and again met her husbands for her as well in all his pulses he felt the conveyed impression it put them it kept them together through the vain show of their separation made the two other faces made the whole lapse of the evening the people the lights the flowers the pretended talk the exquisite music a mystic golden bridge between them strongly swaying and sometimes almost vertiginous for that intimacy of which the sovereign law would be the vigilance of care would be never rashly to forget and never consciously to wound                                 xx  the main interest of these hours for us however will have been in the way the prince continued to know during a particular succession of others separated from the evening in eaton square by a short interval a certain persistent aftertaste this was the lingering savour of a cup presented to him by fanny assinghams hand after dinner while the clustered quartette kept their ranged companions in the musicroom moved if one would but conveniently motionless mrs assingham contrived after a couple of pieces to convey to her friend that for her part she was movedby the genius of brahmsbeyond what she could bear so that without apparent deliberation she had presently floated away at the young mans side to such a distance as permitted them to converse without the effect of disdain it was the twenty minutes enjoyed with her during the rest of the concert in the less associated electric glare of one of the empty roomsit was their achieved and as he would have said successful most pleasantly successful talk on one of the sequestered sofas it was this that was substantially to underlie his consciousness of the later occasion the later occasion then mere matter of discussion had formed her ground for desiringin a light undertone into which his quick ear read indeed some nervousness these independent words with him she had sounded covertly but distinctly by the time they were seated together the great question of what it might involve it had come out for him before anything else and so abruptly that this almost needed an explanation then the abruptness itself had appeared to explain which had introduced in turn a slight awkwardness do you know that theyre not after all going to matcham so that if they dontif at least maggie doesntyou wont i suppose go by yourself it was as i say at matcham where the event had placed him it was at matcham during the easter days that it most befell him oddly enough to live over inwardly for its wealth of special significance this passage by which the event had been really a good deal determined he had paid first and last many an english country visit he had learned even from of old to do the english things and to do them all sufficiently in the english way if he didnt always enjoy them madly he enjoyed them at any rate as much to an appearance as the good people who had in the night of time unanimously invented them and who still in the prolonged afternoon of their good faith unanimously even if a trifle automatically practised them yet with it all he had never so much as during such sojourns the trick of a certain detached the amusement of a certain inward critical life the determined need which apparently all participant of returning upon itself of backing noiselessly in far in again and rejoining there as it were that part of his mind that was not engaged at the front his body very constantly was engaged at the frontin shooting in riding in golfing in walking over the fine diagonals of meadowpaths or round the pocketed corners of billiardtables it sufficiently on the whole in fact bore the brunt of bridgeplaying of breakfasting lunching teadrinking dining and of the nightly climax over the bottigliera as he called it of the bristling tray it met finally to the extent of the limited tax on lip on gesture on wit most of the current demands of conversation and expression therefore something of him he often felt at these times was left out it was much more when he was alone or when he was with his own peopleor when he was say with mrs verver and nobody elsethat he moved that he talked that he listened that he felt as a congruous whole  english society as he would have said cut him accordingly in two and he reminded himself often in his relations with it of a man possessed of a shining star a decoration an order of some sort something so ornamental as to make his identity not complete ideally without it yet who finding no other such object generally worn should be perpetually and the least bit ruefully unpinning it from his breast to transfer it to his pocket the princes shining star may no doubt having been nothing more precious than his private subtlety but whatever the object was he just now fingered it a good deal out of sight amounting as it mainly did for him to a restless play of memory and a fine embroidery of thought something had rather momentously occurred in eaton square during his enjoyed minutes with his old friend his present perspective made definitely clear to him that she had plumped out for him her first little lie that took onand he could scarce have said whya sharpness of importance she had never lied to him beforeif only because it had never come up for her properly intelligibly morally that she must as soon as she had put to him the question of what he would doby which she meant of what charlotte would also do in that event of maggies and mr ververs not embracing the proposal they had appeared for a day or two resignedly to entertain as soon as she had betrayed her curiosity as to the line the other pair so left to themselves might take a desire to avoid the appearance of at all too directly prying had become marked in her betrayed by the solicitude of which she had already three weeks before given him a view she had been obliged on a second thought to name intelligibly a reason for her appeal while the prince on his side had had not without mercy his glimpse of her momentarily groping for one and yet remaining unprovided not without mercy because absolutely he had on the spot in his friendliness invented one for her use presenting it to her with a look no more significant than if he had picked up to hand back to her a dropped flower you ask if im likely also to back out then because it may make a difference in what you and the colonel decidehe had gone as far as that for her fairly inviting her to assent though not having had his impression from any indication offered him by charlotte that the assinghams were really in question for the large matcham party the wonderful thing after this was that the active couple had in the interval managed to inscribe themselves on the golden roll an exertion of a sort that to do her justice he had never before observed fanny to make this last passage of the chapter but proved after all with what success she could work when she would  once launched himself at any rate as he had been directed by all the terms of the intercourse between portland place and eaton square once steeped at matcham in the enjoyment of a splendid hospitality he found everything for his interpretation for his convenience fall easily enough into place and all the more that mrs verver was at hand to exchange ideas and impressions with the great house was full of people of possible new combinations of the quickened play of possible propinquity and no appearance of course was less to be cultivated than that of his having sought an opportunity to foregather with his friend at a safe distance from their respective sposi there was a happy boldness at the best in their mingling thus each unaccompanied in the same sustained sociabilityjust exactly a touch of that eccentricity of associated freedom which sat so lightly on the imagination of the relatives left behind they were exposed as much as one would to its being pronounced funny that they should at such a rate go about togetherthough on the other hand this consideration drew relief from the fact that in their high conditions and with the easy tradition the almost inspiring allowances of the house in question no individual line however freely marked was pronounced anything more than funny both our friends felt afresh as they had felt before the convenience of a society so placed that it had only its own sensibility to considerlooking as it did well over the heads of all lower growths and that moreover treated its own sensibility quite as the easiest friendliest most informal and domesticated party to the general alliance what anyone thought of anyone elseabove all of anyone else with anyone elsewas a matter incurring in these lulls so little awkward formulation that hovering judgment the spirit with the scales might perfectly have been imaged there as some rather snubbed and subdued but quite trained and tactful poor relation of equal of the properest lineage only of aspect a little dingy doubtless from too limited a change of dress for whose tacit and abstemious presence never betrayed by a rattle of her rusty machine a room in the attic and a plate at the sidetable were decently usual it was amusing in such lightness of air that the prince should again present himself only to speak for the princess so unfortunately unable again to leave home and that mrs verver should as regularly figure as an embodied a beautifully deprecating apology for her husband who was all geniality and humility among his own treasures but as to whom the legend had grown up that he couldnt bear with the height of his standards and the tone of the company in the way of sofas and cabinets habitually kept by him the irritation and depression to which promiscuous visiting even at pompous houses had been found to expose him that was all right the noted working harmony of the clever soninlaw and the charming stepmother so long as the relation was for the effect in question maintained at the proper point between sufficiency and excess  what with the noble fairness of the place meanwhile the generous mood of the sunny gusty lusty english april all panting and heaving with impatience or kicking and crying even at moments like some infant hercules who wouldnt be dressed what with these things and the bravery of youth and beauty the insolence of fortune and appetite so diffused among his fellowguests that the poor assinghams in their comparatively marked maturity and their comparatively small splendour were the only approach to a false note in the concert the stir of the air was such for going in a degree to ones head that as a mere matter of exposure almost grotesque in its flagrancy his situation resembled some elaborate practical joke carried out at his expense every voice in the great bright house was a call to the ingenuities and impunities of pleasure every echo was a defiance of difficulty doubt or danger every aspect of the picture a glowing plea for the immediate and as with plenty more to come was another phase of the spell for a world so constituted was governed by a spell that of the smile of the gods and the favour of the powers the only handsome the only gallant in fact the only intelligent acceptance of which was a faith in its guarantees and a high spirit for its chances its demandto that the thing came backwas above all for courage and goodhumour and the value of this as a general assurance that is for seeing one through at the worsthad not even in the easiest hours of his old roman life struck the prince so convincingly his old roman life had had more poetry no doubt but as he looked back upon it now it seemed to hang in the air of mere iridescent horizons to have been loose and vague and thin with large languorous unaccountable blanks the present order as it spread about him had somehow the ground under its feet and a trumpet in its ears and a bottomless bag of solid shining british sovereignswhich was much to the pointin its hand courage and goodhumour therefore were the breath of the day though for ourselves at least it would have been also much to the point that with amerigo really the innermost effect of all this perceptive ease was perhaps a strange final irritation he compared the lucid result with the extraordinary substitute for perception that presided in the bosom of his wife at so contented a view of his conduct and coursea state of mind that was positively like a vicarious good conscience cultivated ingeniously on his behalf a perversity of pressure innocently persisted in and this wonder of irony became on occasion too intense to be kept wholly to himself it wasnt that at matcham anything particular anything monstrous anything that had to be noticed permitted itself as they said to happen there were only odd moments when the breath of the day as it has been called struck him so full in the face that he broke out with all the hilarity of what indeed would they have made of it they were of course maggie and her father mopingso far as they ever consented to mope in monotonous eaton square but placid too in the belief that they knew beautifully what their expert companions were in for they knew it might have appeared in these lights absolutely nothing on earth worth speaking of whether beautifully or cynically and they would perhaps sometimes be a little less trying if they would only once for all peacefully admit that knowledge wasnt one of their needs and that they were in fact constitutionally inaccessible to it they were good children bless their hearts and the children of good children so that verily the principino himself as less consistently of that descent might figure to the fancy as the ripest genius of the trio  the difficulty was for the nerves of daily intercourse with maggie in particular that her imagination was clearly never ruffled by the sense of any anomaly the great anomaly would have been that her husband or even that her fathers wife should prove to have been made for the long run after the pattern set from so far back to the ververs if one was so made one had certainly no business on any terms at matcham whereas if one wasnt one had no business there on the particular termsterms of conformity with the principles of eaton squareunder which one had been so absurdly dedicated deep at the heart of that resurgent unrest in our young man which we have had to content ourselves with calling his irritationdeep in the bosom of this falsity of position glowed the red spark of his inextinguishable sense of a higher and braver propriety there were situations that were ridiculous but that one couldnt yet help as for instance when ones wife chose in the most usual way to make one so precisely here however was the difference it had taken poor maggie to invent a way so extremely unusualyet to which none the less it would be too absurd that he should merely lend himself being thrust systematically with another woman and a woman one happened by the same token exceedingly to like and being so thrust that the theory of it seemed to publish one as idiotic or incapablethis was a predicament of which the dignity depended all on ones own handling what was supremely grotesque in fact was the essential opposition of theoriesas if a galantuomo as he at least constitutionally conceived galantuomini could do anything but blush to go about at such a rate with such a person as mrs verver in a state of childlike innocence the state of our primitive parents before the fall the grotesque theory as he would have called it was perhaps an odd one to resent with violence and he did italso as a man of the worldall merciful justice but assuredly none the less there was but one way really to mark and for his companion as much as for himself the commiseration in which they held it adequate comment on it could only be private but it could also at least be active and of rich and effectual comment charlotte and he were fortunately alike capable wasnt this consensus literally their only way not to be ungracious it was positively as if the measure of their escape from that danger were given by the growth between them during their auspicious visit of an exquisite sense of complicity                                  xxi  he found himself therefore saying with gaiety even to fanny assingham for their common concerned glance at eaton square the glance that was so markedly never as it might have been a glance at portland place what would our cari sposi have made of it here what would they you know reallywhich overflow would have been reckless if already and surprisingly perhaps even to himself he had not got used to thinking of this friend as a person in whom the element of protest had of late been unmistakably allayed he exposed himself of course to her replying ah if it would have been so bad for them how can it be so good for youbut quite apart from the small sense the question would have had at the best she appeared already to unite with him in confidence and cheer he had his view as wellor at least a partial oneof the inner spring of this present comparative humility which was all consistent with the retraction he had practically seen her make after mr ververs last dinner without diplomatising to do so with no effort to square her none to bribe her to an attitude for which he would have had no use in her if it were not sincere he yet felt how he both held her and moved her by the felicity of his taking pity all instinctively on her just discernible depression by just so much as he guessed that she felt herself as the slang was out of it out of the crystal current and the expensive picture by just so much had his friendship charmingly made up to her from hour to hour for the penalties as they might have been grossly called of her mistake her mistake had only been after all in her wanting to seem to him straight she had let herself in for beingas she had made haste for that matter during the very first halfhour at tea to proclaim herselfthe sole and single frump of the party the scale of everything was so different that all her minor values her quainter graces her little local authority her humour and her wardrobe alike for which it was enough elsewhere among her bons amis that they were hers dear fanny assinghamsthese matters and others would be all now as nought five minutes had sufficed to give her the fatal pitch in cadogan place she could always at the worst be picturesquefor she habitually spoke of herself as local to sloane street whereas at matcham she should never be anything but horrible and it all would have come the disaster from the real refinement in her of the spirit of friendship to prove to him that she wasnt really watching himground for which would have been too terribly graveshe had followed him in his pursuit of pleasure so she might precisely mark her detachment this was handsome trouble for her to takethe prince could see it all it wasnt a shade of interference that a goodnatured man would visit on her so he didnt even say when she told him how frumpy she knew herself how frumpy her very maid odiously going back on her rubbed it into her night and morning with unsealed eyes and lips that she now knew herhe didnt then say ah see what youve done isnt it rather your own fault he behaved differently altogether eminently distinguished himselffor she told him she had never seen him so universally distinguishedhe yet distinguished her in her obscurity or in what was worse her objective absurdity and frankly invested her with her absolute value surrounded her with all the importance of her wit that wit as discriminated from stature and complexion a sense for bridge and a credit for pearls could have importance was meanwhile but dimly perceived at matcham so that his niceness to hershe called it only niceness but it brought tears into her eyeshad the greatness of a general as well as of a special demonstration  she understands he said as a comment on all this to mrs ververshe understands all she needs to understand she has taken her time but she has at last made it out for herself she sees how all we can desire is to give them the life they prefer to surround them with the peace and quiet and above all with the sense of security most favourable to it she cant of course very well put it to us that we have so far as she is concerned but to make the best of our circumstances she cant say in so many words dont think of me for i too must make the best of mine arrange as you can only and live as you must i dont get quite that from her any more than i ask for it but her tone and her whole manner mean nothing at all unless they mean that she trusts us to take as watchful to take as artful to take as tender care in our way as she so anxiously takes in hers so that sheswell the prince wound up what you may call practically all right charlotte in fact however to help out his confidence didnt call it anything return as he might to the lucidity the importance or whatever it was of this lesson she gave him no aid toward reading it aloud she let him two or three times over spell it out for himself only on the eve of their visits end was she for once clear or direct in response they had found a minute together in the great hall of the house during the halfhour before dinner this easiest of chances they had already a couple of times arrived at by waiting persistently till the last other loiterers had gone to dress and by being prepared themselves to dress so expeditiously that they might a little later on be among the first to appear in festal array the hall then was empty before the army of rearranging cushionpatting housemaids were marshalled in and there was a place by the forsaken fire at one end where they might imitate with art the unpremeditated above all here for the snatched instants they could breathe so near to each other that the interval was almost engulfed in it and the intensity both of the union and the caution became a workable substitute for contact they had prolongations of instants that counted as visions of bliss they had slow approximations that counted as long caresses the quality of these passages in truth made the spoken word and especially the spoken word about other people fall below them so that our young womans tone had even now a certain dryness its very good of her my dear to trust us but what else can she do  why whatever people do when they dont trust let one see they dont  but let whom see  well let me say to begin with  and should you mind that  he had a slight show of surprise shouldnt you  her letting you see no said charlotte the only thing i can imagine myself minding is what you yourself if you dont look out may let her see to which she added you may let her see you know that youre afraid  im only afraid of you a little at moments he presently returned but i shant let fanny see that  it was clear however that neither the limits nor the extent of mrs assinghams vision were now a real concern to her and she gave expression to this as she had not even yet done what in the world can she do against us theres not a word that she can breathe shes helpless she cant speak she would be herself the first to be dished by it and then as he seemed slow to follow it all comes back to her it all began with her everything from the first she introduced you to maggie she made your marriage  the prince might have had his moment of demur but at this after a little as with a smile dim but deep he came on maynt she also be said a good deal to have made yours that was intended i think wasnt it for a kind of rectification  charlotte on her side for an instant hesitated then she was prompter still i dont mean there was anything to rectify everything was as it had to be and im not speaking of how she may have been concerned for you and me im speaking of how she took in her way each time their lives in hand and how therefore that ties her up today she cant go to them and say its very awkward of course you poor dear things but i was frivolously mistaken  he took it in still with his long look at her all the more that she wasnt she was right everythings right he went on and everything will stay so  then thats all i say  but he worked it out for the deeper satisfaction even to superfluous lucidity were happy and theyre happy what more does the position admit of what more need fanny assingham want  ah my dear said charlotte its not i who say that she need want anything i only say that shes fixed that she must stand exactly where everything has by her own act placed her its you who have seemed haunted with the possibility for her of some injurious alternative something or other we must be prepared for and she had with her high reasoning a strange cold smile we are preparedfor anything for everything and as we are practically so she must take us shes condemned to consistency shes doomed poor thing to a genial optimism that luckily for her however is very much the law of her nature she was born to soothe and to smooth now then therefore mrs verver gently laughed she has the chance of her life  so that her present professions may even at the best not be sinceremay be but a mask for doubts and fears and for gaining time  the prince had looked with the question as if this again could trouble him and it determined in his companion a slight impatience you keep talking about such things as if they were our affair at all i feel at any rate that ive nothing to do with her doubts and fears or with anything she may feel she must arrange all that for herself its enough for me that shell always be of necessity much more afraid for herself really either to see or to speak than we should be to have her do it even if we were the idiots and cowards we arent and charlottes face with these wordsto the mitigation of the slightly hard ring there might otherwise have been in them fairly lightened softened shone out it reflected as really never yet the rare felicity of their luck it made her look for the moment as if she had actually pronounced that word of unpermitted presumptionso apt is the countenance as with a finer consciousness than the tongue to betray a sense of this particular lapse she might indeed the next instant have seen her friend wince in advance at her use of a word that was already on her lips for it was still unmistakable with him that there were things he could prize forms of fortune he could cherish without at all proportionately liking their names had all this however been even completely present to his companion what other term could she have applied to the strongest and simplest of her ideas but the one that exactly fitted it she applied it then though her own instinct moved her at the same time to pay her tribute to the good taste from which they hadnt heretofore by a hairs breadth deviated if it didnt sound so vulgar i should say that werefatally as it weresafe pardon the low expressionsince its what we happen to be were so because they are and theyre so because they cant be anything else from the moment that having originally intervened for them she wouldnt now be able to bear herself if she didnt keep them so thats the way shes inevitably with us said charlotte over her smile we hang essentially together  well the prince candidly allowed she did bring it home to him every way it worked out yes i see we hang essentially together  his friend had a shruga shrug that had a grace cosa volete the effect beautifully nobly was more than roman ah beyond doubt its a case  he stood looking at her its a case there cant he said have been many  perhaps never never never any other that she smiled i confess i should like to think only ours  only oursmost probably speriamo to which as after hushed connections he presently added poor fanny but charlotte had already with a start and a warning hand turned from a glance at the clock she sailed away to dress while he watched her reach the staircase his eyes followed her till with a simple swift look round at him she vanished something in the sight however appeared to have renewed the spring of his last exclamation which he breathed again upon the air poor poor fanny  it was to prove however on the morrow quite consistent with the spirit of these words that the party at matcham breaking up and multitudinously dispersing he should be able to meet the question of the social side of the process of repatriation with due presence of mind it was impossible for reasons that he should travel to town with the assinghams it was impossible for the same reasons that he should travel to town save in the conditions that he had for the last twentyfour hours been privately and it might have been said profoundly thinking out the result of his thought was already precious to him and this put at his service he sufficiently believed the right tone for disposing of his elder friends suggestion an assumption in fact equally full and mild that he and charlotte would conveniently take the same train and occupy the same compartment as the colonel and herself the extension of the idea to mrs verver had been precisely a part of mrs assinghams mildness and nothing could better have characterised her sense for social shades than her easy perception that the gentleman from portland place and the lady from eaton square might now confess quite without indiscretion to simultaneity of movement she had made for the four days no direct appeal to the latter personage but the prince was accidental witness of her taking a fresh start at the moment the company were about to scatter for the last night of their stay there had been at this climax the usual preparatory talk about hours and combinations in the midst of which poor fanny gently approached mrs verver she said you and the prince lovequite apparently without blinking she took for granted their public withdrawal together she remarked that she and bob were alike ready in the interest of sociability to take any train that would make them all one party i feel really as if all this time i had seen nothing of youthat gave an added grace to the candour of the dear things approach but just then it was on the other hand that the young man found himself borrow most effectively the secret of the right tone for doing as he preferred his preference had during the evening not failed of occasion to press him with mute insistences practically without words without any sort of straight telegraphy it had arrived at a felt identity with charlottes own she spoke all for their friend while she answered their friends question but she none the less signalled to him as definitely as if she had fluttered a white handkerchief from a window its awfully sweet of you darlingour going together would be charming but you mustnt mind usyou must suit yourselves weve settled amerigo and i to stay over till after luncheon  amerigo with the chink of this gold in his ear turned straight away so as not to be instantly appealed to and for the very emotion of the wonder furthermore of what divination may achieve when winged by a community of passion charlotte had uttered the exact plea that he had been keeping ready for the same foreseen necessity and had uttered it simply as a consequence of their deepening unexpressed need of each other and without the passing between them of a word he hadnt god knew to take it from herhe was too conscious of what he wanted but the lesson for him was in the straight clear tone that charlotte could thus distil in the perfect felicity of her adding no explanation no touch for plausibility that she wasnt strictly obliged to add and in the truly superior way in which women so situated express and distinguish themselves she had answered mrs assingham quite adequately she had not spoiled it by a reason a scrap larger than the smallest that would serve and she had above all thrown off for his stretched but covered attention an image that flashed like a mirror played at the face of the sun the measure of everything to all his sense at these moments was in itthe measure especially of the thought that had been growing with him a positive obsession and that began to throb as never yet under this brush of her having by perfect parity of imagination the match for it his whole consciousness had by this time begun almost to ache with a truth of an exquisite order at the glow of which she too had so unmistakably then been warming herselfthe truth that the occasion constituted by the last few days couldnt possibly save by some poverty of their own refuse them some still other and still greater beauty it had already told them with an hourly voice that it had a meaninga meaning that their associated sense was to drain even as thirsty lips after the plough through the sands and the sight afar of the palmcluster might drink in at last the promised well in the desert there had been beauty day after day and there had been for the spiritual lips something of the pervasive taste of it yet it was all none the less as if their response had remained below their fortune how to bring it by some brave free lift up to the same height was the idea with which behind and beneath everything he was restlessly occupied and in the exploration of which as in that of the sunchequered greenwood of romance his spirit thus at the opening of a vista met hers they were already from that moment so handinhand in the place that he found himself making use five minutes later of exactly the same tone as charlottes for telling mrs assingham that he was likewise in the matter of the return to london sorry for what mightnt be  this had become of a sudden the simplest thing in the world the sense of which moreover seemed really to amount to a portent that he should feel forevermore on the general head conveniently at his ease with her he went in fact a step further than charlotteput the latter forward as creating his necessity she was staying over luncheon to oblige their hostessas a consequence of which he must also stay to see her decently home he must deliver her safe and sound he felt in eaton square regret as he might too the difference made by this obligation he frankly didnt mind inasmuch as over and above the pleasure itself his scruple would certainly gratify both mr verver and maggie they never yet had absolutely and entirely learned he even found deliberation to intimate how little he really neglected the firstas it seemed nowadays quite to have become of his domestic duties therefore he still constantly felt how little he must remit his effort to make them remark it to which he added with equal lucidity that they would return in time for dinner and if he didnt as a last word subjoin that it would be lovely of fanny to find on her own return a moment to go to eaton square and report them as struggling bravely on this was not because the impulse down to the very name for the amiable act altogether failed to rise his inward assurance his general plan had at moments where she was concerned its drops of continuity and nothing would less have pleased him than that she should suspect in him however tempted any element of conscious cheek but he was alwaysthat was really the upshotcultivating thanklessly the considerate and the delicate it was a long lesson this unlearning with people of english race all the little superstitions that accompany friendship mrs assingham herself was the first to say that she would unfailingly report she brought it out in fact he thought quite wonderfullyhaving attained the summit of the wonderful during the brief interval that had separated her appeal to charlotte from this passage with himself she had taken the five minutes obviously amid the rest of the talk and the movement to retire into her tent for meditationwhich showed among several things the impression charlotte had made on her it was from the tent she emerged as with arms refurbished though who indeed could say if the manner in which she now met him spoke most really of the glitter of battle or of the white waver of the flag of truce the parley was short either way the gallantry of her offer was all sufficient  ill go to our friends thenill ask for luncheon ill tell them when to expect you  that will be charming say were all right  all rightprecisely i cant say more mrs assingham smiled  no doubt but he considered as for the possible importance of it neither can you by what i seem to feel say less  oh i wont say less fanny laughed with which the next moment she had turned away but they had it again not less bravely on the morrow after breakfast in the thick of the advancing carriages and the exchange of farewells i think ill send home my maid from euston she was then prepared to amend and go to eaton square straight so you can be easy  oh i think were easy the prince returned be sure to say at any rate that were bearing up  youre bearing upgood and charlotte returns to dinner  to dinner were not likely i think to make another night away  well then i wish you at least a pleasant day  oh he laughed as they separated we shall do our best for itafter which in due course with the announcement of their conveyance the assinghams rolled off                               xxii  it was quite for the prince after this as if the view had further cleared so that the halfhour during which he strolled on the terrace and smokedthe day being lovelyoverflowed with the plenitude of its particular quality its general brightness was composed doubtless of many elements but what shone out of it as if the whole place and time had been a great picture from the hand of genius presented to him as a prime ornament for his collection and all varnished and framed to hang upwhat marked it especially for the highest appreciation was his extraordinarily unchallenged his absolutely appointed and enhanced possession of it poor fanny assinghams challenge amounted to nothing one of the things he thought of while he leaned on the old marble balustradeso like others that he knew in still more noblyterraced italywas that she was squared allconveniently even to herself and that rumbling toward london with this contentment she had become an image irrelevant to the scene it further passed across him as his imagination was for reasons during the time unprecedentedly activethat he had after all gained more from women than he had ever lost by them there appeared so more and more on those mystic books that are kept in connection with such commerce even by men of the loosest business habits a balance in his favour that he could pretty well as a rule take for granted what were they doing at this very moment wonderful creatures but combine and conspire for his advantagefrom maggie herself most wonderful in her way of all to his hostess of the present hour into whose head it had so inevitably come to keep charlotte on for reasons of her own and who had asked in this benevolent spirit why in the world if not obliged without plausibility to hurry her husbands soninlaw should not wait over in her company he would at least see lady castledean had said that nothing dreadful should happen to her either while still there or during the exposure of the run to town and for that matter if they exceeded a little their license it would positively help them to have done so together each of them would in this way at home have the other comfortably to blame all of which besides in lady castledean as in maggie in fanny assingham as in charlotte herself was working for him without provocation or pressure by the mere play of some vague sense on their partdefinite and conscious at the most only in charlottethat he was not as a nature as a character as a gentleman in fine below his remarkable fortune  but there were more things before him than even these things that melted together almost indistinguishably to feed his sense of beauty if the outlook was in every way spaciousand the towers of three cathedrals in different counties as had been pointed out to him gleamed discernibly like dim silver in the rich sameness of tonedidnt he somehow the more feel it so because precisely lady castledean had kept over a man of her own and that this offered a certain sweet intelligibility as the note of the day it made everything fit above all it diverted him to the extent of keeping up while he lingered and waited his meditative smile she had detained charlotte because she wished to detain mr blint and she couldnt detain mr blint disposed though he clearly was to oblige her without spreading over the act some ampler drapery castledean had gone up to london the place was all her own she had had a fancy for a quiet morning with mr blint a sleek civil accomplished young mandistinctly younger than her ladyshipwho played and sang delightfully played even bridge and sang the englishcomic as well as the frenchtragic and the presencewhich really meant the absenceof a couple of other friends if they were happily chosen would make everything all right the prince had the sense all goodhumouredly of being happily chosen and it was not spoiled for him even by another sense that followed in its train and with which during his life in england he had more than once had reflectively to deal the state of being reminded how after all as an outsider a foreigner and even as a mere representative husband and soninlaw he was so irrelevant to the working of affairs that he could be bent on occasion to uses comparatively trivial no other of her guests would have been thus convenient for their hostess affairs of whatever sorts had claimed by early trains every active easy smoothlyworking man each in his way a lubricated item of the great social political administrative engrenageclaimed most of all castledean himself who was so very oddly given the personage and the type rather a large item if he on the other hand had an affair it was not of that order it was of the order verily that he had been reduced to as a not quite glorious substitute  it marked however the feeling of the hour with him that this vision of being reduced interfered not at all with the measure of his actual ease it kept before him again at moments the so familiar fact of his sacrificesdown to the idea of the very relinquishment for his wifes convenience of his real situation in the world with the consequence thus that he was in the last analysis among all these so often inferior people practically held cheap and made light of but though all this was sensible enough there was a spirit in him that could rise above it a spirit that positively played with the facts with all of them from that of the droll ambiguity of english relations to that of his having in mind something quite beautiful and independent and harmonious something wholly his own he couldnt somehow take mr blint seriouslyhe was much more an outsider by the larger scale even than a roman prince who consented to be in abeyance yet it was past finding out either how such a woman as lady castledean could take himsince this question but sank for him again into the fathomless depths of english equivocation he knew them all as was said well he had lived with them stayed with them dined hunted shot and done various other things with them but the number of questions about them he couldnt have answered had much rather grown than shrunken so that experience struck him for the most part as having left in him but one residual impression they didnt like les situations nettesthat was all he was very sure of they wouldnt have them at any price it had been their national genius and their national success to avoid them at every point they called it themselves with complacency their wonderful spirit of compromisethe very influence of which actually so hung about him here from moment to moment that the earth and the air the light and the colour the fields and the hills and the sky the bluegreen counties and the cold cathedrals owed to it every accent of their tone verily as one had to feel in presence of such a picture it had succeeded it had made up to now for that seated solidity in the rich seamist on which the garish the supposedly envious peoples have ever cooled their eyes but it was at the same time precisely why even much initiation left one at given moments so puzzled as to the element of staleness in all the freshness and of freshness in all the staleness of innocence in the guilt and of guilt in the innocence there were other marble terraces sweeping more purple prospects on which he would have known what to think and would have enjoyed thereby at least the small intellectual fillip of a discerned relation between a given appearance and a taken meaning the inquiring mind in these present conditions might it was true be more sharply challenged but the result of its attention and its ingenuity it had unluckily learned to know was too often to be confronted with a mere dead wall a lapse of logic a confirmed bewilderment and moreover above all nothing mattered in the relation of the enclosing scene to his own consciousness but its very most direct bearings  lady castledeans dream of mr blint for the morning was doubtless already with all the spacious harmonies re established taking the form of going over something with him at the piano in one of the numerous smaller rooms that were consecrated to the less gregarious uses what she had wished had been effectedher convenience had been assured this made him however wonder the more where charlotte wassince he didnt at all suppose her to be making a tactless third which would be to have accepted mere spectatorship in the duet of their companions the upshot of everything for him alike of the less and of the more was that the exquisite day bloomed there like a large fragrant flower that he had only to gather but it was to charlotte he wished to make the offering and as he moved along the terrace which rendered visible parts of two sides of the house he looked up at all the windows that were open to the april morning and wondered which of them would represent his friends room it befell thus that his question after no long time was answered he saw charlotte appear above as if she had been called by the pausing of his feet on the flags she had come to the sill on which she leaned to look down and she remained there a minute smiling at him he had been immediately struck with her wearing a hat and a jacketwhich conduced to her appearance of readiness not so much to join him with a beautiful uncovered head and a parasol where he stood as to take with him some larger step altogether the larger step had been since the evening before intensely in his own mind though he had not fully thought out even yet the slightly difficult detail of it but he had had no chance such as he needed to speak the definite word to her and the face she now showed affected him accordingly as a notice that she had wonderfully guessed it for herself they had these identities of impulsethey had had them repeatedly before and if such unarranged but unerring encounters gave the measure of the degree in which people were in the common phrase meant for each other no union in the world had ever been more sweetened with rightness what in fact most often happened was that her rightness went as who should say even further than his own they were conscious of the same necessity at the same moment only it was she as a general thing who most clearly saw her way to it something in her long look at him now out of the old grey window something in the very poise of her hat the colour of her necktie the prolonged stillness of her smile touched into sudden light for him all the wealth of the fact that he could count on her he had his hand there to pluck it on the open bloom of the day but what did the bright minute mean but that her answering hand was already intelligently out so therefore while the minute lasted it passed between them that their cup was full which cup their very eyes holding it fast carried and steadied and began as they tasted it to praise he broke however after a moment the silence  it only wants a moon a mandolin and a little danger to be a serenade  ah then she lightly called down let it at least have this with which she detached a rich white rosebud from its company with another in the front of her dress and flung it down to him he caught it in its fall fixing her again after she had watched him place it in his buttonhole come down quickly he said in an italian not loud but deep  vengo vengo she as clearly but more lightly tossed out and she had left him the next minute to wait for her  he came along the terrace again with pauses during which his eyes rested as they had already often done on the brave darker wash of faraway watercolour that represented the most distant of the cathedral towns this place with its great church and its high accessibility its towers that distinguishably signalled its english history its appealing type its acknowledged interest this place had sounded its name to him half the night through and its name had become but another name the pronounceable and convenient one for that supreme sense of things which now throbbed within him he had kept saying to himself gloucester gloucester gloucester quite as if the sharpest meaning of all the years just passed were intensely expressed in it that meaning was really that his situation remained quite sublimely consistent with itself and that they absolutely he and charlotte stood there together in the very lustre of this truth every present circumstance helped to proclaim it it was blown into their faces as by the lips of the morning he knew why from the first of his marriage he had tried with such patience for such conformity he knew why he had given up so much and bored himself so much he knew why he at any rate had gone in on the basis of all forms on the basis of his having in a manner sold himself for a situation nette it had all been just in order that hiswell what on earth should he call it but his freedomshould at present be as perfect and rounded and lustrous as some huge precious pearl he hadnt struggled nor snatched he was taking but what had been given him the pearl dropped itself with its exquisite quality and rarity straight into his hand here precisely it was incarnate its size and its value grew as mrs verver appeared afar off in one of the smaller doorways she came toward him in silence while he moved to meet her the great scale of this particular front at matcham multiplied thus in the golden morning the stages of their meeting and the successions of their consciousness it wasnt till she had come quite close that he produced for her his gloucester gloucester gloucester and his look at it over there  she knew just where to look yesisnt it one of the best there are cloisters or towers or some thing and her eyes which though her lips smiled were almost grave with their depths of acceptance came back to him or the tomb of some old king  we must see the old king we must do the cathedral he said we must know all about it if we could but take he exhaled the full opportunity and then while for all they seemed to give him he sounded again her eyes i feel the day like a great gold cup that we must somehow drain together  i feel it as you always make me feel everything just as you do so that i know ten miles off how you feel but do you remember she asked apropos of great gold cups the beautiful one the real one that i offered you so long ago and that you wouldnt have just before your marriageshe brought it back to him the gilded crystal bowl in the little bloomsbury shop  oh yesbut it took with a slight surprise on the princes part some small recollecting the treacherous cracked thing you wanted to palm off on me and the little swindling jew who understood italian and who backed you up but i feel this an occasion he immediately added and i hope you dont mean he smiled that as an occasion its also cracked  they spoke naturally more low than loud overlooked as they were though at a respectful distance by tiers of windows but it made each find in the others voice a taste as of something slowly and deeply absorbed dont you think too much of cracks and arent you too afraid of them i risk the cracks said charlotte and ive often recalled the bowl and the little swindling jew wondering if theyve parted company he made she said a great impression on me  well you also no doubt made a great impression on him and i dare say that if you were to go back to him youd find he has been keeping that treasure for you but as to cracks the prince went onwhat did you tell me the other day you prettily call them in englishrifts within the luterisk them as much as you like for yourself but dont risk them for me he spoke it in all the gaiety of his just barelytremulous serenity i go as you know by my superstitions and thats why he said i know where we are theyre every one today on our side  resting on the parapet toward the great view she was silent a little and he saw the next moment that her eyes were closed i go but by one thing her hand was on the sunwarmed stone so that turned as they were away from the house he put his own upon it and covered it i go by you she said i go by you  so they remained a moment till he spoke again with a gesture that matched what is really our great necessity you know is to go by my watch its already elevenhe had looked at the time so that if we stop here to luncheon what becomes of our afternoon  to this charlottes eyes opened straight theres not the slightest need of our stopping here to luncheon dont you see she asked how im ready he had taken it in but there was always more and more of her you mean youve arranged  its easy to arrange my maid goes up with my things youve only to speak to your man about yours and they can go together  you mean we can leave at once  she let him have it all one of the carriages about which i spoke will already have come back for us if your superstitions are on our side she smiled so my arrangements are and ill back my support against yours  then you had thought he wondered about gloucester  she hesitatedbut it was only her way i thought you would think we have thank goodness these harmonies they are food for superstition if you like its beautiful she went on that it should be gloucester gloster gloster as you say making it sound like an old song however im sure gloster gloster will be charming she still added we shall be able easily to lunch there and with our luggage and our servants off our hands we shall have at least three or four hours we can wire she wound up from there  ever so quietly she had brought it as she had thought it all out and it had to be as covertly that he let his appreciation expand then lady castledean  doesnt dream of our staying  he took it but thinking yet then what does she dream  of mr blint poor dear of mr blint only her smile for him for the prince himselfwas free have i positively to tell you that she doesnt want us she only wanted us for the othersto show she wasnt left alone with him now that thats done and that theyve all gone she of course knows for herself  knows the prince vaguely echoed  why that we like cathedrals that we inevitably stop to see them or go round to take them in whenever weve a chance that its what our respective families quite expect of us and would be disappointed for us to fail of this as forestieri mrs verver pursued would be our pullif our pull werent indeed so great all round  he could only keep his eyes on her and have you made out the very train  the very one paddingtonthe 650 in that gives us oceans we can dine at the usual hour at home and as maggie will of course be in eaton square i hereby invite you  for a while he still but looked at her it was a minute before he spoke thank you very much with pleasure to which he in a moment added but the train for gloucester  a local one1122 with several stops but doing it a good deal i forget how much within the hour so that weve time only she said we must employ our time  he roused himself as from the mere momentary spell of her he looked again at his watch while they moved back to the door through which she had advanced but he had also again questions and stopsall as for the mystery and the charm you looked it upwithout my having asked you  ah my dear she laughed ive seen you with bradshaw it takes anglosaxon blood  blood he echoed youve that of every race it kept her before him youre terrible  well he could put it as he liked i know the name of the inn  what is it then  there are twoyoull see but ive chosen the right one and i think i remember the tomb she smiled  oh the tomb any tomb would do for him but i mean i had been keeping my idea so cleverly for you while there you already were with it  you had been keeping it for me as much as you like but how do you make out she asked that you were keeping it from me  i dontnow how shall i ever keep anythingsome day when i shall wish to  ah for things i maynt want to know i promise you shall find me stupid they had reached their door where she herself paused to explain these days yesterday last night this morning ive wanted everything  well it was all right you shall have everything                                 xxiii  fanny on her arrival in town carried out her second idea despatching the colonel to his club for luncheon and packing her maid into a cab for cadogan place with the variety of their effects the result of this for each of the pair was a state of occupation so unbroken that the day practically passed without fresh contact between them they dined out together but it was both in going to their dinner and in coming back that they appeared on either side to have least to communicate fanny was wrapped in her thoughts still more closely than in the lemon coloured mantle that protected her bare shoulders and her husband with her silence to deal with showed himself not less disposed than usual when so challenged to hold up as he would have said his end of it they had in general in these days longer pauses and more abrupt transitions in one of which latter they found themselves for a climax launched at midnight mrs assingham rather wearily housed again ascended to the first floor there to sink overburdened on the landing outside the drawingroom into a great gilded venetian chairof which at first however she but made with her brooding face a sort of throne of meditation she would thus have recalled a little with her so free orientalism of type the immemorially speechless sphinx about at last to become articulate the colonel not unlike on his side some old pilgrim of the desert camping at the foot of that monument went by way of reconnoissance into the drawingroom he visited according to his wont the windows and their fastenings he cast round the place the eye all at once of the master and the manager the commandant and the ratepayer then he came back to his wife before whom for a moment he stood waiting but she herself for a time continued to wait only looking up at him inscrutably there was in these minor manoeuvres and conscious patiences something of a suspension of their old custom of divergent discussion that intercourse by misunderstanding which had grown so clumsy now this familiar pleasantry seemed to desire to show it could yield on occasion to any clear trouble though it was also sensibly and just incoherently in the air that no trouble was at present to be vulgarly recognised as clear  there might for that matter even have been in mr assinghams face a mild perception of some finer sensea sense for his wifes situation and the very situation she was oddly enough about to repudiatethat she had fairly caused to grow in him but it was a flower to breathe upon gently and this was very much what she finally did she knew he needed no telling that she had given herself all the afternoon to her friends in eaton square and that her doing so would have been but the prompt result of impressions gathered in quantities in brimming baskets like the purple grapes of the vintage at matcham a process surrounded by him while it so unmistakably went on with abstentions and discretions that might almost have counted as solemnities the solemnities at the same time had committed him to nothingto nothing beyond this confession itself of a consciousness of deep waters she had been out on these waters for him visibly and his tribute to the fact had been his keeping her even if without a word well in sight he had not quitted for an hour during her adventure the shore of the mystic lake he had on the contrary stationed himself where she could signal to him at need her need would have arisen if the planks of her bark had partedthen some sort of plunge would have become his immediate duty his present position clearly was that of seeing her in the centre of her sheet of dark water and of wondering if her actual mute gaze at him didnt perhaps mean that her planks were now parting he held himself so ready that it was quite as if the inward man had pulled off coat and waistcoat before he had plunged howeverthat is before he had uttered a questionhe perceived not without relief that she was making for land he watched her steadily paddle always a little nearer and at last he felt her boat bump the bump was distinct and in fact she stepped ashore we were all wrong theres nothing  nothing it was like giving her his hand up the bank  between charlotte verver and the prince i was uneasybut im satisfied now i was in fact quite mistaken theres nothing  but i thought said bob assingham that that was just what you did persistently asseverate youve guaranteed their straightness from the first  noive never till now guaranteed anything but my own disposition to worry ive never till now fanny went on gravely from her chair had such a chance to see and to judge i had it at that placeif i had in my infatuation and my folly she added with expression nothing else so i did seei have seen and now i know her emphasis as she repeated the word made her head in her seat of infallibility rise higher i know  the colonel took itbut took it at first in silence do you mean theyve told you  noi mean nothing so absurd for in the first place i havent asked them and in the second their word in such a matter wouldnt count  oh said the colonel with all his oddity theyd tell us  it made her face him an instant as with her old impatience of his short cuts always across her finest flowerbeds but she felt none the less that she kept her irony down then when theyve told you youll be perhaps so good as to let me know  he jerked up his chin testing the growth of his beard with the back of his hand while he fixed her with a single eye ah i dont say that theyd necessarily tell me that they are over the traces  theyll necessarily whatever happens hold their tongues i hope and im talking of them now as i take them for myself only thats enough for meits all i have to regard with which after an instant theyre wonderful said fanny assingham  indeed her husband concurred i really think they are  youd think it still more if you knew but you dont know because you dont see their situationthis was what he didnt seeis too extraordinary  too he was willing to try  too extraordinary to be believed i mean if one didnt see but just that in a way is what saves them they take it seriously  he followed at his own pace their situation  the incredible side of it they make it credible  credible thenyou do sayto you  she looked at him again for an interval they believe in it themselves they take it for what it is and that she said saves them  but if what it is is just their chance  its their chance for what i told you when charlotte first turned up its their chance for the idea that i was then sure she had  the colonel showed his effort to recall oh your idea at different moments of any one of their ideas this dim procession visibly mustered before him and with the best will in the world he could but watch its immensity are you speaking now of something to which you can comfortably settle down  again for a little she only glowered at him ive come back to my belief and that i have done so  well he asked as she paused  well shows that im rightfor i assure you i had wandered far now im at home again and i mean said fanny assingham to stay here theyre beautiful she declared  the prince and charlotte  the prince and charlotte thats how theyre so remarkable and the beauty she explained is that theyre afraid for them afraid i mean for the others  for mr verver and maggie it did take some following afraid of what  afraid of themselves  the colonel wondered of themselves of mr ververs and maggies selves  mrs assingham remained patient as well as lucid yesof such blindness too but most of all of their own danger  he turned it over that danger being the blindness  that danger being their position what their position contains of all the elementsi neednt at this time of day attempt to tell you it contains luckilyfor thats the mercy everything but blindness i mean on their part the blindness said fanny is primarily her husbands  he stood for a moment he would have it straight whose husbands  mr ververs she went on the blindness is most of all his that they feelthat they see but its also his wifes  whose wifes he asked as she continued to gloom at him in a manner at variance with the comparative cheer of her contention and then as she only gloomed the princes  maggies ownmaggies very own she pursued as for herself  he had a pause do you think maggie so blind  the question isnt of what i think the questions of the conviction that guides the prince and charlottewho have better opportunities than i for judging  the colonel again wondered are you so very sure their opportunities are better  well his wife asked what is their whole so extraordinary situation their extraordinary relation but an opportunity  ah my dear you have that opportunityof their extraordinary situation and relationas much as they  with the difference darling she returned with some spirit that neither of those matters are if you please mine i see the boat theyre in but im not thank god in it myself today however mrs assingham added today in eaton square i did see  well then what  but she mused over it still oh many things more somehow than ever before it was as if god help me i was seeing for themi mean for the others it was as if something had happenedi dont know what except some effect of these days with them at that placethat had either made things come out or had cleared my own eyes these eyes indeed of the poor ladys rested on her companions meanwhile with the lustre not so much of intenser insight as of a particular portent that he had at various other times had occasion to recognise she desired obviously to reassure him but it apparently took a couple of large candid gathering glittering tears to emphasise the fact they had immediately for him their usual direct action she must reassure him he was made to feel absolutely in her own way he would adopt it and conform to it as soon as he should be able to make it out the only thing was that it took such incalculable twists and turns the twist seemed remarkable for instance as she developed her indication of what had come out in the afternoon it was as if i knew better than ever what makes them  what makes themhe pressed her as she fitfully dropped  well makes the prince and charlotte take it all as they do it might well have been difficult to know how to take it and they may even say for themselves that they were a long time trying to see as i say today she went on it was as if i were suddenly with a kind of horrible push seeing through their eyes on which as to shake off her perversity fanny assingham sprang up but she remained there under the dim illumination and while the colonel with his high dry spare look of type to which a certain conformity to the whiteness of inaccessible snows in his necktie shirtfront and waistcoat gave a rigour of accent waited watching her they might at the late hour and in the still house have been a pair of specious worldly adventurers driven for relief under sudden stress to some grim midnight reckoning in an odd corner her attention moved mechanically over the objects of ornament disposed too freely on the walls of staircase and landing as to which recognition for the time had lost both fondness and compunction i can imagine the way it works she said its so easy to understand yet i dont want to be wrong she the next moment broke out i dont i dont want to be wrong  to make a mistake you mean  oh no she meant nothing of the sort she knew but too well what she meant i dont make mistakes but i perpetratein thought crimes and she spoke with all intensity im a most dreadful person there are times when i seem not to mind a bit what ive done or what i think or imagine or fear or accept when i feel that id do it againfeel that id do things myself  ah my dear the colonel remarked in the coolness of debate  yes if you had driven me back on my nature luckily for you you never have youve done every thing else but youve never done that but what i really dont a bit want she declared is to abet them or to protect them  her companion turned this over what is there to protect them fromif by your now so settled faith theyve done nothing that justly exposes them  and it in fact half pulled her up well from a sudden scare from the alarm i mean of what maggie may think  yet if your whole idea is that maggie thinks nothing  she waited again it isnt my whole idea nothing is my whole ideafor i felt today as i tell you that theres so much in the air  oh in the air the colonel dryly breathed  well whats in the air always hashasnt itto come down to the earth and maggie mrs assingham continued is a very curious little person since i was in this afternoon for seeing more than i had ever donewell i felt that too for some reason as i hadnt yet felt it  for some reason for what reason and then as his wife at first said nothing did she give any sign was she in any way different  shes always so different from anyone else in the world that its hard to say when shes different from herself but she has made me said fanny after an instant think of her differently she drove me home  home here  first to portland placeon her leaving her father since she does once in a while leave him that was to keep me with her a little longer but she kept the carriage and after tea there came with me herself back here this was also for the same purpose then she went home though i had brought her a message from the prince that arranged their movements otherwise he and charlotte must have arrivedif they have arrivedexpecting to drive together to eaton square and keep maggie on to dinner there she has everything there you knowshe has clothes  the colonel didnt in fact know but he gave it his apprehension oh you mean a change  twenty changes if you likeall sorts of things she dresses really maggie does as much for her fatherand she always did as for her husband or for herself she has her room in his house very much as she had it before she was marriedand just as the boy has quite a second nursery there in which mrs noble when she comes with him makes herself i assure you at home si bien that if charlotte in her own house so to speak should wish a friend or two to stay with her she really would be scarce able to put them up  it was a picture into which as a thrifty entertainer himself bob assingham could more or less enter maggie and the child spread so  maggie and the child spread so  well he considered it is rather rum  thats all i claimshe seemed thankful for the word i dont say its anything morebut it is distinctly rum  which after an instant the colonel took up more what more could it be  it could be that shes unhappy and that she takes her funny little way of consoling herself for if she were unhappymrs assingham had figured it outthats just the way im convinced she would take but how can she be unhappy sinceas im also convincedshe in the midst of everything adores her husband as much as ever  the colonel at this brooded for a little at large then if shes so happy please whats the matter  it made his wife almost spring at him you think then shes secretly wretched  but he threw up his arms in deprecation ah my dear i give them up to you ive nothing more to suggest  then its not sweet of you she spoke at present as if he were frequently sweet you admit that it is rum  and this indeed fixed again for a moment his intention has charlotte complained of the want of rooms for her friends  never that i know of a word it isnt the sort of thing she does and whom has she after all mrs assingham added to complain to  hasnt she always you  oh me charlotte and i nowadays she spoke as of a chapter closed yet see the justice i still do her she strikes me more and more as extraordinary  a deeper shade at the renewal of the word had come into the colonels face if theyre each and all so extraordinary then isnt that why one must just resign ones self to wash ones hands of themto be lost her face however so met the question as if it were but a flicker of the old tone that their trouble had now become too real forher charged eyes so betrayed the condition of her nerves that he stepped back alertly enough to firmer ground he had spoken before in this light of a plain mans vision but he must be something more than a plain man now hasnt she then charlotte always her husband  to complain to shed rather die  ohand bob assinghams face at the vision of such extremities lengthened for very docility hasnt she the prince then  for such matters oh he doesnt count  i thought that was just whatas the basis of our agitationhe does do  mrs assingham however had her distinction ready not a bit as a person to bore with complaints the ground of my agitation is exactly that she never on any pretext bores him not charlotte and in the imagination of mrs ververs superiority to any such mistake she gave characteristically something like a toss of her headas marked a tribute to that ladys general grace in all the conditions as the personage referred to doubtless had ever received  ah only maggie with which the colonel gave a short low gurgle but it found his wife again prepared  nonot only maggie a great many people in londonand small wonderbore him  maggie only worst then but it was a question that he had promptly dropped at the returning brush of another of which she had shortly before sown the seed you said just now that he would by this time be back with charlotte if they have arrived you think it then possible that they really wont have returned  his companion exhibited to view for the idea a sense of her responsibility but this was insufficient clearly to keep her from entertaining it i think theres nothing theyre not now capable ofin their so intense good faith  good faithhe echoed the words which had in fact something of an odd ring critically  their false position it comes to the same thing and she bore down with her decision the superficial lack of sequence they may very possibly for a demonstrationas i see themnot have come back  he wondered visibly at this how she did see them may have bolted somewhere together  may have stayed over at matcham itself till tomorrow may have wired home each of them since maggie left me may have done fanny assingham continued god knows what she went on suddenly with more emotionwhich at the pressure of some spring of her inner vision broke out in a wail of distress imperfectly smothered whatever theyve done i shall never know never neverbecause i dont want to and because nothing will induce me so they may do as they like but ive worked for them all she uttered this last with another irrepressible quaver and the next moment her tears had come though she had with the explosion quitted her husband as if to hide it from him she passed into the dusky drawingroom where during his own prowl shortly previous he had drawn up a blind so that the light of the streetlamps came in a little at the window she made for this window against which she leaned her head while the colonel with his lengthened face looked after her for a minute and hesitated he might have been wondering what she had really done to what extent beyond his knowledge or his conception in the affairs of these people she could have committed herself but to hear her cry and yet try not to was quickly enough too much for him he had known her at other times quite not try not to and that had not been so bad he went to her and put his arm round her he drew her head to his breast where while she gasped she let it stay a littleall with a patience that presently stilled her yet the effect of this small crisis oddly enough was not to close their colloquy with the natural result of sending them to bed what was between them had opened out further had somehow through the sharp show of her feeling taken a positive stride had entered as it were without more words the region of the understood shutting the door after it and bringing them so still more nearly face to face they remained for some minutes looking at it through the dim window which opened upon the world of human trouble in general and which let the vague light play here and there upon gilt and crystal and colour the florid features looming dimly of fannys drawingroom and the beauty of what thus passed between them passed with her cry of pain with her burst of tears with his wonderment and his kindness and his comfort with the moments of their silence above all which might have represented their sinking together hand in hand for a time into the mystic lake where he had begun as we have hinted by seeing her paddle alonethe beauty of it was that they now could really talk better than before because the basis had at last once for all defined itself what was the basis which fanny absolutely exacted but that charlotte and the prince must be savedso far as consistently speaking of them as still safe might save them it did save them somehow for fannys troubled mindfor that was the nature of the mind of women he conveyed to her now at all events by refusing her no gentleness that he had sufficiently got the tip and that the tip was all he had wanted this remained quite clear even when he presently reverted to what she had told him of her recent passage with maggie i dont altogether see you know what you infer from it or why you infer anything when he so expressed himself it was quite as if in possession of what they had brought up from the depths                                 xxiv  i cant say more this made his companion reply than that something in her face her voice and her whole manner acted upon me as nothing in her had ever acted before and just for the reason above all that i felt her trying her very bestand her very best poor duck is very goodto be quiet and natural its when one sees people who always are natural making little pale pathetic blinking efforts for itthen it is that one knows somethings the matter i cant describe my impressionyou would have had it for yourself and the only thing that ever can be the matter with maggie is that by that i mean her beginning to doubt to doubt for the first time mrs assingham wound up of her wonderful little judgment of her wonderful little world  it was impressive fannys vision and the colonel as if himself agitated by it took another turn of prowling to doubt of fidelityto doubt of friendship poor duck indeed it will go hard with her but shell put it all he concluded on charlotte  mrs assingham still darkly contemplative denied this with a headshake she wont put it anywhere she wont do with it anything anyone else would shell take it all herself  you mean shell make it out her own fault  yesshell find means somehow to arrive at that  ah then the colonel dutifully declared shes indeed a little brick  oh his wife returned youll see in one way or another to what tune and she spoke of a sudden with an approach to elationso that as if immediately feeling his surprise she turned round to him shell see me somehow through  see you  yes me im the worst for said fanny assingham now with a harder exaltation i did it all i recognise thati accept it she wont cast it up at meshe wont cast up anything so i throw myself upon hershell bear me up she spoke almost volublyshe held him with her sudden sharpness shell carry the whole weight of us  there was still nevertheless wonder in it you mean she wont mind i say love and he not unkindly stared then wheres the difficulty  there isnt any fanny declared with the same rich emphasis it kept him indeed as by the loss of the thread looking at her longer ah you mean there isnt any for us  she met his look for a minute as if it perhaps a little too much imputed a selfishness a concern at any cost for their own surface then she might have been deciding that their own surface was after all what they had most to consider not she said with dignity if we properly keep our heads she appeared even to signify that they would begin by keeping them now this was what it was to have at last a constituted basis do you remember what you said to me that night of my first real anxietyafter the foreign office party  in the carriageas we came home yeshe could recall it leave them to pull through  precisely trust their own wit you practically said to save all appearances well ive trusted it i have left them to pull through  he hesitated and your point is that theyre not doing so  ive left them she went on but now i see how and where ive been leaving them all the while without knowing it to her  to the princess  and thats what i mean mrs assingham pensively pursued thats what happened to me with her today she continued to explain it came home to me that thats what ive really been doing  oh i see  i neednt torment myself she has taken them over  the colonel declared that he saw yet it was as if at this he a little sightlessly stared but what then has happened from one day to the other to her what has opened her eyes  they were never really shut she misses him  then why hasnt she missed him before  well facing him there among their domestic glooms and glints fanny worked it out she didbut she wouldnt let herself know it she had her reasonshe wore her blind now at last her situation has come to a head today she does know it and thats illuminating it has been mrs assingham wound up illuminating to me  her husband attended but the momentary effect of his attention was vagueness again and the refuge of his vagueness was a gasp poor dear little girl  ah nodont pity her  this did however pull him up we maynt even be sorry for her  not nowor at least not yet its too soonthat is if it isnt very much too late this will depend mrs assingham went on at any rate we shall see we might have pitied her beforefor all the good it would then have done her we might have begun some time ago now however she has begun to live and the way it comes to me the way it comes to me but again she projected her vision  the way it comes to you can scarcely be that shell like it  the way it comes to me is that she will live the way it comes to me is that shell triumph  she said this with so sudden a prophetic flare that it fairly cheered her husband ah then we must back her  nowe mustnt touch her we maynt touch any of them we must keep our hands off we must go on tiptoe we must simply watch and wait and meanwhile said mrs assingham we must bear it as we can thats where we areand serves us right were in presence  and so moving about the room as in communion with shadowy portents she left it till he questioned again in presence of what  well of something possibly beautiful beautiful as it may come off  she had paused there before him while he wondered you mean shell get the prince back  she raised her hand in quick impatience the suggestion might have been almost abject it isnt a question of recovery it wont be a question of any vulgar struggle to get him back she must have lost him and to have lost him she must have had him with which fanny shook her head what i take her to be waking up to is the truth that all the while she really hasnt had him never  ah my dear the poor colonel panted  never his wife repeated and she went on without pity do you remember what i said to you long agothat evening just before their marriage when charlotte had so suddenly turned up  the smile with which he met this appeal was not it was to be feared robust what havent you love said in your time  so many things no doubt that they make a chance for my having once or twice spoken the truth i never spoke it more at all events than when i put it to you that evening that maggie was the person in the world to whom a wrong thing could least be communicated it was as if her imagination had been closed to it her sense altogether sealed that therefore fanny continued is what will now have to happen her sense will have to open  i see he nodded to the wrong he nodded again almost cheerfullyas if he had been keeping the peace with a baby or a lunatic to the very very wrong  but his wifes spirit after its effort of wing was able to remain higher to whats called evilwith a very big e for the first time in her life to the discovery of it to the knowledge of it to the crude experience of it and she gave for the possibility the largest measure to the harsh bewildering brush the daily chilling breath of it unless indeedand here mrs assingham noted a limit unless indeed as yet so far as she has come and if she comes no further simply to the suspicion and the dread what we shall see is whether that mere dose of alarm will prove enough  he considered but enough for what then dearif not enough to break her heart  enough to give her a shaking mrs assingham rather oddly replied to give her i mean the right one the right one wont break her heart it will make her she explainedwell it will make her by way of a change understand one or two things in the world  but isnt it a pity the colonel asked that they should happen to be the one or two that will be the most disagreeable to her  oh disagreeable theyll have had to be disagreeableto show her a little where she is theyll have had to be disagreeable to make her sit up theyll have had to be disagreeable to make her decide to live  bob assingham was now at the window while his companion slowly revolved he had lighted a cigarette for final patience and he seemed vaguely to time her as she moved to and fro he had at the same time to do justice to the lucidity she had at last attained and it was doubtless by way of expression of this teachability that he let his eyes for a minute roll as from the force of feeling over the upper dusk of the room he had thought of the response his wifes words ideally implied  decide to liveah yesfor her child  oh bother her childand he had never felt so snubbed for an exemplary view as when fanny now stopped short to live you poor dear for her fatherwhich is another pair of sleeves  and mrs assinghams whole ample ornamented person irradiated with this the truth that had begun under so much handling to glow any idiot can do things for her child shell have a motive more original and we shall see how it will work her shell have to save him  to save him  to keep her father from her own knowledge thatand she seemed to see it before her in her husbands very eyeswill be work cut out with which as at the highest conceivable climax she wound up their colloquy good night  there was something in her manner howeveror in the effect at least of this supreme demonstration that had fairly and by a single touch lifted him to her side so that after she had turned her back to regain the landing and the staircase he overtook her before she had begun to mount with the ring of excited perception ah but you know thats rather jolly  jolly she turned upon it again at the foot of the staircase  i mean its rather charming  charming it had still to be their law a little that she was tragic when he was comic  i mean its rather beautiful you just said yourself it would be only he pursued promptly with the impetus of this idea and as if it had suddenly touched with light for him connections hitherto dimonly i dont quite see why that very care for him which has carried her to such other lengths precisely as affect one as so rum hasnt also by the same stroke made her notice a little more what has been going on  ah there you are its the question that ive all along been asking myself she had rested her eyes on the carpet but she raised them as she pursuedshe let him have it straight and its the question of an idiot  an idiot  well the idiot that ive been in all sorts of waysso often of late have i asked it youre excusable since you ask it but now the answer i saw today has all the while been staring me in the face  then what in the world is it  why the very intensity of her conscience about himthe very passion of her brave little piety thats the way it has worked mrs assingham explained and i admit it to have been as rum a way as possible but it has been working from a rum start from the moment the dear man married to ease his daughter off and it then happened by an extraordinary perversity that the very opposite effect was produced with the renewed vision of this fatality however she could give but a desperate shrug  i see the colonel sympathetically mused that was a rum start  but his very response as she again flung up her arms seemed to make her sense for a moment intolerable yesthere i am i was really at the bottom of it she declared i dont know what possessed mebut i planned for him i goaded him on with which however the next moment she took herself up or rather i do know what possessed mefor wasnt he beset with ravening women right and left and didnt he quite pathetically appeal for protection didnt he quite charmingly show one how he needed and desired it maggie she thus lucidly continued couldnt with a new life of her own give herself up to doing for him in the future all she had done in the pastto fencing him in to keeping him safe and keeping them off one perceived this she went onout of the abundance of ones affection and ones sympathy it all blessedly came back to herwhen it wasnt all for the fiftieth time obscured in face of the present facts by anxiety and compunction one was no doubt a meddlesome fool one always is to think one sees peoples lives for them better than they see them for themselves but ones excuse here she insisted was that these people clearly didnt see them for themselvesdidnt see them at all it struck one for very pitythat they were making a mess of such charming material that they were but wasting it and letting it go they didnt know how to liveand somehow one couldnt if one took an interest in them at all simply stand and see it thats what i pay forand the poor woman in straighter communion with her companions intelligence at this moment she appeared to feel than she had ever been before let him have the whole of the burden of her consciousness i always pay for it sooner or later my sociable my damnable my unnecessary interest nothing of course would suit me but that it should fix itself also on charlottecharlotte who was hovering there on the edge of our lives when not beautifully and a trifle mysteriously flitting across them and who was a piece of waste and a piece of threatened failure just as for any possible good to the world mr verver and maggie were it began to come over me in the watches of the night that charlotte was a person who could keep off ravening womenwithout being one herself either in the vulgar way of the others and that this service to mr verver would be a sweet employment for her future there was something of course that might have stopped me you know you know what i meanit looks at me she veritably moaned out of your face but all i can say is that it didnt the reason largely beingonce i had fallen in love with the beautiful symmetry of my planthat i seemed to feel sure maggie would accept charlotte whereas i didnt quite make out either what other woman or what other kind of woman one could think of her accepting  i seei see she had paused meeting all the while his listening look and the fever of her retrospect had so risen with her talk that the desire was visibly strong in him to meet her on his side but with cooling breath one quite understands my dear  it only however kept her there sombre i naturally see love what you understand which sits again perfectly in your eyes you see that i saw that maggie would accept her in helpless ignorance yes dearestand the grimness of her dreariness suddenly once more possessed her youve only to tell me that that knowledge was my reason for what i did how when you do can i stand up to you you see she said with an ineffable headshake that i dont stand up im down down down she declared yet she as quickly addedtheres just one little thing that helps to save my life and she kept him waiting but an instant they might easilythey would perhaps even certainlyhave done something worse  he thought worse than that charlotte  ah dont tell me she cried that there could have been nothing worse there might as they were have been many things charlotte in her way is extraordinary  he was almost simultaneous extraordinary  she observes the forms said fanny assingham  he hesitated with the prince  for the prince and with the others she went on with mr ververwonderfully but above all with maggie and the forms she had to do even them justiceare twothirds of conduct say he had married a woman who would have made a hash of them  but he jerked back ah my dear i wouldnt say it for the world  say she none the less pursued he had married a woman the prince would really have cared for  you mean then he doesnt care for charlotte this was still a new view to jump to and the colonel perceptibly wished to make sure of the necessity of the effort for that while he stared his wife allowed him time at the end of which she simply said no  then what on earth are they up to still however she only looked at him so that standing there before her with his hands in his pockets he had time further to risk soothingly another question are the forms you speak ofthat are twothirds of conductwhat will be keeping her now by your hypothesis from coming home with him till morning  yesabsolutely their forms  theirs  maggies and mr verversthose they impose on charlotte and the prince those she developed that so perversely as i say have succeeded in setting themselves up as the right ones  he consideredbut only now at last really to relapse into woe your perversity my dear is exactly what i dont understand the state of things existing hasnt grown like a field of mushrooms in a night whatever they all round may be in for now is at least the consequence of what theyve done are they mere helpless victims of fate  well fanny at last had the courage of it yesthey are to be so abjectly innocentthat is to be victims of fate  and charlotte and the prince are abjectly innocent  it took her another minute but she rose to the full height yes that is they wereas much so in their way as the others there were beautiful intentions all round the princes and charlottes were beautifulof that i had my faith they were id go to the stake otherwise she added i should have been a wretch and ive not been a wretch ive only been a doubledyed donkey  ah then he asked what does our muddle make them to have been  well too much taken up with considering each other you may call such a mistake as that by what ever name you please it at any rate means all round their case it illustrates the misfortune said mrs assingham gravely of being too too charming  this was another matter that took some following but the colonel again did his best yes but to whomdoesnt it rather depend on that to whom have the prince and charlotte then been too charming  to each other in the first placeobviously and then both of them together to maggie  to maggie he wonderingly echoed  to maggie she was now crystalline by having accepted from the first so guilelesslyyes so guilelessly themselvesher guileless idea of still having her father of keeping him fast in her life  then isnt one supposed in common humanity and if one hasnt quarrelled with him and one has the means and he on his side doesnt drink or kick up rowsisnt one supposed to keep ones aged parent in ones life  certainlywhen there arent particular reasons against it that there may be others than his getting drunk is exactly the moral of what is before us in the first place mr verver isnt aged  the colonel just hung firebut it came then why the deuce does heoh poor dear manbehave as if he were  she took a moment to meet it how do you know how he behaves  well my own love we see how charlotte does again at this she faltered but again she rose ah isnt my whole point that hes charming to her  doesnt it depend a bit on what she regards as charming  she faced the question as if it were flippant then with a headshake of dignity she brushed it away its mr verver whos really youngits charlotte whos really old and what i was saying she added isnt affected  you were sayinghe did her the justicethat theyre all guileless  that they were guileless all at firstquite extraordinarily its what i mean by their failure to see that the more they took for granted they could work together the more they were really working apart for i repeat fanny went on that i really believe charlotte and the prince honestly to have made up their minds originally that their very esteem for mr ververwhich was serious as well it might bewould save them  i see the colonel inclined himself and save him  it comes to the same thing  then save maggie  that comes said mrs assingham to something a little different for maggie has done the most  he wondered what do you call the most  well she did it originallyshe began the vicious circle for thatthough you make round eyes at my associating her with viceis simply what it has been its their mutual consideration all round that has made it the bottomless gulf and theyre really so embroiled but because in their way theyve been so improbably good  in their wayyes the colonel grinned  which was above all maggies way no flicker of his ribaldry was anything to her now maggie had in the first place to make up to her father for her having suffered herself to becomepoor little dear as she believedso intensely married then she had to make up to her husband for taking so much of the time they might otherwise have spent together to make this reparation to mr verver perfect and her way to do this precisely was by allowing the prince the use the enjoyment whatever you may call it of charlotte to cheer his pathby instalments as it were in proportion as she herself making sure her father was all right might be missed from his side by so much at the same time however mrs assingham further explained by so much as she took her young stepmother for this purpose away from mr verver by just so much did this too strike her as something again to be made up for it has saddled her you will easily see with a positively new obligation to her father an obligation created and aggravated by her unfortunate even if quite heroic little sense of justice she began with wanting to show him that his marriage could never under whatever temptation of her own bliss with the prince become for her a pretext for deserting or neglecting him then that in its order entailed her wanting to show the prince that she recognised how the other desirethis wish to remain intensely the same passionate little daughter she had always beeninvolved in some degree and just for the present so to speak her neglecting and deserting him i quite hold fanny with characteristic amplitude parenthesised that a person can mostly feel but one passionone tender passion that isat a time only that doesnt hold good for our primary and instinctive attachments the voice of blood such as ones feeling for a parent or a brother those may be intense and yet not prevent other intensitiesas you will recognise my dear when you remember how i continued tout betement to adore my mother whom you didnt adore for years after i had begun to adore you well maggieshe kept it upis in the same situation as i was plus complications from which i was thank heaven exempt plus the complication above all of not having in the least begun with the sense for complications that i should have had before she knew it at any rate her little scruples and her little lucidities which were really so divinely blind her feverish little sense of justice as i sayhad brought the two others together as her grossest misconduct couldnt have done and now she knows something or other has happenedyet hasnt heretofore known what she has only piled up her remedy poor childsomething that she has earnestly but confusedly seen as her necessary policy piled it on top of the policy on top of the remedy that she at first thought out for herself and that would really have needed since then so much modification her only modification has been the growth of her necessity to prevent her fathers wondering if all in their life in common may be so certainly for the best she has now as never before to keep him unconscious that peculiar if he makes a point of it as their situation is theres anything in it all uncomfortable or disagreeable anything morally the least out of the way she has to keep touching it up to make it each day each month look natural and normal to him so thatgod forgive me the comparisonshes like an old woman who has taken to painting and who has to lay it on thicker to carry it off with a greater audacity with a greater impudence even the older she grows and fanny stood a moment captivated with the image she had thrown off i like the idea of maggie audacious and impudentlearning to be so to gloss things over she couldshe even will yet i believelearn it for that sacred purpose consummately diabolically for from the moment the dear man should see its all rouge she paused staring at the vision  it imparted itself even to bob then the fun would begin as it but made her look at him hard however he amended the form of his inquiry you mean that in that case she will charming creature be lost  she was silent a moment more as ive told you before she wont be lost if her fathers saved shell see that as salvation enough  the colonel took it in then shes a little heroine  rathershes a little heroine but its his innocence above all mrs assingham added that will pull them through  her companion at this focussed again mr ververs innocence its awfully quaint  of course its awfully quaint that its awfully quaint that the pair are awfully quaint quaint with all our dear old quaintnessby which i dont mean yours and mine but that of my own sweet countrypeople from whom ive so deplorably degeneratedthat mrs assingham declared was originally the head and front of their appeal to me and of my interest in them and of course i shall feel them quainter still she rather ruefully subjoined before theyve done with me  this might be but it wasnt what most stood in the colonels way you believe so in mr ververs innocence after two years of charlotte  she stared but the whole point is just that two years of charlotte are what he hasnt reallyor what you may call undividedlyhad  any more than maggie by your theory eh has really or undividedly had four of the prince it takes all she hasnt had the colonel conceded to account for the innocence that in her too so leaves us in admiration  so far as it might be ribald again she let this pass it takes a great many things to account for maggie what is definite at all events is thatstrange though this beher effort for her father has up to now sufficiently succeeded she has made him she makes him accept the tolerably obvious oddity of their relation all round for part of the game behind her there protected and amused and as it were exquisitely humbuggedthe principino in whom he delights always aidinghe has safely and serenely enough suffered the conditions of his life to pass for those he had sublimely projected he hadnt worked them out in detailany more than i had heaven pity meand the queerness has been exactly in the detail this for him is what it was to have married charlotte and they both she neatly wound up help  both  i mean that if maggie always in the breach makes it seem to him all so flourishingly to fit charlotte does her part not less and her part is very large charlotte fanny declared works like a horse  so there it all was and her husband looked at her a minute across it and what does the prince work like  she fixed him in return like a prince whereupon breaking short off to ascend to her room she presented her highly decorated backin which in odd places controlling the complications of its aspect the ruby or the garnet the turquoise and the topaz gleamed like faint symbols of the wit that pinned together the satin patches of her argument  he watched her as if she left him positively under the impression of her mastery of her subject yes as if the real upshot of the drama before them was but that he had when it came to the tight places of lifeas life had shrunk for him nowthe most luminous of wives he turned off in this view of her majestic retreat the comparatively faint little electric lamp which had presided over their talk then he went up as immediately behind her as the billows of her amber train allowed making out how all the clearness they had conquered was even for herself a reliefhow at last the sense of the amplitude of her exposition sustained and floated her joining her however on the landing above where she had already touched a metallic point into light he found she had done perhaps even more to create than to extinguish in him the germ of a curiosity he held her a minute longer there was another plum in the pie what did you mean some minutes ago by his not caring for charlotte  the princes by his not really caring she recalled after a little benevolently enough i mean that men dont when it has all been too easy thats how in nine cases out of ten a woman is treated who has risked her life you asked me just now how he works she added but you might better perhaps have asked me how he plays  well he made it up like a prince  like a prince he is profoundly a prince for that she said with expression hesbeautifullya case theyre far rarer even in the highest circles than they pretend to beand thats what makes so much of his value hes perhaps one of the very lastthe last of the real ones so it is we must take him we must take him all round  the colonel considered and how must charlotteif anything happenstake him  the question held her a minute and while she waited with her eyes on him she put out a grasping hand to his arm in the flesh of which he felt her answer distinctly enough registered thus she gave him standing off a little the firmest longest deepest injunction he had ever received from her nothing in spite of everythingwill happen nothing has happened nothing is happening  he looked a trifle disappointed i see for us  for us for whom else and he was to feel indeed how she wished him to understand it we know nothing on earth it was an undertaking he must sign  so he wrote as it were his name we know nothing on earth it was like the soldiers watchword at night  were as innocent she went on in the same way as babes  why not rather say he asked as innocent as they themselves are  oh for the best of reasons because were much more so  he wondered but how can we be more  for them oh easily we can be anything  absolute idiots then  absolute idiots and oh fanny breathed the way it will rest us  well he looked as if there were something in that but wont they know were not  she barely hesitated charlotte and the prince think we are which is so much gained mr verver believes in our intelligencebut he doesnt matter  and maggie doesnt she know  that we see before our noses yes this indeed took longer oh so far as she may guess it shell give no sign so it comes to the same thing  he raised his eyebrows comes to our not being able to help her  thats the way we shall help her  by looking like fools  she threw up her hands she only wants herself to look like a bigger so there we are with which she brushed it awayhis conformity was promised something however still held her it broke to her own vision as a last wave of clearness moreover now she said i see i mean she addedwhat you were asking me how i knew today in eaton square that maggies awake and she had indeed visibly got it it was by seeing them together  seeing her with her father he fell behind again but youve seen her often enough before  never with my present eyes for nothing like such a testthat of this length of the others absence togetherhas hitherto occurred  possibly but if she and mr verver insisted upon it  why is it such a test because it has become one without their intending it it has spoiled so to speak on their hands  it has soured eh the colonel said  the words horriblesay rather it has changed perhaps fanny went on she did wish to see how much she can bear in that case she has seen only it was she alone whoabout the visitinsisted her father insists on nothing and she watches him do it  her husband looked impressed watches him  for the first faint sign i mean of his noticing it doesnt as i tell you come but shes there for it to see and i felt she continued how shes there i caught her as it were in the fact she couldnt keep it from methough she left her post on purposecame home with me to throw dust in my eyes i took it allher dust but it was what showed me with which supreme lucidity she reached the door of her room luckily it showed me also how she has succeeded nothingfrom himhas come  youre so awfully sure  sure nothing will goodnight she said shell die first       the golden bowl volume ii  book second the princess   part fourth                                xxv  it was not till many days had passed that the princess began to accept the idea of having done a little something she was not always doing or indeed that of having listened to any inward voice that spoke in a new tone yet these instinctive postponements of reflection were the fruit positively of recognitions and perceptions already active of the sense above all that she had made at a particular hour made by the mere touch of her hand a difference in the situation so long present to her as practically unattackable this situation had been occupying for months and months the very centre of the garden of her life but it had reared itself there like some strange tall tower of ivory or perhaps rather some wonderful beautiful but outlandish pagoda a structure plated with hard bright porcelain coloured and figured and adorned at the overhanging eaves with silver bells that tinkled ever so charmingly when stirred by chance airs she had walked round and round itthat was what she felt she had carried on her existence in the space left her for circulation a space that sometimes seemed ample and sometimes narrow looking up all the while at the fair structure that spread itself so amply and rose so high but never quite making out as yet where she might have entered had she wished she had not wished till nowsuch was the odd case and what was doubtless equally odd besides was that though her raised eyes seemed to distinguish places that must serve from within and especially far aloft as apertures and outlooks no door appeared to give access from her convenient garden level the great decorated surface had remained consistently impenetrable and inscrutable at present however to her considering mind it was as if she had ceased merely to circle and to scan the elevation ceased so vaguely so quite helplessly to stare and wonder she had caught herself distinctly in the act of pausing then in that of lingering and finally in that of stepping unprecedentedly near the thing might have been by the distance at which it kept her a mahometan mosque with which no base heretic could take a liberty there so hung about it the vision of ones putting off ones shoes to enter and even verily of ones paying with ones life if found there as an interloper she had not certainly arrived at the conception of paying with her life for anything she might do but it was nevertheless quite as if she had sounded with a tap or two one of the rare porcelain plates she had knocked in shortthough she could scarce have said whether for admission or for what she had applied her hand to a cool smooth spot and had waited to see what would happen something had happened it was as if a sound at her touch after a little had come back to her from within a sound sufficiently suggesting that her approach had been noted  if this image however may represent our young womans consciousness of a recent change in her lifea change now but a few days oldit must at the same time be observed that she both sought and found in renewed circulation as i have called it a measure of relief from the idea of having perhaps to answer for what she had done the pagoda in her blooming garden figured the arrangementhow otherwise was it to be namedby which so strikingly she had been able to marry without breaking as she liked to put it with the past she had surrendered herself to her husband without the shadow of a reserve or a condition and yet she had not all the while given up her fatherthe least little inch she had compassed the high city of seeing the two men beautifully take to each other and nothing in her marriage had marked it as more happy than this fact of its having practically given the elder the lonelier a new friend what had moreover all the while enriched the whole aspect of success was that the latters marriage had been no more meassurably paid for than her own his having taken the same great step in the same free way had not in the least involved the relegation of his daughter that it was remarkable they should have been able at once so to separate and so to keep together had never for a moment from however far back been equivocal to her that it was remarkable had in fact quite counted at first and always and for each of them equally as part of their inspiration and their support there were plenty of singular things they were not enamoured offlights of brilliancy of audacity of originality that speaking at least for the dear man and herself were not at all in their line but they liked to think they had given their life this unusual extension and this liberal form which many families many couples and still more many pairs of couples would not have found workable that last truth had been distinctly brought home to them by the bright testimony the quite explicit envy of most of their friends who had remarked to them again and again that they must on all the showing to keep on such terms be people of the highest amiabilityequally including in the praise of course amerigo and charlotte it had given them pleasureas how should it notto find themselves shed such a glamour it had certainly that is given pleasure to her father and herself both of them distinguishably of a nature so slow to presume that they would scarce have been sure of their triumph without this pretty reflection of it so it was that their felicity had fructified so it was that the ivory tower visible and admirable doubtless from any point of the social field had risen stage by stage maggies actual reluctance to ask herself with proportionate sharpness why she had ceased to take comfort in the sight of it represented accordingly a lapse from that ideal consistency on which her moral comfort almost at any time depended to remain consistent she had always been capable of cutting down more or less her prior term  moving for the first time in her life as in the darkening shadow of a false position she reflected that she should either not have ceased to be rightthat is to be confidentor have recognised that she was wrong though she tried to deal with herself for a space only as a silkencoated spaniel who has scrambled out of a pond and who rattles the water from his ears her shake of her head again and again as she went was much of that order and she had the resource to which save for the rude equivalent of his generalising bark the spaniel would have been a stranger of humming to herself hard as a sign that nothing had happened to her she had not so to speak fallen in she had had no accident and had not got wet this at any rate was her pretension until after she began a little to wonder if she mightnt with or without exposure have taken cold she could at all events remember no time at which she had felt so excited and certainly nonewhich was another special pointthat so brought with it as well the necessity for concealing excitement this birth of a new eagerness became a high pastime in her view precisely by reason of the ingenuity required for keeping the thing born out of sight the ingenuity was thus a private and absorbing exercise in the light of which might i so far multiply my metaphors i should compare her to the frightened but clinging young mother of an unlawful child the idea that had possession of her would be by our new analogy the proof of her misadventure but likewise all the while only another sign of a relation that was more to her than anything on earth she had lived long enough to make out for herself that any deepseated passion has its pangs as well as its joys and that we are made by its aches and its anxieties most richly conscious of it she had never doubted of the force of the feeling that bound her to her husband but to become aware almost suddenly that it had begun to vibrate with a violence that had some of the effect of a strain would rightly looked at after all but show that she was like thousands of women every day acting up to the full privilege of passion why in the world shouldnt she with every rightif on consideration she saw no good reason against it the best reason against it would have been the possibility of some consequence disagreeable or inconvenient to others especially to such others as had never incommoded her by the egotism of their passions but if once that danger were duly guarded against the fulness of ones measure amounted to no more than the equal use of ones faculties or the proper playing of ones part it had come to the princess obscurely at first but little by little more conceivably that her faculties had not for a good while been concomitantly used the case resembled in a manner that of her onceloved dancing a matter of remembered steps that had grown vague from her ceasing to go to balls she would go to balls againthat seemed freely even crudely stated the remedy she would take out of the deep receptacles in which she had laid them away the various ornaments congruous with the greater occasions and of which her store she liked to think was none of the smallest she would have been easily to be figured for us at this occupation dipping at off moments and quiet hours in snatched visits and by draughty candlelight into her rich collections and seeing her jewels again a little shyly but all unmistakably glow that in fact may pass as the very picture of her semismothered agitation of the diversion she to some extent successfully found in referring her crisis so far as was possible to the mere working of her own needs  it must be added however that she would have been at a loss to determineand certainly at firstto which order that of selfcontrol or that of large expression the step she had taken the afternoon of her husbands return from matcham with his companion properly belonged for it had been a step distinctly on maggies part her deciding to do something just then and there which would strike amerigo as unusual and this even though her departure from custom had merely consisted in her so arranging that he wouldnt find her as he would definitely expect to do in eaton square he would have strangely enough as might seem to him to come back home for it and there get the impression of her rather pointedly or at least all impatiently and independently awaiting him these were small variations and mild manoeuvres but they went accompanied on maggies part as we have mentioned with an infinite sense of intention her watching by his fireside for her husbands return from an absence might superficially have presented itself as the most natural act in the world and the only one into the bargain on which he would positively have reckoned it fell by this circumstance into the order of plain matters and yet the very aspect by which it was in the event handed over to her brooding fancy was the fact that she had done with it all she had designed she had put her thought to the proof and the proof had shown its edge this was what was before her that she was no longer playing with blunt and idle tools with weapons that didnt cut there passed across her vision ten times a day the gleam of a bare blade and at this it was that she most shut her eyes most knew the impulse to cheat herself with motion and sound she had merely driven on a certain wednesday to portland place instead of remaining in eaton square and she privately repeated it again and again there had appeared beforehand no reason why she should have seen the mantle of history flung by a single sharp sweep over so commonplace a deed that all the same was what had happened it had been bitten into her mind all in an hour that nothing she had ever done would hereafter in some way yet to be determined so count for herperhaps not even what she had done in accepting in their old golden rome amerigos proposal of marriage and yet by her little crouching posture there that of a timid tigress she had meant nothing recklessly ultimate nothing clumsily fundamental so that she called it names the invidious the grotesque attitude holding it up to her own ridicule reducing so far as she could the portee of what had followed it she had but wanted to get nearernearer to something indeed that she couldnt that she wouldnt even to herself describe and the degree of this achieved nearness was what had been in advance incalculable her actual multiplication of distractions and suppressions whatever it did for her failed to prevent her living over again any chosen minutefor she could choose them she could fix themof the freshness of relation produced by her having administered to her husband the first surprise to which she had ever treated him it had been a poor thing but it had been all her own and the whole passage was backwardly there a great picture hung on the wall of her daily life for her to make what she would of  it fell for retrospect into a succession of moments that were watchable still almost in the manner of the different things done during a scene on the stage some scene so acted as to have left a great impression on the tenant of one of the stalls several of these moments stood out beyond the others and those she could feel again most count again like the firm pearls on a string had belonged more particularly to the lapse of time before dinnerdinner which had been so late quite at nine oclock that evening thanks to the final lateness of amerigos own advent these were parts of the experiencethough in fact there had been a good many of thembetween which her impression could continue sharply to discriminate before the subsequent passages much later on it was to be said the flame of memory turned to an equalising glow that of a lamp in some sidechapel in which incense was thick the great moment at any rate for conscious repossession was doubtless the first the strange little timed silence which she had fully gauged on the spot as altogether beyond her own intention but whichfor just how long should she ever really know for just how longshe could do nothing to break she was in the smaller drawingroom in which she always sat and she had by calculation dressed for dinner on finally coming in it was a wonder how many things she had calculated in respect to this small incidenta matter for the importance of which she had so quite indefinite a measure he would be latehe would be very late that was the one certainty that seemed to look her in the face there was still also the possibility that if he drove with charlotte straight to eaton square he might think it best to remain there even on learning she had come away she had left no message for him on any such chance this was another of her small shades of decision though the effect of it might be to keep him still longer absent he might suppose she would already have dined he might stay with all he would have to tell just on purpose to be nice to her father she had known him to stretch the point to these beautiful ends far beyond that he had more than once stretched it to the sacrifice of the opportunity of dressing  if she herself had now avoided any such sacrifice and had made herself during the time at her disposal quite inordinately fresh and quite positively smart this had probably added while she waited and waited to that very tension of spirit in which she was afterwards to find the image of her having crouched she did her best quite intensely by herself to banish any such appearance she couldnt help it if she couldnt read her pale novelah that par exemple was beyond her but she could at least sit by the lamp with the book sit there with her newest frock worn for the first time sticking out all round her quite stiff and grand even perhaps a little too stiff and too grand for a familiar and domestic frock yet marked none the less this time she ventured to hope by incontestable intrinsic merit she had glanced repeatedly at the clock but she had refused herself the weak indulgence of walking up and down though the act of doing so she knew would make her feel on the polished floor with the rustle and the hang still more beautifully bedecked the difficulty was that it would also make her feel herself still more sharply in a state which was exactly what she proposed not to do the only drops of her anxiety had been when her thought strayed complacently with her eyes to the front of her gown which was in a manner a refuge a beguilement especially when she was able to fix it long enough to wonder if it would at last really satisfy charlotte she had ever been in respect to her clothes rather timorous and uncertain for the last year above all she had lived in the light of charlottes possible and rather inscrutable judgment of them charlottes own were simply the most charming and interesting that any woman had ever put on there was a kind of poetic justice in her being at last able in this particular thanks to means thanks quite to omnipotence freely to exercise her genius but maggie would have described herself as in these connections constantly and intimately torn conscious on one side of the impossibility of copying her companion and conscious on the other of the impossibility of sounding her independently to the bottom yes it was one of the things she should go down to her grave without having knownhow charlotte after all had been said really thought her stepdaughter looked under any supposedly ingenious personal experiment she had always been lovely about the stepdaughters material braverieshad done for her the very best with them but there had ever fitfully danced at the back of maggies head the suspicion that these expressions were mercies not judgments embodying no absolute but only a relative frankness hadnt charlotte with so perfect a critical vision if the truth were known given her up as hopelesshopeless by a serious standard and thereby invented for her a different and inferior one in which as the only thing to be done she patiently and soothingly abetted her hadnt she in other words assented in secret despair perhaps even in secret irritation to her being ridiculousso that the best now possible was to wonder once in a great while whether one mightnt give her the surprise of something a little less out of the true note than usual something of this kind was the question that maggie while the absentees still delayed asked of the appearance she was endeavouring to present but with the result repeatedly again that it only went and lost itself in the thick air that had begun more and more to hang for our young woman over her accumulations of the unanswered they were there these accumulations they were like a roomful of confused objects never as yet sorted which for some time now she had been passing and repassing along the corridor of her life she passed it when she could without opening the door then on occasion she turned the key to throw in a fresh contribution so it was that she had been getting things out of the way they rejoined the rest of the confusion it was as if they found their place by some instinct of affinity in the heap they knew in short where to go and when she at present by a mental act once more pushed the door open she had practically a sense of method and experience what she should never know about charlottes thoughtshe tossed that in it would find itself in company and she might at last have been standing there long enough to see it fall into its corner the sight moreover would doubtless have made her stare had her attention been more free the sight of the mass of vain things congruous incongruous that awaited every addition it made her in fact with a vague gasp turn away and what had further determined this was the final sharp extinction of the inward scene by the outward the quite different door had opened and her husband was there  it had been as strange as she could consent afterwards to think it it had been essentially what had made the abrupt bend in her life he had come back had followed her from the other house visibly uncertainthis was written in the face he for the first minute showed her it had been written only for those seconds and it had appeared to go quickly after they began to talk but while it lasted it had been written large and though she didnt quite know what she had expected of him she felt she hadnt expected the least shade of embarrassment what had made the embarrassmentshe called it embarrassment so as to be able to assure herself she put it at the very worst what had made the particular look was his thus distinguishably wishing to see how he should find her why firstthat had later on kept coming to her the question dangled there as if it were the key to everything with the sense of it on the spot she had felt overwhelmingly that she was significant that so she must instantly strike him and that this had a kind of violence beyond what she had intended it was in fact even at the moment not absent from her view that he might easily have made an abject fool of herat least for the time she had indeed for just ten seconds been afraid of some such turn the uncertainty in his face had become so the next thing an uncertainty in the very air three words of impatience the least bit loud some outbreak of what in the world are you up to and what do you mean any note of that sort would instantly have brought her lowand this all the more that heaven knew she hadnt in any manner designed to be high it was such a trifle her small breach with custom or at any rate with his natural presumption that all magnitude of wonder had already had before one could deprecate the shadow of it the effect of a complication it had made for him some difference that she couldnt measure this meeting him at home and alone instead of elsewhere and with others and back and back it kept coming to her that the blankness he showed her before he was able to see might should she choose to insist on it have a meaninghave as who should say an historic value beyond the importance of momentary expressions in general she had naturally had on the spot no ready notion of what he might want to see it was enough for a ready notion not to speak of a beating heart that he did see that he saw his wife in her own drawingroom at the hour when she would most properly be there he hadnt in any way challenged her it was true and after those instants during which she now believed him to have been harbouring the impression of something unusually prepared and pointed in her attitude and array he had advanced upon her smiling and smiling and thus without hesitation at the last had taken her into his arms the hesitation had been at the first and she at present saw that he had surmounted it without her help she had given him no help for if on the one hand she couldnt speak for hesitation so on the otherand especially as he didnt ask hershe couldnt explain why she was agitated she had known it all the while down to her toes known it in his presence with fresh intensity and if he had uttered but a question it would have pressed in her the spring of recklessness it had been strange that the most natural thing of all to say to him should have had that appearance but she was more than ever conscious that any appearance she had would come round more or less straight to her father whose life was now so quiet on the basis accepted for it that any alteration of his consciousness even in the possible sense of enlivenment would make their precious equilibrium waver that was at the bottom of her mind that their equilibrium was everything and that it was practically precarious a matter of a hairs breadth for the loss of the balance it was the equilibrium or at all events her conscious fear about it that had brought her heart into her mouth and the same fear was on either side in the silent look she and amerigo had exchanged the happy balance that demanded this amount of consideration was truly thus as by its own confession a delicate matter but that her husband had also his habit of anxiety and his general caution only brought them after all more closely together it would have been most beautifully therefore in the name of the equilibrium and in that of her joy at their feeling so exactly the same about it that she might have spoken if she had permitted the truth on the subject of her behaviour to ring outon the subject of that poor little behaviour which was for the moment so very limited a case of eccentricity  why why have i made this evening such a point of our not all dining together well because ive all day been so wanting you alone that i finally couldnt bear it and that there didnt seem any great reason why i should try to that came to mefunny as it may at first sound with all the things weve so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other youve seemed these last daysi dont know what more absent than ever before too absent for us merely to go on so its all very well and i perfectly see how beautiful it is all round but there comes a day when something snaps when the full cup filled to the very brim begins to flow over thats what has happened to my need of youthe cup all day has been too full to carry so here i am with it spilling it over youand just for the reason that is the reason of my life after all ive scarcely to explain that im as much in love with you now as the first hour except that there are some hourswhich i know when they come because they almost frighten methat show me im even more so they come of themselvesand ah theyve been coming after all after all some such words as those were what didnt ring out yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver it was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far without that extremity at the end of a moment he had taken in what he needed to takethat his wife was testifying that she adored and missed and desired him after all after all since she put it so she was right that was what he had to respond to that was what from the moment that as has been said he saw he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible he held her close and long in expression of their personal reunionthis obviously was one way of doing so he rubbed his cheek tenderly and with a deep vague murmur against her face that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast that was not less obviously another way and there were ways enough in short for his extemporised ease for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact this last was partly no doubt because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned he had told her of his day the happy thought of his roundabout journey with charlotte all their cathedralhunting adventure and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected the moral of it was at any rate that he was tired verily and must have a bath and dressto which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible she was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on thishow he had looked for her during an instant at the door before going out how he had met her asking him in hesitation first then quickly in decision whether she couldnt help him by going up with him he had perhaps also for a moment hesitated but he had declined her offer and she was to preserve as i say the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldnt dine till ten oclock and that he should go straighter and faster alone such things as i say were to come back to herthey played through her full aftersense like lights on the whole impression the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness one of these subsequent parts the first had been the not inconsiderable length to her later and more analytic consciousness of this second wait for her husbands reappearance she might certainly with the best will in the world had she gone up with him have been more in his way than not since people could really almost always hurry better without help than with it still she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking though it must indeed be added that there was now in this muchthinking little persons state of mind no mere crudity of impatience something had happened rapidly with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro subsidence of the fearsome for maggies spirit was always at first positive emergence of the sweet and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession                                xxvi  amerigo was away from her again as she sat there as she walked there without himfor she had with the difference of his presence in the house ceased to keep herself from moving about but the hour was filled nevertheless with the effect of his nearness and above all with the effect strange in an intimacy so established of an almost renewed vision of the facts of his aspect she had seen him last but five days since yet he had stood there before her as if restored from some far country some long voyage some combination of dangers or fatigues this unquenchable variety in his appeal to her interest what did it mean but thatreduced to the flatness of mere statementshe was married by good fortune to an altogether dazzling person that was an old old story but the truth of it shone out to her like the beauty of some family picture some mellow portrait of an ancestor that she might have been looking at almost in surprise after a long intermission the dazzling person was upstairs and she was down and there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required and of the constant care that the equilibrium involved but  she had all the same never felt so absorbingly married so abjectly conscious of a master of her fate he could do what he would with her in fact what was actually happening was that he was actually doing it what he would what he really wouldonly that quantity itself escaped perhaps in the brightness of the high harmony familiar naming and discussing it was enough of a recognition for her that whatever the thing he might desire he would always absolutely bring it off she knew at this moment without a question with the fullest surrender how he had brought off in her by scarce more than a single allusion a perfect flutter of tenderness if he had come back tired tired from his long day the exertion had been literally in her service and her fathers they two had sat at home at peace the principino between them the complications of life kept down the bores sifted out the large ease of the home preserved because of the way the others held the field and braved the weather amerigo never complainedany more than for that matter charlotte did but she seemed to see tonight as she had never yet quite done that their business of social representation conceived as they conceived it beyond any conception of her own and conscientiously carried out was an affair of living always in harness she remembered fanny assinghams old judgment that friends description of her father and herself as not living at all as not knowing what to do or what might be done for them and there came back to her with it an echo of the long talk they had had together one september day at fawns under the trees when she put before him this dictum of fannys  that occasion might have counted for themshe had already often made the reflectionas the first step in an existence more intelligently arranged it had been an hour from which the chain of causes and consequences was definitely traceableso many things and at the head of the list her fathers marriage having appeared to her to flow from charlottes visit to fawns and that event itself having flowed from the memorable talk but what perhaps most came out in the light of these concatenations was that it had been for all the world as if charlotte had been had in as the servants always said of extra help because they had thus suffered it to be pointed out to them that if their family coach lumbered and stuck the fault was in its lacking its complement of wheels having but three as they might say it had wanted another and what had charlotte done from the first but begin to act on the spot and ever so smoothly and beautifully as a fourth nothing had been immediately more manifest than the greater grace of the movement of the vehicleas to which for the completeness of her image maggie was now supremely to feel how every strain had been lightened for herself so far as she was one of the wheels she had but to keep in her place since the work was done for her she felt no weight and it wasnt too much to acknowledge that she had scarce to turn round she had a long pause before the fire during which she might have been fixing with intensity her projected vision have been conscious even of its taking an absurd fantastic shape she might have been watching the family coach pass and noting that somehow amerigo and charlotte were pulling it while she and her father were not so much as pushing they were seated inside together dandling the principino and holding him up to the windows to see and be seen like an infant positively royal so that the exertion was all with the others maggie found in this image a repeated challenge again and yet again she paused before the fire after which each time in the manner of one for whom a strong light has suddenly broken she gave herself to livelier movement she had seen herself at last in the picture she was studying suddenly jump from the coach whereupon frankly with the wonder of the sight her eyes opened wider and her heart stood still for a moment she looked at the person so acting as if this person were somebody else waiting with intensity to see what would follow the person had taken a decisionwhich was evidently because an impulse long gathering had at last felt a sharpest pressure only how was the decision to be applied what in particular would the figure in the picture do she looked about her from the middle of the room under the force of this question as if there exactly were the field of action involved then as the door opened again she recognised whatever the action the form at any rate of a first opportunity her husband had reappearedhe stood before her refreshed almost radiant quite reassuring dressed anointed fragrant ready above all for his dinner he smiled at her over the end of their delay it was as if her opportunity had depended on his lookand now she saw that it was good there was still for the instant something in suspense but it passed more quickly than on his previous entrance he was already holding out his arms it was for hours and hours later on as if she had somehow been lifted aloft were floated and carried on some warm high tide beneath which stumbling blocks had sunk out of sight this came from her being again for the time in the enjoyment of confidence from her knowing as she believed what to do all the next day and all the next she appeared to herself to know it she had a plan and she rejoiced in her plan this consisted of the light that suddenly breaking into her restless reverie had marked the climax of that vigil it had come to her as a questionwhat if ive abandoned them you know what if ive accepted too passively the funny form of our life there would be a process of her own by which she might do differently in respect to amerigo and charlottea process quite independent of any process of theirs such a solution had but to rise before her to affect her to charm her with its simplicity an advantageous simplicity she had been stupid for so long not to have been struck by and the simplicity meanwhile seemed proved by the success that had already begun to attend her she had only had herself to do something to see how immediately it answered this consciousness of its having answered with her husband was the uplifting sustaining wave he had met hershe so put it to herself met her with an effect of generosity and of gaiety in especial on his coming back to her ready for dinner which she wore in her breast as the token of an escape for them both from something not quite definite but clearly much less good even at that moment in fact her plan had begun to work she had been when he brightly reappeared in the act of plucking it out of the heart of her earnestnessplucking it in the garden of thought as if it had been some fullblown flower that she could present to him on the spot well it was the flower of participation and as that then and there she held it out to him putting straightway into execution the idea so needlessly so absurdly obscured of her sharing with him whatever the enjoyment the interest the experience might beand sharing also for that matter with charlotte  she had thrown herself at dinner into every feature of the recent adventure of the companions letting him see without reserve that she wished to hear everything about it and making charlotte in particular charlottes judgment of matcham charlottes aspect her success there her effect traceably produced her clothes inimitably worn her cleverness gracefully displayed her social utility in fine brilliantly exemplified the subject of endless inquiry maggies inquiry was most empathetic moreover for the whole happy thought of the cathedralhunt which she was so glad they had entertained and as to the pleasant results of which down to the cold beef and breadandcheese the queer old smell and the dirty tablecloth at the inn amerigo was goodhumouredly responsive he had looked at her across the table more than once as if touched by the humility of this welcome offered to impressions at secondhand the amusements the large freedoms only of othersas if recognising in it something fairly exquisite and at the end while they were alone before she had rung for a servant he had renewed again his condonation of the little irregularity such as it was on which she had ventured they had risen together to come upstairs he had been talking at the last about some of the people at the very last of all about lady castledean and mr blint after which she had once more broken ground on the matter of the type of gloucester it brought her as he came round the table to join her yet another of his kind conscious stares one of the looks visibly beguiled but at the same time not invisibly puzzled with which he had already shown his sense of this charming grace of her curiosity it was as if he might for a moment be going to sayyou neednt pretend dearest quite so hard neednt think it necessary to care quite so muchit was as if he stood there before her with some such easy intelligence some such intimate reassurance on his lips her answer would have been all readythat she wasnt in the least pretending and she looked up at him while he took her hand with the maintenance the real persistence of her lucid little plan in her eyes she wanted him to understand from that very moment that she was going to be with him again quite with them together as she doubtless hadnt been since the funny changesthat was really all one could call theminto which they had each as for the sake of the others too easily and too obligingly slipped they had taken too much for granted that their life together required as people in london said a special formwhich was very well so long as the form was kept only for the outside world and was made no more of among themselves than the pretty mould of an iced pudding or something of that sort into which to help yourself you didnt hesitate to break with the spoon so much as that she would with an opening have allowed herself furthermore to observe she wanted him to understand how her scheme embraced charlotte too so that if he had but uttered the acknowledgment she judged him on the point of makingthe acknowledgment of his catching at her brave little idea for their caseshe would have found herself as distinctly voluble almost to eloquence  what befell however was that even while she thus waited she felt herself present at a process taking place rather deeper within him than the occasion on the whole appeared to require a process of weighing something in the balance of considering deciding dismissing he had guessed that she was there with an idea there in fact by reason of her idea only this oddly enough was what at the last stayed his words she was helped to these perceptions by his now looking at her still harder than he had yet donewhich really brought it to the turn of a hair for her that she didnt make sure his notion of her idea was the right one it was the turn of a hair because he had possession of her hands and was bending toward her ever so kindly as if to see to understand more or possibly give moreshe didnt know which and that had the effect of simply putting her as she would have said in his power she gave up let her idea go let everything go her one consciousness was that he was taking her again into his arms it was not till afterwards that she discriminated as to this felt how the act operated with him instead of the words he hadnt utteredoperated in his view as probably better than any words as always better in fact at any time than anything her acceptance of it her response to it inevitable foredoomed came back to her later on as a virtual assent to the assumption he had thus made that there was really nothing such a demonstration didnt anticipate and didnt dispose of and that the spring acting within herself moreover might well have been beyond any other the impulse legitimately to provoke it it made for any issue the third time since his return that he had drawn her to his breast and at present holding her to his side as they left the room he kept her close for their moving into the hall and across it kept her for their slow return together to the apartments above he had been right overwhelmingly right as to the felicity of his tenderness and the degree of her sensibility but even while she felt these things sweep all others away she tasted of a sort of terror of the weakness they produced in her it was still for her that she had positively something to do and that she mustnt be weak for this must much rather be strong for many hours after none the less she remained weakif weak it was though holding fast indeed to the theory of her success since her agitated overture had been after all so unmistakably met  she recovered soon enough on the whole the sense that this left her charlotte always to deal withcharlotte who at any rate however she might meet overtures must meet them at the worst more or less differently of that inevitability of such other ranges of response as were open to charlotte maggie took the measure in approaching her on the morrow of her return from matcham with the same show of desire to hear all her story she wanted the whole picture from her as she had wanted it from her companion and promptly in eaton square whither without the prince she repaired almost ostentatiously for the purpose this purpose only she brought her repeatedly back to the subject both in her husbands presence and during several scraps of independent colloquy before her father instinctively maggie took the ground that his wish for interesting echoes would be not less than her ownallowing that is for everything his wife would already have had to tell him for such passages between them as might have occurred since the evening before joining them after luncheon reaching them in her desire to proceed with the application of her idea before they had quitted the breakfastroom the scene of their midday meal she referred in her parents presence to what she might have lost by delay and expressed the hope that there would be an anecdote or two left for her to pick up charlotte was dressed to go out and her husband it appeared rather positively prepared not to he had left the table but was seated near the fire with two or three of the morning papers and the residuum of the second and third posts on a stand beside himmore even than the usual extravagance as maggies glance made out of circulars catalogues advertisements announcements of sales foreign envelopes and foreign handwritings that were as unmistakable as foreign clothes charlotte at the window looking into the sidestreet that abutted on the square might have been watching for their visitors advent before withdrawing and in the light strange and coloured like that of a painted picture which fixed the impression for her objects took on values not hitherto so fully shown it was the effect of her quickened sensibility she knew herself again in presence of a problem in need of a solution for which she must intensely work that consciousness lately born in her had been taught the evening before to accept a temporary lapse but had quickly enough again with her getting out of her own house and her walking across half the townfor she had come from portland place on footfound breath still in its lungs  it exhaled this breath in a sigh faint and unheard her tribute while she stood there before speaking to realities looming through the golden mist that had already begun to be scattered the conditions facing her had yielded for the time to the golden misthad considerably melted away but there they were again definite and it was for the next quarter of an hour as if she could have counted them one by one on her fingers sharp to her above all was the renewed attestation of her fathers comprehensive acceptances which she had so long regarded as of the same quality with her own but which so distinctly now she should have the complication of being obliged to deal with separately they had not yet struck her as absolutely extraordinarywhich had made for her lumping them with her own since her view of her own had but so lately begun to change though it instantly stood out for her that there was really no new judgment of them she should be able to show without attracting in some degree his attention without perhaps exciting his surprise and making thereby for the situation she shared with him some difference she was reminded and warned by the concrete image and for a minute charlottes face immediately presented to her affected her as searching her own to see the reminder tell she had not less promptly kissed her stepmother and then had bent over her father from behind and laid her cheek upon him little amenities tantamount heretofore to an easy change of guardcharlottes own frequent though always cheerful term of comparison for this process of transfer maggie figured thus as the relieving sentry and so smoothly did use and custom work for them that her mate might even on this occasion after acceptance of the password have departed without irrelevant and in strictness unsoldierly gossip this was not none the less what happened inasmuch as if our young woman had been floated over her first impulse to break the existing charm at a stroke it yet took her but an instant to sound at any risk the note she had been privately practising if she had practised it the day before at dinner on amerigo she knew but the better how to begin for it with mrs verver and it immensely helped her for that matter to be able at once to speak of the prince as having done more to quicken than to soothe her curiosity frankly and gaily she had come to askto ask what in their unusually prolonged campaign the two had achieved she had got out of her husband she admitted what she could but husbands were never the persons who answered such questions ideally he had only made her more curious and she had arrived early this way in order to miss as little as possible of charlottes story  wives papa she said are always much better reporters though i grant she added for charlotte that fathers are not much better than husbands he never she smiled tells me more than a tenth of what you tell him so i hope you havent told him everything yet since in that case i shall probably have lost the best part of it maggie went she wentshe felt herself going she reminded herself of an actress who had been studying a part and rehearsing it but who suddenly on the stage before the footlights had begun to improvise to speak lines not in the text it was this very sense of the stage and the footlights that kept her up made her rise higher just as it was the sense of action that logically involved some platformaction quite positively for the first time in her life or counting in the previous afternoon for the second the platform remained for three or four days thus sensibly under her feet and she had all the while with it the inspiration of quite remarkably of quite heroically improvising preparation and practice had come but a short way her part opened out and she invented from moment to moment what to say and to do she had but one rule of artto keep within bounds and not lose her head certainly she might see for a week how far that would take her she said to herself in her excitement that it was perfectly simple to bring about a difference touch by touch without letting either of the three and least of all her father so much as suspect her hand if they should suspect they would want a reason and the humiliating truth was that she wasnt ready with a reasonnot that is with what she would have called a reasonable one she thought of herself instinctively beautifully as having dealt all her life at her fathers side and by his example only in reasonable reasons and what she would really have been most ashamed of would be to produce for him in this line some inferior substitute unless she were in a position to plead definitely that she was jealous she should be in no position to plead decently that she was dissatisfied this latter condition would be a necessary implication of the former without the former behind it it would have to fall to the ground so had the case wonderfully been arranged for her there was a card she could play but there was only one and to play it would be to end the game she felt herselfas at the small square green table between the tall old silver candlesticks and the neatly arranged countersher fathers playmate and partner and what it constantly came back to in her mind was that for her to ask a question to raise a doubt to reflect in any degree on the play of the others would be to break the charm the charm she had to call it since it kept her companion so constantly engaged so perpetually seated and so contentedly occupied to say anything at all would be in fine to have to say why she was jealous and she could in her private hours but stare long with suffused eyes at that impossibility  by the end of a week the week that had begun especially with her morning hour in eaton square between her father and his wife her consciousness of being beautifully treated had become again verily greater than her consciousness of anything else and i must add moreover that she at last found herself rather oddly wondering what else as a consciousness could have been quite so overwhelming charlottes response to the experiment of being more with her ought as she very well knew to have stamped the experiment with the feeling of success so that if the success itself seemed a boon less substantial than the original image of it it enjoyed thereby a certain analogy with our young womans aftertaste of amerigos own determined demonstrations maggie was to have retained for that matter more than one aftertaste and if i have spoken of the impressions fixed in her as soon as she had so insidiously taken the field a definite note must be made of her perception during those moments of charlottes prompt uncertainty she had shown no doubtshe couldnt not have shownthat she had arrived with an idea quite exactly as she had shown her husband the night before that she was awaiting him with a sentiment this analogy in the two situations was to keep up for her the remembrance of a kinship of expression in the two faces in respect to which all she as yet professed to herself was that she had affected them or at any rate the sensibility each of them so admirably covered in the same way to make the comparison at all was for maggie to return to it often to brood upon it to extract from it the last dregs of its interestto play with it in short nervously vaguely incessantly as she might have played with a medallion containing on either side a cherished little portrait and suspended round her neck by a gold chain of a firm fineness that no effort would ever snap the miniatures were back to back but she saw them forever face to face and when she looked from one to the other she found in charlottes eyes the gleam of the momentary what does she really want that had come and gone for her in the princes so again she saw the other light the light touched into a glow both in portland place and in eaton square as soon as she had betrayed that she wanted no harmwanted no greater harm of charlotte that is than to take in that she meant to go out with her she had been present at that process as personally as she might have been present at some other domestic incident the hanging of a new picture say or the fitting of the principino with his first little trousers  she remained present accordingly all the week so charmingly and systematically did mrs verver now welcome her company charlotte had but wanted the hint and what was it but the hint after all that during the so subdued but so ineffaceable passage in the breakfastroom she had seen her take it had been taken moreover not with resignation not with qualifications or reserves however bland it had been taken with avidity with gratitude with a grace of gentleness that supplanted explanations the very liberality of this accommodation might indeed have appeared in the event to give its own account of the matteras if it had fairly written the princess down as a person of variations and had accordingly conformed but to a rule of tact in accepting these caprices for law the caprice actually prevailing happened to be that the advent of one of the ladies anywhere should till the fit had changed become the sign unfailingly of the advent of the other and it was emblazoned in rich colour on the bright face of this period that mrs verver only wished to know on any occasion what was expected of her only held herself there for instructions in order even to better them if possible the two young women while the passage lasted became again very much the companions of other days the days of charlottes prolonged visits to the admiring and bountiful maggie the days when equality of condition for them had been all the result of the latters native vagueness about her own advantages the earlier elements flushed into life again the frequency the intimacy the high pitch of accompanying expressionappreciation endearment confidence the rarer charm produced in each by this active contribution to the felicity of the other all enhanced furthermoreenhanced or qualified who should say whichby a new note of diplomacy almost of anxiety just sensible on charlottes part in particular of intensity of observance in the matter of appeal and response in the matter of making sure the princess might be disposed or gratified that resembled an attempt to play again with more refinement at disparity of relation charlottes attitude had in short its moments of flowering into pretty excesses of civility selfeffacements in the presence of others sudden little formalisms of suggestion and recognition that might have represented her sense of the duty of not losing sight of a social distinction this impression came out most for maggie when in their easier intervals they had only themselves to regard and when her companions inveteracy of never passing first of not sitting till she was seated of not interrupting till she appeared to give leave of not forgetting too familiarly that in addition to being important she was also sensitive had the effect of throwing over their intercourse a kind of silver tissue of decorum it hung there above them like a canopy of state a reminder that though the ladyinwaiting was an established favourite safe in her position a little queen however goodnatured was always a little queen and might with small warning remember it  and yet another of these concomitants of feverish success all the while was the perception that in another quarter too things were being made easy charlottes alacrity in meeting her had in one sense operated slightly overmuch as an intervention it had begun to reabsorb her at the very hour of her husbands showing her that to be all there as the phrase was he likewise only requiredas one of the other phrases was toothe straight tip she had heard him talk about the straight tip in his moods of amusement at english slang in his remarkable displays of assimilative power power worthy of better causes and higher inspirations and he had taken it from her at need in a way that certainly in the first glow of relief had made her brief interval seem large then however immediately and even though superficially there had declared itself a readjustment of relations to which she was once more practically a little sacrificed i must do everything she had said without letting papa see what i doat least till its done but she scarce knew how she proposed even for the next few days to blind or beguile this participant in her life what had in fact promptly enough happened she presently recognised was that if her stepmother had beautifully taken possession of her and if she had virtually been rather snatched again thereby from her husbands side so on the other hand this had with as little delay entailed some very charming assistance for her in eaton square when she went home with charlotte from whatever happy demonstration for the benefit of the world in which they supposed themselves to live that there was no smallest reason why their closer association shouldnt be public and acclaimed at these times she regularly found that amerigo had come either to sit with his fatherinlaw in the absence of the ladies or to make on his side precisely some such display of the easy working of the family life as would represent the equivalent of her excursions with charlotte under this particular impression it was that everything in maggie most melted and went to pieces every thing that is that belonged to her disposition to challenge the perfection of their common state it divided them again that was true this particular turn of the tidecut them up afresh into pairs and parties quite as if a sense for the equilibrium was what between them all had most power of insistence quite as if amerigo himself were all the while at bottom equally thinking of it and watching it but as against that he was making her father not miss her and he could have rendered neither of them a more excellent service he was acting in short on a cue the cue given him by observation it had been enough for him to see the shade of change in her behaviour his instinct for relations the most exquisite conceivable prompted him immediately to meet and match the difference to play somehow into its hands that was what it was she renewedly felt to have married a man who was sublimely a gentleman so that in spite of her not wanting to translate all their delicacies into the grossness of discussion she yet found again and again in portland place moments for saying if i didnt love you you know for yourself i should still love you for him he looked at her after such speeches as charlotte looked in eaton square when she called her attention to his benevolence through the dimness of the almost musing smile that took account of her extravagance harmless though it might be as a tendency to reckon with but my poor child charlotte might under this pressure have been on the point of replying thats the way nice people are all roundso that why should one be surprised about it were all nice togetheras why shouldnt we be if we hadnt been we wouldnt have gone farand i consider that weve gone very far indeed why should you take on as if you werent a perfect dear yourself capable of all the sweetest thingsas if you hadnt in fact grown up in an atmosphere the atmosphere of all the good things that i recognised even of old as soon as i came near you and that youve allowed me now between you to make so blessedly my own mrs verver might in fact have but just failed to make another point a point charmingly natural to her as a grateful and irreproachable wife it isnt a bit wonderful i may also remind you that your husband should find when opportunity permits worse things to do than to go about with mine i happen love to appreciate my husbandi happen perfectly to understand that his acquaintance should be cultivated and his company enjoyed  some such happilyprovoked remarks as these from charlotte at the other house had been in the air but we have seen how there was also in the air for our young woman as an emanation from the same source a distilled difference of which the very principle was to keep down objections and retorts that impression came backit had its hours of doing so and it may interest us on the ground of its having prompted in maggie a final reflection a reflection out of the heart of which a light flashed for her like a great flower grown in a night as soon as this light had spread a little it produced in some quarters a surprising distinctness made her of a sudden ask herself why there should have been even for three days the least obscurity the perfection of her success decidedly was like some strange shore to which she had been noiselessly ferried and where with a start she found herself quaking at the thought that the boat might have put off again and left her the word for it the word that flashed the light was that they were treating her that they were proceeding with herand for that matter with her fatherby a plan that was the exact counterpart of her own it was not from her that they took their cue butand this was what in particular made her sit upfrom each other and with a depth of unanimity an exact coincidence of inspiration that when once her attention had begun to fix it struck her as staring out at her in recovered identities of behaviour expression and tone they had a view of her situation and of the possible forms her own consciousness of it might takea view determined by the change of attitude they had had ever so subtly to recognise in her on their return from matcham they had had to read into this small and allbutsuppressed variation a mute commenton they didnt quite know what and it now arched over the princesss head like a vault of bold span that important communication between them on the subject couldnt have failed of being immediate this new perception bristled for her as we have said with odd intimations but questions unanswered played in and out of it as wellthe question for instance of why such promptitude of harmony should have been important ah when she began to recover piece by piece the process became lively she might have been picking small shining diamonds out of the sweepings of her ordered house she bent in this pursuit over her dustbin she challenged to the last grain the refuse of her innocent economy then it was that the dismissed vision of amerigo that evening in arrest at the door of her salottino while her eyes from her placed chair took him inthen it was that this immense little memory gave out its full power since the question was of doors she had afterwards she now saw shut it out she had responsibly shut in as we have understood shut in there with her sentient self only the fact of his reappearance and the plenitude of his presence these things had been testimony after all to supersede any other for on the spot even while she looked the warmlywashing wave had travelled far up the strand she had subsequently lived for hours she couldnt count under the dizzying smothering welter positively in submarine depths where everything came to her through walls of emerald and motherofpearl though indeed she had got her head above them for breath when face to face with charlotte again on the morrow in eaton square meanwhile none the less as was so apparent the prior the prime impression had remained in the manner of a spying servant on the other side of the barred threshold a witness availing himself in time of the lightest pretext to reenter it was as if he had found this pretext in her observed necessity of comparingcomparing the obvious common elements in her husbands and her stepmothers ways of now taking her with or without her witness at any rate she was led by comparison to a sense of the quantity of earnest intention operating and operating so harmoniously between her companions and it was in the mitigated midnight of these approximations that she had made out the promise of her dawn  it was a workedout scheme for their not wounding her for their behaving to her quite nobly to which each had in some winning way induced the other to contribute and which therefore so far as that went proved that she had become with them a subject of intimate study quickly quickly on a certain alarm taken eagerly and anxiously before they should without knowing it wound her they had signalled from house to house their clever idea the idea by which for all these days her own idea had been profiting they had built her in with their purposewhich was why above her a vault seemed more heavily to arch so that she sat there in the solid chamber of her helplessness as in a bath of benevolence artfully prepared for her over the brim of which she could but just manage to see by stretching her neck baths of benevolence were very well but at least unless one were a patient of some sort a nervous eccentric or a lost child one was usually not so immersed save by ones request it wasnt in the least what she had requested she had flapped her little wings as a symbol of desired flight not merely as a plea for a more gilded cage and an extra allowance of lumps of sugar above all she hadnt complained not by the quaver of a syllableso what wound in particular had she shown her fear of receiving what wound had she receivedas to which she had exchanged the least word with them if she had ever whined or moped they might have had some reason but she would be hangedshe conversed with herself in strong languageif she had been from beginning to end anything but pliable and mild it all came back in consequence to some required process of their own a process operating quite positively as a precaution and a policy they had got her into the bath and for consistency with themselves which was with each othermust keep her there in that condition she wouldnt interfere with the policy which was established which was arranged her thought over this arrived at a great intensityhad indeed its pauses and timidities but always to take afterwards a further and lighter spring the ground was wellnigh covered by the time she had made out her husband and his colleague as directly interested in preventing her freedom of movement policy or no policy it was they themselves who were arranged she must be kept in position so as not to disarrange them it fitted immensely together the whole thing as soon as she could give them a motive for strangely as it had by this time begun to appear to herself she had hitherto not imagined them sustained by an ideal distinguishably different from her own of course they were arrangedall four arranged but what had the basis of their life been precisely but that they were arranged together amerigo and charlotte were arranged together but sheto confine the matter only to herselfwas arranged apart it rushed over her the full sense of all this with quite another rush from that of the breaking wave of ten days before and as her father himself seemed not to meet the vaguely clutching hand with which during the first shock of complete perception she tried to steady herself she felt very much alone                                xxvii  there had been from far backthat is from the christmas time ona plan that the parent and the child should do something lovely together and they had recurred to it on occasion nursed it and brought it up theoretically though without as yet quite allowing it to put its feet to the ground the most it had done was to try a few steps on the drawingroom carpet with much attendance on either side much holding up and guarding much anticipation in fine of awkwardness or accident their companions by the same token had constantly assisted at the performance following the experiment with sympathy and gaiety and never so full of applause maggie now made out for herself as when the infant project had kicked its little legs most wildlykicked them for all the world across the channel and half the continent kicked them over the pyrenees and innocently crowed out some rich spanish name she asked herself at present if it had been a real belief that they were but wanting for some such adventure to snatch their moment whether either had at any instant seen it as workable save in the form of a toy to dangle before the other that they should take flight without wife or husband for one more look before they died at the madrid pictures as well as for a drop of further weak delay in respect to three or four possible prizes privately offered rarities of the first water responsibly reported on and profusely photographed still patiently awaiting their noiseless arrival in retreats to which the clue had not otherwise been given away the vision dallied with during the duskier days in eaton square had stretched to the span of three or four weeks of springtime for the total adventure three or four weeks in the very spirit after all of their regular life as their regular life had been persisting full of shared mornings afternoons evenings walks drives looksin at old places on vague chances full also in especial of that purchased social ease the sense of the comfort and credit of their house which had essentially the perfection of something paid for but which came on the whole so cheap that it might have been felt as costingas costing the parent and childnothing it was for maggie to wonder at present if she had been sincere about their going to ask herself whether she would have stuck to their plan even if nothing had happened  her view of the impossibility of sticking to it now may give us the measure of her sense that everything had happened a difference had been made in her relation to each of her companions and what it compelled her to say to herself was that to behave as she might have behaved before would be to act for amerigo and charlotte with the highest hypocrisy she saw in these days that a journey abroad with her father would more than anything else have amounted on his part and her own to a last expression of an ecstasy of confidence and that the charm of the idea in fact had been in some such sublimity day after day she put off the moment of speaking as she inwardly and very comprehensively called itspeaking that is to her father and all the more that she was ridden by a strange suspense as to his himself breaking silence she gave him time gave him during several days that morning that noon that night and the next and the next and the next even made up her mind that if he stood off longer it would be proof conclusive that he too wasnt at peace they would then have been all successfully throwing dust in each others eyes and it would be at last as if they must turn away their faces since the silver mist that protected them had begun to grow sensibly thin finally at the   end of april she decided that if he should say nothing for another period of twentyfour hours she must take it as showing that they were in her private phraseology lost so little possible sincerity could there be in pretending to care for a journey to spain at the approach of a summer that already promised to be hot such a proposal on his lips such an extravagance of optimism would be his way of being consistentfor that he didnt really want to move or to move further at the worst than back to fawns again could only signify that he wasnt at heart contented what he wanted at any rate and what he didnt want were in the event put to the proof for maggie just in time to give her a fresh wind she had been dining with her husband in eaton square on the occasion of hospitality offered by mr and mrs verver to lord and lady castledean the propriety of some demonstration of this sort had been for many days before our group the question reduced to the mere issue of which of the two houses should first take the field the issue had been easily settledin the manner of every issue referred in any degree to amerigo and charlotte the initiative obviously belonged to mrs verver who had gone to matcham while maggie had stayed away and the evening in eaton square might have passed for a demonstration all the more personal that the dinner had been planned on intimate lines six other guests only in addition to the host and the hostess of matcham made up the company and each of these persons had for maggie the interest of an attested connection with the easter revels at that visionary house their common memory of an occasion that had clearly left behind it an ineffaceable charm this air of beatific reference less subdued in the others than in amerigo and charlotte lent them together an inscrutable comradeship against which the young womans imagination broke in a small vain wave  it wasnt that she wished she had been of the remembered party and possessed herself of its secrets for she didnt care about its secretsshe could concern herself at present absolutely with no secret but her own what occurred was simply that she became aware at a stroke of the quantity of further nourishment required by her own and of the amount of it she might somehow extract from these people whereby she rose of a sudden to the desire to possess and use them even to the extent of braving of fairly defying of directly exploiting of possibly quite enjoying under cover of an evil duplicity the felt element of curiosity with which they regarded her once she was conscious of the flitting wing of this last impressionthe perception irresistible that she was something for their queer experience just as they were something for hersthere was no limit to her conceived design of not letting them escape she went and went again tonight after her start was taken went positively as she had felt herself going three weeks before on the morning when the vision of her father and his wife awaiting her together in the breakfastroom had been so determinant in this other scene it was lady castledean who was determinant who kindled the light or at all events the heat and who acted on the nerves lady castledean whom she knew she so oddly didnt like in spite of reasons upon reasons the biggest diamonds on the yellowest hair the longest lashes on the prettiest falsest eyes the oldest lace on the most violet velvet the rightest manner on the wrongest assumption her ladyships assumption was that she kept at every moment of her life every advantageit made her beautifully soft very nearly generous so she didnt distinguish the little protuberant eyes of smaller social insects often endowed with such a range from the other decorative spots on their bodies and wings maggie had liked in london and in the world at large so many more people than she had thought it right to fear right even to so much as judge that it positively quickened her fever to have to recognise in this case such a lapse of all the sequences it was only that a charming clever woman wondered about herthat is wondered about her as amerigos wife and wondered moreover with the intention of kindness and the spontaneity almost of surprise  the point of viewthat onewas what she read in their free contemplation in that of the whole eight there was something in amerigo to be explained and she was passed about all tenderly and expertly like a dressed doll held in the right manner by its firmlystuffed middle for the account she could give she might have been made to give it by pressure of her stomach she might have been expected to articulate with a rare imitation of nature oh yes im here all the while im also in my way a solid little fact and i cost originally a great deal of money cost that is my father for my outfit and let in my husband for an amount of painstoward my trainingthat money would scarce represent well she would meet them in some such way and she translated her idea into action after dinner before they dispersed by engaging them all unconventionally almost violently to dine with her in portland place just as they were if they didnt mind the same party which was the party she wanted oh she was going she was goingshe could feel it afresh it was a good deal as if she had sneezed ten times or had suddenly burst into a comic song there were breaks in the connection as there would be hitches in the process she didnt wholly see yet what they would do for her nor quite how herself she should handle them but she was dancing up and down beneath her propriety with the thought that she had at least begun somethingshe so fairly liked to feel that she was a point for convergence of wonder it wasnt after all either that their wonder so much signifiedthat of the cornered six whom it glimmered before her that she might still live to drive about like a flock of sheep the intensity of her consciousness its sharpest savour was in the theory of her having diverted having as they said captured the attention of amerigo and charlotte at neither of whom all the while did she so much as once look she had pitched them in with the six for that matter so far as they themselves were concerned they had dropped for the succession of minutes out of contact with their function had in short startled and impressed abandoned their post theyre paralysed theyre paralysed she commented deep within so much it helped her own apprehension to hang together that they should suddenly lose their bearings  her grasp of appearances was thus out of proportion to her view of causes but it came to her then and there that if she could only get the facts of appearance straight only jam them down into their place the reasons lurking behind them kept uncertain for the eyes by their wavering and shifting wouldnt perhaps be able to help showing it wasnt of course that the prince and mrs verver marvelled to see her civil to their friends it was rather precisely that civil was just what she wasnt she had so departed from any such custom of delicate approachapproach by the permitted note the suggested if the accepted vaguenessas would enable the people in question to put her off if they wished and the profit of her plan the effect of the violence she was willing to let it go for was exactly in their being the people in question people she had seemed to be rather shy of before and for whom she suddenly opened her mouth so wide later on we may add with the ground soon covered by her agitated but resolute step it was to cease to matter what people they were or werent but meanwhile the particular sense of them that she had taken home tonight had done her the service of seeming to break the ice where that formation was thickest still more unexpectedly the service might have been the same for her father inasmuch as immediately when everyone had gone he did exactly what she had been waiting for and despairing ofand did it as he did everything with a simplicity that left any purpose of sounding him deeper of drawing him out further of going in his own frequent phrase behind what he said nothing whatever to do he brought it out straight made it bravely and beautifully irrelevant save for the plea of what they should lose by breaking the charm i guess we wont go down there after all will we magjust when its getting so pleasant here that was all with nothing to lead up to it but it was done for her at a stroke and done not less more rather for amerigo and charlotte on whom the immediate effect as she secretly as she almost breathlessly measured it was prodigious everything now so fitted for her to everything else that she could feel the effect as prodigious even while sticking to her policy of giving the pair no look there were thus some five wonderful minutes during which they loomed to her sightless eyes on either side of her larger than they had ever loomed before larger than life larger than thought larger than any danger or any safety there was thus a space of time in fine fairly vertiginous for her during which she took no more account of them than if they were not in the room  she had never never treated them in any such waynot even just now when she had plied her art upon the matcham band her present manner was an intenser exclusion and the air was charged with their silence while she talked with her other companion as if she had nothing but him to consider he had given her the note amazingly by his allusion to the pleasantnessthat of such an occasion as his successful dinnerwhich might figure as their bribe for renouncing so that it was all as if they were speaking selfishly counting on a repetition of just such extensions of experience maggie achieved accordingly an act of unprecedented energy threw herself into her fathers presence as by the absolute consistency with which she held his eyes saying to herself at the same time that she smiled and talked and inaugurated her system what does he mean by it thats the questionwhat does he mean but studying again all the signs in him that recent anxiety had made familiar and counting the stricken minutes on the part of the others it was in their silence that the others loomed as she felt she had had no measure she afterwards knew of this duration but it drew out and outreally to what would have been called in simpler conditions awkwardnessas if she herself were stretching the cord ten minutes later however in the homeward carriage to which her husband cutting delay short had proceeded at the first announcement ten minutes later she was to stretch it almost to breaking the prince had permitted her to linger much less before his move to the door than they usually lingered at the gossiping close of such evenings which she all responsive took for a sign of his impatience to modify for her the odd effect of his not having and of charlottes not having instantly acclaimed the issue of the question debated or more exactly settled before them he had had time to become aware of this possible impression in her and his virtually urging her into the carriage was connected with his feeling that he must take action on the new ground a certain ambiguity in her would absolutely have tormented him but he had already found something to soothe and correctas to which she had on her side a shrewd notion of what it would be she was herself for that matter prepared and she was of a truth as she took her seat in the brougham amazed at her preparation it allowed her scarce an interval she brought it straight out  i was certain that was what father would say if i should leave him alone i have been leaving him alone and you see the effect he hates now to movehe likes too much to be with us but if you see the effectshe felt herself magnificently keeping it up perhaps you dont see the cause the cause my dear is too lovely  her husband on taking his place beside her had during a minute or two for her watching sense neither said nor done anything he had been for that sense as if thinking waiting deciding yet it was still before he spoke that he as she felt it to be definitely acted he put his arm round her and drew her close indulged in the demonstration the long firm embrace by his single arm the infinite pressure of her whole person to his own that such opportunities had so often suggested and prescribed held accordingly and as she could but too intimately feel exquisitely solicited she had said the thing she was intending and desiring to say and as to which she felt even more than she felt anything else that whatever he might do she mustnt be irresponsible yes she was in his exerted grasp and she knew what that was but she was at the same time in the grasp of her conceived responsibility and the extraordinary thing was that of the two intensities the second was presently to become the sharper he took his time for it meanwhile but he met her speech after a fashion  the cause of your fathers deciding not to go  yes and of my having wanted to let it act for him quietlyi mean without my insistence she had in her compressed state another pause and it made her feel as if she were immensely resisting strange enough was this sense for her and altogether new the sense of possessing by miraculous help some advantage that absolutely then and there in the carriage as they rolled she might either give up or keep strange inexpressibly strangeso distinctly she saw that if she did give it up she should somehow give up everything for ever and what her husbands grasp really meant as her very bones registered was that she should give it up it was exactly for this that he had resorted to unfailing magic he knew how to resort to ithe could be on occasion as she had lately more than ever learned so munificent a lover all of which was precisely a part of the character she had never ceased to regard in him as princely a part of his large and beautiful ease his genius for charm for intercourse for expression for life she should have but to lay her head back on his shoulder with a certain movement to make it definite for him that she didnt resist to this as they went every throb of her consciousness prompted herevery throb that is but one the throb of her deeper need to know where she really was by the time she had uttered the rest of her idea therefore she was still keeping her head and intending to keep it though she was also staring out of the carriagewindow with eyes into which the tears of suffered pain had risen indistinguishable perhaps happily in the dusk she was making an effort that horribly hurt her and as she couldnt cry out her eyes swam in her silence with them all the same through the square opening beside her through the grey panorama of the london night she achieved the feat of not losing sight of what she wanted and her lips helped and protected her by being able to be gay its not to leave you my dearfor that hell give up anything just as he would go off anywhere i think you know if you would go with him i mean you and he alone maggie pursued with her gaze out of her window  for which amerigos answer again took him a moment ah the dear old boy you would like me to propose him something  well if you think you could bear it  and leave the prince asked you and charlotte alone  why not maggie had also to wait a minute but when she spoke it came clear why shouldnt charlotte be just one of my reasonsmy not liking to leave her she has always been so good so perfect to mebut never so wonderfully as just now we have somehow been more togetherthinking for the time almost only of each other it has been quite as in old days and she proceeded consummately for she felt it as consummate its as if we had been missing each other had got a little apartthough going on so side by side but the good moments if one only waits for them she hastened to add come round of themselves moreover youve seen for yourself since youve made it up so to father feeling for yourself in your beautiful way every difference every air that blows not having to be told or pushed only being perfect to live with through your habit of kindness and your exquisite instincts but of course youve seen all the while that both he and i have deeply felt how youve managed managed that he hasnt been too much alone and that i on my side havent appeared towhat you might call neglect him this is always she continued what i can never bless you enough for of all the good things youve done for me youve never done anything better she went on explaining as for the pleasure of explainingeven though knowing he must recognise as a part of his easy way too her description of his large liberality your taking the child down yourself those days and your coming each time to bring him awaynothing in the world nothing you could have invented would have kept father more under the charm besides you know how youve always suited him and how youve always so beautifully let it seem to him that he suits you only it has been these last weeks as if you wishedjust in order to please himto remind him of it afresh so there it is she wound up its your doing youve produced your effectthat of his wanting not to be even for a month or two where youre not he doesnt want to bother or bore youthat i think you know he never has done and if youll only give me time ill come round again to making it my care as always that he shant but he cant bear you out of his sight  she had kept it up and up filling it out crowding it in and all really without difficulty for it was every word of it thanks to a long evolution of feeling what she had been primed to the brim with she made the picture forced it upon him hung it before him remembering happily how he had gone so far one day supported by the principino as to propose the zoo in eaton square to carry with him there on the spot under this pleasant inspiration both his elder and his younger companion with the latter of whom he had taken the tone that they were introducing granddaddy granddaddy nervous and rather funking it to lions and tigers more or less at large touch by touch she thus dropped into her husbands silence the truth about his good nature and his good manners and it was this demonstration of his virtue precisely that added to the strangeness even for herself of her failing as yet to yield to him it would be a question but of the most trivial act of surrender the vibration of a nerve the mere movement of a muscle but the act grew important between them just through her doing perceptibly nothing nothing but talk in the very tone that would naturally have swept her into tenderness she knew more and moreevery lapsing minute taught herhow he might by a single rightness make her cease to watch him that rightness a million miles removed from the queer actual falling so short which would consist of his breaking out to her diviningly indulgently with the last happy inconsequence come away with me somewhere youand then we neednt think we neednt even talk of anything of anyone else five words like that would answer her would break her utterly down but they were the only ones that would so serve she waited for them and there was a supreme instant when by the testimony of all the rest of him she seemed to feel them in his heart and on his lips only they didnt sound and as that made her wait again so it made her more intensely watch this in turn showed her that he too watched and waited and how much he had expected something that he now felt wouldnt come yes it wouldnt come if he didnt answer her if he but said the wrong things instead of the right if he could say the right everything would comeit hung by a hair that everything might crystallise for their recovered happiness at his touch this possibility glowed at her however for fifty seconds only then to turn cold and as it fell away from her she felt the chill of reality and knew again all but pressed to his heart and with his breath upon her cheek the slim rigour of her attitude a rigour beyond that of her natural being they had silences at last that were almost crudities of mutual resistancesilences that persisted through his felt effort to treat her recurrence to the part he had lately played to interpret all the sweetness of her so talking to him as a manner of making love to him ah it was no such manner heaven knew for maggie she could make love if this had been in question better than that on top of which it came to her presently to say keeping in with what she had already spoken except of course that for the question of going off somewhere hed go readily quite delightedly with you i verily believe hed like to have you for a while to himself  do you mean he thinks of proposing it the prince after a moment sounded  oh nohe doesnt ask as you must so often have seen but i believe hed go like a shot as you say if you were to suggest it  it had the air she knew of a kind of condition made and she had asked herself while she spoke if it wouldnt cause his arm to let her go the fact that it didnt suggested to her that she had made him of a sudden still more intensely think think with such concentration that he could do but one thing at once and it was precisely as if the concentration had the next moment been proved in him he took a turn inconsistent with the superficial impressiona jump that made light of their approach to gravity and represented for her the need in him to gain time that she made out was his drawbackthat the warning from her had come to him and had come to charlotte after all too suddenly that they were in face of it rearranging that they had to rearrange was all before her again yet to do as they would like they must enjoy a snatch longer or shorter of recovered independence amerigo for the instant was but doing as he didnt like and it was as if she were watching his effort without disguise whats your fathers idea this year then about fawns will he go at whitsuntide and will he then stay on  maggie went through the form of thought he will really do i imagine as he has in so many ways so often done before do whatever may seem most agreeable to yourself and theres of course always charlotte to be considered only their going early to fawns if they do go she said neednt in the least entail your and my going  ah amerigo echoed it neednt in the least entail your and my going  we can do as we like what they may do neednt trouble us since theyre by good fortune perfectly happy together  oh the prince returned your fathers never so happy as with you near him to enjoy his being so  well i may enjoy it said maggie but im not the cause of it  youre the cause her husband declared of the greater part of everything thats good among us but she received this tribute in silence and the next moment he pursued if mrs verver has arrears of time with you to make up as you say shell scarcely do itor you scarcely willby our cutting your and my cutting too loose  i see what you mean maggie mused  he let her for a little to give her attention to it after which shall i just quite of a sudden he asked propose him a journey  maggie hesitated but she brought forth the fruit of reflection it would have the merit that charlotte then would be with me with me i mean so much more also that i shouldnt by choosing such a time for going away seem unconscious and ungrateful seem not to respond seem in fact rather to wish to shake her off i should respond on the contrary very markedlyby being here alone with her for a month  and would you like to be here alone with her for a month  i could do with it beautifully or we might even she said quite gaily go together down to fawns  you could be so very content without me the prince presently inquired  yes my own dearif you could be content for a while with father that would keep me up i might for the time she went on go to stay there with charlotte or better still she might come to portland place  oho said the prince with cheerful vagueness  i should feel you see she continued that the two of us were showing the same sort of kindness  amerigo thought the two of us charlotte and i  maggie again hesitated you and i darling  i see i seehe promptly took it in and what reason shall i givegive i mean your father  for asking him to go off why the very simplestif you conscientiously can the desire said maggie to be agreeable to him just that only  something in this reply made her husband again reflect conscientiously why shouldnt i conscientiously it wouldnt by your own contention he developed represent any surprise for him i must strike him sufficiently as at the worst the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him  ah there it was again for maggiethe note already sounded the note of the felt need of not working harm why this precautionary view she asked herself afresh when her father had complained at the very least as little as herself with their stillness together so perfect what had suggested so around them the attitude of sparing them her inner vision fixed it once more this attitude saw it in the others as vivid and concrete extended it straight from her companion to charlotte before she was well aware accordingly she had echoed in this intensity of thought amerigos last words youre the last person in the world to wish to do anything to hurt him  she heard herself heard her tone after she had spoken and heard it the more that for a minute after she felt her husbands eyes on her face very close too close for her to see him he was looking at her because he was struck and looking hardthough his answer when it came was straight enough why isnt that just what we have been talking aboutthat ive affected you as fairly studying his comfort and his pleasure he might show his sense of it the prince went on by proposing to me an excursion  and you would go with him maggie immediately asked  he hung fire but an instant per dio  she also had her pause but she broke itsince gaiety was in the airwith an intense smile you can say that safely because the proposals one that of his own motion he wont make  she couldnt have narrated afterwardsand in fact was at a loss to tell herselfby what transition what rather marked abruptness of change in their personal relation their drive came to its end with a kind of interval established almost confessed to between them she felt it in the tone with which he repeated after her safely  safely as regards being thrown with him perhaps after all in such a case too long hes a person to think you might easily feel yourself to be so it wont maggie said come from father hes too modest  their eyes continued to meet on it from corner to corner of the brougham oh your modesty between you but he still smiled for it so that unless i insist  we shall simply go on as we are  well were going on beautifully he answeredthough by no means with the effect it would have had if their mute transaction that of attempted capture and achieved escape had not taken place as maggie said nothing none the less to gainsay his remark it was open to him to find himself the next moment conscious of still another idea i wonder if it would do i mean for me to break in  to break in  between your father and his wife but there would be a way he saidwe can make charlotte ask him and then as maggie herself now wondered echoing it again we can suggest to her to suggest to him that he shall let me take him off  oh said maggie  then if he asks her why i so suddenly break out shell be able to tell him the reason  they were stopping and the footman who had alighted had rung at the housedoor that you think it would be so charming  that i think it would be so charming that weve persuaded her will be convincing  i see maggie went on while the footman came back to let them out i see she said again though she felt a little disconcerted what she really saw of a sudden was that her stepmother might report her as above all concerned for the proposal and this brought her back her need that her father shouldnt think her concerned in any degree for anything she alighted the next instant with a slight sense of defeat her husband to let her out had passed before her and a little in advance he awaited her on the edge of the low terrace a step high that preceded their open entrance on either side of which one of their servants stood the sense of a life tremendously ordered and fixed rose before her and there was something in amerigos very face while his eyes again met her own through the dusky lamplight that was like a conscious reminder of it he had answered her just before distinctly and it appeared to leave her nothing to say it was almost as if having planned for the last word she saw him himself enjoying it it was almost as ifin the strangest way in the worldhe were paying her back by the production of a small pang that of a new uneasiness for the way she had slipped from him during their drive                                xxviii  maggies new uneasiness might have had time to drop inasmuch as she not only was conscious during several days that followed of no fresh indication for it to feed on but was even struck in quite another way with an augmentation of the symptoms of that difference she had taken it into her head to work for she recognised by the end of a week that if she had been in a manner caught up her father had been not less sowith the effect of her husbands and his wifes closing in together round them and of their all having suddenly begun as a party of four to lead a life gregarious and from that reason almost hilarious so far as the easy sound of it went as never before it might have been an accident and a mere coincidenceso at least she said to herself at first but a dozen chances that furthered the whole appearance had risen to the surface pleasant pretexts oh certainly pleasant as pleasant as amerigo in particular could make them for associated undertakings quite for shared adventures for its always turning out amusingly that they wanted to do very much the same thing at the same time and in the same way funny all this was to some extent in the light of the fact that the father and daughter for so long had expressed so few positive desires yet it would be sufficiently natural that if amerigo and charlotte had at last got a little tired of each others company they should find their relief not so much in sinking to the rather low level of their companions as in wishing to pull the latter into the train in which they so constantly moved were in the train maggie mutely reflected after the dinner in eaton square with lady castledean weve suddenly waked up in it and found ourselves rushing along very much as if we had been put in during sleepshoved like a pair of labelled boxes into the van and since i wanted to go im certainly going she might have added im moving without troubletheyre doing it all for us its wonderful how they understand and how perfectly it succeeds for that was the thing she had most immediately to acknowledge it seemed as easy for them to make a quartette as it had formerly so long appeared for them to make a pair of couplesthis latter being thus a discovery too absurdly belated the only point at which day after day the success appeared at all qualified was represented as might have been said by her irresistible impulse to give her father a clutch when the train indulged in one of its occasional lurches thenthere was no denying ithis eyes and her own met so that they were themselves doing active violence as against the others to that very spirit of union or at least to that very achievement of change which she had taken the field to invoke  the maximum of change was reached no doubt the day the matcham party dined in portland place the day really perhaps of maggies maximum of social glory in the sense of its showing for her own occasion her very own with every one else extravagantly rallying and falling in absolutely conspiring to make her its heroine it was as if her father himself always with more initiative as a guest than as a host had dabbled too in the conspiracy and the impression was not diminished by the presence of the assinghams likewise very much caughtup now after something of a lull by the sidewind of all the rest of the motion and giving our young woman so far at least as fanny was concerned the sense of some special intention of encouragement and applause fanny who had not been present at the other dinner thanks to a preference entertained and expressed by charlotte made a splendid show at this one in new orangecoloured velvet with multiplied turquoises and with a confidence furthermore as different as possible her hostess inferred from her toomarked betrayal of a belittled state at matcham maggie was not indifferent to her own opportunity to redress this balancewhich seemed for the hour part of a general rectification she liked making out for herself that on the high level of portland place a spot exempt on all sorts of grounds from jealous jurisdictions her friend could feel as good as any one and could in fact at moments almost appear to take the lead in recognition and celebration so far as the evening might conduce to intensify the lustre of the little princess mrs assingham produced on her the impression of giving her constantly her cue for this and it was in truth partly by her help intelligently quite gratefully accepted that the little princess in maggie was drawn out and emphasised she couldnt definitely have said how it happened but she felt herself for the first time in her career living up to the public and popular notion of such a personage as it pressed upon her from all round rather wondering inwardly too while she did so at that strange mixture in things through which the popular notion could be evidenced for her by such supposedly great ones of the earth as the castledeans and their kind fanny assingham might really have been there at all events like one of the assistants in the ring at the circus to keep up the pace of the sleek revolving animal on whose back the lady in short spangled skirts should brilliantly caper and posture that was all doubtless maggie had forgotten had neglected had declined to be the little princess on anything like the scale open to her but now that the collective hand had been held out to her with such alacrity so that she might skip up into the light even as seemed to her modest mind with such a show of pink stocking and such an abbreviation of white petticoat she could strike herself as perceiving under arched eyebrows where her mistake had been she had invited for the later hours after her dinner a fresh contingent the whole list of her apparent london acquaintance which was again a thing in the manner of little princesses for whom the princely art was a matter of course that was what she was learning to do to fill out as a matter of course her appointed her expected her imposed character and though there were latent considerations that somewhat interfered with the lesson she was having tonight an inordinate quantity of practice none of it so successful as when quite wittingly she directed it at lady castledean who was reduced by it at last to an unprecedented state of passivity the perception of this high result caused mrs assingham fairly to flush with responsive joy she glittered at her young friend from moment to moment quite feverishly it was positively as if her young friend had in some marvellous sudden supersubtle way become a source of succour to herself become beautifully divinely retributive the intensity of the taste of these registered phenomena was in fact that somehow by a process and through a connexion not again to be traced she so practised at the same time on amerigo and charlottewith only the drawback her constant check and secondthought that she concomitantly practised perhaps still more on her father  this last was a danger indeed that for much of the ensuing time had its hours of strange beguilementthose at which her sense for precautions so suffered itself to lapse that she felt her communion with him more intimate than any other it couldnt but pass between them that something singular was happeningso much as this she again and again said to herself whereby the comfort of it was there after all to be noted just as much as the possible peril and she could think of the couple they formed together as groping with sealed lips but with mutual looks that had never been so tender for some freedom some fiction some figured bravery under which they might safely talk of it the moment was to comeand it finally came with an effect as penetrating as the sound that follows the pressure of an electric buttonwhen she read the least helpful of meanings into the agitation she had created the merely specious description of their case would have been that after being for a long time as a family delightfully uninterruptedly happy they had still had a new felicity to discover a felicity for which blessedly her fathers appetite and her own in particular had been kept fresh and grateful this livelier march of their intercourse as a whole was the thing that occasionally determined in him the clutching instinct we have glanced at very much as if he had said to her in default of her breaking silence first everything is remarkably pleasant isnt itbut where for it after all are we up in a balloon and whirling through space or down in the depths of the earth in the glimmering passages of a goldmine the equilibrium the precious condition lasted in spite of rearrangement there had been a fresh distribution of the different weights but the balance persisted and triumphed all of which was just the reason why she was forbidden face to face with the companion of her adventure the experiment of a test if they balanced they balancedshe had to take that it deprived her of every pretext for arriving by however covert a process at what he thought  but she had her hours thus of feeling supremely linked to him by the rigour of their law and when it came over her that all the while the wish on his side to spare her might be what most worked with him this very fact of their seeming to have nothing inward really to talk about wrapped him up for her in a kind of sweetness that was wanting as a consecration even in her yearning for her husband she was powerless however was only more utterly hushed when the interrupting flash came when she would have been all ready to say to him yes this is by every appearance the best time weve had yet but dont you see all the same how they must be working together for it and how my very success my success in shifting our beautiful harmony to a new basis comes round to being their success above all their cleverness their amiability their power to hold out their complete possession in short of our life for how could she say as much as that without saying a great deal more without saying theyll do everything in the world that suits us save only one thingprescribe a line for us that will make them separate how could she so much as imagine herself even faintly murmuring that without putting into his mouth the very words that would have made her quail separate my dear do you want them to separate then you want us toyou and me for how can the one separation take place without the other that was the question that in spirit she had heard him askwith its dread train moreover of involved and connected inquiries their own separation his and hers was of course perfectly thinkable but only on the basis of the sharpest of reasons well the sharpest the very sharpest would be that they could no longer afford as it were he to let his wife she to let her husband run them in such compact formation and say they accepted this account of their situation as a practical finality acting upon it and proceeding to a division would no sombre ghosts of the smothered past on either side show across the widening strait pale unappeased faces or raise in the very passage deprecating denouncing hands  meanwhile however such things might be she was to have occasion to say to herself that there might be but a deeper treachery in recoveries and reassurances she was to feel alone again as she had felt at the issue of her high tension with her husband during their return from meeting the castledeans in eaton square the evening in question had left her with a larger alarm but then a lull had comethe alarm after all was yet to be confirmed there came an hour inevitably when she knew with a chill what she had feared and why it had taken this hour a month to arrive but to find it before her was thoroughly to recognise it for it showed her sharply what amerigo had meant in alluding to a particular use that they might make for their reaffirmed harmony and prosperity of charlotte the more she thought at present of the tone he had employed to express their enjoyment of this resource the more it came back to her as the product of a conscious art of dealing with her he had been conscious at the moment of many thingsconscious even not a little of desiring and thereby of needing to see what she would do in a given case the given case would be that of her being to a certain extent as she might fairly make it out menaced horrible as it was to impute to him any intention represented by such a word why it was that to speak of making her stepmother intervene as they might call it in a question that seemed just then and there quite peculiarly their own businesswhy it was that a turn so familiar and so easy should at the worst strike her as charged with the spirit of a threat was an oddity disconnected for her temporarily from its grounds the adventure of an imagination within her that possibly had lost its way that precisely was doubtless why she had learned to wait as the weeks passed by with a fair or rather indeed with an excessive imitation of resumed serenity there had been no prompt sequel to the princes equivocal light and that made for patience yet she was none the less to have to admit after delay that the bread he had cast on the waters had come home and that she should thus be justified of her old apprehension the consequence of this in turn was a renewed pang in presence of his remembered ingenuity to be ingenious with herwhat didnt what mightnt that mean when she had so absolutely never at any point of contact with him put him by as much as the value of a penny to the expense of sparing doubting fearing her of having in any way whatever to reckon with her the ingenuity had been in his simply speaking of their use of charlotte as if it were common to them in an equal degree and his triumph on the occasion had been just in the simplicity she couldntand he knew itsay what was true oh you use her and i use her if you will yes but we use her ever so differently and separatelynot at all in the same way or degree theres nobody we really use together but ourselves dont you seeby which i mean that where our interests are the same i can so beautifully so exquisitely serve you for everything and you can so beautifully so exquisitely serve me the only person either of us needs is the other of us so why as a matter of course in such a case as this drag in charlotte  she couldnt so challenge him because it would have beenand there she was paralysedthe note it would have translated itself on the spot for his ear into jealousy and from reverberation to repercussion would have reached her fathers exactly in the form of a cry piercing the stillness of peaceful sleep it had been for many days almost as difficult for her to catch a quiet twenty minutes with her father as it had formerly been easy there had been in fact of oldthe time so strangely seemed already far awayan inevitability in her longer passages with him a sort of domesticated beauty in the calculability round about them of everything but at present charlotte was almost always there when amerigo brought her to eaton square where amerigo was constantly bringing her and amerigo was almost always there when charlotte brought her husband to portland place where charlotte was constantly bringing him the fractions of occasions the chance minutes that put them face to face had as yet of late contrived to count but little between them either for the sense of opportunity or for that of exposure inasmuch as the lifelong rhythm of their intercourse made against all cursory handling of deep things they had never availed themselves of any given quarterofanhour to gossip about fundamentals they moved slowly through large still spaces they could be silent together at any time beautifully with much more comfort than hurriedly expressive it appeared indeed to have become true that their common appeal measured itself for vividness just by this economy of sound they might have been talking at each other when they talked with their companions but these latter assuredly were not in any directer way to gain light on the current phase of their relation such were some of the reasons for which maggie suspected fundamentals as i have called them to be rising by a new movement to the surfacesuspected it one morning late in may when her father presented himself in portland place alone he had his pretextof that she was fully aware the principino two days before had shown signs happily not persistent of a feverish cold and had notoriously been obliged to spend the interval at home this was ground ample ground for punctual inquiry but what it wasnt ground for she quickly found herself reflecting was his having managed in the interest of his visit to dispense so unwontedlyas their life had recently come to be arrangedwith his wifes attendance it had so happened that she herself was for the hour exempt from her husbands and it will at once be seen that the hour had a quality all its own when i note that remembering how the prince had looked in to say he was going out the princess whimsically wondered if their respective sposi mightnt frankly be meeting whimsically hoped indeed they were temporarily so disposed of strange was her need at moments to think of them as not attaching an excessive importance to their repudiation of the general practice that had rested only a few weeks before on such a consecrated rightness repudiations surely were not in the airthey had none of them come to that for wasnt she at this minute testifying directly against them by her own behaviour when she should confess to fear of being alone with her father to fear of what he might thenah with such a slow painful motion as she had a horror ofsay to her then would be time enough for amerigo and charlotte to confess to not liking to appear to foregather  she had this morning a wonderful consciousness both of dreading a particular question from him and of being able to check yes even to disconcert magnificently by her apparent manner of receiving it any restless imagination he might have about its importance the day bright and soft had the breath of summer it made them talk to begin with of fawns of the way fawns invitedmaggie aware the while that in thus regarding with him the sweetness of its invitation to one couple just as much as to another her humbugging smile grew very nearly convulsive that was it and there was relief truly of a sort in taking it in she was humbugging him already by absolute necessity as she had never never done in her lifedoing it up to the full height of what she had allowed for the necessity in the great dimlyshining room where declining for his reasons to sit down he moved about in amerigos very footsteps the necessity affected her as pressing upon her with the very force of the charm itself of the old pleasantness between them so candidly playing up there again of the positive flatness of their tenderness a surface all for familiar use quite as if generalised from the long succession of tapestried sofas sweetly faded on which his theory of contentment had sat through unmeasured pauses beside her own she knew from this instant knew in advance and as well as anything would ever teach her that she must never intermit for a solitary second her so highly undertaking to prove that there was nothing the matter with her she saw of a sudden everything she might say or do in the light of that undertaking established connections from it with any number of remote matters struck herself for instance as acting all in its interest when she proposed their going out in the exercise of their freedom and in homage to the season for a turn in the regents park this resort was close at hand at the top of portland place and the principino beautifully better had already proceeded there under high attendance all of which considerations were defensive for maggie all of which became to her mind part of the business of cultivating continuity  upstairs while she left him to put on something to go out in the thought of his waiting below for her in possession of the empty house brought with it sharply if briefly one of her abrupt arrests of consistency the brush of a vain imagination almost paralysing her often for the minute before her glass the vivid look in other words of the particular difference his marriage had made the particular difference seemed at such instants the loss more than anything else of their old freedom their never having had to think where they were together concerned of any one of anything but each other it hadnt been her marriage that did it that had never for three seconds suggested to either of them that they must act diplomatically must reckon with another presenceno not even with her husbands she groaned to herself while the vain imagination lasted why did he marry ah why did he and then it came up to her more than ever that nothing could have been more beautiful than the way in which till charlotte came so much more closely into their life amerigo hadnt interfered what she had gone on owing him for this mounted up again to her eyes like a column of figuresor call it even if one would a house of cards it was her fathers wonderful act that had tipped the house down and made the sum wrong with all of which immediately after her question her why did he why did he rushed back inevitably the confounding the overwhelming wave of the knowledge of his reason he did it for me he did it for me she moaned he did it exactly that our freedommeaning beloved man simply and solely mineshould be greater instead of less he did it divinely to liberate me so far as possible from caring what became of him she found time upstairs even in her haste as she had repeatedly found time before to let the wonderments involved in these recognitions flash at her with their customary effect of making her blink the question in especial of whether she might find her solution in acting herself in the spirit of what he had done in forcing her care really to grow as much less as he had tried to make it thus she felt the whole weight of their case drop afresh upon her shoulders was confronted unmistakably with the prime source of her haunted state it all came from her not having been able not to mindnot to mind what became of him not having been able without anxiety to let him go his way and take his risk and lead his life she had made anxiety her stupid little idol and absolutely now while she stuck a long pin a trifle fallaciously into her hatshe had with an approach to irritation told her maid a new woman whom she had lately found herself thinking of as abysmal that she didnt want hershe tried to focus the possibility of some understanding between them in consequence of which he should cut loose  very near indeed it looked any such possibility that consciousness too had taken its turn by the time she was ready all the vibration all the emotion of this present passage being precisely in the very sweetness of their lapse back into the conditions of the simpler time into a queer resemblance between the aspect and the feeling of the moment and those of numberless other moments that were sufficiently far away she had been quick in her preparation in spite of the flow of the tide that sometimes took away her breath but a pause once more was still left for her to make a pause at the top of the stairs before she came down to him in the span of which she asked herself if it werent thinkable from the perfectly practical point of view that she should simply sacrifice him she didnt go into the detail of what sacrificing him would meanshe didnt need to so distinct was it in one of her restless lights that there he was awaiting her that she should find him walking up and down the drawingroom in the warm fragrant air to which the open windows and the abundant flowers contributed slowly and vaguely moving there and looking very slight and young and superficially manageable almost as much like her child putting it a little freely as like her parent with the appearance about him above all of having perhaps arrived just on purpose to say it to her himself in so many words sacrifice me my own love do sacrifice me do sacrifice me should she want to should she insist on it she might verily hear him bleating it at her all conscious and all accommodating like some precious spotless exceptionally intelligent lamb the positive effect of the intensity of this figure however was to make her shake it away in her resumed descent and after she had rejoined him after she had picked him up she was to know the full pang of the thought that her impossibility was made absolutely by his consciousness by the lucidity of his intention this she felt while she smiled there for him again all hypocritically while she drew on fair fresh gloves while she interrupted the process first to give his necktie a slightly smarter twist and then to make up to him for her hidden madness by rubbing her nose into his cheek according to the tradition of their frankest levity  from the instant she should be able to convict him of intending every issue would be closed and her hypocrisy would have to redouble the only way to sacrifice him would be to do so without his dreaming what it might be for she kissed him she arranged his cravat she dropped remarks she guided him out she held his arm not to be led but to lead him and taking it to her by much the same intimate pressure she had always used when a little girl to mark the inseparability of her dollshe did all these things so that he should sufficiently fail to dream of what they might be for                               xxix  there was nothing to show that her effort in any degree fell short till they got well into the park and he struck her as giving unexpectedly the goby to any serious search for the principino the way they sat down awhile in the sun was a sign of that his dropping with her into the first pair of sequestered chairs they came across and waiting a little after they were placed as if now at last she might bring out as between them something more specific it made her but feel the more sharply how the specific in almost any direction was utterly forbidden herhow the use of it would be for all the world like undoing the leash of a dog eager to follow up a scent it would come out the specific where the dog would come out would run to earth somehow the truthfor she was believing herself in relation to the truthat which she mustnt so much as indirectly point such at any rate was the fashion in which her passionate prudence played over possibilities of danger reading symptoms and betrayals into everything she looked at and yet having to make it evident while she recognised them that she didnt wince there were moments between them in their chairs when he might have been watching her guard herself and trying to think of something new that would trip her up there were pauses during which with her affection as sweet and still as the sunshine she might yet as at some hard game over a table for money have been defying him to fasten upon her the least little complication of consciousness she was positively proud afterwards of the great style in which she had kept this up later on at the hours end when they had retraced their steps to find amerigo and charlotte awaiting them at the house she was able to say to herself that truly she had put her plan through even though once more setting herself the difficult task of making their relation every minute of the time not fall below the standard of that other hour in the treasured past which hung there behind them like a framed picture in a museum a high watermark for the history of their old fortune the summer evening in the park at fawns when side by side under the trees just as now they had let their happy confidence lull them with its most golden tone there had been the possibility of a trap for her at present in the very question of their taking up anew that residence wherefore she had not been the first to sound it in spite of the impression from him of his holding off to see what she would do she was saying to herself in secret can we again in this form migrate there can i for myself undertake it face all the intenser keepingup and stretchingout indefinitely impossibly that our conditions in the country as weve established and accepted them would stand for she had positively lost herself in this inward doubtso much she was subsequently to remember but remembering then too that her companion though perceptibly perhaps as if not to be eager had broken the ice very much as he had broken it in eaton square after the banquet to the castledeans  her mind had taken a long excursion wandered far into the vision of what a summer at fawns with amerigo and charlotte still more eminently in presence against that higher sky would bring forth wasnt her father meanwhile only pretending to talk of it just as she was in a manner pretending to listen he got off it finally at all events for the transition it couldnt well help thrusting out at him it had amounted exactly to an arrest of her private excursion by the sense that he had begun to imitateoh as never yetthe ancient tone of gold it had verily come from him at last the question of whether she thought it would be very goodbut very good indeedthat he should leave england for a series of weeks on some pretext with the prince then it had been that she was to know her husbands menace hadnt really dropped since she was face to face with the effect of it ah the effect of it had occupied all the rest of their walk had stayed out with them and come home with them besides making it impossible that they shouldnt presently feign to recollect how rejoining the child had been their original purpose maggies uneffaced note was that it had at the end of five minutes more driven them to that endeavour as to a refuge and caused them afterwards to rejoice as well that the boys irrepressibly importunate company in due course secured and enjoyed with the extension imparted by his governess a person expectant of consideration constituted a cover for any awkwardness for that was what it had all come to that the dear man had spoken to her to try herquite as he had been spoken to himself by charlotte with the same fine idea the princess took it in on the spot firmly grasping it she heard them together her father and his wife dealing with the queer case the prince tells me that maggie has a plan for your taking some foreign journey with him and as he likes to do everything she wants he has suggested my speaking to you for it as the thing most likely to make you consent so i do speakseebeing always so eager myself as you know to meet maggies wishes i speak but without quite understanding this time what she has in her head why should she of a sudden at this particular moment desire to ship you off together and to remain here alone with me the compliments all to me i admit and you must decide quite as you like the prince is quite ready evidently to do his partbut youll have it out with him that is youll have it out with her something of that kind was what in her minds ear maggie heardand this after his waiting for her to appeal to him directly was her fathers invitation to her to have it out well as she could say to herself all the rest of the day that was what they did while they continued to sit there in their penny chairs that was what they had done as much as they would now ever ever have out anything the measure of this at least had been given that each would fight to the last for the protection for the perversion of any real anxiety she had confessed instantly with her humbugging grin not flinching by a hair meeting his eyes as mildly as he met hers she had confessed to her fancy that they might both he and his soninlaw have welcomed such an escapade since they had both been so long so furiously domestic she had almost cocked her hat under the inspiration of this opportunity to hint how a couple of spirited young men reacting from confinement and sallying forth arminarm might encounter the agreeable in forms that would strike them for the time at least as novel she had felt for fifty seconds with her eyes all so sweetly and falsely in her companions horribly vulgar yet without minding it eithersuch luck should she have if to be nothing worse than vulgar would see her through and i thought amerigo might like it better she had said than wandering off alone  do you mean that he wont go unless i take him  she had considered here and never in her life had she considered so promptly and so intently if she really put it that way her husband challenged might belie the statement so that what would that do but make her father wonder make him perhaps ask straight out why she was exerting pressure she couldnt of course afford to be suspected for an instant of exerting pressure which was why she was obliged only to make answer wouldnt that be just what you must have out with him  decidedlyif he makes me the proposal but he hasnt made it yet  oh once more how she was to feel she had smirked perhaps hes too shy  because youre so sure he so really wants my company  i think he has thought you might like it  well i should but with this he looked away from her and she held her breath to hear him either ask if she wished him to address the question to amerigo straight or inquire if she should be greatly disappointed by his letting it drop what had settled her as she was privately to call it was that he had done neither of these things and had thereby markedly stood off from the risk involved in trying to draw out her reason to attenuate on the other hand this appearance and quite as if to fill out the too large receptacle made so musingly by his abstention he had himself presently given her a reasonhad positively spared her the effort of asking whether he judged charlotte not to have approved he had taken everything on himselfthat was what had settled her she had had to wait very little more to feel with this how much he was taking the point he made was his lack of any eagerness to put time and space on any such scale between himself and his wife he wasnt so unhappy with herfar from it and maggie was to hold that he had grinned back paternally through his rather shielding glasses in easy emphasis of thisas to be able to hint that he required the relief of absence therefore unless it was for the prince himself  oh i dont think it would have been for amerigo himself amerigo and i maggie had said perfectly rub on together  well then there we are  i seeand she had again with sublime blandness assented there we are  charlotte and i too her father had gaily proceeded perfectly rub on together and then he had appeared for a little to be making time to put it only so he had mildly and happily addedto put it only so he had spoken as if he might easily put it much better yet as if the humour of contented understatement fairly sufficed for the occasion he had played then either all consciously or all unconsciously into charlottes hands and the effect of this was to render trebly oppressive maggies conviction of charlottes plan she had done what she wanted his wife hadwhich was also what amerigo had made her do she had kept her test maggies test from becoming possible and had applied instead a test of her own it was exactly as if she had known that her stepdaughter would be afraid to be summoned to say under the least approach to crossexamination why any change was desirable and it was for our young woman herself still more prodigiously as if her father had been capable of calculations to match of judging it important he shouldnt be brought to demand of her what was the matter with her why otherwise with such an opportunity hadnt he demanded it always from calculationthat was why that was why he was terrified of the retort he might have invoked what my dear if you come to that is the matter with you when a minute later on he had followed up his last note by a touch or two designed still further to conjure away the ghost of the anomalous at that climax verily she would have had to be dumb to the question there seems a kind of charm doesnt there on our lifeand quite as if just lately it had got itself somehow renewed had waked up refreshed a kind of wicked selfish prosperity perhaps as if we had grabbed everything fixed everything down to the last lovely object for the last glass case of the last corner left over of my old show thats the only takeoff that it has made us perhaps lazy a wee bit languidlying like gods together all careless of mankind  do you consider that were languidthat form of rejoinder she had jumped at for the sake of its pretty lightness do you consider that we are careless of mankindliving as we do in the biggest crowd in the world and running about always pursued and pursuing  it had made him think indeed a little longer than she had meant but he came up again as she might have said smiling well i dont know we get nothing but the fun do we  no she had hastened to declare we certainly get nothing but the fun  we do it all he had remarked so beautifully  we do it all so beautifully she hadnt denied this for a moment i see what you mean  well i mean too he had gone on that we havent no doubt enough the sense of difficulty  enough enough for what  enough not to be selfish  i dont think you are selfish she had returnedand had managed not to wail it  i dont say that its me particularlyor that its you or charlotte or amerigo but were selfish togetherwe move as a selfish mass you see we want always the same thing he had gone onand that holds us that binds us together we want each other he had further explained only wanting it each time for each other thats what i call the happy spell but its also a little possibly the immorality  the immorality she had pleasantly echoed  well were tremendously moral for ourselvesthat is for each other and i wont pretend that i know exactly at whose particular personal expense you and i for instance are happy what it comes to i daresay is that theres something haunting as if it were a bit uncannyin such a consciousness of our general comfort and privilege unless indeed he had rambled on its only i to whom fantastically it says so much thats all i mean at any ratethat its sort of soothing as if we were sitting about on divans with pigtails smoking opium and seeing visions let us then be up and doingwhat is it longfellow says that seems sometimes to ring out like the police breaking ininto our opium dento give us a shake but the beauty of it is at the same time that we are doing were doing that is after all what we went in for were working it our life our chance whatever you may call it as we saw it as we felt it from the first we have worked it and what more can you do than that its a good deal for me he had wound up to have made charlotte so happyto have so perfectly contented her you from a good way back were a matter of coursei mean your being all right so that i neednt mind your knowing that my great interest since then has rather inevitably been in making sure of the same success very much to your advantage as well for charlotte if weve worked our life our idea really as i say if at any rate i can sit here and say that ive worked my share of itit has not been what you may call least by our having put charlotte so at her ease that has been soothing all round that has curled up as the biggest of the blue fumes or whatever they are of the opium dont you see what a cropper we would have come if she hadnt settled down as she has and he had concluded by turning to maggie as for something she mightnt really have thought of you darling in that case i verily believe would have been the one to hate it most  to hate it maggie had wondered  to hate our having with our tremendous intentions not brought it off and i daresay i should have hated it for you even more than for myself  thats not unlikely perhaps when it was for me after all that you did it  he had hesitated but only a moment i never told you so  well charlotte herself soon enough told me  but i never told her her father had answered  are you very sure she had presently asked  well i like to think how thoroughly i was taken with her and how right i was and how fortunate to have that for my basis i told her all the good i thought of her  then that maggie had returned was precisely part of the good i mean it was precisely part of it that she could so beautifully understand  yesunderstand everything  everythingand in particular your reasons her telling methat showed me how she had understood  they were face to face again now and she saw she had made his colour rise it was as if he were still finding in her eyes the concrete image the enacted scene of her passage with charlotte which he was now hearing of for the first time and as to which it would have been natural he should question her further his forbearance to do so would but mark precisely the complication of his fears what she does like he finally said is the way it has succeeded  your marriage  yesmy whole idea the way ive been justified thats the joy i give her if for her either it had failed that however was not worth talking about he had broken off you think then you could now risk fawns  risk it  well morallyfrom the point of view i was talking of that of our sinking deeper into sloth our selfishness somehow seems at its biggest down there  maggie had allowed him the amusement of her not taking this up is charlotte she had simply asked really ready  oh if you and i and amerigo are whenever one corners charlotte he had developed more at his ease one finds that she only wants to know what we want which is what we got her for  what we got her forexactly and so for a little even though with a certain effect of oddity in their more or less successful ease they left it left it till maggie made the remark that it was all the same wonderful her stepmother should be willing before the season was out to exchange so much company for so much comparative solitude  ah he had then made answer thats because her idea i think this time is that we shall have more people more than weve hitherto had in the country dont you remember that that originally was what we were to get her for  oh yesto give us a life maggie had gone through the form of recalling this and the light of their ancient candour shining from so far back had seemed to bring out some things so strangely that with the sharpness of the vision she had risen to her feet well with a life fawns will certainly do he had remained in his place while she looked over his head the picture in her vision had suddenly swarmed the vibration was that of one of the lurches of the mystic train in which with her companion she was travelling but she was having to steady herself this time before meeting his eyes she had measured indeed the full difference between the move to fawns because each of them now knew the others wanted it and the pairingoff for a journey of her husband and her father which nobody knew that either wanted more company at fawns would be effectually enough the key in which her husband and her stepmother were at work there was truly no question but that she and her father must accept any array of visitors no one could try to marry him now what he had just said was a direct plea for that and what was the plea itself but an act of submission to charlotte he had from his chair been noting her look but he had the next minute also risen and then it was they had reminded each other of their having come out for the boy their junction with him and with his companion successfully effected the four had moved home more slowly and still more vaguely yet with a vagueness that permitted of maggies reverting an instant to the larger issue  if we have people in the country then as you were saying do you know for whom my first fancy would be you may be amused but it would be for the castledeans  i see but why should i be amused  well i mean i am myself i dont think i like herand yet i like to see her which as amerigo says is rum  but dont you feel shes very handsome her father inquired  yes but it isnt for that  then what is it for  simply that she may be therejust there before us its as if she may have a valueas if something may come of her i dont in the least know what and she rather irritates me meanwhile i dont even know i admit whybut if we see her often enough i may find out  does it matter so very much her companion had asked while they moved together  she had hesitated you mean because you do rather like her  he on his side too had waited a little but then he had taken it from her yes i guess i do rather like her  which she accepted for the first case she could recall of their not being affected by a person in the same way it came back therefore to his pretending but she had gone far enough and to add to her appearance of levity she further observed that though they were so far from a novelty she should also immediately desire at fawns the presence of the assinghams that put everything on a basis independent of explanations yet it was extraordinary at the same time how much once in the country again with the others she was going as they used to say at home to need the presence of the good fanny it was the strangest thing in the world but it was as if mrs assingham might in a manner mitigate the intensity of her consciousness of charlotte it was as if the two would balance one against the other as if it came round again in that fashion to her idea of the equilibrium it would be like putting this friend into her scale to make weightinto the scale with her father and herself amerigo and charlotte would be in the other therefore it would take the three of them to keep that one straight and as this played all duskily in her mind it had received from her father with a sound of suddenness a luminous contribution ah rather do lets have the assinghams  it would be to have them she had said as we used so much to have them for a good long stay in the old way and on the old terms as regular boarders fanny used to call it that is if theyll come  as regular boarders on the old termsthats what i should like too but i guess theyll come her companion had added in a tone into which she had read meanings the main meaning was that he felt he was going to require them quite as much as she was his recognition of the new terms as different from the old what was that practically but a confession that something had happened and a perception that interested in the situation she had helped to create mrs assingham would be by so much as this concerned in its inevitable development it amounted to an intimation off his guard that he should be thankful for some one to turn to if she had wished covertly to sound him he had now in short quite given himself away and if she had even at the start needed anything more to settle her here assuredly was enough he had hold of his small grandchild as they retraced their steps swinging the boys hand and not bored as he never was by his always bristling like a fat little porcupine with shrill interrogationpointsso that secretly while they went she had wondered again if the equilibrium mightnt have been more real mightnt above all have demanded less strange a study had it only been on the books that charlotte should give him a principino of his own she had repossessed herself now of his other arm only this time she was drawing him back gently helplessly back to what they had tried for the hour to get away fromjust as he was consciously drawing the child and as high miss bogle on her left representing the duties of home was complacently drawing her the duties of home when the house in portland place reappeared showed even from a distance as vividly there before them amerigo and charlotte had come in that is amerigo had charlotte rather having come outand the pair were perched together in the balcony he bareheaded she divested of her jacket her mantle or whatever but crowned with a brilliant brave hat responsive to the balmy day which maggie immediately spotted as new as insuperably original as worn in characteristic generous harmony for the first time all evidently to watch for the return of the absent to be there to take them over again as punctually as possible they were gay they were amused in the pleasant morning they leaned across the rail and called down their greeting lighting up the front of the great black house with an expression that quite broke the monotony that might almost have shocked the decency of portland place the group on the pavement stared up as at the peopled battlements of a castle even miss bogle who carried her head most aloft gaped a little through the interval of space as toward truly superior beings there could scarce have been so much of the open mouth since the dingy waits on christmas eve had so lamentably chanted for penniesthe time when amerigo insatiable for english customs had come out with a gasped santissima vergine to marvel at the depositaries of this tradition and purchase a reprieve maggies individual gape was inevitably again for the thought of how the pair would be at work                                 xxx  she had not again for weeks had mrs assingham so effectually in presence as on the afternoon of that ladys return from the easter party at matcham but the intermission was made up as soon as the date of the migration to fawnsthat of the more or less simultaneous adjournment of the two housesbegan to be discussed it had struck her promptly that this renewal with an old friend of the old terms she had talked of with her father was the one opening for her spirit that wouldnt too much advertise or betray her even her father who had always as he would have said believed in their ancient ally wouldnt necessarily suspect her of invoking fannys aid toward any special inquiryand least of all if fanny would only act as fanny so easily might maggies measure of fannys ease would have been agitating to mrs assingham had it been all at once revealed to heras for that matter it was soon destined to become even on a comparatively graduated showing our young womans idea in particular was that her safety her escape from being herself suspected of suspicion would proceed from this friends power to cover to protect and as might be even showily to represent herrepresent that is her relation to the form of the life they were all actually leading this would doubtless be as people said a large order but that mrs assingham existed substantially or could somehow be made prevailingly to exist for her private benefit was the finest flower maggie had plucked from among the suggestions sown like abundant seed on the occasion of the entertainment offered in portland place to the matcham company mrs assingham that night rebounding from dejection had bristled with bravery and sympathy she had then absolutely she had perhaps recklessly for herself betrayed the deeper and darker consciousnessan impression it would now be late for her inconsistently to attempt to undo it was with a wonderful air of giving out all these truths that the princess at present approached her again making doubtless at first a sufficient scruple of letting her know what in especial she asked of her yet not a bit ashamed as she in fact quite expressly declared of fannys discerned foreboding of the strange uses she might perhaps have for her quite from the first really maggie said extraordinary things to her such as you can help me you know my dear when nobody else can such as i almost wish upon my word that you had something the matter with you that you had lost your health or your money or your reputation forgive me love so that i might be with you as much as i want or keep you with me without exciting comment without exciting any other remark than that such kindnesses are like me we have each our own way of making up for our unselfishness and maggie who had no small self at all as against her husband or her father and only a weak and uncertain one as against her stepmother would verily at this crisis have seen mrs assinghams personal life or liberty sacrificed without a pang  the attitude that the appetite in question maintained in her was to draw peculiar support moreover from the current aspects and agitations of her victim this personage struck her in truth as ready for almost anything as not perhaps effusively protesting yet as wanting with a restlessness of her own to know what she wanted and in the long runwhich was none so long eitherthere was to be no difficulty as happened about that it was as if for all the world maggie had let her see that she held her that she made her fairly responsible for something not to begin with dotting all the is nor hooking together all the links but treating her without insistence rather with caressing confidence as there to see and to know to advise and to assist the theory visibly had patched itself together for her that the dear woman had somehow from the early time had a hand in all their fortunes so that there was no turn of their common relations and affairs that couldnt be traced back in some degree to her original affectionate interest on this affectionate interest the good ladys young friend now built before her eyes very much as a wise or even as a mischievous child playing on the floor might pile up blocks skilfully and dizzily with an eye on the face of a covertlywatching elder  when the blocks tumbled down they but acted after the nature of blocks yet the hour would come for their rising so high that the structure would have to be noticed and admired mrs assinghams appearance of unreservedly giving herself involved meanwhile on her own side no separate recognitions her face of almost anxious attention was directed altogether to her young friends so vivid felicity it suggested that she took for granted at the most certain vague recent enhancements of that state if the princess now more than before was going and going she was prompt to publish that she beheld her go that she had always known she would sooner or later and that any appeal for participation must more or less contain and invite the note of triumph there was a blankness in her blandness assuredly and very nearly an extravagance in her generalising gaiety a precipitation of cheer particularly marked whenever they met again after short separations meetings during the first flush of which maggie sometimes felt reminded of other looks in other faces of two strangely unobliterated impressions above all the physiognomic light that had played out in her husband at the shockshe had come at last to talk to herself of the shockof his first vision of her on his return from matcham and gloucester and the wonder of charlottes beautiful bold wavering gaze when the next morning in eaton square this old friend had turned from the window to begin to deal with her  if she had dared to think of it so crudely she would have said that fanny was afraid of her afraid of something she might say or do even as for their few brief seconds amerigo and charlotte had beenwhich made exactly an expressive element common to the three the difference however was that this look had in the dear woman its oddity of a constant renewal whereas it had never for the least little instant again peeped out of the others other looks other lights radiant and steady with the others had taken its place reaching a climax so short a time ago that morning of the appearance of the pair on the balcony of her house to overlook what she had been doing with her father when their general interested brightness and beauty attuned to the outbreak of summer had seemed to shed down warmth and welcome and the promise of protection they were conjoined not to do anything to startle herand now at last so completely that with experience and practice they had almost ceased to fear their liability mrs assingham on the other hand deprecating such an accident not less had yet less assurance as having less control the high pitch of her cheer accordingly the tentative adventurous expressions of the wouldbe smiling order that preceded her approach even like a squad of skirmishers or whatever they were called moving ahead of the baggage train these things had at the end of a fortnight brought a dozen times to our young womans lips a challenge that had the cunning to await its right occasion but of the relief of which as a demonstration she meanwhile felt no little need youve such a dread of my possibly complaining to you that you keep pealing all the bells to drown my voice but dont cry out my dear till youre hurtand above all ask yourself how i can be so wicked as to complain what in the name of all thats fantastic can you dream that i have to complain of such inquiries the princess temporarily succeeded in repressing and she did so in a measure by the aid of her wondering if this ambiguity with which her friend affected her wouldnt be at present a good deal like the ambiguity with which she herself must frequently affect her father she wondered how she should enjoy on his part such a takeup as she but just succeeded from day to day in sparing mrs assingham and that made for her trying to be as easy with this associate as mr verver blessed man all indulgent but all inscrutable was with his daughter she had extracted from her none the less a vow in respect to the time that if the colonel might be depended on they would spend at fawns and nothing came home to her more in this connection or inspired her with a more intimate interest than her sense of absolutely seeing her interlocutress forbear to observe that charlottes view of a long visit even from such allies was there to be reckoned with  fanny stood off from that proposition as visibly to the princess and as consciously to herself as she might have backed away from the edge of a chasm into which she feared to slip a truth that contributed again to keep before our young woman her own constant danger of advertising her subtle processes that charlotte should have begun to be restrictive about the assinghamswhich she had never and for a hundred obviously good reasons been before this in itself was a fact of the highest value for maggie and of a value enhanced by the silence in which fanny herself so much too unmistakably dressed it what gave it quite thrillingly its price was exactly the circumstance that it thus opposed her to her stepmother more activelyif she was to back up her friends for holding outthan she had ever yet been opposed though of course with the involved result of the fine chance given mrs verver to ask her husband for explanations ah from the moment she should be definitely caught in opposition there would be naturally no saying how much charlottes opportunities might multiply what would become of her father she hauntedly asked if his wife on the one side should begin to press him to call his daughter to order and the force of old habitto put it only at thatshould dispose him not less effectively to believe in this young person at any price there she was all round imprisoned in the circle of the reasons it was impossible she should givecertainly give him the house in the country was his house and thereby was charlottes it was her own and amerigos only so far as its proper master and mistress should profusely place it at their disposal maggie felt of course that she saw no limit to her fathers profusion but this couldnt be even at the best the case with charlottes whom it would never be decent when all was said to reduce to fighting for her preferences there were hours truly when the princess saw herself as not unarmed for battle if battle might only take place without spectators  this last advantage for her was however too sadly out of the question her sole strength lay in her being able to see that if charlotte wouldnt want the assinghams it would be because that sentiment too would have motives and grounds she had all the while command of one way of meeting any objection any complaint on his wifes part reported to her by her father it would be open to her to retort to his possible what are your reasons my dear by a lucidlyproduced what are hers love pleaseisnt that what we had better know maynt her reasons be a dislike beautifully founded of the presence and thereby of the observation of persons who perhaps know about her things its inconvenient to her they should know that hideous card she might in mere logic playbeing by this time at her still swifter private pace intimately familiar with all the fingered pasteboard in her pack but she could play it only on the forbidden issue of sacrificing him the issue so forbidden that it involved even a horror of finding out if he would really have consented to be sacrificed what she must do she must do by keeping her hands off him and nothing meanwhile as we see had less in common with that scruple than such a merciless manipulation of their yielding beneficiaries as her spirit so boldly revelled in she saw herself in this connexion without detachmentsaw others alone with intensity otherwise she might have been struck fairly have been amused by her free assignment of the pachydermatous quality if she could face the awkwardness of the persistence of her friends at fawns in spite of charlotte she somehow looked to them for an inspiration of courage that would improve upon her own they were in short not only themselves to find a plausibility and an audacity but were somehow by the way to pick up these forms for her maggie as well and she felt indeed that she was giving them scant time longer when one afternoon in portland place she broke out with an irrelevance that was merely superficial  what awfulness in heavens name is there between them what do you believe what do you know  oh if she went by faces her visitors sudden whiteness at this might have carried her far fanny assingham turned pale for it but there was something in such an appearance in the look it put into the eyes that renewed maggies conviction of what this companion had been expecting she had been watching it come come from afar and now that it was there after all and the first convulsion over they would doubtless soon find themselves in a more real relation it was there because of the sunday luncheon they had partaken of alone together it was there as strangely as one would because of the bad weather the cold perverse june rain that was making the day wrong it was there because it stood for the whole sum of the perplexities and duplicities among which our young woman felt herself lately to have picked her steps it was there because amerigo and charlotte were again paying together alone a week end visit which it had been maggies plan infernally to promotejust to see if this time they really would it was there because she had kept fanny on her side from paying one she would manifestly have been glad to pay and had made her come instead stupidly vacantly boringly to luncheon all in the spirit of celebrating the fact that the prince and mrs verver had thus put it into her own power to describe them exactly as they were it had abruptly occurred in truth that maggie required the preliminary help of determining how they were though on the other hand before her guest had answered her question everything in the hour and the place everything in all the conditions affected her as crying it out her guests stare of ignorance above allthat of itself at first cried it out between them what do you mean  anything there shouldnt be there shouldnt have beenall this time do you believe there isor whats your idea  fannys idea was clearly to begin with that her young friend had taken her breath away but she looked at her very straight and very hard do you speak from a suspicion of your own  i speak at last from a torment forgive me if it comes out ive been thinking for months and months and ive no one to turn to no one to help me to make things out no impression but my own dont you see to go by  youve been thinking for months and months mrs assingham took it in but what then dear maggie have you been thinking  well horrible thingslike a little beast that i perhaps am that there may be somethingsomething wrong and dreadful something they cover up  the elder womans colour had begun to come back she was able though with a visible effort to face the question less amazedly you imagine poor child that the wretches are in love is that it  but maggie for a minute only stared back at her help me to find out what i imagine i dont knowive nothing but my perpetual anxiety have you anydo you see what i mean if youll tell me truly that at least one way or the other will do something for me  fannys look had taken a peculiar gravitya fulness with which it seemed to shine is what it comes to that youre jealous of charlotte  do you mean whether i hate herand maggie thought no not on account of father  ah mrs assingham returned that isnt what one would suppose what i ask is if youre jealous on account of your husband  well said maggie presently perhaps that may be all if im unhappy im jealous it must come to the same thing and with you at least im not afraid of the word if im jealous dont you see im tormented she went onand all the more if im helpless and if im both helpless and tormented i stuff my pockethandkerchief into my mouth i keep it there for the most part night and day so as not to be heard too indecently moaning only now with you at last i cant keep it longer ive pulled it out and here i am fairly screaming at you theyre away she wound up so they cant hear and im by a miracle of arrangement not at luncheon with father at home i live in the midst of miracles of arrangement half of which i admit are my own i go about on tiptoe i watch for every sound i feel every breath and yet i try all the while to seem as smooth as old satin dyed rosecolour have you ever thought of me she asked as really feeling as i do  her companion conspicuously required to be clear jealous unhappy tormented no said mrs assingham but at the same timeand though you may laugh at me for itim bound to confess that ive never been so awfully sure of what i may call knowing you here you are indeed as you saysuch a deep little person ive never imagined your existence poisoned and since you wish to know if i consider that it need be ive not the least difficulty in speaking on the spot nothing decidedly strikes me as more unnecessary  for a minute after this they remained face to face maggie had sprung up while her friend sat enthroned and after moving to and fro in her intensity now paused to receive the light she had invoked it had accumulated considerably by this time round mrs assinghams ample presence and it made even to our young womans own sense a medium in which she could at last take a deeper breath ive affected you these monthsand these last weeks in especialas quiet and natural and easy  but it was a question that took not imperceptibly some answering youve never affected me from the first hour i beheld you as anything butin a way all your ownabsolutely good and sweet and beautiful in a way as i say mrs assingham almost caressingly repeated just all your very ownnobody elses at all ive never thought of you but as outside of ugly things so ignorant of any falsity or cruelty or vulgarity as never to have to be touched by them or to touch them ive never mixed you up with them there would have been time enough for that if they had seemed to be near you but they haventif thats what you want to know  youve only believed me contented then because youve believed me stupid  mrs assingham had a free smile now for the length of this stride dissimulated though it might be in a graceful little frisk if i had believed you stupid i shouldnt have thought you interesting and if i hadnt thought you interesting i shouldnt have noted whether i knew you as ive called it or not what ive always been conscious of is your having concealed about you somewhere no small amount of character quite as much in fact fanny smiled as one could suppose a person of your size able to carry the only thing was she explained that thanks to your never calling ones attention to it i hadnt made out much more about it and should have been vague above all as to where you carried it or kept it somewhere under i should simply have saidlike that little silver cross you once showed me blest by the holy father that you always wear out of sight next your skin that relic ive had a glimpse ofwith which she continued to invoke the privilege of humour but the precious little innermost say this time little golden personal nature of you blest by a greater power i think even than the popethat youve never consentingly shown me im not sure youve ever consentingly shown it to anyone youve been in general too modest  maggie trying to follow almost achieved a little fold of her forehead i strike you as modest todaymodest when i stand here and scream at you  oh your screaming ive granted you is something new i must fit it on somewhere the question is however mrs assingham further proceeded of what the deuce i can fit it on to do you mean she asked to the fact of our friends being from yesterday to tomorrow at a place where they may more or less irresponsibly meet she spoke with the air of putting it as badly for them as possible are you thinking of their being there aloneof their having consented to be and then as she had waited without result for her companion to say but isnt it true thatafter you had this time again at the eleventh hour said you wouldntthey would really much rather not have gone  yesthey would certainly much rather not have gone but i wanted them to go  then my dear child what in the world is the matter  i wanted to see if they would and theyve had to maggie added it was the only thing  her friend appeared to wonder from the moment you and your father backed out  oh i dont mean go for those people i mean go for us for father and me maggie went on because now they know  they know fanny assingham quavered  that ive been for some time past taking more notice notice of the queer things in our life  maggie saw her companion for an instant on the point of asking her what these queer things might be but mrs assingham had the next minute brushed by that ambiguous opening and taken as she evidently felt a better one and is it for that you did it i mean gave up the visit  its for that i did it to leave them to themselvesas they less and less want or at any rate less and less venture to appear to want to be left as they had for so long arranged things the princess went on you see they sometimes have to be and then as if baffled by the lucidity of this mrs assingham for a little said nothing now do you think im modest  with time however fanny could brilliantly think anything that would serve i think youre wrong that my dear is my answer to your question it demands assuredly the straightest i can make i see no awfulnessi suspect none im deeply distressed she added that you should do anything else it drew again from maggie a long look youve never even imagined anything  ah god forbidfor its exactly as a woman of imagination that i speak theres no moment of my life at which im not imagining something and its thanks to that darling mrs assingham pursued that i figure the sincerity with which your husband whom you see as viciously occupied with your stepmother is interested is tenderly interested in his admirable adorable wife she paused a minute as to give her friend the full benefit of thisas to maggies measure of which however no sign came and then poor woman haplessly she crowned her efforthe wouldnt hurt a hair of your head  it had produced in maggie at once and apparently in the intended form of a smile the most extraordinary expression ah there it is  but her guest had already gone on and im absolutely certain that charlotte wouldnt either  it kept the princess with her strange grimace standing there nocharlotte wouldnt either thats how theyve had again to go off together theyve been afraid not tolest it should disturb me aggravate me somehow work upon me as i insisted that they must that we couldnt all failthough father and charlotte hadnt really accepted as i did this they had to yield to the fear that their showing as afraid to move together would count for them as the greater danger which would be the danger you see of my feeling myself wronged their least danger they know is in going on with all the things that ive seemed to accept and that ive given no indication at any moment of not accepting everything that has come up for them has come up in an extraordinary manner without my having by a sound or a sign given myself awayso that its all as wonderful as you may conceive they move at any rate among the dangers i speak of between that of their doing too much and that of their not having any longer the confidence or the nerve or whatever you may call it to do enough her tone by this time might have shown a strangeness to match her smile which was still more marked as she wound up and thats how i make them do what i like  it had an effect on mrs assingham who rose with the deliberation that from point to point marked the widening of her grasp my dear child youre amazing  amazing  youre terrible  maggie thoughtfully shook her head no im not terrible and you dont think me so i do strike you as surprising no doubt but surprisingly mild becausedont you seei am mild i can bear anything  oh bear mrs assingham fluted  for love said the princess  fanny hesitated of your father  for love maggie repeated  it kept her friend watching of your husband  for love maggie said again  it was for the moment as if the distinctness of this might have determined in her companion a choice between two or three highly different alternatives mrs assinghams rejoinder at all eventshowever much or however little it was a choicewas presently a triumph speaking with this love of your own then have you undertaken to convey to me that you believe your husband and your fathers wife to be in act and in fact lovers of each other and then as the princess didnt at first answer do you call such an allegation as that mild  oh im not pretending to be mild to you but ive told you and moreover you must have seen for yourself how much so ive been to them  mrs assingham more brightly again bridled is that what you call it when you make them for terror as you say do as you like  ah there wouldnt be any terror for them if they had nothing to hide  mrs assingham faced herquite steady now are you really conscious love of what youre saying  im saying that im bewildered and tormented and that ive no one but you to speak to ive thought ive in fact been sure that youve seen for yourself how much this is the case its why ive believed you would meet me half way  half way to what to denouncing fanny asked two persons friends of years whom ive always immensely admired and liked and against whom i havent the shadow of a charge to make  maggie looked at her with wide eyes i had much rather you should denounce me than denounce them denounce me denounce me she said if you can see your way it was exactly what she appeared to have argued out with herself if conscientiously you can denounce me if conscientiously you can revile me if conscientiously you can put me in my place for a lowminded little pig  well said mrs assingham consideringly as she paused for emphasis  i think i shall be saved  her friend took it for a minute however by carrying thoughtful eyes eyes verily portentous over her head you say youve no one to speak to and you make a point of your having so disguised your feelingsnot having as you call it given yourself away have you then never seen it not only as your right but as your bounden duty worked up to such a pitch to speak to your husband  ive spoken to him said maggie  mrs assingham stared ah then it isnt true that youve made no sign  maggie had a silence ive made no trouble ive made no scene ive taken no stand ive neither reproached nor accused him youll say theres a way in all that of being nasty enough  oh dropped from fanny as if she couldnt help it  but i dont thinkstrangely enoughthat he regards me as nasty i think that at bottomfor that is said the princess the strangenesshes sorry for me yes i think that deep within he pities me  her companion wondered for the state youve let yourself get into  for not being happy when ive so much to make me so  youve everything said mrs assingham with alacrity yet she remained for an instant embarrassed as to a further advance i dont understand however how if youve done nothing  an impatience from maggie had checked her ive not done absolutely nothing  but what then  well she went on after a minute he knows what ive done  it produced on mrs assinghams part her whole tone and manner exquisitely aiding a hush not less prolonged and the very duration of which inevitably gave it something of the character of an equal recognition and what then has he done  maggie took again a minute he has been splendid  splendid then what more do you want  ah what you see said maggie not to be afraid  it made her guest again hang fire not to be afraid really to speak  not to be afraid not to speak  mrs assingham considered further you cant even to charlotte but as at this after a look at her maggie turned off with a movement of suppressed despair she checked herself and might have been watching her for all the difficulty and the pity of it vaguely moving to the window and the view of the hill street it was almost as if she had had to give up from failure of responsive wit in her friendthe last failure she had feared the hope of the particular relief she had been working for mrs assingham resumed the next instant however in the very tone that seemed most to promise her she should have to give up nothing i see i see you would have in that case too many things to consider it brought the princess round again proving itself thus the note of comprehension she wished most to clutch at dont be afraid  maggie took it where she stoodwhich she was soon able to signify thankyou  it very properly encouraged her counsellor what your idea imputes is a criminal intrigue carried on from day to day amid perfect trust and sympathy not only under your eyes but under your fathers thats an idea its impossible for me for a moment to entertain  ah there you are then its exactly what i wanted from you  youre welcome to it mrs assingham breathed  you never have entertained it maggie pursued  never for an instant said fanny with her head very high  maggie took it again yet again as wanting more pardon my being so horrid but by all you hold sacred  mrs assingham faced her ah my dear upon my positive word as an honest woman  thankyou then said the princess  so they remained a little after which but do you believe it love fanny inquired  i believe you  well as ive faith in them it comes to the same thing  maggie at this last appeared for a moment to think again but she embraced the proposition the same thing  then youre no longer unhappy her guest urged coming more gaily toward her  i doubtless shant be a great while  but it was now mrs assinghams turn to want more ive convinced you its impossible  she had held out her arms and maggie after a moment meeting her threw herself into them with a sound that had its oddity as a sign of relief impossible impossible she emphatically more than emphatically replied yet the next minute she had burst into tears over the impossibility and a few seconds later pressing clinging sobbing had even caused them to flow audibly sympathetically and perversely from her friend                               xxxi  the understanding appeared to have come to be that the colonel and his wife were to present themselves toward the middle of july for the good long visit at fawns on which maggie had obtained from her father that he should genially insist as well as that the couple from eaton square should welcome there earlier in the month and less than a week after their own arrival the advent of the couple from portland place oh we shall give you time to breathe fanny remarked in reference to the general prospect with a gaiety that announced itself as heedless of criticism to each member of the party in turn sustaining and bracing herself by her emphasis pushed even to an amiable cynicism of the confident view of these punctualities of the assinghams the ground she could best occupy to her sense was that of her being moved as in this connexion she had always been moved by the admitted grossness of her avidity the way the hospitality of the ververs met her convenience and ministered to her ease destitute as the colonel had kept her from the first of any rustic retreat any leafy bower of her own any fixed base for the stale season now at hand she had explained at home she had repeatedly reexplained the terms of her dilemma the real difficulty of her oras she now put itof their position when the pair could do nothing else in cadogan place they could still talk of marvellous little maggie and of the charm the sinister charm of their having to hold their breath to watch her a topic the momentous midnight discussion at which we have been present was so far from having exhausted it came up irrepressibly at all private hours they had planted it there between them and it grew from day to day in a manner to make their sense of responsibility almost yield to their sense of fascination mrs assingham declared at such moments that in the interest of this admirable young thingto whom she also declared she had quite come overshe was ready to pass with all the world else even with the prince himself the object inconsequently as well of her continued her explicitly shameless appreciation for a vulgar indelicate pestilential woman showing her true character in an abandoned old age the colonels confessed attention had been enlisted we have seen as never yet under pressure from his wife by any guaranteed imbroglio but this she could assure him she perfectly knew was not a bit because he was sorry for her or touched by what she had let herself in for but because when once they had been opened he couldnt keep his eyes from resting complacently resting almost intelligently on the princess if he was in love with her now however so much the better it would help them both not to wince at what they would have to do for her mrs assingham had come back to that whenever he groaned or grunted she had at no beguiled moment since maggies little march was positively beguilinglet him lose sight of the grim necessity awaiting them we shall have as ive again and again told you to lie for herto lie till were black in the face  to lie for her the colonel often at these hours as from a vague vision of old chivalry in a new form wandered into apparent lapses from lucidity  to lie to her up and down and in and outit comes to the same thing it will consist just as much of lying to the others too to the prince about ones belief in him to charlotte about ones belief in her to mr verver dear sweet man about ones belief in everyone so weve work cut outwith the biggest lie on top of all being that we like to be there for such a purpose we hate it unspeakablyim more ready to be a coward before it to let the whole thing to let everyone selfishly and pusillanimously slide than before any social duty any felt human call that has ever forced me to be decent i speak at least for myself for you she had added as ive given you so perfect an opportunity to fall in love with maggie youll doubtless find your account in being so much nearer to her  and what do you make the colonel could at this always imperturbably enough ask of the account you yourself will find in being so much nearer to the prince of your confirmed if not exasperated infatuation with whomto say nothing of my weak goodnature about ityou give such a pretty picture  to the picture in question she had been always in fact able contemplatively to return the difficulty of my enjoyment of that is dont you see that im making in my loyalty to maggie a sad hash of his affection for me  you find means to call it then this whitewashing of his crime being loyal to maggie  oh about that particular crime there is always much to say it is always more interesting to us than any other crime it has at least that for it but of course i call everything i have in mind at all being loyal to maggie being loyal to her is more than anything else helping her with her fatherwhich is what she most wants and needs  the colonel had had it before but he could apparently never have too much of it helping her with him  helping her against him then against what weve already so fully talked ofits having to be recognised between them that he doubts thats where my part is so plainto see her through to see her through to the end exaltation for the moment always lighted mrs assinghams reference to this plainness yet she at the same time seldom failed the next instant to qualify her view of it when i talk of my obligation as clear i mean that its absolute for just how from day to day and through thick and thin to keep the thing up is i grant you another matter theres one way luckily nevertheless in which im strong i can perfectly count on her  the colonel seldom failed here as from the insidious growth of an excitement to wonder to encourage not to see youre lying  to stick to me fast whatever she sees if i stick to herthat is to my own poor struggling way under providence of watching over them allshell stand by me to the death she wont give me away for you know she easily can  this regularly was the most lurid turn of their road but bob assingham with each journey met it as for the first time easily  she can utterly dishonour me with her father she can let him know that i was aware at the time of his marriageas i had been aware at the time of her ownof the relations that had pre existed between his wife and her husband  and how can she do so if up to this minute by your own statement she is herself in ignorance of your knowledge  it was a question that mrs assingham had ever for dealing with a manner to which repeated practice had given almost a grand effect very much as if she was invited by it to say that about this exactly she proposed to do her best lying but she said and with full lucidity something quite other it could give itself a little the air still of a triumph over his coarseness by acting immediately with the blind resentment with which in her place ninetynine women out of a hundred would act and by so making mr verver in turn act with the same natural passion the passion of ninetynine men out of a hundred theyve only to agree about me the poor lady said theyve only to feel at one over it feel bitterly practised upon cheated and injured theyve only to denounce me to each other as false and infamous for me to be quite irretrievably dished of course its i who have been and who continue to be cheatedcheated by the prince and charlotte but theyre not obliged to give me the benefit of that or to give either of us the benefit of anything theyll be within their rights to lump us all together as a false cruel conspiring crew and if they can find the right facts to support them get rid of us root and branch  this on each occasion put the matter so at the worst that repetition even scarce controlled the hot flush with which she was compelled to see the parts of the whole history all its ugly consistency and its temporary gloss hang together she enjoyed invariably the sense of making her danger present of making it real to her husband and of his almost turning pale when their eyes met at this possibility of their compromised state and their shared discredit the beauty was that as under a touch of one of the ivory notes at the left of the keyboard he sounded out with the short sharpness of the dear fond stupid uneasy man conspiringso far as you were concernedto what end  why to the obvious end of getting the prince a wifeat maggies expense and then to that of getting charlotte a husband at mr ververs  of rendering friendly services yeswhich have produced as it turns out complications but from the moment you didnt do it for the complications why shouldnt you have rendered them  it was extraordinary for her always in this connexion how with time given him he fell to speaking better for her than she could in the presence of her clearcut image of the worst speak for herself troubled as she was she thus never wholly failed of her amusement by the way oh isnt what i may have meddled forso far as it can be proved i did meddleopen to interpretation by which i mean to mr ververs and maggies maynt they see my motive in the light of that appreciation as the wish to be decidedly more friendly to the others than to the victimised father and daughter she positively liked to keep it up maynt they see my motive as the determination to serve the prince in any case and at any price first to place him comfortably in other words to find him his fill of money maynt it have all the air for them of a really equivocal sinister bargain between ussomething quite unholy and louche  it produced in the poor colonel infallibly the echo louche love  why havent you said as much yourselfhavent you put your finger on that awful possibility  she had a way now with his felicities that made him enjoy being reminded of them in speaking of your having always had such a mash  such a mash precisely for the man i was to help to put so splendidly at his ease a motherly mash an impartial look at it would show it only as likely to have beenbut were not talking of course about impartial looks were talking of good innocent people deeply worked upon by a horrid discovery and going much further in their view of the lurid as such people almost always do than those who have been wider awake all round from the first what i was to have got from my friend in such a view in exchange for what i had been able to do for himwell that would have been an equivalent of a kind best known to myself for me shrewdly to consider and she easily lost herself each time in the anxious satisfaction of filling out the picture it would have been seen it would have been heard of before the case of the woman a man doesnt want or of whom hes tired or for whom he has no use but such uses and who is capable in her infatuation in her passion of promoting his interests with other women rather than lose sight of him lose touch of him cease to have to do with him at all cela sest vu my dear and stranger things stillas i neednt tell you very good then she wound up there is a perfectly possible conception of the behaviour of your sweet wife since as i say theres no imagination so lively once its started as that of really agitated lambs lions are nothing to them for lions are sophisticated are blases are brought up from the first to prowling and mauling it does give us youll admit something to think about my relief is luckily however in what i finally do think  he was well enough aware by this time of what she finally did think but he was not without a sense again also for his amusement by the way it would have made him for a spectator of these passages between the pair resemble not a little the artless child who hears his favourite story told for the twentieth time and enjoys it exactly because he knows what is next to happen what of course will pull them up if they turn out to have less imagination than you assume is the profit you can have found in furthering mrs ververs marriage you werent at least in love with charlotte  oh mrs assingham at this always brought out my hand in that is easily accounted  for by my desire to be agreeable to him  to mr verver  to the princeby preventing her in that way from taking as he was in danger of seeing her do some husband with whom he wouldnt be able to open to keep open so large an account as with his fatherinlaw ive brought her near him kept her within his reach as she could never have remained either as a single woman or as the wife of a different man  kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress  kept her on that sweet construction to be his mistress she brought it out grandlyit had always so for her own ear as well as visibly for her husbands its effect the facilities in the case thanks to the particular conditions being so quite ideal  down even to the facility of your minding everything so little from your own point of viewas to have supplied him with the enjoyment of two beautiful women  down even to thatto the monstrosity of my folly but not mrs assingham added two of anything one beautiful woman and one beautiful fortune thats what a creature of pure virtue exposes herself to when she suffers her pure virtue suffers her sympathy her disinterestedness her exquisite sense for the lives of others to carry her too far voila  i see its the way the ververs have you  its the way the ververs have me its in other words the way they would be able to make such a show to each other of having meif maggie werent so divine  she lets you off he never failed to insist on all this to the very end which was how he had become so versed in what she finally thought  she lets me off so that now horrified and contrite at what ive done i may work to help her out and mr verver she was fond of adding lets me off too  then you do believe he knows  it determined in her always there with a significant pause a deep immersion in her thought i believe he would let me off if he did knowso that i might work to help him out or rather really she went on that i might work to help maggie that would be his motive that would be his condition in forgiving me just as hers for me in fact her motive and her condition are my acting to spare her father but its with maggie only that im directly concerned nothing evernot a breath not a look ill guaranteeshall i have whatever happens from mr verver himself so it is therefore that i shall probably by the closest possible shave escape the penalty of my crimes  you mean being held responsible  i mean being held responsible my advantage will be that maggies such a trump  such a trump that as you say shell stick to you  stick to me on our understandingstick to me for our understandings signed and sealed and to brood over it again was ever for mrs assingham to break out again with exaltation its a grand high compact she has solemnly promised  but in words  oh yes in words enoughsince its a matter of words to keep up her lie so long as i keep up mine  and what do you call her lie  why the pretence that she believes me believes theyre innocent  she positively believes then theyre guilty she has arrived at that shes really content with it in the absence of proof it was here each time that fanny assingham most faltered but always at last to get the matter for her own sense and with a long sigh sufficiently straight it isnt a question of belief or of proof absent or present its inevitably with her a question of natural perception of insurmountable feeling she irresistibly knows that theres something between them but she hasnt arrived at it as you say at all thats exactly what she hasnt done what she so steadily and intensely refuses to do she stands off and off so as not to arrive she keeps out to sea and away from the rocks and what she most wants of me is to keep at a safe distance with heras i for my own skin only ask not to come nearer after which invariably she let him have it all so far from wanting proofwhich she must get in a manner by my siding with hershe wants disproof as against herself and has appealed to me so extraordinarily to side against her its really magnificent when you come to think of it the spirit of her appeal if ill but cover them up brazenly enough the others so as to show round and about them as happy as a bird she on her side will do what she can if ill keep them quiet in a word it will enable her to gain timetime as against any idea of her fathersand so somehow come out if ill take care of charlotte in particular shell take care of the prince and its beautiful and wonderful really pathetic and exquisite to see what she feels that time may do for her  ah but what does she call poor little thing time  well this summer at fawns to begin with she can live as yet of course but from hand to mouth but she has worked it out for herself i think that the very danger of fawns superficially looked at may practically amount to a greater protection there the loversif they are loverswill have to mind theyll feel it for themselves unless things are too utterly far gone with them  and things are not too utterly far gone with them  she had inevitably poor woman her hesitation for this but she put down her answer as for the purchase of some absolutely indispensable article she would have put down her last shilling no  it made him always grin at her is that a lie  do you think youre worth lying to if it werent the truth for me she added i wouldnt have accepted for fawns i can i believe keep the wretches quiet  but howat the worst  oh the worstdont talk about the worst i can keep them quiet at the best i seem to feel simply by our being there it will work from week to week of itself youll see  he was willing enough to see but he desired to provide yet if it doesnt work  ah thats talking about the worst  well it might be but what were they doing from morning to night at this crisis but talk wholl keep the others  the others  wholl keep them quiet if your couple have had a life together they cant have had it completely without witnesses without the help of persons however few who must have some knowledge some idea about them theyve had to meet secretly protectedly theyve had to arrange for if they havent met and havent arranged and havent thereby in some quarter or other had to give themselves away why are we piling it up so therefore if theres evidence up and down london  there must be people in possession of it ah it isnt all she always remembered up and down london some of it must connect themi mean she musingly added it naturally wouldwith other places with who knows what strange adventures opportunities dissimulations but whatever there may have been it will also all have been buried on the spot oh theyve known howtoo beautifully but nothing all the same is likely to find its way to maggie of itself  because every one who may have anything to tell you hold will have been so squared and then inveterately before she could sayhe enjoyed so much coming to this what will have squared lady castledean  the consciousnessshe had never lost her promptnessof having no stones to throw at any one elses windows she has enough to do to guard her own glass that was what she was doing fanny said that last morning at matcham when all of us went off and she kept the prince and charlotte over she helped them simply that she might herself be helpedif it wasnt perhaps rather with her ridiculous mr blint that he might be they put in together therefore of course that day they got it clearand quite under her eyes inasmuch as they didnt become traceable again as we know till late in the evening on this historic circumstance mrs assingham was always ready afresh to brood but she was no less ready after her brooding devoutly to add only we know nothing whatever elsefor which all our stars be thanked  the colonels gratitude was apt to be less marked what did they do for themselves all the same from the moment they got that free hand to the moment long after dinnertime havent you told me of their turning up at their respective homes  well its none of your business  i dont speak of it as mine but its only too much theirs people are always traceable in england when tracings are required something sooner or later happens somebody sooner or later breaks the holy calm murder will out  murder willbut this isnt murder quite the contrary perhaps i verily believe she had her moments of adding that for the amusement of the row you would prefer an explosion  this however was a remark he seldom noticed he wound up for the most part after a long contemplative smoke with a transition from which no exposed futility in it had succeeded in weaning him what i cant for my life make out is your idea of the old boy  charlottes too inconceivably funny husband i have no idea  i beg your pardonyouve just shown it you never speak of him but as too inconceivably funny  well he is she always confessed that is he may be for all i know too inconceivably great but thats not an idea it represents only my weak necessity of feeling that hes beyond mewhich isnt an idea either you see he may be stupid too  preciselythere you are  yet on the other hand she always went on he may be sublime sublimer even than maggie herself he may in fact have already been but we shall never know with which her tone betrayed perhaps a shade of soreness for the single exemption she didnt yearningly welcome that i can see  oh i say it came to affect the colonel himself with a sense of privation  im not sure even that charlotte will  oh my dear what charlotte doesnt know  but she brooded and brooded im not sure even that the prince will it seemed privation in short for them all theyll be mystified confounded tormented but they wont knowand all their possible putting their heads together wont make them that said fanny assingham will be their punishment and she ended ever when she had come so far at the same pitch it will probably alsoif i get off with so littlebe mine  and what her husband liked to ask will be mine  nothingyoure not worthy of any ones punishment is in what one feels and what will make ours effective is that we shall feel she was splendid with her ours she flared up with this prophecy it will be maggie herself who will mete it out  maggie  shell knowabout her father everything everything she repeated on the vision of which each time mrs assingham as with the presentiment of an odd despair turned away from it but shell never tell us                                 xxxii  if maggie had not so firmly made up her mind never to say either to her good friend or to any one else more than she meant about her father she might have found herself betrayed into some such overflow during the week spent in london with her husband after the others had adjourned to fawns for the summer this was because of the odd element of the unnatural imparted to the so simple fact of their brief separation by the assumptions resident in their course of life hitherto she was used herself certainly by this time to dealing with odd elements but she dropped instantly even from such peace as she had patched up when it was a question of feeling that her unpenetrated parent might be alone with them she thought of him as alone with them when she thought of him as alone with charlotteand this strangely enough even while fixing her sense to the full on his wifes power of preserving quite of enhancing every felicitous appearance charlotte had done thatunder immeasurably fewer difficulties indeedduring the numerous months of their hymeneal absence from england the period prior to that wonderful reunion of the couples in the interest of the larger play of all the virtues of each which was now bearing for mrs ververs stepdaughter at least such remarkable fruit it was the present so much briefer interval in a situation possibly in a relation so changedit was the new terms of her problem that would tax charlottes art the princess could pull herself up repeatedly by remembering that the real relation between her father and his wife was a thing that she knew nothing about and that in strictness was none of her business but she none the less failed to keep quiet as she would have called it before the projected image of their ostensibly happy isolation nothing could have had less of the quality of quietude than a certain queer wish that fitfully flickered up in her a wish that usurped perversely the place of a much more natural one if charlotte while she was about it could only have been worse that idea maggie fell to invoking instead of the idea that she might desirably have been better for exceedingly odd as it was to feel in such ways she believed she mightnt have worried so much if she didnt somehow make her stepmother out under the beautiful trees and among the dear old gardens as lavish of fifty kinds of confidence and twenty kinds at least of gentleness gentleness and confidence were certainly the right thing as from a charming woman to her husband but the fine tissue of reassurance woven by this ladys hands and flung over her companion as a light muffling veil formed precisely a wrought transparency through which she felt her fathers eyes continually rest on herself the reach of his gaze came to her straighter from a distance it showed him as still more conscious down there alone of the suspected the felt elaboration of the process of their not alarming or hurting him she had herself now for weeks and weeks and all unwinkingly traced the extension of this pious effort but her perfect success in giving no signshe did herself that creditwould have been an achievement quite wasted if mrs verver should make with him those mistakes of proportion one set of them too abruptly too incoherently designed to correct another set that she had made with his daughter however if she had been worse poor woman who should say that her husband would to a certainty have been better  one groped noiselessly among such questions and it was actually not even definite for the princess that her own amerigo left alone with her in town had arrived at the golden mean of nonprecautionary gallantry which would tend by his calculation to brush private criticism from its last perchingplace the truth was in this connection that she had different sorts of terrors and there were hours when it came to her that these days were a prolonged repetition of that nightdrive of weeks before from the other house to their own when he had tried to charm her by his sovereign personal power into some collapse that would commit her to a repudiation of consistency she was never alone with him it was to be said without her having sooner or later to ask herself what had already become of her consistency yet at the same time so long as she breathed no charge she kept hold of a remnant of appearance that could save her from attack attack real attack from him as he would conduct it was what she above all dreaded she was so far from sure that under that experience she mightnt drop into some depth of weakness mightnt show him some shortest way with her that he would know how to use again therefore since she had given him as yet no moments pretext for pretending to her that she had either lost faith or suffered by a feathers weight in happiness she left him it was easy to reason with an immense advantage for all waiting and all tension she wished him for the present to make up to her for nothing who could say to what makingup might lead into what consenting or pretending or destroying blindness it might plunge her she loved him too helplessly still to dare to open the door by an inch to his treating her as if either of them had wronged the other something or somebodyand who at this which of them allwould inevitably would in the gust of momentary selfishness be sacrificed to that whereas what she intelligently needed was to know where she was going knowledge knowledge was a fascination as well as a fear and a part precisely of the strangeness of this juncture was the way her apprehension that he would break out to her with some merely general profession was mixed with her dire need to forgive him to reassure him to respond to him on no ground that she didnt fully measure to do these things it must be clear to her what they were for but to act in that light was by the same effect to learn horribly what the other things had been he might tell her only what he wanted only what would work upon her by the beauty of his appeal and the result of the direct appeal of any beauty in him would be her helpless submission to his terms all her temporary safety her handto mouth success accordingly was in his neither perceiving nor divining this thanks to such means as she could take to prevent him take literally from hour to hour during these days of more unbroken exposure from hour to hour she fairly expected some sign of his having decided on a jump ah yes it has been as you think ive strayed away ive fancied myself free given myself in other quantities with larger generosities because i thought you were differentdifferent from what i now see but it was only only because i didnt knowand you must admit that you gave me scarce reason enough reason enough i mean to keep clear of my mistake to which i confess for which ill do exquisite penance which you can help me now i too beautifully feel to get completely over  that was what while she watched herself she potentially heard him bring out and while she carried to an end another day another sequence and yet another of their hours together without his producing it she felt herself occupied with him beyond even the intensity of surrender she was keeping her head for a reason for a cause and the labour of this detachment with the labour of her keeping the pitch of it down held them together in the steel hoop of an intimacy compared with which artless passion would have been but a beating of the air her greatest danger or at least her greatest motive for care was the obsession of the thought that if he actually did suspect the fruit of his attention to her couldnt help being a sense of the growth of her importance taking the measure with him as she had taken it with her father of the prescribed reach of her hypocrisy she saw how it would have to stretch even to her seeking to prove that she was not all the same important a single touch from himoh she should know it in case of its comingany brush of his hand of his lips of his voice inspired by recognition of her probable interest as distinct from pity for her virtual gloom would hand her over to him bound hand and foot therefore to be free to be free to act other than abjectly for her father she must conceal from him the validity that like a microscopic insect pushing a grain of sand she was taking on even for herself she could keep it up with a change in sight but she couldnt keep it up forever so that really one extraordinary effect of their week of untempered confrontation which bristled with new marks was to make her reach out in thought to their customary companions and calculate the kind of relief that rejoining them would bring she was learning almost from minute to minute to be a mistress of shades since always when there were possibilities enough of intimacy there were also by that fact in intercourse possibilities of iridescence but she was working against an adversary who was a master of shades too and on whom if she didnt look out she should presently have imposed a consciousness of the nature of their struggle to feel him in fact to think of his feeling himself her adversary in things of this finenessto see him at all in short brave a name that would represent him as in opposition was already to be nearly reduced to a visible smothering of her cry of alarm should he guess they were having in their so occult manner a high fight and that it was she all the while in her supposed stupidity who had made it high and was keeping it highin the event of his doing this before they could leave town she should verily be lost  the possible respite for her at fawns would come from the fact that observation in him there would inevitably find some of its directness diverted this would be the case if only because the remarkable strain of her fathers placidity might be thought of as likely to claim some larger part of his attention besides which there would be always charlotte herself to draw him off charlotte would help him again doubtless to study anything right or left that might be symptomatic but maggie could see that this very fact might perhaps contribute in its degree to protect the secret of her own fermentation it is not even incredible that she may have discovered the gleam of a comfort that was to broaden in the conceivable effect on the princes spirit on his nerves on his finer irritability of some of the very airs and aspects the light graces themselves of mrs ververs too perfect competence what it would most come to after all she said to herself was a renewal for him of the privilege of watching that lady watch her very well then with the elements after all so mixed in him how long would he go on enjoying mere spectatorship of that act for she had by this time made up her mind that in charlottes company he deferred to charlottes easier art of mounting guard wouldnt he get tired to put it only at thatof seeing her always on the rampart erect and elegant with her laceflounced parasol now folded and now shouldered march to and fro against a goldcoloured east or west maggie had gone far truly for a view of the question of this particular reaction and she was not incapable of pulling herself up with the rebuke that she counted her chickens before they were hatched how sure she should have to be of so many things before she might thus find a weariness in amerigos expression and a logic in his weariness  one of her dissimulated arts for meeting their tension meanwhile was to interweave mrs assingham as plausibly as possible with the undulations of their surface to bring it about that she should join them of an afternoon when they drove together or if they went to look at thingslooking at things being almost as much a feature of their life as if they were bazaaropening royalties then there were such combinations later in the day as her attendance on them and the colonels as well for such whimsical matters as visits to the opera no matter who was singing and sudden outbreaks of curiosity about the british drama the good couple from cadogan place could always unprotestingly dine with them and go on afterwards to such publicities as the princess cultivated the boldness of now perversely preferring it may be said of her that during these passages she plucked her sensations by the way detached nervously the small wild blossoms of her dim forest so that she could smile over them at least with the spacious appearance for her companions for her husband above all of bravely of altogether frivolously going amaying she had her intense her smothered excitements some of which were almost inspirations she had in particular the extravagant positively at moments the amused sense of using her friend to the topmost notch accompanied with the high luxury of not having to explain never no never should she have to explain to fanny assingham again who poor woman on her own side would be charged it might be forever with that privilege of the higher ingenuity she put it all off on fanny and the dear thing herself might henceforth appraise the quantity more and more magnificent now in her blameless egoism maggie asked no questions of her and thus only signified the greatness of the opportunity she gave her she didnt care for what devotions what dinners of their own the assinghams might have been booked that was a detail and she could think without wincing of the ruptures and rearrangements to which her service condemned them it all fell in beautifully moreover so that as hard at this time in spite of her fever as a little pointed diamond the princess showed something of the glitter of consciously possessing the constructive the creative hand she had but to have the fancy of presenting herself of presenting her husband in a certain high and convenient manner to make it natural they should go about with their gentleman and their lady to what else but this exactly had charlotte during so many weeks of the earlier season worked her upherself assuming and discharging so far as might be the character and office of one of those revolving subordinate presences that float in the wake of greatness  the precedent was therefore established and the group normally constituted mrs assingham meanwhile at table on the stairs in the carriage or the operabox mightwith her constant overflow of expression for that matter and its singularly resident character where men in especial were concernedlook across at amerigo in whatever sense she liked it was not of that maggie proposed to be afraid she might warn him she might rebuke him she might reassure him she mightif it were impossible not toabsolutely make love to him even this was open to her as a matter simply between them if it would help her to answer for the impeccability he had guaranteed and maggie desired in fact only to strike her as acknowledging the efficacy of her aid when she mentioned to her one evening a small project for the morrow privately entertainedthe idea irresistible intense of going to pay at the museum a visit to mr crichton mr crichton as mrs assingham could easily remember was the most accomplished and obliging of public functionaries whom every one knew and who knew every onewho had from the first in particular lent himself freely and for the love of art and history to becoming one of the steadier lights of mr ververs adventurous path the custodian of one of the richest departments of the great national collection of precious things he could feel for the sincere private collector and urge him on his way even when condemned to be present at his capture of trophies sacrificed by the country to parliamentary thrift he carried his amiability to the point of saying that since london under pettifogging views had to miss from time to time its rarest opportunities he was almost consoled to see such lost causes invariably wander at last one by one with the tormenting tinkle of their silver bells into the wondrous the already famous fold beyond the mississippi there was a charm in his almosts that was not to be resisted especially after mr verver and maggie had grown sureor almost againof enjoying the monopoly of them and on this basis of envy changed to sympathy by the more familiar view of the father and the daughter mr crichton had at both houses though especially in eaton square learned to fill out the responsive and suggestive character it was at his invitation fanny well recalled that maggie one day long before and under her own attendance precisely had for the glory of the name she bore paid a visit to one of the ampler shrines of the supreme exhibitory temple an alcove of shelves charged with the goldandbrown goldand ivory of old italian bindings and consecrated to the records of the princes race it had been an impression that penetrated that remained yet maggie had sighed ever so prettily at its having to be so superficial she was to go back some day to dive deeper to linger and taste in spite of which however mrs assingham could not recollect perceiving that the visit had been repeated this second occasion had given way for a long time in her happy life to other occasionsall testifying in their degree to the quality of her husbands blood its rich mixture and its many remarkable references after which no doubt the charming piety involved had grown on still further grounds bewildered and faint  it now appeared none the less that some renewed conversation with mr crichton had breathed on the faintness revivingly and maggie mentioned her purpose as a conception of her very own to the success of which she designed to devote her morning visits of gracious ladies under his protection lighted up rosily for this perhaps most flowerloving and honeysipping member of the great bloomsbury hive its packed passages and cells and though not sworn of the province toward which his friend had found herself according to her appeal to him yearning again nothing was easier for him than to put her in relation with the presiding urbanities so it had been settled maggie said to mrs assingham and she was to dispense with amerigos company fanny was to remember later on that she had at first taken this last fact for one of the finer notes of her young womans detachment imagined she must be going alone because of the shade of irony that in these ambiguous days her husbands personal presence might be felt to confer practically on any tribute to his transmitted significance then as the next moment she felt it clear that so much plotted freedom was virtually a refinement of reflection an impulse to commemorate afresh whatever might still survive of pride and hope her sense of ambiguity happily fell and she congratulated her companion on having anything so exquisite to do and on being so exquisitely in the humour to do it after the occasion had come and gone she was confirmed in her optimism she made out in the evening that the hour spent among the projected lights the annals and illustrations the parchments and portraits the emblazoned volumes and the murmured commentary had been for the princess enlarging and inspiring maggie had said to her some days before very sweetly but very firmly invite us to dine please for friday and have any one you like or you canit doesnt in the least matter whom and the pair in cadogan place had bent to this mandate with a docility not in the least ruffled by all that it took for granted  it provided for an eveningthis had been maggies view and she lived up to her view in her friends eyes by treating the occasion more or less explicitly as new and strange the good assinghams had feasted in fact at the two other boards on a scale so disproportionate to the scant solicitations of their own that it was easy to make a joke of seeing how they fed at home how they met themselves the question of giving to eat maggie dined with them in short and arrived at making her husband appear to dine much in the manner of a pair of young sovereigns who have in the frolic humour of the golden years of reigns proposed themselves to a pair of faithfullyserving subjects she showed an interest in their arrangements an inquiring tenderness almost for their economies so that her hostess not unnaturally as they might have said put it all downthe tone and the freedom of which she set the exampleto the effect wrought in her afresh by one of the lessons learned in the morning at the altar of the past hadnt she picked it up from an anecdote or two offered again to her attention that there were for princesses of such a line more ways than one of being a heroine maggies way tonight was to surprise them all truly by the extravagance of her affability she was doubtless not positively boisterous yet though mrs assingham as a bland critic had never doubted her being graceful she had never seen her put so much of it into being what might have been called assertive it was all a tune to which fannys heart could privately palpitate her guest was happy happy as a consequence of something that had occurred but she was making the prince not lose a ripple of her laugh though not perhaps always enabling him to find it absolutely not foolish foolish in public beyond a certain point he was scarce the man to brook his wifes being thought to be so that there hovered before their friend the possibility of some subsequent scene between them in the carriage or at home of slightly sarcastic inquiry of promptly invited explanation a scene that according as maggie should play her part in it might or might not precipitate developments what made these appearances practically thrilling meanwhile was this mysterya mystery it was clear to amerigo himselfof the incident or the influence that had so peculiarly determined them  the lady of cadogan place was to read deeper however within three days and the page was turned for her on the eve of her young confidants leaving london the awaited migration to fawns was to take place on the morrow and it was known meanwhile to mrs assingham that their party of four were to dine that night at the american embassy with another and a larger party so that the elder woman had a sense of surprise on receiving from the younger under date of six oclock a telegram requesting her immediate attendance please come to me at once dress early if necessary so that we shall have time the carriage ordered for us will take you back first mrs assingham on quick deliberation dressed though not perhaps with full lucidity and by seven oclock was in portland place where her friend upstairs and described to her on her arrival as herself engaged in dressing instantly received her she knew on the spot poor fanny as she was afterwards to declare to the colonel that her feared crisis had popped up as at the touch of a spring that her impossible hour was before her her impossible hour was the hour of its coming out that she had known of old so much more than she had ever said and she had often put it to herself in apprehension she tried to think even in preparation that she should recognise the approach of her doom by a consciousness akin to that of the blowing open of a window on some night of the highest wind and the lowest thermometer it would be all in vain to have crouched so long by the fire the glass would have been smashed the icy air would fill the place if the air in maggies room then on her going up was not as yet quite the polar blast she had expected it was distinctly none the less such an atmosphere as they had not hitherto breathed together the princess she perceived was completely dressedthat business was over it added indeed to the effect of her importantly awaiting the assistance she had summoned of her showing a deck cleared so to speak for action her maid had already left her and she presented herself in the large clear room where everything was admirable but where nothing was out of place as for the first time in her life rather bedizened was it that she had put on too many things overcharged herself with jewels wore in particular more of them than usual and bigger ones in her haira question her visitor presently answered by attributing this appearance largely to the bright red spot red as some monstrous ruby that burned in either of her cheeks these two items of her aspect had promptly enough their own light for mrs assingham who made out by it that nothing more pathetic could be imagined than the refuge and disguise her agitation had instinctively asked of the arts of dress multiplied to extravagance almost to incoherence she had had visibly her ideathat of not betraying herself by inattentions into which she had never yet fallen and she stood there circled about and furnished forth as always in a manner that testified to her perfect little personal processes it had ever been her sign that she was for all occasions found ready without loose ends or exposed accessories or unremoved superfluities a suggestion of the swept and garnished in her whole splendid yet thereby more or less encumbered and embroidered setting that reflected her small still passion for order and symmetry for objects with their backs to the walls and spoke even of some probable reference in her american blood to dusting and polishing new england grandmothers if her apartment was princely in the clearness of the lingering day she looked as if she had been carried there prepared all attired and decorated like some holy image in a procession and left precisely to show what wonder she could work under pressure her friend felthow could she notas the truly pious priest might feel when confronted behind the altar before the festa with his miraculous madonna such an occasion would be grave in general with all the gravity of what he might look for but the gravity tonight would be of the rarest what he might look for would depend so on what he could give                                xxxiii  something very strange has happened and i think you ought to know it  maggie spoke this indeed without extravagance yet with the effect of making her guest measure anew the force of her appeal it was their definite understanding whatever fanny knew fannys faith would provide for and she knew accordingly at the end of five minutes what the extraordinary in the late occurrence had consisted of and how it had all come of maggies achieved hour under mr crichtons protection at the museum he had desired mr crichton with characteristic kindness after the wonderful show after offered luncheon at his incorporated lodge hard by to see her safely home especially on his noting in attending her to the great steps that she had dismissed her carriage which she had done really just for the harmless amusement of taking her way alone she had known she should find herself as the consequence of such an hour in a sort of exalted state under the influence of which a walk through the london streets would be exactly what would suit her best an independent ramble impressed excited contented with nothing to mind and nobody to talk to and shopwindows in plenty to look at if she liked a low taste of the essence it was to be supposed of her nature that she had of late for so many reasons been unable to gratify she had taken her leave with her thanksshe knew her way quite enough it being also sufficiently the case that she had even a shy hope of not going too straight to wander a little wild was what would truly amuse her so that keeping clear of oxford street and cultivating an impression as of parts she didnt know she had ended with what she had more or less had been fancying an encounter with three or four shopsan old booksellers an old printmongers a couple of places with dim antiquities in the windowthat were not as so many of the other shops those in sloane street say a hollow parade which had long since ceased to beguile there had remained with her moreover an allusion of charlottes of some months beforeseed dropped into her imagination in the form of a casual speech about there being in bloomsbury such funny little fascinating places and even sometimes such unexpected finds there could perhaps have been no stronger mark than this sense of wellnigh romantic opportunityno livelier sign of the impression made on her and always so long retained so watchfully nursed by any observation of charlottes however lightly thrown off and then she had felt somehow more at her ease than for months and months before she didnt know why but her time at the museum oddly had done it it was as if she hadnt come into so many noble and beautiful associations nor secured them also for her boy secured them even for her father only to see them turn to vanity and doubt turn possibly to something still worse i believed in him again as much as ever and i felt how i believed in him she said with bright fixed eyes i felt it in the streets as i walked along and it was as if that helped me and lifted me up my being off by myself there not having for the moment to wonder and watch having on the contrary almost nothing on my mind  it was so much as if everything would come out right that she had fallen to thinking of her fathers birthday had given herself this as a reason for trying what she could pick up for it they would keep it at fawns where they had kept it beforesince it would be the twentyfirst of the month and she mightnt have another chance of making sure of something to offer him there was always the impossibility of course of finding him anything the least bit good that he wouldnt already long ago in his rummagings have seen himselfand only not to think a quarter good enough this however was an old story and one could not have had any fun with him but for his sweet theory that the individual gift the friendships offering was by a rigorous law of nature a foredoomed aberration and that the more it was so the more it showed and the more one cherished it for showing how friendly it had been the infirmity of art was the candour of affection the grossness of pedigree the refinement of sympathy the ugliest objects in fact as a general thing were the bravest the tenderest mementos and as such figured in glass cases apart worthy doubtless of the home but not worthy of the templededicated to the grimacing not to the clearfaced gods she herself naturally through the past years had come to be much represented in those receptacles against the thick locked panes of which she still liked to flatten her nose finding in its place each time everything she had on successive anniversaries tried to believe he might pretend at her suggestion to be put off with or at least think curious she was now ready to try it again they had always with his pleasure in her pretence and her pleasure in his with the funny betrayal of the sacrifice to domestic manners on either side played the game so happily to this end on her way home she had loitered everywhere quite too deludedly among the old books and the old prints which had yielded nothing to her purpose but with a strange inconsequence in one of the other shops that of a small antiquarian a queer little foreign man who had shown her a number of things shown her finally something that struck with it as rather a rarity and thinking it would compared to some of her ventures quite superlatively do she had boughtbought really when it came to that for a price it appears now it wont do at all said maggie something has happened since that puts it quite out of the question i had only my day of satisfaction in it but i feel at the same time as i keep it here before me that i wouldnt have missed it for the world  she had talked from the first of her friends entrances coherently enough even with a small quaver that overstated her calm but she held her breath every few seconds as if for deliberation and to prove she didnt pantall of which marked for fanny the depth of her commotion her reference to her thought about her father about her chance to pick up something that might divert him her mention in fine of his fortitude under presents having meanwhile naturally it should be said much less an amplitude of insistence on the speakers lips than a power to produce on the part of the listener herself the prompt response and full comprehension of memory and sympathy of old amused observation the picture was filled out by the latters fond fancy but maggie was at any rate under arms she knew what she was doing and had already her plana plan for making for allowing as yet no difference in accordance with which she would still dine out and not with red eyes nor convulsed features nor neglected items of appearance nor anything that would raise a question yet there was some knowledge that exactly to this support of her not breaking down she desired she required possession of and with the sinister rise and fall of lightning unaccompanied by thunder it played before mrs assinghams eyes that she herself should have at whatever risk or whatever cost to supply her with the stuff of her need all our friends instinct was to hold off from this till she should see what the ground would bear she would take no step nearer unless intelligibly to meet her and awkward though it might be to hover there only pale and distorted with mere imbecilities of vagueness there was a quality of bald help in the fact of not as yet guessing what such an ominous start could lead to she caught however after a seconds thought at the princesss allusion to her lost reassurance  you mean you were so at your ease on mondaythe night you dined with us  i was very happy then said maggie  yeswe thought you so gay and so brilliant fanny felt it feeble but she went on we were so glad you were happy  maggie stood a moment at first only looking at her you thought me all right eh  surely dearest we thought you all right  well i daresay it was natural but in point of fact i never was more wrong in my life for all the while if you please this was brewing  mrs assingham indulged as nearly as possible to luxury her vagueness this  that replied the princess whose eyes her companion now saw had turned to an object on the chimneypiece of the room of which among so many precious objectsthe ververs wherever they might be always revelled peculiarly in matchless old mantel ornamentsher visitor had not taken heed  do you mean the gilt cup  i mean the gilt cup  the piece now recognised by fanny as new to her own vision was a capacious bowl of oldlooking rather strikingly yellow gold mounted by a short stem on an ample foot which held a central position above the fireplace where to allow it the better to show a clearance had been made of other objects notably of the louisseize clock that accompanied the candelabra this latter trophy ticked at present on the marble slab of a commode that exactly matched it in splendour and style mrs assingham took it the bowl as a fine thing but the question was obviously not of its intrinsic value and she kept off from it admiring it at a distance but what has that to do  it has everything youll see with which again however for the moment maggie attached to her strange wide eyes he knew her beforebefore i had ever seen him  he knew but fanny while she cast about her for the links she missed could only echo it  amerigo knew charlottemore than i ever dreamed  fanny felt then it was stare for stare but surely you always knew they had met  i didnt understand i knew too little dont you see what i mean the princess asked  mrs assingham wondered during these instants how much she even now knew it had taken a minute to perceive how gently she was speaking with that perception of its being no challenge of wrath no heat of the deceived soul but only a free exposure of the completeness of past ignorance inviting derision even if it must the elder woman felt first a strange barely credible relief she drew in as if it had been the warm summer scent of a flower the sweet certainty of not meeting any way she should turn any consequence of judgment she shouldnt be judgedsave by herself which was her own wretched business the next moment however at all events she blushed within for her immediate cowardice she had thought of herself thought of getting off before so much as thinkingthat is of pitifully seeingthat she was in presence of an appeal that was all an appeal that utterly accepted its necessity in a general way dear child yes but notain connexion with what youve been telling me  they were intimate you see intimate said the princess  fanny continued to face her taking from her excited eyes this history so dim and faint for all her anxious emphasis of the faraway other time theres always the question of what one considers  what one considers intimate well i know what i consider intimate now too intimate said maggie to let me know anything about it  it was quietyes but not too quiet for fanny assinghams capacity to wince only compatible with letting me you mean she had asked it after a pause but turning again to the new ornament of the chimney and wondering even while she took relief from it at this gap in her experience but here are things my dear of which my ignorance is perfect  they went about togethertheyre known to have done it and i dont mean only beforei mean after  after said fanny assingham  before we were marriedyes but after we were engaged  ah ive known nothing about that and she said it with a braver assuranceclutching with comfort at something that was apparently new to her  that bowl maggie went on is so strangelytoo strangely almost to believe at this time of daythe proof they were together all the whileup to the very eve of our marriage dont you remember how just before that she came back so unexpectedly from america  the question had for mrs assinghamand whether all consciously or notthe oddest pathos of simplicity oh yes dear of course i remember how she came back from americaand how she stayed with us and what view one had of it  maggies eyes still all the time pressed and penetrated so that during a moment just here she might have given the little flare have made the little pounce of asking what then ones view had been to the small flash of this eruption fanny stood for her minute wittingly exposed but she saw it as quickly cease to threatenquite saw the princess even though in all her pain refuse in the interest of their strange and exalted bargain to take advantage of the opportunity for planting the stab of reproach the opportunity thus coming all of itself she saw heror she believed she saw herlook at her chance for straight denunciation look at it and then pass it by and she felt herself with this fact hushed wellnigh to awe at the lucid higher intention that no distress could confound and that no discoverysince it was however obscurely a case of discoverycould make less needful these seconds were brief they rapidly passed but they lasted long enough to renew our friends sense of her own extraordinary undertaking the function again imposed on her the answerability again drilled into her by this intensity of intimation she was reminded of the terms on which she was let offher quantity of release having made its sufficient show in that recall of her relation to charlottes old reappearance and deep within the whole impression glowedah so inspiringly when it came to that her steady view clear from the first of the beauty of her companions motive it was like a fresh sacrifice for a larger conquest only see me through now do it in the face of this and in spite of it and i leave you a hand of which the freedom isnt to be said the aggravation of fearor call it apparently of knowledgehad jumped straight into its place as an aggravation above all for her father the effect of this being but to quicken to passion her reasons for making his protectedness or in other words the forms of his ignorance still the law of her attitude and the key to her solution she kept as tight hold of these reasons and these forms in her confirmed horror as the rider of a plunging horse grasps his seat with his knees and she might absolutely have been putting it to her guest that she believed she could stay on if they should only meet nothing more though ignorant still of what she had definitely met fanny yearned within over her spirit and so no word about it said passed through mere pitying eyes a vow to walk ahead and at crossroads with a lantern for the darkness and wavings away for unadvised traffic look out for alarms there was accordingly no wait in maggies reply they spent together hoursspent at least a morningthe certainty of which has come back to me now but that i didnt dream of it at the time that cup there has turned witnessby the most wonderful of chances thats why since it has been here ive stood it out for my husband to see put it where it would meet him almost immediately if he should come into the room ive wanted it to meet him she went on and ive wanted him to meet it and to be myself present at the meeting but that hasnt taken place as yet often as he has lately been in the way of coming to see me hereyes in particular latelyhe hasnt showed today it was with her managed quietness more and more that she talkedan achieved coherence that helped her evidently to hear and to watch herself there was support and thereby an awful harmony but which meant a further guidance in the facts she could add together its quite as if he had an instinctsomething that has warned him off or made him uneasy he doesnt quite know naturally what has happened but guesses with his beautiful cleverness that something has and isnt in a hurry to be confronted with it so in his vague fear he keeps off  but being meanwhile in the house  ive no ideanot having seen him today by exception since before luncheon he spoke to me then the princess freely explained of a ballot of great importance at a clubfor somebody some personal friend i think whos coming up and is supposed to be in danger to make an effort for him he thought he had better lunch there you see the efforts he can makefor which maggie found a smile that went to her friends heart hes in so many ways the kindest of men but it was hours ago  mrs assingham thought the more danger then of his coming in and finding me here i dont know you see what you now consider that youve ascertained nor anything of the connexion with it of that object that you declare so damning her eyes rested on this odd acquisition and then quitted it went back to it and again turned from it it was inscrutable in its rather stupid elegance and yet from the moment one had thus appraised it vivid and definite in its domination of the scene fanny could no more overlook it now than she could have overlooked a lighted christmastree but nervously and all in vain she dipped into her mind for some floating reminiscence of it at the same time that this attempt left her blank she understood a good deal she even not a little shared the princes mystic apprehension the golden bowl put on under consideration a sturdy a conscious perversity as a document somehow it was ugly though it might have a decorative grace his finding me here in presence of it might be more flagrantly disagreeablefor all of usthan you intend or than would necessarily help us and i must take time truly to understand what it means  youre safe as far as that goes maggie returned you may take it from me that he wont come in and that i shall only find him below waiting for me when i go down to the carriage  fanny assingham took it from her took it and more were to sit together at the ambassadors thenor at least you two arewith this new complication thrust up before you all unexplained and to look at each other with faces that pretend for the ghastly hour not to be seeing it  maggie looked at her with a face that might have been the one she was preparing unexplained my dear quite the contrary explained fully intensely admirably explained with nothing really to add my own loveshe kept it upi dont want anything more ive plenty to go upon and to do with as it is  fanny assingham stood there in her comparative darkness with her links verily still missing but the most acceptable effect of this was singularly as yet a cold fear of getting nearer the fact but when you come home i mean hell come up with you again wont he see it then  on which maggie gave her after an instants visible thought the strangest of slow headshakes i dont know perhaps hell never see itif it only stands there waiting for him he may never again said the princess come into this room  fanny more deeply wondered never again oh  yes it may be how do i know with this she quietly went on she had not looked again at the incriminating piece but there was a marvel to her friend in the way the little word representing it seemed to express and include for her the whole of her situation then you intend not to speak to him  maggie waited to speak  well about your having it and about what you consider that it represents  oh i dont know that i shall speakif he doesnt but his keeping away from me because of thatwhat will that be but to speak he cant say or do more it wont be for me to speak maggie added in a different tone one of the tones that had already so penetrated her guest it will be for me to listen  mrs assingham turned it over then it all depends on that object that you regard for your reasons as evidence  i think i may say that i depend on it i cant said maggie treat it as nothing now  mrs assingham at this went closer to the cup on the chimney quite liking to feel that she did so moreover without going closer to her companions vision she looked at the precious thingif precious it wasfound herself in fact eyeing it as if by her dim solicitation to draw its secret from it rather than suffer the imposition of maggies knowledge it was brave and rich and firm with its bold deep hollow and without this queer torment about it would thanks to her love of plenty of yellow figure to her as an enviable ornament a possession really desirable she didnt touch it but if after a minute she turned away from it the reason was rather oddly and suddenly in her fear of doing so then it all depends on the bowl i mean your future does for thats what it comes to i judge  what it comes to maggie presently returned is what that thing has put me so almost miraculously in the way of learning how far they had originally gone together if there was so much between them before there cantwith all the other appearancesnot be a great deal more now and she went on and on she steadily made her points if such things were already then between them they make all the difference for possible doubt of what may have been between them since if there had been nothing before there might be explanations but it makes today too much to explain i mean to explain away she said  fanny assingham was there to explain awayof this she was duly conscious for that at least had been true up to now in the light however of maggies demonstration the quantity even without her taking as yet a more exact measure might well seem larger than ever besides which with or without exactness the effect of each successive minute in the place was to put her more in presence of what maggie herself saw maggie herself saw the truth and that was really while they remained there together enough for mrs assinghams relation to it there was a force in the princesss mere manner about it that made the detail of what she knew a matter of minor importance fanny had in fact something like a momentary shame over her own need of asking for this detail i dont pretend to repudiate she said after a little my own impressions of the different times i suppose you speak of any more she added than i can forget what difficulties and as it constantly seemed to me what dangers every course of actionwhatever i should decide uponmade for me i tried i tried hard to act for the best and you know she next pursued while at the sound of her own statement a slow courage and even a faint warmth of conviction came back to herand you know i believe its what i shall turn out to have done  this produced a minute during which their interchange though quickened and deepened was that of silence only and the long charged look all of which found virtual consecration when maggie at last spoke im sure you tried to act for the best  it kept fanny assingham again a minute in silence i never thought dearest you werent an angel  not however that this alone was much help it was up to the very eve you see the princess went onup to within two or three days of our marriage that that you know and she broke down for strangely smiling  yes as i say it was while she was with me but i didnt know it that is said fanny assingham i didnt know of anything in particular it sounded weakthat she felt but she had really her point to make what i mean is that i dont know for knowledge now anything i didnt then thats how i am she still however floundered i mean its how i was  but dont they how you were and how you are maggie asked come practically to the same thing the elder womans words had struck her own ear as in the tone now mistimed of their recent but all too factitious understanding arrived at in hours when as there was nothing susceptible of proof there was nothing definitely to disprove the situation had changed bywell by whatever there was by the outbreak of the definite and this could keep maggie at least firm she was firm enough as she pursued it was on the whole thing that amerigo married me with which her eyes had their turn again at her damnatory piece and it was on thatit was on that but they came back to her visitor and it was on it all that father married her  her visitor took it as might be they both marriedah that you must believewith the highest intentions  father did certainly and then at the renewal of this consciousness it all rolled over her ah to thrust such things on us to do them here between us and with us day after day and in return in return to do it to himto him to him  fanny hesitated you mean its for him you most suffer and then as the princess after a look but turned away moving about the roomwhich made the question somehow seem a blunderi ask she continued because i think everything everything we now speak of may be for him really may be made for him quite as if it hadnt been  but maggie had the next moment faced about as if without hearing her father did it for medid it all and only for me  mrs assingham with a certain promptness threw up her head but she faltered again before she spoke well  it was only an intended word but maggie showed after an instant that it had reached her do you mean that thats the reason that thats a reason  fanny at first however feeling the response in this didnt say all she meant she said for the moment something else instead he did it for youlargely at least for you and it was for you that i did in my smaller interested waywell what i could do for i could do something she continued i thought i saw your interest as he himself saw it and i thought i saw charlottes i believed in her  and i believed in her said maggie  mrs assingham waited again but she presently pushed on she believed then in herself  ah maggie murmured  something exquisite faintly eager in the prompt simplicity of it supported her friend further and the prince believed his belief was real just as he believed in himself  maggie spent a minute in taking it from her he believed in himself  just as i too believed in him for i absolutely did maggie to which fanny then added and i believe in him yet i mean she subjoinedwell i mean i do  maggie again took it from her after which she was again restlessly set afloat then when this had come to an end and do you believe in charlotte yet  mrs assingham had a demur that she felt she could now afford well talk of charlotte some other day they both at any rate thought themselves safe at the time  then why did they keep from me everything i might have known  her friend bent upon her the mildest eyes why did i myself keep it from you  oh you werent for honour obliged  dearest maggie the poor woman broke out on this you are divine  they pretended to love me the princess went on and they pretended to love him  and pray what was there that i didnt pretend  not at any rate to care for me as you cared for amerigo and for charlotte they were much more interestingit was perfectly natural how couldnt you like amerigo maggie continued  mrs assingham gave it up how couldnt i how couldnt i then with a fine freedom she went all her way how cant i how cant i  it fixed afresh maggies wide eyes on her i seei see well its beautiful for you to be able to and of course she added you wanted to help charlotte  yesfanny considered iti wanted to help charlotte but i wanted also you see to help youby not digging up a past that i believed with so much on top of it solidly buried i wanted as i still want she richly declared to help every one  it set maggie once more in movementmovement which however spent itself again with a quick emphasis then its a good deal my faultif everything really began so well  fanny assingham met it as she could youve been only too perfect youve thought only too much  but the princess had already caught at the words yesive thought only too much yet she appeared to continue for the minute full of that fault she had it in fact by this prompted thought all before her of him dear man of him  her friend able to take in thus directly her vision of her father watched her with a new suspense that way might safety lieit was like a wider chink of light he believedwith a beautyin charlotte  yes and it was i who had made him believe i didnt mean to at the time so much for i had no idea then of what was coming but i did it i did it the princess declared  with a beautyah with a beauty you too mrs assingham insisted  maggie however was seeing for herselfit was another matter the thing was that he made her think it would be so possible  fanny again hesitated the prince made her think  maggie staredshe had meant her father but her vision seemed to spread they both made her think she wouldnt have thought without them  yet amerigos good faith mrs assingham insisted was perfect and there was nothing all the more she added against your fathers  the remark however kept maggie for a moment still nothing perhaps but his knowing that she knew  knew  that he was doing it so much for me to what extent she suddenly asked of her friend do you think he was aware that she knew  ah who can say what passes between people in such a relation the only thing one can be sure of is that he was generous and mrs assingham conclusively smiled he doubtless knew as much as was right for himself  as much that is as was right for her  yes thenas was right for her the point is fanny declared that whatever his knowledge it made all the way it went for his good faith  maggie continued to gaze and her friend now fairly waited on her successive movements isnt the point very considerably that his good faith must have been his faith in her taking almost as much interest in me as he himself took  fanny assingham thought he recognised he adopted your long friendship but he founded on it no selfishness  no said maggie with still deeper consideration he counted her selfishness out almost as he counted his own  so you may say  very well maggie went on if he had none of his own he invited her may have expected her on her side to have as little and she may only since have found that out  mrs assingham looked blank since  and he may have become aware maggie pursued that she has found it out that she has taken the measure since their marriage she explained of how much he had asked of hermore say than she had understood at the time he may have made out at last how such a demand was in the long run to affect her  he may have done many things mrs assingham responded but theres one thing he certainly wont have done hell never have shown that he expected of her a quarter as much as she must have understood he was to give  ive often wondered maggie mused what charlotte really understood but its one of the things she has never told me  then as its one of the things she has never told me either we shall probably never know it and we may regard it as none of our business there are many things said mrs assingham that we shall never know  maggie took it in with a long reflection never  but there are others her friend went on that stare us in the face and thatunder whatever difficulty you may feel you labourmay now be enough for us your father has been extraordinary  it had been as if maggie were feeling her way but she rallied to this with a rush extraordinary  magnificent said fanny assingham  her companion held tight to it magnificent  then hell do for himself whatever there may be to do what he undertook for you hell do to the end he didnt undertake it to break down in whatquiet patient exquisite as he isdid he ever break down he had never in his life proposed to himself to have failed and he wont have done it on this occasion  ah this occasionand maggies wail showed her of a sudden thrown back on it am i in the least sure that with everything he even knows what it is and yet am i in the least sure he doesnt  if he doesnt then so much the better leave him alone  do you mean give him up  leave her fanny assingham went on leave her to him  maggie looked at her darkly do you mean leave him to her after this  after everything arent they for that matter intimately together now  intimately how do i know  but fanny kept it up arent you and your husbandin spite of everything  maggies eyes still further if possible dilated it remains to be seen  if youre not then wheres your faith  in my husband  mrs assingham but for an instant hesitated in your father it all comes back to that rest on it  on his ignorance  fanny met it again on whatever he may offer you take that  take it maggie stared  mrs assingham held up her head and be grateful on which for a minute she let the princess face her do you see  i see said maggie at last  then there you are but maggie had turned away moving to the window as if still to keep something in her face from sight she stood there with her eyes on the street while mrs assinghams reverted to that complicating object on the chimney as to which her condition so oddly even to herself was that both of recurrent wonder and recurrent protest she went over it looked at it afresh and yielded now to her impulse to feel it in her hands she laid them on it lifting it up and was surprised thus with the weight of itshe had seldom handled so much massive gold that effect itself somehow prompted her to further freedom and presently to saying i dont believe in this you know  it brought maggie round to her dont believe in it you will when i tell you  ah tell me nothing i wont have it said mrs assingham she kept the cup in her hand held it there in a manner that gave maggies attention to her she saw the next moment a quality of excited suspense this suggested to her oddly that she had with the liberty she was taking an air of intention and the impression betrayed by her companions eyes grew more distinct in a word of warning its of value but its values impaired ive learned by a crack  a crackin the gold  it isnt gold with which somewhat strangely maggie smiled  thats the point  what is it then  its glassand cracked under the gilt as i say at that  glassof this weight  well said maggie its crystaland was once i suppose precious but what she then asked do you mean to do with it  she had come away from her window one of the three by which the wide room enjoying an advantageous back commanded the western sky and caught a glimpse of the evening flush while mrs assingham possessed of the bowl and possessed too of this indication of a flaw approached another for the benefit of the slowlyfading light here thumbing the singular piece weighing it turning it over and growing suddenly more conscious above all of an irresistible impulse she presently spoke again a crack then your whole idea has a crack  maggie by this time at some distance from her waited a moment if you mean by my idea the knowledge that has come to me that  but fanny with decision had already taken her up theres only one knowledge that concerns usone fact with which we can have anything to do  which one then  the fact that your husband has never never never but the very gravity of this statement while she raised her eyes to her friend across the room made her for an instant hang fire  well never what  never been half so interested in you as now but dont you my dear really feel it  maggie considered oh i think what ive told you helps me to feel it his having today given up even his forms his keeping away from me his not having come and she shook her head as against all easy glosses it is because of that you know  well then if its because of this and fanny assingham who had been casting about her and whose inspiration decidedly had come raised the cup in her two hands raised it positively above her head and from under it solemnly smiled at the princess as a signal of intention so for an instant full of her thought and of her act she held the precious vessel and then with due note taken of the margin of the polished floor bare fine and hard in the embrasure of her window she dashed it boldly to the ground where she had the thrill of seeing it with the violence of the crash lie shattered she had flushed with the force of her effort as maggie had flushed with wonder at the sight and this high reflection in their faces was all that passed between them for a minute more after which whatever you meant by itand i dont want to know nowhas ceased to exist mrs assingham said  and what in the world my dear did you mean by itthat sound as at the touch of a spring rang out as the first effect of fannys speech it broke upon the two womens absorption with a sharpness almost equal to the smash of the crystal for the door of the room had been opened by the prince without their taking heed he had apparently had time moreover to catch the conclusion of fannys act his eyes attached themselves through the large space allowing just there as happened a free view to the shining fragments at this ladys feet his question had been addressed to his wife but he moved his eyes immediately afterwards to those of her visitor whose own then held them in a manner of which neither party had been capable doubtless for mute penetration since the hour spent by him in cadogan place on the eve of his marriage and the afternoon of charlottes reappearance something now again became possible for these communicants under the intensity of their pressure something that took up that tale and that might have been a redemption of pledges then exchanged this rapid play of suppressed appeal and disguised response lasted indeed long enough for more results than onelong enough for mrs assingham to measure the feat of quick selfrecovery possibly therefore of recognition still more immediate accompanying amerigos vision and estimate of the evidence with which she had beenso admirably she felt as she looked at himinspired to deal she looked at him and looked at himthere were so many things she wanted on the spot to say but maggie was looking tooand was moreover looking at them both so that these things for the elder woman quickly enough reduced themselves to one she met his questionnot too late since in their silence it had remained in the air gathering herself to go leaving the golden bowl split into three pieces on the ground she simply referred him to his wife she should see them later they would all meet soon again and meanwhile as to what maggie had meantshe said in her turn from the doorwhy maggie herself was doubtless by this time ready to tell him                                 xxxiv  left with her husband maggie however for the time said nothing she only felt on the spot a strong sharp wish not to see his face again till he should have had a minute to arrange it she had seen it enough for her temporary clearness and her next movementseen it as it showed during the stare of surprise that followed his entrance then it was that she knew how hugely expert she had been made for judging it quickly by that vision of it indelibly registered for reference that had flashed a light into her troubled soul the night of his late return from matcham the expression worn by it at that juncture for however few instants had given her a sense of its possibilities one of the most relevant of which might have been playing up for her before the consummation of fanny assinghams retreat just long enough to be recognised what she had recognised in it was his recognition the result of his having been forced by the flush of their visitors attitude and the unextinguished report of her words to take account of the flagrant signs of the accident of the incident on which he had unexpectedly dropped he had not unnaturally failed to see this occurrence represented by the three fragments of an object apparently valuable which lay there on the floor and which even across the width of the room his kept interval reminded him unmistakably though confusedly of something known some other unforgotten image that was a mere shock that was a painas if fannys violence had been a violence redoubled and acting beyond its intention a violence calling up the hot blood as a blow across the mouth might have called it maggie knew as she turned away from him that she didnt want his pain what she wanted was her own simple certaintynot the red mark of conviction flaming there in his beauty if she could have gone on with bandaged eyes she would have liked that best if it were a question of saying what she now apparently should have to and of taking from him what he would say any blindness that might wrap it would be the nearest approach to a boon  she went in silence to where her friendnever in intention visibly so much her friend as at that momenthad braced herself to so amazing an energy and there under amerigos eyes she picked up the shining pieces bedizened and jewelled in her rustling finery she paid with humility of attitude this prompt tribute to orderonly to find however that she could carry but two of the fragments at once she brought them over to the chimneypiece to the conspicuous place occupied by the cup before fannys appropriation of it and after laying them carefully down went back for what remained the solid detached foot with this she returned to the mantelshelf placing it with deliberation in the centre and then for a minute occupying herself as with the attempt to fit the other morsels after she had squared again her little objects on the chimney she was within an ace in fact of turning on him with that appeal besides its being lucid for her all the while that the occasion was passing that they were dining out that he wasnt dressed and that though she herself was she was yet in all probability so horribly red in the face and so awry in many ways with agitation that in view of the ambassadors company of possible comments and constructions she should need before her glass some restoration of appearances  amerigo meanwhile after all could clearly make the most of her having enjoined on him to waitsuggested it by the positive pomp of her dealings with the smashed cup to wait that is till she should pronounce as mrs assingham had promised for her this delay again certainly tested her presence of mindthough that strain was not what presently made her speak keep her eyes for the time from her husbands as she might she soon found herself much more drivingly conscious of the strain on his own wit there was even a minute when her back was turned to him during which she knew once more the strangeness of her desire to spare him a strangeness that had already fifty times brushed her in the depth of her trouble as with the wild wing of some bird of the air who might blindly have swooped for an instant into the shaft of a well darkening there by his momentary flutter the faroff round of sky it was extraordinary this quality in the taste of her wrong which made her completed sense of it seem rather to soften than to harden and it was the more extraordinary the more she had to recognise it for what it came to was that seeing herself finally sure knowing everything having the fact in all its abomination so utterly before her that there was nothing else to addwhat it came to was that merely by being with him there in silence she felt within her the sudden split between conviction and action they had begun to cease on the spot surprisingly to be connected conviction that is budged no inch only planting its feet the more firmly in the soilbut action began to hover like some lighter and larger but easier form excited by its very power to keep above ground it would be free it would be independent it would go inwouldnt itfor some prodigious and superior adventure of its own what would condemn it so to speak to the responsibility of freedomthis glimmered on maggie even nowwas the possibility richer with every lapsing moment that her husband would have on the whole question a new need of her a need which was in fact being born between them in these very seconds it struck her truly as so new that he would have felt hitherto none to compare with it at all would indeed absolutely by this circumstance be really needing her for the first one in their whole connection no he had used her had even exceedingly enjoyed her before this but there had been no precedent for that character of a proved necessity to him which she was rapidly taking on the immense advantage of this particular clue moreover was that she should have now to arrange alter to falsify nothing should have to be but consistently simple and straight she asked herself with concentration while her back was still presented what would be the very ideal of that method after which the next instant it had all come to her and she had turned round upon him for the application fanny assingham broke itknowing it had a crack and that it would go if she used sufficient force she thought when i had told her that that would be the best thing to do with itthought so from her own point of view that hadnt been at all my idea but she acted before i understood i had on the contrary she explained put it here in full view exactly that you might see  he stood with his hands in his pockets he had carried his eyes to the fragments on the chimneypiece and she could already distinguish the element of relief absolutely of succour in his acceptance from her of the opportunity to consider the fruits of their friends violenceevery added inch of reflection and delay having the advantage from this point on of counting for him double it had operated within her now to the last intensity her glimpse of the precious truth that by her helping him helping him to help himself as it were she should help him to help her hadnt she fairly got into his labyrinth with himwasnt she indeed in the very act of placing herself there for him at its centre and core whence on that definite orientation and by an instinct all her own she might securely guide him out of it she offered him thus assuredly a kind of support that was not to have been imagined in advance and that moreover requiredah most trulysome close looking at before it could be believed in and pronounced void of treachery yes look look she seemed to see him hear her say even while her sounded words were other look look both at the truth that still survives in that smashed evidence and at the even more remarkable appearance that im not such a fool as you supposed me look at the possibility that since i am different there may still be something in it for youif youre capable of working with me to get that out consider of course as you must the question of what you may have to surrender on your side what price you may have to pay whom you may have to pay with to set this advantage free but take in at any rate that there is something for you if you dont too blindly spoil your chance for it he went no nearer the damnatory pieces but he eyed them from where he stood with a degree of recognition just visibly less to be dissimulated all of which represented for her a certain traceable process and her uttered words meanwhile were different enough from those he might have inserted between the lines of her alreadyspoken its the golden bowl you know that you saw at the little antiquarios in bloomsbury so long agowhen you went there with charlotte when you spent those hours with her unknown to me a day or two before our marriage it was shown you both but you didnt take it you left it for me and i came upon it extraordinarily through happening to go into the same shop on monday last in walking home in prowling about to pick up some small old thing for fathers birthday after my visit to the museum my appointment there with mr crichton of which i told you it was shown me and i was struck with it and took it knowing nothing about it at the time what i now know ive learned sincei learned this afternoon a couple of hours ago receiving from it naturally a great impression so there it is in its three pieces you can handle themdont be afraidif you want to make sure the thing is the thing you and charlotte saw together its having come apart makes an unfortunate difference for its beauty its artistic value but none for anything else its other value is just the samei mean that of its having given me so much of the truth about you i dont therefore so much care what becomes of it nowunless perhaps you may yourself when you come to think have some good use for it in that case maggie wound up we can easily take the pieces with us to fawns  it was wonderful how she felt by the time she had seen herself through this narrow pass that she had really achieved somethingthat she was emerging a little in fine with the prospect less contracted she had done for him that is what her instinct enjoined had laid a basis not merely momentary on which he could meet her when by the turn of his head he did finally meet her this was the last thing that glimmered out of his look but it came into sight none the less as a perception of his distress and almost as a question of his eyes so that for still another minute before he committed himself there occurred between them a kind of unprecedented moral exchange over which her superior lucidity presided it was not however that when he did commit himself the show was promptly portentous but what in the world has fanny assingham had to do with it  she could verily out of all her smothered soreness almost have smiled his question so affected her as giving the whole thing up to her but it left her only to go the straighter she has had to do with it that i immediately sent for her and that she immediately came she was the first person i wanted to see because i knew she would know know more about what i had learned i mean than i could make out for myself i made out as much as i could for myselfthat i also wanted to have done but it didnt in spite of everything take me very far and she has really been a help not so much as she would like to benot so much as poor dear she just now tried to be yet she has done her very best for younever forget thatand has kept me along immeasurably better than i should have been able to come without her she has gained me time and that these three months dont you see has been everything  she had said dont you see on purpose and was to feel the next moment that it had acted these three months the prince asked  counting from the night you came home so late from matcham counting from the hours you spent with charlotte at gloucester your visit to the cathedralwhich you wont have forgotten describing to me in so much detail for that was the beginning of my being sure before it i had been sufficiently in doubt sure maggie developed of your having and of your having for a long time had two relations with charlotte  he stared a little at sea as he took it up two  something in the tone of it gave it a sense or an ambiguity almost foolishleaving maggie to feel as in a flash how such a consequence a foredoomed infelicity partaking of the ridiculous even in one of the cleverest might be of the very essence of the penalty of wrongdoing oh you may have had fiftyhad the same relation with her fifty times its of the number of kinds of relation with her that i speaka number that doesnt matter really so long as there wasnt only one kind as father and i supposed one kind she went on was there before us we took that fully for granted as you saw and accepted it we never thought of there being another kept out of our sight but after the evening i speak of i knew there was something else as i say i had before that my ideawhich you never dreamed i had from the moment i speak of it had more to go upon and you became yourselves you and she vaguely yet uneasily conscious of the difference but its within these last hours that ive most seen where we are and as ive been in communication with fanny assingham about my doubts so i wanted to let her know my certaintywith the determination of which however you must understand she has had nothing to do she defends you maggie remarked  he had given her all his attention and with this impression for her again that he was in essence fairly reaching out to her for timetime only timeshe could sufficiently imagine and to whatever strangeness that he absolutely liked her to talk even at the cost of his losing almost everything else by it it was still for a minute as if he waited for something worse wanted everything that was in her to come out any definite fact anything more precisely nameable so that he tooas was his rightshould know where he was what stirred in him above all while he followed in her face the clear train of her speech must have been the impulse to take up something she put before him that he was yet afraid directly to touch he wanted to make free with it but had to keep his hands offfor reasons he had already made out and the discomfort of his privation yearned at her out of his eyes with an announcing gleam of the fever the none too tolerable chill of specific recognition she affected him as speaking more or less for her father as well and his eyes might have been trying to hypnotise her into giving him the answer without his asking the question had he his idea and has he now with you anything morethose were the words he had to hold himself from not speaking and that she would as yet certainly do nothing to make easy she felt with her sharpest thrill how he was straitened and tied and with the miserable pity of it her present conscious purpose of keeping him so could none the less perfectly accord to name her father on any such basis of anxiety of compunction would be to do the impossible thing to do neither more nor less than give charlotte away visibly palpably traceably he stood off from this moved back from it as from an open chasm now suddenly perceived but which had been between the two with so much so strangely much else quite uncalculated verily it towered before her this history of their confidence they had built strong and piled highbased as it was on such appearancestheir conviction that thanks to her native complacencies of so many sorts she would always quite to the end and through and through take them as nobly sparing her amerigo was at any rate having the sensation of a particular ugliness to avoid a particular difficulty to count with that practically found him as unprepared as if he had been like his wife an abjectly simple person and she meanwhile however abjectly simple was further discerning for herself that whatever he might have to take from hershe being on her side beautifully freehe would absolutely not be able for any qualifying purpose to name charlotte either as his fatherinlaws wife mrs verver rose between them there for the time in august and prohibitive form to protect her defend her explain about her was at the least to bring her into the questionwhich would be by the same stroke to bring her husband but this was exactly the door maggie wouldnt open to him on all of which she was the next moment asking herself if thus warned and embarrassed he were not fairly writhing in his pain he writhed on that hypothesis some seconds more for it was not till then that he had chosen between what he could do and what he couldnt  youre apparently drawing immense conclusions from very small matters wont you perhaps feel in fairness that youre striking out triumphing or whatever i may call it rather too easilyfeel it when i perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does come back to me i frankly confess now to the occasion and to having wished not to speak of it to you at the time we took two or three hours together by arrangement it was on the eve of my marriageat the moment you say but that put it on the eve of yours too my dearwhich was directly the point it was desired to find for you at the eleventh hour some small weddingpresenta hunt for something worth giving you and yet possible from other points of view as well in which it seemed i could be of use you were naturally not to be toldprecisely because it was all for you we went forth together and we looked we rummaged about and as i remember we called it we prowled then it was that as i freely recognise we came across that crystal cupwhich im bound to say upon my honour i think it rather a pity fanny assingham from whatever good motive should have treated so he had kept his hands in his pockets he turned his eyes again but more complacently now to the ruins of the precious vessel and maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation a long deep breath of comparative relief behind everything beneath everything it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with herand he seemed to be proving to himself that he could talk it was at a little shop in bloomsburyi think i could go to the place now the man understood italian i remember he wanted awfully to work off his bowl but i didnt believe in it and we didnt take it  maggie had listened with an interest that wore all the expression of candour oh you left it for me but what did you take  he looked at her first as if he were trying to remember then as if he might have been trying to forget nothing i thinkat that place  what did you take then at any other what did you get mesince that was your aim and endfor a weddinggift  the prince continued very nobly to bethink himself didnt we get you anything  maggie waited a little she had for some time now kept her eyes on him steadily but they wandered at this to the fragments on her chimney yes it comes round after all to your having got me the bowl i myself was to come upon it the other day by so wonderful a chance was to find it in the same place and to have it pressed upon me by the same little man who does as you say understand italian i did believe in it you seemust have believed in it somehow instinctively for i took it as soon as i saw it though i didnt know at all then she added what i was taking with it  the prince paid her for an instant visibly the deference of trying to imagine what this might have been i agree with you that the coincidence is extraordinarythe sort of thing that happens mainly in novels and plays but i dont see you must let me say the importance or the connexion  of my having made the purchase where you failed of it she had quickly taken him up but she had with her eyes on him once more another drop into the order of her thoughts to which through whatever he might say she was still adhering its not my having gone into the place at the end of four years that makes the strangeness of the coincidence for dont such chances as that in london easily occur the strangeness she lucidly said is in what my purchase was to represent to me after i had got it home which value came she explained from the wonder of my having found such a friend  such a friend as a wonder assuredly her husband could but take it  as the little man in the shop he did for me more than he knew i owe it to him he took an interest in me maggie said and taking that interest he recalled your visit he remembered you and spoke of you to me  on which the prince passed the comment of a sceptical smile ah but my dear if extraordinary things come from peoples taking an interest in you  my life in that case she asked must be very agitated well he liked me i meanvery particularly its only so i can account for my afterwards hearing from himand in fact he gave me that today she pursued he gave me it frankly as his reason  today the prince inquiringly echoed  but she was singularly ableit had been marvellously given her she afterwards said to herselfto abide for her light for her clue by her own order  i inspired him with sympathythere you are but the miracle is that he should have a sympathy to offer that could be of use to me that was really the oddity of my chance the princess proceededthat i should have been moved in my ignorance to go precisely to him  he saw her so keep her course that it was as if he could at the best but stand aside to watch her and let her pass he only made a vague demonstration that was like an ineffective gesture im sorry to say any ill of your friends and the thing was a long time ago besides which there was nothing to make me recur to it but i remember the mans striking me as a decided little beast  she gave a slow headshakeas if no after consideration not that way were an issue i can only think of him as kind for he had nothing to gain he had in fact only to lose it was what he came to tell methat he had asked me too high a price more than the object was really worth there was a particular reason which he hadnt mentioned and which had made him consider and repent he wrote for leave to see me againwrote in such terms that i saw him here this afternoon  hereit made the prince look about him  downstairsin the little red room while he was waiting he looked at the few photographs that stand about there and recognised two of them though it was so long ago he remembered the visit made him by the lady and the gentleman and that gave him his connexion it gave me mine for he remembered everything and told me everything you see you too had produced your effect only unlike you he had thought of it againhe had recurred to it he told me of your having wished to make each other presentsbut of thats not having come off the lady was greatly taken with the piece i had bought of him but you had your reason against receiving it from her and you had been right he would think that of you more than ever now maggie went on he would see how wisely you had guessed the flaw and how easily the bowl could be broken i had bought it myself you see for a presenthe knew i was doing that this was what had worked in himespecially after the price i had paid  her story had dropped an instant she still brought it out in small waves of energy each of which spent its force so that he had an opportunity to speak before this force was renewed but the quaint thing was what he now said and what pray was the price  she paused again a little it was high certainlyfor those fragments i think i feel as i look at them there rather ashamed to say  the prince then again looked at them he might have been growing used to the sight but shall you at least get your money back  oh im far from wanting it backi feel so that im getting its worth with which before he could reply she had a quick transition the great fact about the day were talking of seems to me to have been quite remarkably that no present was then made me if your undertaking had been for that that was not at least what came of it  you received then nothing at all the prince looked vague and grave almost retrospectively concerned  nothing but an apology for empty hands and empty pockets which was made meas if it mattered a miteever so frankly ever so beautifully and touchingly  this amerigo heard with interest yet not with confusion ah of course you couldnt have minded distinctly as she went on he was getting the better of the mere awkwardness of his arrest quite as if making out that he need suffer arrest from her now before they should go forth to show themselves in the world togetherin no greater quantity than an occasion illchosen at the best for a scene might decently make room for he looked at his watch their engagement all the while remained before him but i dont make out you see what case against me you rest  on everything im telling you why the whole casethe case of your having for so long so successfully deceived me the idea of your finding something for mecharming as that would have been was what had least to do with your taking a morning together at that moment what had really to do with it said maggie was that you had to you couldnt not from the moment you were again face to face and the reason of that was that there had been so much between you beforebefore i came between you at all  her husband had been for these last moments moving about under her eyes but at this as to check any show of impatience he again stood still youve never been more sacred to me than you were at that hourunless perhaps youve become so at this one  the assurance of his speech she could note quite held up its head in him his eyes met her own so for the declaration that it was as if something cold and momentarily unimaginable breathed upon her from afar off out of his strange consistency she kept her direction still however under that oh the thing ive known best of all is that youve never wanted together to offend us youve wanted quite intensely not to and the precautions youve had to take for it have been for a long time one of the strongest of my impressions that i think she added is the way ive best known  known he repeated after a moment  known known that you were older friends and so much more intimate ones than i had any reason to suppose when we married known there were things that hadnt been told meand that gave their meaning little by little to other things that were before me  would they have made a difference in the matter of our marriage the prince presently asked if you had known them  she took her time to think i grant you notin the matter of ours and then as he again fixed her with his hard yearning which he couldnt keep down the question is so much bigger than that you see how much what i know makes of it for me that was what acted on him this iteration of her knowledge into the question of the validity of the various bearings of which he couldnt on the spot trust himself to pretend in any high way to go what her claim as she made it represented for himthat he couldnt help betraying if only as a consequence of the effect of the word itself her repeated distinct know know on his nerves she was capable of being sorry for his nerves at a time when he should need them for dining out pompously rather responsibly without his heart in it yet she was not to let that prevent her using with all economy so precious a chance for supreme clearness i didnt force this upon you you must recollect and it probably wouldnt have happened for you if you hadnt come in  ah said the prince i was liable to come in you know  i didnt think you were this evening  and why not  well she answered you have many liabilitiesof different sorts  with which she recalled what she had said to fanny assingham and then youre so deep  it produced in his features in spite of his control of them one of those quick plays of expression the shade of a grimace that testified as nothing else did to his race its you cara who are deep  which after an instant she had accepted from him she could so feel at last that it was true then i shall have need of it all  but what would you have done he was by this time asking if i hadnt come in  i dont know she had hesitated what would you  oh iothat isnt the question i depend upon you i go on you would have spoken tomorrow  i think i would have waited  and for what he asked  to see what difference it would make for myself my possession at last i mean of real knowledge  oh said the prince  my only point now at any rate she went on is the difference as i say that it may make for you your knowing wasfrom the moment you did come inall i had in view and she sounded it againhe should have it once more your knowing that ive ceased  that youve ceased with her pause in fact she had fairly made him press her for it  why to be as i was not to know  it was once more then after a little that he had had to stand receptive yet the singular effect of this was that there was still something of the same sort he was made to want he had another hesitation but at last this odd quantity showed then does any one else know  it was as near as he could come to naming her father and she kept him at that distance any one  any one i mean but fanny assingham  i should have supposed you had had by this time particular means of learning i dont see she said why you ask me  then after an instantand only after an instant as she sawhe made out what she meant and it gave her all strangely enough the still further light that charlotte for herself knew as little as he had known the vision loomed in this light it fairly glared for the few secondsthe vision of the two others alone together at fawns and charlotte as one of them having gropingly to go on always not knowing and not knowing the picture flushed at the same time with all its essential colour that of the so possible identity of her fathers motive and principle with her own he was deep as amerigo called it so that no vibration of the still air should reach his daughter just as she had earned that description by making and by for that matter intending still to make her care for his serenity or at any rate for the firm outer shell of his dignity all marvellous enamel her paramount law more strangely even than anything else her husband seemed to speak now but to help her in this i know nothing but what you tell me  then ive told you all i intended find out the rest  find it out he waited  she stood before him a momentit took that time to go on depth upon depth of her situation as she met his face surged and sank within her but with the effect somehow once more that they rather lifted her than let her drop she had her feet somewhere through it allit was her companion absolutely who was at sea and she kept her feet she pressed them to what was beneath her she went over to the bell beside the chimney and gave a ring that he could but take as a summons for her maid it stopped everything for the present it was an intimation to him to go and dress but she had to insist find out for yourself    part fifth                              xxxv  after the little party was again constituted at fawnswhich had taken for completeness some ten daysmaggie naturally felt herself still more possessed in spirit of everything that had last happened in london there was a phrase that came back to her from old american years she was having by that idiom the time of her lifeshe knew it by the perpetual throb of this sense of possession which was almost too violent either to recognise or to hide it was as if she had come outthat was her most general consciousness out of a dark tunnel a dense wood or even simply a smoky room and had thereby at least for going on the advantage of air in her lungs it was as if she were somehow at last gathering in the fruits of patience she had either been really more patient than she had known at the time or had been so for longer the change brought about by itself as great a difference of view as the shift of an inch in the position of a telescope it was her telescope in fact that had gained in rangejust as her danger lay in her exposing herself to the observation by the more charmed and therefore the more reckless use of this optical resource not under any provocation to produce it in public was her unremitted rule but the difficulties of duplicity had not shrunk while the need of it had doubled humbugging which she had so practised with her father had been a comparatively simple matter on the basis of mere doubt but the ground to be covered was now greatly larger and she felt not unlike some young woman of the theatre who engaged for a minor part in the play and having mastered her cues with anxious effort should find herself suddenly promoted to leading lady and expected to appear in every act of the five she had made much to her husband that last night of her knowing but it was exactly this quantity she now knew that from the moment she could only dissimulate it added to her responsibility and made of the latter all a mere question of having something precious and precarious in charge there was no one to help her with itnot even fanny assingham now this good friends presence having become inevitably with that climax of their last interview in portland place a severely simplified function she had her use oh yes a thousand times but it could only consist henceforth in her quite conspicuously touching at no point whateverassuredly at least with maggiethe matter they had discussed she was there inordinately as a value but as a value only for the clear negation of everything she was their general sign precisely of unimpaired beatitudeand she was to live up to that somewhat arduous character poor thing as she might she might privately lapse from it if she must with amerigo or with charlotteonly not of course ever so much as for the wink of an eye with the master of the house such lapses would be her own affair which maggie at present could take no thought of she treated her young friend meanwhile it was to be said to no betrayal of such wavering so that from the moment of her alighting at the door with the colonel everything went on between them at concert pitch what had she done that last evening in maggies room but bring the husband and wife more together than as would seem they had ever been therefore what indiscretion should she not show by attempting to go behind the grand appearance of her successwhich would be to court a doubt of her beneficent work she knew accordingly nothing but harmony and diffused restlessly nothing but peacean extravagant expressive aggressive peace not incongruous after all with the solid calm of the place a kind of helmetted tridentshaking pax britannica  the peace it must be added had become as the days elapsed a peace quite generally animated and peopledthanks to that fact of the presence of company in which maggies ability to preserve an appearance had learned from so far back to find its best resource it was not inconspicuous it was in fact striking that this resource just now seemed to meet in the highest degree every ones need quite as if every one were by the multiplication of human objects in the scene by the creation by the confusion of fictive issues hopeful of escaping somebody elses notice it had reached the point in truth that the collective bosom might have been taken to heave with the knowledge of the descent upon adjacent shores for a short period of mrs rance and the lutches still united and still so divided for conquest the sense of the party showed at least oddly enough as favourable to the fancy of the quaint turn that some near weekend might derive from their reappearance this measured for maggie the ground they had all travelled together since that unforgotten afternoon of the none so distant year that determinant september sunday when sitting with her father in the park as in commemoration of the climax both of their old order and of their old danger she had proposed to him that they should call in charlottecall her in as a specialist might be summoned to an invalids chair wasnt it a sign of something rather portentous their being ready to be beholden as for a diversion to the once despised kitty and dotty that had already had its application in truth to her invocation of the castledeans and several other members again of the historic matcham week made before she left town and made always consistently with an ideasince she was never henceforth to approach these people without an idea and since that lurid element of their intercourse grew and grew for her with each occasion the flame with which it burned afresh during these particular days the way it held up the torch to anything to everything that might have occurred as the climax of revels springing from traditions so vivifiedthis by itself justified her private motive and reconsecrated her diplomacy she had already produced by the aid of these people something of the effect she soughtthat of being good for whatever her companions were good for and of not asking either of them to give up anyone or anything for her sake there was moreover frankly a sharpness of point in it that she enjoyed it gave an accent to the truth she wished to illustratethe truth that the surface of her recent life thicksown with the flower of earnest endeavour with every form of the unruffled and the undoubting suffered no symptom anywhere to peep out it was as if under her pressure neither party could get rid of the complicity as it might be figured of the other as if in a word she saw amerigo and charlotte committed for fear of betrayals on their own side to a kind of wan consistency on the subject of lady castledeans set and this latter group by the same stroke compelled to assist at attestations the extent and bearing of which they rather failed to grasp and which left them indeed in spite of hereditary high spirits a trifle bewildered and even a trifle scared  they made none the less at fawns for number for movement for soundthey played their parts during a crisis that must have hovered for them in the long passages of the old house after the fashion of the established ghost felt through the dark hours as a constant possibility rather than have menaced them in the form of a daylight bore one of the perceived outsiders who are liable to be met in the drawingroom or to be sat next to at dinner if the princess moreover had failed of her occult use for so much of the machinery of diversion she would still have had a sense not other than sympathetic for the advantage now extracted from it by fanny assinghams bruised philosophy this good friends relation to it was actually the revanche she sufficiently indicated of her obscured lustre at matcham where she had known her way about so much less than most of the others she knew it at fawns through the pathless wild of the right tone positively better than any one maggie could note for her and her revenge had the magnanimity of a brave pointing out of it to every one else a wonderful irresistible conscious almost compassionate patronage here was a house she triumphantly caused it to be noted in which she so bristled with values that some of them might serve by her amused willingness to share for such of the temporarily vague among her fellowguests such of the dimly disconcerted as had lost the key to their own it may have been partly through the effect of this especial strain of community with her old friend that maggie found herself one evening moved to take up again their dropped directness of reference they had remained downstairs together late the other women of the party had filed singly or in couples up the grand staircase on which from the equally grand hall these retreats and advances could always be pleasantly observed the men had apparently taken their way to the smokingroom while the princess in possession thus of a rare reach of view had lingered as if to enjoy it then she saw that mrs assingham was remaining a littleand as for the appreciation of her enjoyment upon which they stood looking at each other across the cleared prospect until the elder woman only vaguely expressive and tentative now came nearer it was like the act of asking if there were anything she could yet do and that question was answered by her immediately feeling on this closer view as she had felt when presenting herself in portland place after maggies last sharp summons their understanding was taken up by these new snatched moments where that occasion had left it  he has never told her that i know of that im at last satisfied and then as mrs assingham opened wide eyes ive been in the dark since we came down not understanding what he has been doing or intendingnot making out what can have passed between them but within a day or two ive begun to suspect and this evening for reasonsoh too many to tell youive been sure since it explains nothing has passed between themthats what has happened it explains the princess repeated with energy it explains it explains she spoke in a manner that her auditor was afterwards to describe to the colonel oddly enough as that of the quietest excitement she had turned back to the chimneyplace where in honour of a damp day and a chill night the piled logs had turned to flame and sunk to embers and the evident intensity of her vision for the fact she imparted made fanny assingham wait upon her words it explained this striking fact more indeed than her companion though conscious of fairly gaping with goodwill could swallow at once the princess however as for indulgence and confidence quickly filled up the measure he hasnt let her know that i knowand clearly doesnt mean to he has made up his mind hell say nothing about it therefore as shes quite unable to arrive at the knowledge by herself she has no idea how much im really in possession she believes said maggie and so far as her own conviction goes she knows that im not in possession of anything and that somehow for my own help seems to me immense  immense my dear mrs assingham applausively murmured though not quite even as yet seeing all the way hes keeping quiet then on purpose  on purpose maggies lighted eyes at least looked further than they had ever looked hell never tell her now  fanny wondered she cast about her most of all she admired her little friend in whom this announcement was evidently animated by an heroic lucidity she stood there in her full uniform like some small erect commander of a siege an anxious captain who has suddenly got news replete with importance for him of agitation of division within the place this importance breathed upon her comrade so youre all right  oh all rights a good deal to say but i seem at least to see as i havent before where i am with it  fanny bountifully brooded there was a point left vague and you have it from himyour husband himself has told you  told me  why what you speak of it isnt of an assurance received from him then that you do speak  at which maggie had continued to stare dear me no do you suppose ive asked him for an assurance  ah you havent her companion smiled thats what i supposed you might mean then darling what have you  asked him for ive asked him for nothing  but this in turn made fanny stare then nothing that evening of the embassy dinner passed between you  on the contrary everything passed  everything  everything i told him what i knewand i told him how i knew it  mrs assingham waited and that was all  wasnt it quite enough  oh love she bridled thats for you to have judged  then i have judged said maggiei did judge i made sure he understoodthen i let him alone  mrs assingham wondered but he didnt explain  explain thank god no maggie threw back her head as with horror at the thought then the next moment added and i didnt either  the decency of pride in it shed a cold little lightyet as from heights at the base of which her companion rather panted but if he neither denies nor confesses  he does whats a thousand times betterhe lets it alone he does maggie went on as he would do as i see now that i was sure he would he lets me alone  fanny assingham turned it over then how do you know so where as you say you are  why just by that i put him in possession of the difference the difference made about me by the fact that i hadnt been after allthough with a wonderful chance i admitted helping metoo stupid to have arrived at knowledge he had to see that im changed for himquite changed from the idea of me that he had so long been going on with it became a question then of his really taking in the changeand what i now see is that he is doing so  fanny followed as she could which he shows by letting you as you say alone  maggie looked at her a minute and by letting her  mrs assingham did what she might to embrace itchecked a little however by a thought that was the nearest approach she could have in this almost too large air to an inspiration ah but does charlotte let him  oh thats another affairwith which ive practically nothing to do i dare say however she doesnt and the princess had a more distant gaze for the image evoked by the question i dont in fact well see how she can but the point for me is that he understands  yes fanny assingham cooed understands  well what i want i want a happiness without a hole in it big enough for you to poke in your finger  a brilliant perfect surfaceto begin with at least i see  the golden bowlas it was to have been and maggie dwelt musingly on this obscured figure the bowl with all our happiness in it the bowl without the crack  for mrs assingham too the image had its force and the precious object shone before her again reconstituted plausible presentable but wasnt there still a piece missing yet if he lets you alone and you only let him  maynt our doing so you mean be noticedmaynt it give us away well we hope notwe try notwe take such care we alone know whats between uswe and you and havent you precisely been struck since youve been here maggie asked with our making so good a show  her friend hesitated to your father  but it made her hesitate too she wouldnt speak of her father directly to everyone to hernow that you understand  it held poor fanny again in wonder to charlotteyes if theres so much beneath it for you and if its all such a plan that makes it hang together it makes you hang together she fairly exhaled her admiration youre like nobody elseyoure extraordinary  maggie met it with appreciation but with a reserve no im not extraordinarybut i am for every one quiet  well thats just what is extraordinary quiet is more than i am and you leave me far behind with which again for an instant mrs assingham frankly brooded now that i understand you saybut theres one thing i dont understand and the next minute while her companion waited she had mentioned it how can charlotte after all not have pressed him not have attacked him about it how can she not have asked himasked him on his honour i meanif you know  how can she not why of course said the princess limpidly she must  well then  well then you think he must have told her why exactly what i mean said maggie is that he will have done nothing of the sort will as i say have maintained the contrary  fanny assingham weighed it under her direct appeal for the truth  under her direct appeal for the truth  her appeal to his honour  her appeal to his honour thats my point  fanny assingham braved it for the truth as from him to her  from him to any one  mrs assinghams face lighted hell simply hell insistently have lied  maggie brought it out roundly hell simply hell insistently have lied  it held again her companion who next however with a single movement throwing herself on her neck overflowed oh if you knew how you help me  maggie had liked her to understand so far as this was possible but had not been slow to see afterwards how the possibility was limited when one came to think by mysteries she was not to sound this inability in her was indeed not remarkable inasmuch as the princess herself as we have seen was only now in a position to boast of touching bottom maggie lived inwardly in a consciousness that she could but partly open even to so good a friend and her own visitation of the fuller expanse of which was for that matter still going on they had been duskier still however these recesses of her imaginationthat no doubt was what might at present be said for them she had looked into them on the eve of her leaving town almost without penetration she had made out in those hours and also of a truth during the days which immediately followed little more than the strangeness of a relation having for its chief mark whether to be prolonged or notthe absence of any intimate result of the crisis she had invited her husband to recognise they had dealt with this crisis again face to face very briefly the morning after the scene in her roombut with the odd consequence of her having appeared merely to leave it on his hands he had received it from her as he might have received a bunch of keys or a list of commissionsattentive to her instructions about them but only putting them for the time very carefully and safely into his pocket the instructions had seemed from day to day to make so little difference for his behaviourthat is for his speech or his silence to produce as yet so little of the fruit of action he had taken from her on the spot in a word before going to dress for dinner all she then had to giveafter which on the morrow he had asked her for more a good deal as if she might have renewed her supply during the night but he had had at his command for this latter purpose an air of extraordinary detachment and discretion an air amounting really to an appeal which if she could have brought herself to describe it vulgarly she would have described as cool just as he himself would have described it in any one else as cheeky a suggestion that she should trust him on the particular ground since she didnt on the general neither his speech nor his silence struck her as signifying more or less under this pressure than they had seemed to signify for weeks past yet if her sense hadnt been absolutely closed to the possibility in him of any thought of wounding her she might have taken his undisturbed manner the perfection of his appearance of having recovered himself for one of those intentions of high impertinence by the aid of which great people les grands seigneurs persons of her husbands class and type always know how to reestablish a violated order  it was her one purely good fortune that she could feel thus sure impertinenceto her at any ratewas not among the arts on which he proposed to throw himself for though he had in so almost mystifying a manner replied to nothing denied nothing explained nothing apologised for nothing he had somehow conveyed to her that this was not because of any determination to treat her case as not worth it there had been consideration on both occasions in the way he had listened to hereven though at the same time there had been extreme reserve a reserve indeed it was also to be remembered qualified by the fact that on their second and shorter interview in portland place and quite at the end of this passage she had imagined him positively proposing to her a temporary accommodation it had been but the matter of something in the depths of the eyes he finally fixed upon her and she had found in it the more she kept it before her the tacitlyoffered sketch of a working arrangement leave me my reserve dont question itits all i have just now dont you see so that if youll make me the concession of letting me alone with it for as long a time as i require i promise you something or other grown under cover of it even though i dont yet quite make out what as a return for your patience she had turned away from him with some such unspoken words as that in her ear and indeed she had to represent to herself that she had spiritually heard them had to listen to them still again to explain her particular patience in face of his particular failure he hadnt so much as pretended to meet for an instant the question raised by her of her accepted ignorance of the point in time the period before their own marriage from which his intimacy with charlotte dated as an ignorance in which he and charlotte had been personally interestedand to the pitch of consummately protecting for years each others interestas a condition so imposed upon her the fact of its having ceased might have made it on the spot the first article of his defence he had vouchsafed it however nothing better than his longest stare of postponed consideration that tribute he had coldly paid it and maggie might herself have been stupefied truly had she not had something to hold on by at her own present ability even provisional to make terms with a chapter of history into which she could but a week before not have dipped without a mortal chill at the rate at which she was living she was getting used hour by hour to these extensions of view and when she asked herself at fawns to what single observation of her own in london the prince had had an affirmation to oppose she but just failed to focus the small strained wife of the moments in question as some panting dancer of a difficult step who had capered before the footlights of an empty theatre to a spectator lounging in a box  her best comprehension of amerigos success in not committing himself was in her recall meanwhile of the inquiries he had made of her on their only return to the subject and which he had in fact explicitly provoked their return in order to make he had had it over with her again the so distinctly remarkable incident of her interview at home with the little bloomsbury shopman this anecdote for him had not altogether surprisingly required some straighter telling and the princes attitude in presence of it had represented once more his nearest approach to a crossexamination the difficulty in respect to the little man had been for the question of his motivehis motive in writing first in the spirit of retraction to a lady with whom he had made a most advantageous bargain and in then coming to see her so that his apology should be personal maggie had felt her explanation weak but there were the facts and she could give no other left alone after the transaction with the knowledge that his visitor designed the object bought of him as a birthdaygift to her fatherfor maggie confessed freely to having chattered to him almost as to a friendthe vendor of the golden bowl had acted on a scruple rare enough in vendors of any class and almost unprecedented in the thrifty children of israel he hadnt liked what he had done and what he had above all made such a good thing of having done at the thought of his purchasers good faith and charming presence opposed to that flaw in her acquestion which would make it verily as an offering to a loved parent a thing of sinister meaning and evil effect he had known conscientious he had known superstitious visitings had given way to a whim all the more remarkable to his own commercial mind no doubt from its never having troubled him in other connexions she had recognised the oddity of her adventure and left it to show for what it was she had not been unconscious on the other hand that if it hadnt touched amerigo so nearly he would have found in it matter for some amused reflection he had uttered an extraordinary sound something between a laugh and a howl on her saying as she had made a point of doing oh most certainly he told me his reason was because he liked methough she remained in doubt of whether that inarticulate comment had been provoked most by the familiarities she had offered or by those that so pictured she had had to endure that the partner of her bargain had yearned to see her again that he had plainly jumped at a pretext for it this also she had frankly expressed herself to the prince as having in no snubbing no scandalised but rather in a positively appreciative and indebted spirit not delayed to make out he had wished ever so seriously to return her a part of her money and she had wholly declined to receive it and then he had uttered his hope that she had not at all events already devoted the crystal cup to the beautiful purpose she had so kindly and so fortunately named to him it wasnt a thing for a present to a person she was fond of for she wouldnt wish to give a present that would bring ill luck that had come to himso that he couldnt rest and he should feel better now that he had told her his having led her to act in ignorance was what he should have been ashamed of and if she would pardon gracious lady as she was all the liberties he had taken she might make of the bowl any use in life but that one  it was after this that the most extraordinary incident of all of course had occurredhis pointing to the two photographs with the remark that those were persons he knew and that more wonderful still he had made acquaintance with them years before precisely over the same article the lady on that occasion had taken up the fancy of presenting it to the gentleman and the gentleman guessing and dodging ever so cleverly had declared that he wouldnt for the world receive an object under such suspicion he himself the little man had confessed wouldnt have mindedabout them but he had never forgotten either their talk or their faces the impression altogether made by them and if she really wished to know now what had perhaps most moved him it was the thought that she should ignorantly have gone in for a thing not good enough for other buyers he had been immensely struckthat was another pointwith this accident of their turning out after so long friends of hers too they had disappeared and this was the only light he had ever had upon them he had flushed up quite red with his recognition with all his responsibilityhad declared that the connexion must have had mysteriously something to do with the impulse he had obeyed and maggie had made to her husband while he again stood before her no secret of the shock for herself so suddenly and violently received she had done her best even while taking it full in the face not to give herself away but she wouldnt answerno she wouldntfor what she might in her agitation have made her informant think he might think what he wouldthere had been three or four minutes during which while she asked him question upon question she had doubtless too little cared and he had spoken for his remembrance as fully as she could have wished he had spoken oh delightedly for the terms on which his other visitors had appeared to be with each other and in fact for that conviction of the nature and degree of their intimacy under which in spite of precautions they hadnt been able to help leaving him he had observed and judged and not forgotten he had been sure they were great people but no ah no distinctly hadnt liked them as he liked the signora principessa certainlyshe had created no vagueness about thathe had been in possession of her name and address for sending her both her cup and her account but the others he had only always wondered abouthe had been sure they would never come back and as to the time of their visit he could place it positively to a dayby reason of a transaction of importance recorded in his books that had occurred but a few hours later he had left her in short definitely rejoicing that he had been able to make up to her for not having been quite square over their little business by rendering her so unexpectedly the service of this information his joy moreover wasas much as amerigo woulda matter of the personal interest with which her kindness gentleness grace her charming presence and easy humanity and familiarity had inspired him all of which while in thought maggie went over it again and again oh over any imputable rashness of her own immediate passion and pain as well as over the rest of the straight little story she had after all to tellmight very conceivably make a long sum for the prince to puzzle out  there were meanwhile after the castledeans and those invited to meet them had gone and before mrs rance and the lutches had come three or four days during which she was to learn the full extent of her need not to be penetrable and then it was indeed that she felt all the force and threw herself upon all the help of the truth she had confided several nights earlier to fanny assingham she had known it in advance had warned herself of it while the house was full charlotte had designs upon her of a nature best known to herself and was only waiting for the better opportunity of their finding themselves less companioned this consciousness had been exactly at the bottom of maggies wish to multiply their spectators there were moments for her positively moments of planned postponement of evasion scarcely less disguised than studied during which she turned over with anxiety the different waysthere being two or three possible onesin which her young stepmother might at need seek to work upon her amerigos not having told her of his passage with his wife gave for maggie altogether a new aspect to charlottes consciousness and conditionan aspect with which for apprehension for wonder and even at moments inconsequently enough for something like compassion the princess had now to reckon she asked herselffor she was capable of thatwhat he had meant by keeping the sharer of his guilt in the dark about a matter touching her otherwise so nearly what he had meant that is for this unmistakably mystified personage herself maggie could imagine what he had meant for herall sorts of thinkable things whether things of mere form or things of sincerity things of pity or things of prudence he had meant for instance in all probability primarily to conjure away any such appearance of a changed relation between the two women as his fatherinlaw might notice and follow up it would have been open to him however given the pitch of their intimacy to avert this danger by some more conceivable course with charlotte since an earnest warning in fact the full freedom of alarm that of his insisting to her on the peril of suspicion incurred and on the importance accordingly of outward peace at any price would have been the course really most conceivable instead of warning and advising he had reassured and deceived her so that our young woman who had been from far back by the habit if her nature as much on her guard against sacrificing others as if she felt the great trap of life mainly to be set for ones doing so now found herself attaching her fancy to that side of the situation of the exposed pair which involved for themselves at least the sacrifice of the least fortunate  she never at present thought of what amerigo might be intending without the reflection by the same stroke that whatever this quantity he was leaving still more to her own ingenuity he was helping her when the thing came to the test only by the polished possibly almost too polished surface his manner to his wife wore for an admiring world and that surely was entitled to scarcely more than the praise of negative diplomacy he was keeping his manner right as she had related to mrs assingham the case would have been beyond calculation truly if on top of everything he had allowed it to go wrong she had hours of exaltation indeed when the meaning of all this pressed in upon her as a tacit vow from him to abide without question by whatever she should be able to achieve or think fit to prescribe then it was that even while holding her breath for the awe of it she truly felt almost able enough for anything it was as if she had passed in a time incredibly short from being nothing for him to being all it was as if rightly noted every turn of his head every tone of his voice in these days might mean that there was but one way in which a proud man reduced to abjection could hold himself during those of maggies vigils in which that view loomed largest the image of her husband that it thus presented to her gave out a beauty for the revelation of which she struck herself as paying if anything all too little to make sure of itto make sure of the beauty shining out of the humility and of the humility lurking in all the pride of his presenceshe would have gone the length of paying more yet of paying with difficulties and anxieties compared to which those actually before her might have been as superficial as headaches or rainy days  the point at which these exaltations dropped however was the point at which it was apt to come over her that if her complications had been greater the question of paying would have been limited still less to the liabilities of her own pocket the complications were verily great enough whether for ingenuities or sublimities so long as she had to come back to it so often that charlotte all the while could only be struggling with secrets sharper than her own it was odd how that certainty again and again determined and coloured her wonderments of detail the question for instance of how amerigo in snatched opportunities of conference put the haunted creature off with false explanations met her particular challenges and evadedif that was what he did doher particular demands even the conviction that charlotte was but awaiting some chance really to test her trouble upon her lovers wife left maggies sense meanwhile open as to the sight of gilt wires and bruised wings the spacious but suspended cage the home of eternal unrest of pacings beatings shakings all so vain into which the baffled consciousness helplessly resolved itself the cage was the deluded condition and maggie as having known delusionratherunderstood the nature of cages she walked round charlottescautiously and in a very wide circle and when inevitably they had to communicate she felt herself comparatively outside on the breast of nature and saw her companions face as that of a prisoner looking through bars so it was that through bars bars richly gilt but firmly though discreetly planted charlotte finally struck her as making a grim attempt from which at first the princess drew back as instinctively as if the door of the cage had suddenly been opened from within                               xxxvi  they had been alone that eveningalone as a party of six and four of them after dinner under suggestion not to be resisted sat down to bridge in the smokingroom they had passed together to that apartment on rising from table charlotte and mrs assingham alike indulgent always to tobacco and in fact practising an emulation which as fanny said would for herself had the colonel not issued an interdict based on the fear of her stealing his cigars have stopped only at the short pipe here cards had with inevitable promptness asserted their rule the game forming itself as had often happened before of mr verver with mrs assingham for partner and of the prince with mrs verver the colonel who had then asked of maggie license to relieve his mind of a couple of letters for the earliest post out on the morrow was addressing himself to this task at the other end of the room and the princess herself had welcomed the comparatively hushed hourfor the bridgeplayers were serious and silentmuch in the mood of a tired actress who has the good fortune to be off while her mates are on almost long enough for a nap on the property sofa in the wing maggies nap had she been able to snatch forty winks would have been of the spirit rather than of the sense yet as she subsided near a lamp with the last salmoncoloured french periodical she was to fail for refreshment even of that sip of independence  there was no question for her as she found of closing her eyes and getting away they strayed back to life in the stillness over the top of her review she could lend herself to none of those refinements of the higher criticism with which its pages bristled she was there where her companions were there again and more than ever there it was as if of a sudden they had been made in their personal intensity and their rare complexity of relation freshly importunate to her it was the first evening there had been no one else mrs rance and the lutches were due the next day but meanwhile the facts of the situation were upright for her round the green cloth and the silver flambeaux the fact of her fathers wifes lover facing his mistress the fact of her father sitting all unsounded and unblinking between them the fact of charlotte keeping it up keeping up everything across the table with her husband beside her the fact of fanny assingham wonderful creature placed opposite to the three and knowing more about each probably when one came to think than either of them knew of either erect above all for her was the sharpedged fact of the relation of the whole group individually and collectively to herselfherself so speciously eliminated for the hour but presumably more present to the attention of each than the next card to be played  yes under that imputation to her sense they satthe imputation of wondering beneath and behind all their apparently straight play if she werent really watching them from her corner and consciously as might be said holding them in her hand she was asking herself at last how they could bear itfor though cards were as nought to her and she could follow no move so that she was always on such occasions out of the party they struck her as conforming alike in the matter of gravity and propriety to the stiff standard of the house her father she knew was a high adept one of the greatestshe had been ever in her stupidity his small his sole despair amerigo excelled easily as he understood and practised every art that could beguile large leisure mrs assingham and charlotte moreover were accounted as good as members of a sex incapable of the nobler consistency could be therefore evidently they were not all so up to their usual form merely passing it off whether for her or for themselves and the amount of enjoyed or at least achieved security represented by so complete a conquest of appearances was what acted on her nerves precisely with a kind of provocative force she found herself for five minutes thrilling with the idea of the prodigious effect that just as she sat there near them she had at her command with the sense that if she were but differentoh ever so differentall this high decorum would hang by a hair there reigned for her absolutely during these vertiginous moments that fascination of the monstrous that temptation of the horribly possible which we so often trace by its breaking out suddenly lest it should go further in unexplained retreats and reactions  after it had been thus vividly before her for a little that springing up under her wrong and making them all start stare and turn pale she might sound out their doom in a single sentence a sentence easy to choose among several of the luridafter she had faced that blinding light and felt it turn to blackness she rose from her place laying aside her magazine and moved slowly round the room passing near the cardplayers and pausing an instant behind the chairs in turn silent and discreet she bent a vague mild face upon them as if to signify that little as she followed their doings she wished them well and she took from each across the table in the common solemnity an upward recognition which she was to carry away with her on her moving out to the terrace a few minutes later her father and her husband mrs assingham and charlotte had done nothing but meet her eyes yet the difference in these demonstrations made each a separate passagewhich was all the more wonderful since with the secret behind every face they had alike tried to look at her through it and in denial of it  it all left her as she wandered off with the strangest of impressionsthe sense forced upon her as never yet of an appeal a positive confidence from the four pairs of eyes that was deeper than any negation and that seemed to speak on the part of each of some relation to be contrived by her a relation with herself which would spare the individual the danger the actual present strain of the relation with the others they thus tacitly put it upon her to be disposed of the whole complexity of their peril and she promptly saw why because she was there and there just as she was to lift it off them and take it to charge herself with it as the scapegoat of old of whom she had once seen a terrible picture had been charged with the sins of the people and had gone forth into the desert to sink under his burden and die that indeed wasnt their design and their interest that she should sink under hers it wouldnt be their feeling that she should do anything but live live on somehow for their benefit and even as much as possible in their company to keep proving to them that they had truly escaped and that she was still there to simplify this idea of her simplifying and of their combined struggle dim as yet but steadily growing toward the perception of her adopting it from them clung to her while she hovered on the terrace where the summer night was so soft that she scarce needed the light shawl she had picked up several of the long windows of the occupied rooms stood open to it and the light came out in vague shafts and fell upon the old smooth stones the hour was moonless and starless and the air heavy and stillwhich was why in her evening dress she need fear no chill and could get away in the outer darkness from that provocation of opportunity which had assaulted her within on her sofa as a beast might have leaped at her throat  nothing in fact was stranger than the way in which when she had remained there a little her companions watched by her through one of the windows actually struck her as almost consciously and gratefully safer they might have beenreally charming as they showed in the beautiful room and charlotte certainly as always magnificently handsome and supremely distinguishedthey might have been figures rehearsing some play of which she herself was the author they might even for the happy appearance they continued to present have been such figures as would by the strong note of character in each fill any author with the certitude of success especially of their own histrionic they might in short have represented any mystery they would the point being predominantly that the key to the mystery the key that could wind and unwind it without a snap of the spring was there in her pocketor rather no doubt clasped at this crisis in her hand and pressed as she walked back and forth to her breast she walked to the end and far out of the light she returned and saw the others still where she had left them she passed round the house and looked into the drawingroom lighted also but empty now and seeming to speak the more in its own voice of all the possibilities she controlled spacious and splendid like a stage again awaiting a drama it was a scene she might people by the press of her spring either with serenities and dignities and decencies or with terrors and shames and ruins things as ugly as those formless fragments of her golden bowl she was trying so hard to pick up  she continued to walk and continued to pause she stopped afresh for the look into the smokingroom and by this timeit was as if the recognition had of itself arrested hershe saw as in a picture with the temptation she had fled from quite extinct why it was she had been able to give herself so little from the first to the vulgar heat of her wrong she might fairly as she watched them have missed it as a lost thing have yearned for it for the straight vindictive view the rights of resentment the rages of jealousy the protests of passion as for something she had been cheated of not least a range of feelings which for many women would have meant so much but which for her husbands wife for her fathers daughter figured nothing nearer to experience than a wild eastern caravan looming into view with crude colours in the sun fierce pipes in the air high spears against the sky all a thrill a natural joy to mingle with but turning off short before it reached her and plunging into other defiles she saw at all events why horror itself had almost failed her the horror that foreshadowed in advance would by her thought have made everything that was unaccustomed in her cry out with pain the horror of finding evil seated all at its ease where she had only dreamed of good the horror of the thing hideously behind behind so much trusted so much pretended nobleness cleverness tenderness it was the first sharp falsity she had known in her life to touch at all or be touched by it had met her like some badfaced stranger surprised in one of the thickcarpeted corridors of a house of quiet on a sunday afternoon and yet yes amazingly she had been able to look at terror and disgust only to know that she must put away from her the bittersweet of their freshness the sight from the window of the group so constituted told her why told her how named to her as with hard lips named straight at her so that she must take it full in the face that other possible relation to the whole fact which alone would bear upon her irresistibly it was extraordinary they positively brought home to her that to feel about them in any of the immediate inevitable assuaging ways the ways usually open to innocence outraged and generosity betrayed would have been to give them up and that giving them up was marvellously not to be thought of she had never from the first hour of her state of acquired conviction given them up so little as now though she was no doubt as the consequence of a step taken a few minutes later to invoke the conception of doing that if might be even less she had resumed her walk stopping here and there while she rested on the cool smooth stone balustrade to draw it out in the course of which after a little she passed again the lights of the empty drawingroom and paused again for what she saw and felt there  it was not at once however that this became quite concrete that was the effect of her presently making out that charlotte was in the room launched and erect there in the middle and looking about her that she had evidently just come round to it from her cardtable by one of the passageswith the expectation to all appearance of joining her stepdaughter she had pulled up at seeing the great room emptymaggie not having passed out on leaving the group in a manner to be observed so definite a quest of her with the bridgeparty interrupted or altered for it was an impression that fairly assailed the princess and to which something of attitude and aspect of the air of arrested pursuit and purpose in charlotte together with the suggestion of her next vague movements quickly added its meaning this meaning was that she had decided that she had been infinitely conscious of maggies presence before that she knew that she would at last find her alone and that she wanted her for some reason enough to have presumably called on bob assingham for aid he had taken her chair and let her go and the arrangement was for maggie a signal proof of her earnestness of the energy in fact that though superficially commonplace in a situation in which people werent supposed to be watching each other was what affected our young woman on the spot as a breaking of bars the splendid shining supple creature was out of the cage was at large and the question now almost grotesquely rose of whether she mightnt by some art just where she was and before she could go further be hemmed in and secured it would have been for a moment in this case a matter of quickly closing the windows and giving the alarmwith poor maggies sense that though she couldnt know what she wanted of her it was enough for trepidation that at these firm hands anything should be to say nothing of the sequel of a flight taken again along the terrace even under the shame of the confessed feebleness of such evasions on the part of an outraged wife it was to this feebleness none the less that the outraged wife had presently resorted the most that could be said for her being as she felt while she finally stopped short at a distance that she could at any rate resist her abjection sufficiently not to sneak into the house by another way and safely reach her room she had literally caught herself in the act of dodging and ducking and it told her there vividly in a single word what she had all along been most afraid of  she had been afraid of the particular passage with charlotte that would determine her fathers wife to take him into her confidence as she couldnt possibly as yet have done to prepare for him a statement of her wrong to lay before him the infamy of what she was apparently suspected of this should she have made up her mind to do it would rest on a calculation the thought of which evoked strangely other possibilities and visions it would show her as sufficiently believing in her grasp of her husband to be able to assure herself that with his daughter thrown on the defensive with maggies cause and maggies word in fine against her own it wasnt maggies that would most certainly carry the day such a glimpse of her conceivable idea which would be founded on reasons all her own reasons of experience and assurance impenetrable to others but intimately familiar to herselfsuch a glimpse opened out wide as soon as it had come into view for if so much as this was still firm ground between the elder pair if the beauty of appearances had been so consistently preserved it was only the golden bowl as maggie herself knew it that had been broken the breakage stood not for any wrought discomposure among the triumphant threeit stood merely for the dire deformity of her attitude toward them she was unable at the minute of course fully to measure the difference thus involved for her and it remained inevitably an agitating image the way it might be held over her that if she didnt of her own prudence satisfy charlotte as to the reference in her mocking spirit of so much of the unuttered and unutterable of the constantly and unmistakably implied her father would be invited without further ceremony to recommend her to do so but any confidence any latent operating insolence that mrs verver should thanks to her large native resources continue to be possessed of and to hold in reserve glimmered suddenly as a possible working light and seemed to offer for meeting her a new basis and something like a new system maggie felt truly a rare contraction of the heart on making out the next instant what the new system would probably have to beand she had practically done that before perceiving that the thing she feared had already taken place charlotte extending her search appeared now to define herself vaguely in the distance of this after an instant the princess was sure though the darkness was thick for the projected clearness of the smokingroom windows had presently contributed its help her friend came slowly into that circlehaving also for herself by this time not indistinguishably discovered that maggie was on the terrace maggie from the end saw her stop before one of the windows to look at the group within and then saw her come nearer and pause again still with a considerable length of the place between them  yes charlotte had seen she was watching her from afar and had stopped now to put her further attention to the test her face was fixed on her through the night she was the creature who had escaped by force from her cage yet there was in her whole motion assuredly even as so dimly discerned a kind of portentous intelligent stillness she had escaped with an intention but with an intention the more definite that it could so accord with quiet measures the two women at all events only hovered there for these first minutes face to face over their interval and exchanging no sign the intensity of their mutual look might have pierced the night and maggie was at last to start with the scared sense of having thus yielded to doubt to dread to hesitation for a time that with no other proof needed would have completely given her away how long had she stood staring a single minute or five long enough in any case to have felt herself absolutely take from her visitor something that the latter threw upon her irresistibly by this effect of silence by this effect of waiting and watching by this effect unmistakably of timing her indecision and her fear if then scared and hanging back she had as was so evident sacrificed all past pretences it would have been with the instant knowledge of an immense advantage gained that charlotte finally saw her come on maggie came on with her heart in her hands she came on with the definite prevision throbbing like the tick of a watch of a doom impossibly sharp and hard but to which after looking at it with her eyes wide open she had none the less bowed her head by the time she was at her companions side for that matter by the time charlotte had without a motion without a word simply let her approach and stand there her head was already on the block so that the consciousness that everything had now gone blurred all perception of whether or no the axe had fallen oh the advantage it was perfectly enough in truth with mrs verver for what was maggies own sense but that of having been thrown over on her back with her neck from the first half broken and her helpless face staring up that position only could account for the positive grimace of weakness and pain produced there by charlottes dignity  ive come to join youi thought you would be here  oh yes im here maggie heard herself return a little flatly its too close indoors  verybut close even here charlotte was still and graveshe had even uttered her remark about the temperature with an expressive weight that verged upon solemnity so that maggie reduced to looking vaguely about at the sky could only feel her not fail of her purpose the airs heavy as if with thunderi think therell be a storm she made the suggestion to carry off an awkwardnesswhich was a part always of her companions gain but the awkwardness didnt diminish in the silence that followed charlotte had said nothing in reply her brow was dark as with a fixed expression and her high elegance her handsome head and long straight neck testified through the dusk to their inveterate completeness and noble erectness it was as if what she had come out to do had already begun and when as a consequence maggie had said helplessly dont you want something wont you have my shawl everything might have crumbled away in the comparative poverty of the tribute mrs ververs rejection of it had the brevity of a sign that they hadnt closed in for idle words just as her dim serious face uninterruptedly presented until they moved again might have represented the success with which she watched all her message penetrate they presently went back the way she had come but she stopped maggie again within range of the smokingroom window and made her stand where the party at cards would be before her side by side for three minutes they fixed this picture of quiet harmonies the positive charm of it and as might have been said the full significancewhich as was now brought home to maggie could be no more after all than a matter of interpretation differing always for a different interpreter as she herself had hovered in sight of it a quarterofanhour before it would have been a thing for her to show charlotteto show in righteous irony in reproach too stern for anything but silence but now it was she who was being shown it and shown it by charlotte and she saw quickly enough that as charlotte showed it so she must at present submissively seem to take it  the others were absorbed and unconscious either silent over their game or dropping remarks unheard on the terrace and it was to her fathers quiet face discernibly expressive of nothing that was in his daughters mind that our young womans attention was most directly given his wife and his daughter were both closely watching him and to which of them could he have been notified of this would his raised eyes first all impulsively have responded in which of them would he have felt it most important to destroyfor his clutch at the equilibriumany germ of uneasiness not yet since his marriage had maggie so sharply and so formidably known her old possession of him as a thing divided and contested she was looking at him by charlottes leave and under charlottes direction quite in fact as if the particular way she should look at him were prescribed to her quite even as if she had been defied to look at him in any other it came home to her too that the challenge wasnt as might be said in his interest and for his protection but pressingly insistently in charlottes for that of her security at any price she might verily by this dumb demonstration have been naming to maggie the price naming it as a question for maggie herself a sum of money that she properly was to find she must remain safe and maggie must paywhat she was to pay with being her own affair  straighter than ever thus the princess again felt it all put upon her and there was a minute just a supreme instant during which there burned in her a wild wish that her father would only look up it throbbed for these seconds as a yearning appeal to himshe would chance it that is if he would but just raise his eyes and catch them across the larger space standing in the outer dark together then he might be affected by the sight taking them as they were he might make some signshe scarce knew whatthat would save her save her from being the one this way to pay all he might somehow show a preference distinguishing between them might out of pity for her signal to her that this extremity of her effort for him was more than he asked that represented maggies one little lapse from consistencythe sole small deflection in the whole course of her scheme it had come to nothing the next minute for the dear mans eyes had never moved and charlottes hand promptly passed into her arm had already had very firmly drawn her onquite for that matter as from some sudden some equal perception on her part too of the more ways than one in which their impression could appeal they retraced their steps along the rest of the terrace turning the corner of the house and presently came abreast of the other windows those of the pompous drawingroom still lighted and still empty here charlotte again paused and it was again as if she were pointing out what maggie had observed for herself the very look the place had of being vivid in its stillness of having with all its great objects as ordered and balanced as for a formal reception been appointed for some high transaction some real affair of state in presence of this opportunity she faced her companion once more she traced in her the effect of everything she had already communicated she signified with the same success that the terrace and the sullen night would bear too meagre witness to the completion of her idea soon enough then within the room under the old lustres of venice and the eyes of the several great portraits more or less contemporary with these that awaited on the walls of fawns their final far migrationsoon enough maggie found herself staring and at first all too gaspingly at the grand total to which each separate demand mrs verver had hitherto made upon her however she had made it now amounted  ive been wantingand longer than youd perhaps believeto put a question to you for which no opportunity has seemed to me yet quite so good as this it would have been easier perhaps if you had struck me as in the least disposed ever to give me one i have to take it now you see as i find it they stood in the centre of the immense room and maggie could feel that the scene of life her imagination had made of it twenty minutes before was by this time sufficiently peopled these few straight words filled it to its uttermost reaches and nothing was now absent from her consciousness either of the part she was called upon to play in it charlotte had marched straight in dragging her rich train she rose there beautiful and free with her whole aspect and action attuned to the firmness of her speech maggie had kept the shawl she had taken out with her and clutching it tight in her nervousness drew it round her as if huddling in it for shelter covering herself with it for humility she looked out as from under an improvised hoodthe sole headgear of some poor woman at somebodys proud door she waited even like the poor woman she met her friends eyes with recognitions she couldnt suppress she might sound it as she couldwhat question theneverything in her from head to foot crowded it upon charlotte that she knew she knew too wellthat she was showing so that successful vagueness to save some scrap of her dignity from the imminence of her defeat was already a lost cause and the one thing left was if possible at any cost even that of stupid inconsequence to try to look as if she werent afraid if she could but appear at all not afraid she might appear a little not ashamedthat is not ashamed to be afraid which was the kind of shame that could be fastened on her it being fear all the while that moved her her challenge at any rate her wonder her terrorthe blank blurred surface whatever it was that she presented became a mixture that ceased to signify for to the accumulated advantage by which charlotte was at present sustained her next words themselves had little to add  have you any ground of complaint of me is there any wrong you consider ive done you i feel at last that ive a right to ask you  their eyes had to meet on it and to meet long maggies avoided at least the disgrace of looking away what makes you want to ask it  my natural desire to know youve done that for so long little justice  maggie waited a moment for so long you mean youve thought  i mean my dear that ive seen ive seen week after week that you seemed to be thinkingof something that perplexed or worried you is it anything for which im in any degree responsible  maggie summoned all her powers what in the world should it be  ah thats not for me to imagine and i should be very sorry to have to try to say im aware of no point whatever at which i may have failed you said charlotte nor of any at which i may have failed any one in whom i can suppose you sufficiently interested to care if ive been guilty of some fault ive committed it all unconsciously and am only anxious to hear from you honestly about it but if ive been mistaken as to what i speak ofthe difference more and more marked as ive thought in all your manner to mewhy obviously so much the better no form of correction received from you could give me greater satisfaction  she spoke it struck her companion with rising with extraordinary ease as if hearing herself say it all besides seeing the way it was listened to helped her from point to point she saw she was rightthat this was the tone for her to take and the thing for her to do the thing as to which she was probably feeling that she had in advance in her delays and uncertainties much exaggerated the difficulty the difficulty was small and it grew smaller as her adversary continued to shrink she was not only doing as she wanted but had by this time effectively done it and hung it up all of which but deepened maggies sense of the sharp and simple need now of seeing her through to the end if youve been mistaken you sayand the princess but barely faltered you have been mistaken  charlotte looked at her splendidly hard youre perfectly sure its all my mistake  all i can say is that youve received a false impression  ah thenso much the better from the moment i had received it i knew i must sooner or later speak of itfor that you see is systematically my way and now charlotte added you make me glad ive spoken i thank you very much  it was strange how for maggie too with this the difficulty seemed to sink her companions acceptance of her denial was like a general pledge not to keep things any worse for her than they essentially had to be it positively helped her to build up her falsehoodto which accordingly she contributed another block ive affected you evidentlyquite accidentallyin some way of which ive been all unaware ive not felt at any time that youve wronged me  how could i come within a mile charlotte inquired of such a possibility  maggie with her eyes on her more easily now made no attempt to say she said after a little something more to the present point i accuse youi accuse you of nothing  ah thats lucky  charlotte had brought this out with the richness almost of gaiety  and maggie to go on had to think with her own intensity of amerigoto think how he on his side had had to go through with his lie to her how it was for his wife he had done so and how his doing so had given her the clue and set her the example he must have had his own difficulty about it and she was not after all falling below him it was in fact as if thanks to her hovering image of him confronted with this admirable creature even as she was confronted there glowed upon her from afar yet straight and strong a deep explanatory light which covered the last inch of the ground he had given her something to conform to and she hadnt unintelligently turned on him gone back on him as he would have said by not conforming they were together thus he and she close close togetherwhereas charlotte though rising there radiantly before her was really off in some darkness of space that would steep her in solitude and harass her with care the heart of the princess swelled accordingly even in her abasement she had kept in tune with the right and something certainly something that might be like a rare flower snatched from an impossible ledge would and possibly soon come of it for her the right the rightyes it took this extraordinary form of her humbugging as she had called it to the end it was only a question of not by a hairs breadth deflecting into the truth so supremely was she braced you must take it from me that your anxiety rests quite on a misconception you must take it from me that ive never at any moment fancied i could suffer by you and marvellously she kept it upnot only kept it up but improved on it you must take it from me that ive never thought of you but as beautiful wonderful and good which is all i think that you can possibly ask  charlotte held her a moment longer she needednot then to have appeared only tactlessthe last word its much more my dear than i dreamed of asking i only wanted your denial  well then you have it  upon your honour  upon my honour  and she made a point even our young woman of not turning away her grip of her shawl had loosenedshe had let it fall behind her but she stood there for anything more and till the weight should be lifted with which she saw soon enough what more was to come she saw it in charlottes face and felt it make between them in the air a chill that completed the coldness of their conscious perjury will you kiss me on it then  she couldnt say yes but she didnt say no what availed her still however was to measure in her passivity how much too far charlotte had come to retreat but there was something different also something for which while her cheek received the prodigious kiss she had her opportunitythe sight of the others who having risen from their cards to join the absent members of their party had reached the open door at the end of the room and stopped short evidently in presence of the demonstration that awaited them her husband and her father were in front and charlottes embrace of herwhich wasnt to be distinguished for them either she felt from her embrace of charlottetook on with their arrival a high publicity                               xxxvii  her father had asked her three days later in an interval of calm how she was affected in the light of their reappearance and of their now perhaps richer fruition by dotty and kitty and by the once formidable mrs rance and the consequence of this inquiry had been for the pair just such another stroll together away from the rest of the party and off into the park as had asserted its need to them on the occasion of the previous visit of these anciently more agitating friendsthat of their long talk on a sequestered bench beneath one of the great trees when the particular question had come up for them the then purblind discussion of which at their enjoyed leisure maggie had formed the habit of regarding as the first beginning of their present situation the whirligig of time had thus brought round for them again on their finding themselves face to face while the others were gathering for tea on the terrace the same odd impulse quietly to slopeso adam verver himself as they went familiarly expressed itthat had acted in its way of old acted for the distant autumn afternoon and for the sharpness of their since so outlived crisis it might have been funny to them now that the presence of mrs rance and the lutchesand with symptoms too at that time less developedhad once for their anxiety and their prudence constituted a crisis it might have been funny that these ladies could ever have figured to their imagination as a symbol of dangers vivid enough to precipitate the need of a remedy this amount of entertainment and assistance they were indeed disposed to extract from their actual impressions they had been finding it for months past by maggies view a resource and a relief to talk with an approach to intensity when they met of all the people they werent really thinking of and didnt really care about the people with whom their existence had begun almost to swarm and they closed in at present round the spectres of their past as they permitted themselves to describe the three ladies with a better imitation of enjoying their theme than they had been able to achieve certainly during the stay for instance of the castledeans the castledeans were a new joke comparatively and they had had always to maggies viewto teach themselves the way of it whereas the detroit the providence party rebounding so from providence from detroit was an old and ample one of which the most could be made and as to which a humorous insistence could be guarded  sharp and sudden moreover this afternoon had been their wellnigh confessed desire just to rest together a little as from some strain long felt but never named to rest as who should say shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand each pair of eyes so yearninglyand indeed what could it be but so wearily closed as to render the collapse safe from detection by the other pair it was positively as if in short the inward felicity of their being once more perhaps only for halfanhour simply daughter and father had glimmered out for them and they had picked up the pretext that would make it easiest they were husband and wifeoh so immenselyas regards other persons but after they had dropped again on their old bench conscious that the party on the terrace augmented as in the past by neighbours would do beautifully without them it was wonderfully like their having got together into some boat and paddled off from the shore where husbands and wives luxuriant complications made the air too tropical in the boat they were father and daughter and poor dotty and kitty supplied abundantly for their situation the oars or the sail why into the bargain for that matterthis came to maggiecouldnt they always live so far as they lived together in a boat she felt in her face with the question the breath of a possibility that soothed her they needed only know each other henceforth in the unmarried relation that other sweet evening in the same place he had been as unmarried as possiblewhich had kept down so to speak the quantity of change in their state well then that other sweet evening was what the present sweet evening would resemble with the quite calculable effect of an exquisite inward refreshment they had after all whatever happened always and ever each other each otherthat was the hidden treasure and the saving truthto do exactly what they would with a provision full of possibilities who could tell as yet what thanks to it they wouldnt have done before the end  they had meanwhile been tracing together in the golden air that toward six oclock of a july afternoon hung about the massed kentish woods several features of the social evolution of her old playmates still beckoned on it would seem by unattainable ideals still falling back beyond the sea to their native seats for renewals of the moral financial conversationalone scarce knew what to call itoutfit and again and for ever reappearing like a tribe of wandering jewesses our couple had finally exhausted however the study of these annals and maggie was to take up after a drop a different matter or one at least with which the immediate connection was not at first apparent were you amused at me just nowwhen i wondered what other people could wish to struggle for did you think me she asked with some earnestnesswell fatuous  fatuoushe seemed at a loss  i mean sublime in our happinessas if looking down from a height or rather sublime in our general positionthats what i mean she spoke as from the habit of her anxious conscience something that disposed her frequently to assure herself for her human commerce of the state of the books of the spirit because i dont at all want she explained to be blinded or made sniffy by any sense of a social situation her father listened to this declaration as if the precautions of her general mercy could still as they betrayed themselves have surprises for himto say nothing of a charm of delicacy and beauty he might have been wishing to see how far she could go and where she would all touchingly to him arrive but she waited a littleas if made nervous precisely by feeling him depend too much on what she said they were avoiding the serious standing off anxiously from the real and they fell again and again as if to disguise their precaution itself into the tone of the time that came back to them from their other talk when they had shared together this same refuge dont you remember she went on how when they were here before i broke it to you that i wasnt so very sure we ourselves had the thing itself  he did his best to do so had you mean a social situation  yesafter fanny assingham had first broken it to me that at the rate we were going we should never have one  which was what put us on charlotte oh yes they had had it over quite often enough for him easily to remember  maggie had another pausetaking it from him that he now could both affirm and admit without wincing that they had been at their critical moment put on charlotte it was as if this recognition had been threshed out between them as fundamental to the honest view of their success well she continued i recall how i felt about kitty and dotty that even if we had already then been more placed or whatever you may call what we are now it still wouldnt have been an excuse for wondering why others couldnt obligingly leave me more exalted by having themselves smaller ideas for those she said were the feelings we used to have  oh yes he responded philosophicallyi remember the feelings we used to have  maggie appeared to wish to plead for them a little in tender retrospectas if they had been also respectable it was bad enough i thought to have no sympathy in your heart when you had a position but it was worse to be sublime about itas i was so afraid as im in fact still afraid of beingwhen it wasnt even there to support one and she put forth again the earnestness she might have been taking herself as having outlived became for itwhich was doubtless too often even now her dangeralmost sententious one must always whether or no have some imagination of the states of othersof what they may feel deprived of however she added kitty and dotty couldnt imagine we were deprived of anything and now and now but she stopped as for indulgence to their wonder and envy  and now they see still more that we can have got everything and kept everything and yet not be proud  no were not proud she answered after a moment im not sure that were quite proud enough yet she changed the next instant that subject too she could only do so however by harking backas if it had been a fascination she might have been wishing under this renewed this still more suggestive visitation to keep him with her for remounting the stream of time and dipping again for the softness of the water into the contracted basin of the past we talked about itwe talked about it you dont remember so well as i you too didnt know and it was beautiful of you like kitty and dotty you too thought we had a position and were surprised when i thought we ought to have told them we werent doing for them what they supposed in fact maggie pursued were not doing it now were not you see really introducing them i mean not to the people they want  then what do you call the people with whom theyre now having tea  it made her quite spring round thats just what you asked me the other timeone of the days there was somebody and i told you i didnt call anybody anything  i rememberthat such people the people we made so welcome didnt count that fanny assingham knew they didnt she had awakened his daughter the echo and on the bench there as before he nodded his head amusedly he kept nervously shaking his foot yes they were only good enoughthe people who came for us i remember he said again that was the way it all happened  that was the waythat was the way and you asked me maggie added if i didnt think we ought to tell them tell mrs rance in particular i mean that we had been entertaining her up to then under false pretences  preciselybut you said she wouldnt have understood  to which you replied that in that case you were like her you didnt understand  no nobut i remember how about our having in our benighted innocence no position you quite crushed me with your explanation  well then said maggie with every appearance of delight ill crush you again i told you that you by yourself had onethere was no doubt of that you were different from meyou had the same one you always had  and then i asked you her father concurred why in that case you hadnt the same  then indeed you did he had brought her face round to him before and this held it covering him with its kindled brightness the result of the attested truth of their being able thus in talk to live again together what i replied was that i had lost my position by my marriage that onei know how i saw itwould never come back i had done something to iti didnt quite know what given it away somehow and yet not as then appeared really got my return i had been assuredalways by dear fannythat i could get it only i must wake up so i was trying you see to wake uptrying very hard  yesand to a certain extent you succeeded as also in waking me but you made much he said of your difficulty to which he added its the only case i remember mag of you ever making anything of a difficulty  she kept her eyes on him a moment that i was so happy as i was  that you were so happy as you were  well you admittedmaggie kept it upthat that was a good difficulty you confessed that our life did seem to be beautiful  he thought a moment yesi may very well have confessed it for so it did seem to me but he guarded himself with his dim his easier smile what do you want to put on me now  only that we used to wonderthat we were wondering thenif our life wasnt perhaps a little selfish this also for a time much at his leisure adam verver retrospectively fixed because fanny assingham thought so  oh no she never thought she couldnt think if she would anything of that sort she only thinks people are sometimes fools maggie developed she doesnt seem to think so much about their being wrongwrong that is in the sense of being wicked she doesnt the princess further adventured quite so much mind their being wicked  i seei see and yet it might have been for his daughter that he didnt so very vividly see then she only thought us fools  oh noi dont say that im speaking of our being selfish  and that comes under the head of the wickedness fanny condones  oh i dont say she condones a scruple in maggie raised its crest besides im speaking of what was  her father showed however after a little that he had not been reached by this discrimination his thoughts were resting for the moment where they had settled look here mag he said reflectivelyi aint selfish ill be blowed if im selfish  well maggie if he would talk of that could also pronounce then father i am  oh shucks said adam verver to whom the vernacular in moments of deepest sincerity could thus come back ill believe it he presently added when amerigo complains of you  ah its just he whos my selfishness im selfish so to speak for him i mean she continued that hes my motivein everything  well her father could from experience fancy what she meant but hasnt a girl a right to be selfish about her husband  what i dont mean she observed without answering is that im jealous of him but thats his meritits not mine  her father again seemed amused at her you could beotherwise  oh how can i talk she asked of otherwise it isnt luckily for me otherwise if everything were differentshe further presented her thoughtof course everything would be and then again as if that were but half my idea is this that when you only love a little youre naturally not jealousor are only jealous also a little so that it doesnt matter but when you love in a deeper and intenser way then you are in the same proportion jealous your jealousy has intensity and no doubt ferocity when however you love in the most abysmal and unutterable way of allwhy then youre beyond everything and nothing can pull you down  mr verver listened as if he had nothing on these high lines to oppose and thats the way you love  for a minute she failed to speak but at last she answered it wasnt to talk about that i do feel however beyond everything and as a consequence of that i dare say she added with a turn to gaiety seem often not to know quite where i am  the mere fine pulse of passion in it the suggestion as of a creature consciously floating and shining in a warm summer sea some element of dazzling sapphire and silver a creature cradled upon depths buoyant among dangers in which fear or folly or sinking otherwise than in play was impossiblesomething of all this might have been making once more present to him with his discreet his half shy assent to it her probable enjoyment of a rapture that he in his day had presumably convinced no great number of persons either of his giving or of his receiving he sat awhile as if he knew himself hushed almost admonished and not for the first time yet it was an effect that might have brought before him rather what she had gained than what he had missed  besides who but himself really knew what he after all hadnt or even had gained the beauty of her condition was keeping him at any rate as he might feel in sight of the sea where though his personal dips were over the whole thing could shine at him and the air and the plash and the play become for him too a sensation that couldnt be fixed upon him as missing since if it wasnt personally floating if it wasnt even sitting in the sand it could yet pass very well for breathing the bliss in a communicated irresistible wayfor tasting the balm it could pass further for knowingfor knowing that without him nothing might have been which would have been missing least of all  i guess ive never been jealous he finally remarked and it said more to her he had occasion next to perceive than he was intending for it made her as by the pressure of a spring give him a look that seemed to tell of things she couldnt speak  but she at last tried for one of them oh its you father who are what i call beyond everything nothing can pull you down  he returned the look as with the sociability of their easy communion though inevitably throwing in this time a shade of solemnity he might have been seeing things to say and others whether of a type presumptuous or not doubtless better kept back so he settled on the merely obvious well then we make a pair were all right  oh were all right a declaration launched not only with all her discriminating emphasis but confirmed by her rising with decision and standing there as if the object of their small excursion required accordingly no further pursuit at this juncture howeverwith the act of their crossing the bar to get as might be into portthere occurred the only approach to a betrayal of their having had to beat against the wind her father kept his place and it was as if she had got over first and were pausing for her consort to follow if they were all right they were all right yet he seemed to hesitate and wait for some word beyond his eyes met her own suggestively and it was only after she had contented herself with simply smiling at him smiling ever so fixedly that he spoke for the remaining importance of it from the bench where he leaned back raising his face to her his legs thrust out a trifle wearily and his hands grasping either side of the seat they had beaten against the wind and she was still fresh they had beaten against the wind and he as at the best the more battered vessel perhaps just vaguely drooped but the effect of their silence was that she appeared to beckon him on and he might have been fairly alongside of her when at the end of another minute he found their word the only thing is that as for ever putting up again with your pretending that youre selfish  at this she helped him out with it you wont take it from me  i wont take it from you  well of course you wont for thats your way it doesnt matter and it only proves but it doesnt matter either what it proves im at this very moment she declared frozen stiff with selfishness  he faced her awhile longer in the same way it was strangely as if by this sudden arrest by their having in their acceptance of the unsaid or at least their reference to it practically given up pretendingit was as if they were in for it for something they had been ineffably avoiding but the dread of which was itself in a manner a seduction just as any confession of the dread was by so much an allusion then she seemed to see him let himself go when a persons of the nature you speak of there are always other persons to suffer but youve just been describing to me what youd take if you had once a good chance from your husband  oh im not talking about my husband  then whom are you talking about  both the retort and the rejoinder had come quicker than anything previously exchanged and they were followed on maggies part by a momentary drop but she was not to fall away and while her companion kept his eyes on her while she wondered if he werent expecting her to name his wife then with high hypocrisy as paying for his daughters bliss she produced something that she felt to be much better im talking about you  do you mean ive been your victim  of course youve been my victim what have you done ever done that hasnt been for me  many things more than i can tell youthings youve only to think of for yourself what do you make of all that ive done for myself  yourself she brightened out with derision  what do you make of what ive done for american city  it took her but a moment to say im not talking of you as a public characterim talking of you on your personal side  well american cityif personalities can do ithas given me a pretty personal side what do you make he went on of what ive done for my reputation  your reputation there youve given it up to them the awful people for less than nothing youve given it up to them to tear to pieces to make their horrible vulgar jokes against you with  ah my dear i dont care for their horrible vulgar jokes adam verver almost artlessly urged  then there exactly you are she triumphed everything that touches you everything that surrounds you goes onby your splendid indifference and your incredible permissionat your expense  just as he had been sitting he looked at her an instant longer then he slowly rose while his hands stole into his pockets and stood there before her of course my dear you go on at my expense it has never been my idea he smiled that you should work for your living i wouldnt have liked to see it with which for a little again they remained face to face say therefore i have had the feelings of a father how have they made me a victim  because i sacrifice you  but to what in the world  at this it hung before her that she should have had as never yet her opportunity to say and it held her for a minute as in a vise her impression of his now with his strained smile which touched her to deepest depths sounding her in his secret unrest this was the moment in the whole process of their mutual vigilance in which it decidedly most hung by a hair that their thin wall might be pierced by the lightest wrong touch it shook between them this transparency with their very breath it was an exquisite tissue but stretched on a frame and would give way the next instant if either so much as breathed too hard she held her breath for she knew by his eyes the light at the heart of which he couldnt blind that he was by his intention making suresure whether or no her certainty was like his the intensity of his dependence on it at that momentthis itself was what absolutely convinced her so that as if perched up before him on her vertiginous point and in the very glare of his observation she balanced for thirty seconds she almost rocked she might have been for the time in all her conscious person the very form of the equilibrium they were in their different ways equally trying to save and they were saving ityes they were or at least she was that was still the workable issue she could say as she felt her dizziness drop she held herself hard the thing was to be done once for all by her acting now where she stood so much was crowded into so short a space that she knew already she was keeping her head she had kept it by the warning of his eyes she shouldnt lose it again she knew how and why and if she had turned cold this was precisely what helped her he had said to himself shell break down and name amerigo shell say its to him shes sacrificing me and its by what that will give mewith so many other things toothat my suspicion will be clinched he was watching her lips spying for the symptoms of the sound whereby these symptoms had only to fail and he would have got nothing that she didnt measure out to him as she gave it she had presently in fact so recovered herself that she seemed to know she could more easily have made him name his wife than he have made her name her husband it was there before her that if she should so much as force him just not consciously to avoid saying charlotte charlotte he would have given himself away but to be sure of this was enough for her and she saw more clearly with each lapsing instant what they were both doing he was doing what he had steadily been coming to he was practically offering himself pressing himself upon her as a sacrificehe had read his way so into her best possibility and where had she already for weeks and days past planted her feet if not on her acceptance of the offer cold indeed colder and colder she turned as she felt herself suffer this close personal vision of his attitude still not to make her weaken that was her very certitude the intensity of his pressure for if something dreadful hadnt happened there wouldnt for either of them be these dreadful things to do she had meanwhile as well the immense advantage that she could have named charlotte without exposing herselfas for that matter she was the next minute showing him  why i sacrifice you simply to everything and to every one i take the consequences of your marriage as perfectly natural  he threw back his head a little settling with one hand his eyeglass what do you call my dear the consequences  your life as your marriage has made it  well hasnt it made it exactly what we wanted she just hesitated then felt herself steadyoh beyond what she had dreamed exactly what i wantedyes  his eyes through his straightened glasses were still on hers and he might with his intenser fixed smile have been knowing she was for herself rightly inspired what do you make then of what i wanted  i dont make anything any more than of what youve got thats exactly the point i dont put myself out to do soi never have i take from you all i can get all youve provided for me and i leave you to make of your own side of the matter what you can there you arethe rest is your own affair i dont even pretend to concern myself  to concern yourself he watched her as she faintly faltered looking about her now so as not to keep always meeting his face  with what may have really become of you its as if we had agreed from the first not to go into thatsuch an arrangement being of course charming for me you cant say you know that i havent stuck to it  he didnt say so theneven with the opportunity given him of her stopping once more to catch her breath he said instead oh my dearoh oh  but it made no difference know as she might what a paststill so recent and yet so distantit alluded to she repeated her denial warning him off on her side from spoiling the truth of her contention i never went into anything and you see i dont ive continued to adore youbut whats that from a decent daughter to such a father what but a question of convenient arrangement our having two houses three houses instead of one you would have arranged for fifty if i had wished and my making it easy for you to see the child you dont claim i suppose that my natural course once you had set up for yourself would have been to ship you back to american city  these were direct inquiries they quite rang out in the soft wooded air so that adam verver for a minute appeared to meet them with reflection she saw reflection however quickly enough show him what to do with them do you know mag what you make me wish when you talk that way and he waited again while she further got from him the sense of something that had been behind deeply in the shade coming cautiously to the front and just feeling its way before presenting itself you regularly make me wish that i had shipped back to american city when you go on as you do but he really had to hold himself to say it  well when i go on  why you make me quite want to ship back myself you make me quite feel as if american city would be the best place for us  it made her all too finely vibrate for us  for me and charlotte do you know that if we should ship it would serve you quite right with which he smiledoh he smiled and if you say much more we will ship  ah then it was that the cup of her conviction full to the brim overflowed at a touch there was his idea the clearness of which for an instant almost dazzled her it was a blur of light in the midst of which she saw charlotte like some object marked by contrast in blackness saw her waver in the field of vision saw her removed transported doomed and he had named charlotte named her again and she had made himwhich was all she had needed more it was as if she had held a blank letter to the fire and the writing had come out still larger than she hoped the recognition of it took her some seconds but she might when she spoke have been folding up these precious lines and restoring them to her pocket well i shall be as much as ever then the cause of what you do i havent the least doubt of your being up to that if you should think i might get anything out of it even the little pleasure she laughed of having said as you call it more let my enjoyment of this therefore at any price continue to represent for you what i call sacrificing you  she had drawn a long breath she had made him do it all for her and had lighted the way to it without his naming her husband that silence had been as distinct as the sharp the inevitable sound and something now in him followed it up a sudden air as of confessing at last fully to where she was and of begging the particular question dont you think then i can take care of myself  ah its exactly what ive gone upon if it wasnt for that  but she broke off and they remained only another moment face to face ill let you know my dear the day i feel youve begun to sacrifice me  begun she extravagantly echoed  well it will be for me the day youve ceased to believe in me  with which his glasses still fixed on her his hands in his pockets his hat pushed back his legs a little apart he seemed to plant or to square himself for a kind of assurance it had occurred to him he might as well treat her to in default of other things before they changed their subject it had the effect for her of a remindera reminder of all he was of all he had done of all above and beyond his being her perfect little father she might take him as representing take him as having quite eminently in the eyes of two hemispheres been capable of and as therefore wishing notwas it illegitimately to call her attention to the successful beneficent person the beautiful bountiful original dauntlessly wilful great citizen the consummate collector and infallible high authority he had been and still wasthese things struck her on the spot as making up for him in a wonderful way a character she must take into account in dealing with him either for pity or for envy he positively under the impression seemed to loom larger than life for her so that she saw him during these moments in a light of recognition which had had its brightness for her at many an hour of the past but which had never been so intense and so almost admonitory his very quietness was part of it now as always part of everything of his success his originality his modesty his exquisite public perversity his inscrutable incalculable energy and this quality perhaps it might beall the more too as the result for the present occasion of an admirable traceable effortthat placed him in her eyes as no precious a work of art probably had ever been placed in his own there was a long moment absolutely during which her impression rose and rose even as that of the typical charmed gazer in the still museum before the named and dated object the pride of the catalogue that time has polished and consecrated extraordinary in particular was the number of the different ways in which he thus affected her as showing he was strongthat was the great thing he was suresure for himself always whatever his idea the expression of that in him had somehow never appeared more identical with his proved taste for the rare and the true but what stood out beyond everything was that he was always marvellously youngwhich couldnt but crown at this juncture his whole appeal to her imagination before she knew it she was lifted aloft by the consciousness that he was simply a great and deep and high little man and that to love him with tenderness was not to be distinguished a whit from loving him with pride it came to her all strangely as a sudden an immense relief the sense that he wasnt a failure and could never be purged their predicament of every meanness made it as if they had really emerged in their transmuted union to smile almost without pain it was like a new confidence and after another instant she knew even still better why wasnt it because now also on his side he was thinking of her as his daughter was trying her during these mute seconds as the child of his blood oh then if she wasnt with her little conscious passion the child of any weakness what was she but strong enough too it swelled in her fairly it raised her higher higher she wasnt in that case a failure eitherhadnt been but the contrary his strength was her strength her pride was his and they were decent and competent together this was all in the answer she finally made him  i believe in you more than any one  than any one at all  she hesitated for all it might mean but there wasoh a thousand timesno doubt of it than any one at all she kept nothing of it back now met his eyes over it let him have the whole of it after which she went on and thats the way i think you believe in me  he looked at her a minute longer but his tone at last was right about the wayyes  well then she spoke as for the end and for other matters for anything everything else there might be they would never return to it  well then his hands came out and while her own took them he drew her to his breast and held her he held her hard and kept her long and she let herself go but it was an embrace that august and almost stern produced for all its intimacy no revulsion and broke into no inconsequence of tears                               xxxviii  maggie was to feel after this passage how they had both been helped through it by the influence of that accident of her having been caught a few nights before in the familiar embrace of her fathers wife his return to the saloon had chanced to coincide exactly with this demonstration missed moreover neither by her husband nor by the assinghams who their cardparty suspended had quitted the billiardroom with him she had been conscious enough at the time of what such an impression received by the others might in that extended state do for her case and none the less that as no one had appeared to wish to be the first to make a remark about it it had taken on perceptibly the special shade of consecration conferred by unanimities of silence the effect she might have considered had been almost awkwardthe promptitude of her separation from charlotte as if they had been discovered in some absurdity on her becoming aware of spectators the spectators on the other handthat was the appearancemightnt have supposed them in the existing relation addicted to mutual endearments and yet hesitating with a fine scruple between sympathy and hilarity must have felt that almost any spoken or laughed comment could be kept from sounding vulgar only by sounding beyond any permitted measure intelligent they had evidently looked the two young wives like a pair of women making up effusively as women were supposed to do especially when approved fools after a broil but taking note of the reconciliation would imply on her fathers part on amerigos and on fanny assinghams some proportionate vision of the grounds of their difference there had been something there had been but too much in the incident for each observer yet there was nothing any one could have said without seeming essentially to say see see the dear thingstheir quarrels blissfully over our quarrel what quarrel the dear things themselves would necessarily in that case have demanded and the wits of the others would thus have been called upon for some agility of exercise no one had been equal to the flight of producing offhand a fictive reason for any estrangementto take that is the place of the true which had so long for the finer sensibility pervaded the air and every one accordingly not to be inconveniently challenged was pretending immediately after to have remarked nothing that any one else hadnt  maggies own measure had remained all the same full of the reflection caught from the total inference which had acted virtually by enabling every one presentand oh charlotte not leastto draw a long breath the message of the little scene had been different for each but it had been this markedly all round that it reinforcedreinforced even immenselythe general effort carried on from week to week and of late distinctly more successful to look and talk and move as if nothing in life were the matter supremely however while this glass was held up to her had maggies sense turned to the quality of the success constituted on the spot for charlotte most of all if she was guessing how her father must have secretly started how her husband must have secretly wondered how fanny assingham must have secretly in a flash seen daylight for herselfmost of all had she tasted by communication of the high profit involved for her companion she felt in all her pulses charlotte feel it and how publicity had been required absolutely to crown her own abasement it was the added touch and now nothing was wanting which to do her stepmother justice mrs verver had appeared but to desire from that evening to show with the last vividness that she recognised maggie lived over again the minutes in questionhad found herself repeatedly doing so to the degree that the whole evening hung together to her aftersense as a thing appointed by some occult power that had dealt with her that had for instanceanimated the four with just the right restlessness too had decreed and directed and exactly timed it in them making their game of bridgehowever abysmal a face it had worn for hergive way precisely to their common unavowed impulse to find out to emulate charlottes impatience a preoccupation this latter attached detectedly to the member of the party who was roaming in her queerness and was for all their simulated blindness not roaming unnoted  if mrs verver meanwhile then had struck her as determined in a certain direction by the last felicity into which that night had flowered our young woman was yet not to fail of appreciating the truth that she had not been put at ease after all with absolute permanence maggie had seen her unmistakably desire to rise to the occasion and be magnificentseen her decide that the right way for this would be to prove that the reassurance she had extorted there under the high cool lustre of the saloon a twinkle of crystal and silver had not only poured oil upon the troubled waters of their question but had fairly drenched their whole intercourse with that lubricant she had exceeded the limit of discretion in this insistence on her capacity to repay in proportion a service she acknowledged as handsome why handsome maggie would have been free to ask since if she had been veracious the service assuredly would not have been huge it would in that case have come up vividly and for each of them alike that the truth on the princesss lips presented no difficulty if the latters mood in fact could have turned itself at all to private gaiety it might have failed to resist the diversion of seeing so clever a creature so beguiled charlottes theory of a generous manner was manifestly to express that her stepdaughters word wiping out as she might have said everything had restored them to the serenity of a relation without a cloud it had been in short in this light ideally conclusive so that no ghost of anything it referred to could ever walk again what was the ecstasy of that however but in itself a trifle compromisingas truly within the week maggie had occasion to suspect her friend of beginning and rather abruptly to remember convinced as she was of the example already given her by her husband and in relation to which her profession of trust in his mistress had been an act of conformity exquisitely calculated her imagination yet sought in the hidden play of his influence the explanation of any change of surface any difference of expression or intention there had been through life as we know few quarters in which the princesss fancy could let itself loose but it shook off restraint when it plunged into the figured void of the detail of that relation this was a realm it could people with imagesagain and again with fresh ones they swarmed there like the strange combinations that lurked in the woods at twilight they loomed into the definite and faded into the vague their main present sign for her being however that they were always that they were duskily agitated her earlier vision of a state of bliss made insecure by the very intensity of the blissthis had dropped from her she had ceased to see as she lost herself the pair of operatic of high wagnerian lovers she found deep within her these comparisons interlocked in their wood of enchantment a green glade as romantic as ones dream of an old german forest the picture was veiled on the contrary with the dimness of trouble behind which she felt indistinguishable the procession of forms that had lost all so pitifully their precious confidence therefore though there was in these days for her with amerigo little enough even of the imitation from day to day of unembarrassed referencesas she had foreseen for that matter from the first that there would beher active conception of his accessibility to their companions own private and unextinguished right to break ground was not much less active than before so it was that her inner sense in spite of everything represented him as still pulling wires and controlling currents or rather indeed as muffling the whole possibility keeping it down and down leading his accomplice continually on to some new turn of the road as regards herself maggie had become more conscious from week to week of his ingenuities of intention to make up to her for their forfeiture in so dire a degree of any reality of franknessa privation that had left on his lips perhaps a little of the same thirst with which she fairly felt her own distorted the torment of the lost pilgrim who listens in desert sands for the possible the impossible plash of water it was just this hampered state in him none the less that she kept before her when she wished most to find grounds of dignity for the hard little passion which nothing he had done could smother there were hours enough lonely hours in which she let dignity go then there were others when clinging with her winged concentration to some deep cell of her heart she stored away her hived tenderness as if she had gathered it all from flowers he was walking ostensibly beside her but in fact given over without a break to the grey medium in which he helplessly groped a perception on her part which was a perpetual pang and which might last what it wouldfor ever if need bebut which if relieved at all must be relieved by his act alone she herself could do nothing more for it she had done the utmost possible it was meantime not the easier to bear for this aspect under which charlotte was presented as depending on him for guidance taking it from him even in doses of bitterness and yet lost with him in devious depths nothing was thus more sharply to be inferred than that he had promptly enough warned her on hearing from her of the precious assurance received from his wife that she must take care her satisfaction didnt betray something of her danger maggie had a day of still waiting after allowing him time to learn how unreservedly she had lied for himof waiting as for the light of she scarce knew what slow shining reflection of this knowledge in his personal attitude what retarded evolution she asked herself in these hours mightnt poor charlotte all unwittingly have precipitated she was thus poor charlotte again for maggie even while maggies own head was bowed and the reason for this kept coming back to our young woman in the conception of what would secretly have passed she saw her face to face with the prince take from him the chill of his stiffest admonition with the possibilities of deeper difficulty that it represented for each she heard her ask irritated and sombre what tone in gods namesince her bravery didnt suit himshe was then to adopt and by way of a fantastic flight of divination she heard amerigo reply in a voice of which every fine note familiar and admirable came home to her that one must really manage such prudences a little for ones self it was positive in the princess that for this she breathed charlottes cold airturned away from him in it with her turned with her in growing compassion this way and that hovered behind her while she felt her ask herself where then she should rest marvellous the manner in which under such imaginations maggie thus circled and lingeredquite as if she were materially following her unseen counting every step she helplessly wasted noting every hindrance that brought her to a pause  a few days of this accordingly had wrought a change in that apprehension of the instant beatitude of triumphof triumph magnanimous and serenewith which the upshot of the nightscene on the terrace had condemned our young woman to make terms she had had as we know her vision of the gilt bars bent of the door of the cage forced open from within and the creature imprisoned roaming at largea movement on the creatures part that was to have even for the short interval its impressive beauty but of which the limit and in yet another direction had loomed straight into view during her last talk under the great trees with her father it was when she saw his wifes face ruefully attached to the quarter to which in the course of their session he had so significantly addressed his ownit was then that maggie could watch for its turning pale it was then she seemed to know what she had meant by thinking of her in she shadow of his most ominous reference as doomed if as i say her attention now day after day so circled and hovered it found itself arrested for certain passages during which she absolutely looked with charlottes grave eyes what she unfailingly made out through them was the figure of a little quiet gentleman who mostly wore as he moved alone across the field of vision a straw hat a white waistcoat and a blue necktie keeping a cigar in his teeth and his hands in his pockets and who oftener than not presented a somewhat meditative back while he slowly measured the perspectives of the park and broodingly counted it might have appeared his steps there were hours of intensity for a week or two when it was for all the world as if she had guardedly tracked her stepmother in the great house from room to room and from window to window only to see her here and there and everywhere try her uneasy outlook question her issue and her fate something unmistakably had come up for her that had never come up before it represented a new complication and had begotten a new anxietythings these that she carried about with her done up in the napkin of her lovers accepted rebuke while she vainly hunted for some corner where she might put them safely down the disguised solemnity the prolonged futility of her search might have been grotesque to a more ironic eye but maggies provision of irony which we have taken for naturally small had never been so scant as now and there were moments while she watched with her thus unseen when the mere effect of being near her was to feel her own heart in her throat was to be almost moved to saying to her hold on tight my poor dearwithout too much terrorand it will all come out somehow  even to that indeed she could reflect charlotte might have replied that it was easy to say even to that no great meaning could attach so long as the little meditative man in the straw hat kept coming into view with his indescribable air of weaving his spell weaving it off there by himself in whatever quarter of the horizon the appearances were scanned he was to be noticed as absorbed in this occupation and maggie was to become aware of two or three extraordinary occasions of receiving from him the hint that he measured the impression he produced it was not really till after their recent long talk in the park that she knew how deeply how quite exhaustively they had then communicatedso that they were to remain together for the time in consequence quite in the form of a couple of sociable drinkers who sit back from the table over which they have been resting their elbows over which they have emptied to the last drop their respective charged cups the cups were still there on the table but turned upside down and nothing was left for the companions but to confirm by placid silences the fact that the wine had been good they had parted positively as if on either side primed with itprimed for whatever was to be and everything between them as the month waned added its touch of truth to this similitude nothing truly was at present between them save that they were looking at each other in infinite trust it fairly wanted no more words and when they met during the deep summer days met even without witnesses when they kissed at morning and evening or on any of the other occasions of contact that they had always so freely celebrated a pair of birds of the upper air could scarce have appeared less to invite each other to sit down and worry afresh so it was that in the house itself where more of his waiting treasures than ever were provisionally ranged she sometimes only looked at himfrom end to end of the great gallery the pride of the house for instanceas if in one of the halls of a museum she had been an earnest young woman with a baedeker and he a vague gentleman to whom even baedekers were unknown he had ever of course had his way of walking about to review his possessions and verify their condition but this was a pastime to which he now struck her as almost extravagantly addicted and when she passed near him and he turned to give her a smile she caughtor so she fanciedthe greater depth of his small perpetual hum of contemplation it was as if he were singing to himself sotto voce as he wentand it was also on occasion quite ineffably as if charlotte hovering watching listening on her side too kept sufficiently within earshot to make it out as song and yet for some reason connected with the very manner of it stood off and didnt dare  one of the attentions she had from immediately after her marriage most freely paid him was that of her interest in his rarities her appreciation of his taste her native passion for beautiful objects and her grateful desire not to miss anything he could teach her about them maggie had in due course seen her begin to work this fortunately natural source of sympathy for all it was worth she took possession of the mound throughout its extent she abounded to odd excess one might have remarked in the assumption of its being for her with her husband all the ground the finest clearest air and most breathable medium common to them it had been given to maggie to wonder if she didnt in these intensities of approbation too much shut him up to his province but this was a complaint he had never made his daughter and charlotte must at least have had for her that thanks to her admirable instinct her range of perception marching with his own and never falling behind she had probably not so much as once treated him to a rasping mistake or a revealing stupidity maggie wonderfully in the summer days felt it forced upon her that that was one way after all of being a genial wife and it was never so much forced upon her as at these odd moments of her encountering the sposi as amerigo called them under the coved ceilings of fawns while so together yet at the same time so separate they were making their daily round charlotte hung behind with emphasised attention she stopped when her husband stopped but at the distance of a case or two or of whatever other succession of objects and the likeness of their connection would not have been wrongly figured if he had been thought of as holding in one of his pocketed hands the end of a long silken halter looped round her beautiful neck he didnt twitch it yet it was there he didnt drag her but she came and those indications that i have described the princess as finding extraordinary in him were two or three mute facial intimations which his wifes presence didnt prevent his addressing his daughternor prevent his daughter as she passed it was doubtless to be added from flushing a little at the receipt of they amounted perhaps only to a wordless wordless smile but the smile was the soft shake of the twisted silken rope and maggies translation of it held in her breast till she got well away came out only as if it might have been overheard when some door was closed behind her yes you seei lead her now by the neck i lead her to her doom and she doesnt so much as know what it is though she has a fear in her heart which if you had the chances to apply your ear there that i as a husband have you would hear thump and thump and thump she thinks it may be her doom the awful place over thereawful for her but shes afraid to ask dont you see just as shes afraid of not asking just as shes afraid of so many other things that she sees multiplied round her now as portents and betrayals shell know howeverwhen she does know  charlottes one opportunity meanwhile for the air of confidence she had formerly worn so well and that agreed so with her firm and charming type was the presence of visitors never as the season advanced wholly intermittedrather in fact so constant with all the people who turned up for luncheon and for tea and to see the house now replete now famous that maggie grew to think again of this large element of company as of a kind of renewed watersupply for the tank in which like a party of panting goldfish they kept afloat it helped them unmistakably with each other weakening the emphasis of so many of the silences of which their intimate intercourse would otherwise have consisted beautiful and wonderful for her even at times was the effect of these interventionstheir effect above all in bringing home to each the possible heroism of perfunctory things they learned fairly to live in the perfunctory they remained in it as many hours of the day as might be it took on finally the likeness of some spacious central chamber in a haunted house a great overarched and overglazed rotunda where gaiety might reign but the doors of which opened into sinister circular passages here they turned up for each other as they said with the blank faces that denied any uneasiness felt in the approach here they closed numerous doors carefully behind themall save the door that connected the place as by a straight tented corridor with the outer world and encouraging thus the irruption of society imitated the aperture through which the bedizened performers of the circus are poured into the ring the great part mrs verver had socially played came luckily maggie could make out to her assistance she had personal friendscharlottes personal friends had ever been in london at the two houses one of the most convenient pleasantrieswho actually tempered at this crisis her aspect of isolation and it wouldnt have been hard to guess that her best moments were those in which she suffered no fear of becoming a bore to restrain her appeal to their curiosity their curiosity might be vague but their clever hostess was distinct and she marched them about sparing them nothing as if she counted each day on a harvest of half crowns maggie met her again in the gallery at the oddest hours with the party she was entertaining heard her draw out the lesson insist upon the interest snub even the particular presumption and smile for the general bewildermentinevitable features these latter of almost any occasionin a manner that made our young woman herself incurably dazzled marvel afresh at the mystery by which a creature who could be in some connexions so earnestly right could be in others so perversely wrong when her father vaguely circulating was attended by his wife it was always charlotte who seemed to bring up the rear but he hung in the background when she did cicerone and it was then perhaps that moving mildly and modestly to and fro on the skirts of the exhibition his appearance of weaving his spell was for the initiated conscience least to be resisted brilliant women turned to him in vague emotion but his response scarce committed him more than if he had been the person employed to see that after the invading wave was spent the cabinets were all locked and the symmetries all restored  there was a morning when during the hour before luncheon and shortly after the arrival of a neighbourly contingent neighbourly from ten miles offwhom mrs verver had taken in charge maggie paused on the threshold of the gallery through which she had been about to pass faltered there for the very impression of his face as it met her from an opposite door charlotte halfway down the vista held together as if by something almost austere in the grace of her authority the semiscared now that they were there knot of her visitors who since they had announced themselves by telegram as yearning to inquire and admire saw themselves restricted to this consistency her voice high and clear and a little hard reached her husband and her stepdaughter while she thus placed beyond doubt her cheerful submission to duty her words addressed to the largest publicity rang for some minutes through the place every one as quiet to listen as if it had been a church ablaze with tapers and she were taking her part in some hymn of praise fanny assingham looked rapt in devotionfanny assingham who forsook this other friend as little as she forsook either her host or the princess or the prince or the principino she supported her in slow revolutions in murmurous attestations of presence at all such times and maggie advancing after a first hesitation was not to fail of noting her solemn inscrutable attitude her eyes attentively lifted so that she might escape being provoked to betray an impression she betrayed one however as maggie approached dropping her gaze to the latters level long enough to seem to adventure marvellously on a mute appeal you understand dont you that if she didnt do this there would be no knowing what she might do this light mrs assingham richly launched while her younger friend unresistingly moved became uncertain again and then not too much to show itor rather positively to conceal it and to conceal something more as wellturned short round to one of the windows and awkwardly pointlessly waited the largest of the three pieces has the rare peculiarity that the garlands looped round it which as you see are the finest possible vieux saxe are not of the same origin or period or even wonderful as they are of a taste quite so perfect they have been put on at a later time by a process of which there are very few examples and none so important as this which is really quite uniqueso that though the whole thing is a little baroque its value as a specimen is i believe almost inestimable  so the high voice quavered aiming truly at effects far over the heads of gaping neighbours so the speaker piling it up sticking at nothing as less interested judges might have said seemed to justify the faith with which she was honoured maggie meanwhile at the window knew the strangest thing to be happening she had turned suddenly to crying or was at least on the point of itthe lighted square before her all blurred and dim the high voice went on its quaver was doubtless for conscious ears only but there were verily thirty seconds during which it sounded for our young woman like the shriek of a soul in pain kept up a minute longer it would break and collapseso that maggie felt herself the next thing turn with a start to her father cant she be stopped hasnt she done it enough some such question as that she let herself ask him to suppose in her then it was that across half the galleryfor he had not moved from where she had first seen himhe struck her as confessing with strange tears in his own eyes to sharp identity of emotion poor thing poor thingit reached straight isnt she for ones credit on the swagger after which as held thus together they had still another strained minute the shame the pity the better knowledge the smothered protest the divined anguish even so overcame him that blushing to his eyes he turned short away the affair but of a few muffled moments this snatched communion yet lifted maggie as on airso much for deep guesses on her own side too it gave her to think of there was honestly an awful mixture in things and it was not closed to her aftersense of such passageswe have already indeed in other cases seen it openthat the deepest depth of all in a perceived penalty was that you couldnt be sure some of your compunctions and contortions wouldnt show for ridiculous amerigo that morning for instance had been as absent as he at this juncture appeared to desire he should mainly be noted as being he had gone to london for the day and the nighta necessity that now frequently rose for him and that he had more than once suffered to operate during the presence of guests successions of pretty women the theory of his fond interest in whom had been publicly cultivated it had never occurred to his wife to pronounce him ingenuous but there came at last a high dim august dawn when she couldnt sleep and when creeping restlessly about and breathing at her window the coolness of wooded acres she found the faint flush of the east march with the perception of that other almost equal prodigy it rosily coloured her vision thateven such as he was yesher husband could on occasion sin by excess of candour he wouldnt otherwise have given as his reason for going up to portland place in the august days that he was arranging books there he had bought a great many of late and he had had others a large number sent from romewonders of old print in which her father had been interested but when her imagination tracked him to the dusty town to the house where drawn blinds and pale shrouds where a caretaker and a kitchenmaid were alone in possession it wasnt to see him in his shirtsleeves unpacking battered boxes  she saw him in truth less easily beguiledsaw him wander in the closed dusky rooms from place to place or else for long periods recline on deep sofas and stare before him through the smoke of ceaseless cigarettes she made him out as liking better than anything in the world just now to be alone with his thoughts being herself connected with his thoughts she continued to believe more than she had ever been it was thereby a good deal as if he were alone with her she made him out as resting so from that constant strain of the perfunctory to which he was exposed at fawns and she was accessible to the impression of the almost beggared aspect of this alternative it was like his doing penance in sordid waysbeing sent to prison or being kept without money it wouldnt have taken much to make her think of him as really kept without food he might have broken away might easily have started to travel he had a rightthought wonderful maggie nowto so many more freedoms than he took his secret was of course that at fawns he all the while winced was all the while in presences in respect to which he had thrown himself back with a hard pressure on whatever mysteries of pride whatever inward springs familiar to the man of the world he could keep from snapping maggie for some reason had that morning while she watched the sunrise taken an extraordinary measure of the ground on which he would have had to snatch at pretexts for absence it all came to her therehe got off to escape from a sound the sound was in her own ears stillthat of charlottes high coerced quaver before the cabinets in the hushed gallery the voice by which she herself had been pierced the day before as by that of a creature in anguish and by which while she sought refuge at the blurred window the tears had been forced into her eyes her comprehension soared so high that the wonder for her became really his not feeling the need of wider intervals and thicker walls before that admiration she also meditated consider as she might now she kept reading not less into what he omitted than into what he performed a beauty of intention that touched her fairly the more by being obscure it was like hanging over a garden in the dark nothing was to be made of the confusion of growing things but one felt they were folded flowers and their vague sweetness made the whole air their medium he had to turn away but he wasnt at least a coward he would wait on the spot for the issue of what he had done on the spot she sank to her knees with her arm on the ledge of her windowseat where she blinded her eyes from the full glare of seeing that his idea could only be to wait whatever might come at her side it was to her buried face that she thus for a long time felt him draw nearest though after a while when the strange wail of the gallery began to repeat its inevitable echo she was conscious of how that brought out his pale hard grimace                               xxxix  the resemblance had not been present to her on first coming out into the hot still brightness of the sunday afternoononly the second sunday of all the summer when the party of six the party of seven including the principino had practically been without accessions or invasions but within sight of charlotte seated far away very much where she had expected to find her the princess fell to wondering if her friend wouldnt be affected quite as she herself had been that night on the terrace under mrs ververs perceptive pursuit the relation today had turned itself round charlotte was seeing her come through patches of lingering noon quite as she had watched charlotte menace her through the starless dark and there was a moment that of her waiting a little as they thus met across the distance when the interval was bridged by a recognition not less soundless and to all appearance not less charged with strange meanings than that of the other occasion the point however was that they had changed places maggie had from her window seen her stepmother leave the houseat so unlikely an hour three oclock of a canicular august for a ramble in garden or groveand had thereupon felt her impulse determined with the same sharpness that had made the spring of her companions three weeks before it was the hottest day of the season and the shaded siesta for people all at their ease would certainly rather have been prescribed but our young woman had perhaps not yet felt it so fully brought home that such refinements of repose among them constituted the empty chair at the feast this was the more distinct as the feast literally in the great bedimmed diningroom the cool ceremonious semblance of luncheon had just been taking place without mrs verver she had been represented but by the plea of a bad headache not reported to the rest of the company by her husband but offered directly to mr verver himself on their having assembled by her maid deputed for the effect and solemnly producing it  maggie had sat down with the others to viands artfully iced to the slow circulation of precious tinkling jugs to marked reserves of reference in many directionspoor fanny assingham herself scarce thrusting her nose out of the padded hollow into which she had withdrawn a consensus of languor which might almost have been taken for a community of dread ruled the scenerelieved only by the fitful experiments of father mitchell good holy hungry man a trusted and overworked london friend and adviser who had taken for a week or two the light neighbouring service local rites flourishing under maggies munificence and was enjoying as a convenience all the bounties of the house he conversed undiscouraged father mitchell conversed mainly with the indefinite wandering smile of the entertainers and the princesss power to feel him on the whole a blessing for these occasions was not impaired by what was awkward in her consciousness of having from the first of her trouble really found her way without his guidance she asked herself at times if he suspected how more than subtly how perversely she had dispensed with him and she balanced between visions of all he must privately have guessed and certitudes that he had guessed nothing whatever he might nevertheless have been so urbanely filling up gaps at present for the very reason that his instinct sharper than the expression of his face had sufficiently served himmade him aware of the thin ice figuratively speaking and of prolongations of tension round about him mostly foreign to the circles in which luxury was akin to virtue some day in some happier season she would confess to him that she hadnt confessed though taking so much on her conscience but just now she was carrying in her weak stiffened hand a glass filled to the brim as to which she had recorded a vow that no drop should overflow she feared the very breath of a better wisdom the jostle of the higher light of heavenly help itself and in addition however that might be she drew breath this afternoon as never yet in an element heavy to oppression something grave had happened somehow and somewhere and she had god knew her choice of suppositions her heart stood still when she wondered above all if the cord mightnt at last have snapped between her husband and her father she shut her eyes for dismay at the possibility of such a passagethere moved before them the procession of ugly forms it might have taken find out for yourself she had thrown to amerigo for her last word on the question of who else knew that night of the breaking of the bowl and she flattered herself that she hadnt since then helped him in her clear consistency by an inch it was what she had given him all these weeks to be busy with and she had again and again lain awake for the obsession of this sense of his uncertainty ruthlessly and endlessly playing with his dignity she had handed him over to an ignorance that couldnt even try to become indifferent and that yet wouldnt project itself either into the cleared air of conviction in proportion as he was generous it had bitten into his spirit and more than once she had said to herself that to break the spell she had cast upon him and that the polished old ivory of her fathers inattackable surface made so absolute he would suddenly commit some mistake or some violence smash some windowpane for air fail even of one of his blest inveteracies of taste in that way fatally he would have put himself in the wrongblighting by a single false step the perfection of his outward show  these shadows rose and fell for her while father mitchell prattled with other shadows as well those that hung over charlotte herself those that marked her as a prey to equal suspicionsto the idea in particular of a change such a change as she didnt dare to face in the relations of the two men or there were yet other possibilities as it seemed to maggie there were always too many and all of them things of evil when ones nerves had at last done for one all that nerves could do had left one in a darkness of prowling dangers that was like the predicament of the nightwatcher in a beasthaunted land who has no more means for a fire she might with such nerves have supposed almost anything of any one anything almost of poor bob assingham condemned to eternal observances and solemnly appreciating her fathers wine anything verily yes of the good priest as he finally sat back with fat folded hands and twiddled his thumbs on his stomach the good priest looked hard at the decanters at the different dishes of desserthe eyed them halfobliquely as if they might have met him today for conversation better than any one present but the princess had her fancy at last about that too she was in the midst of a passage before she knew it between father mitchell and charlottesome approach he would have attempted with her that very morning perhaps to the circumstance of an apparent detachment recently noted in her from any practice of devotion he would have drawn from this say his artless inferencetaken it for a sign of some smothered inward trouble and pointed naturally the moral that the way out of such straits was not through neglect of the grand remedy he had possibly prescribed contritionhe had at any rate quickened in her the beat of that false repose to which our young womans own act had devoted her at her all so deluded instance the falsity of it had laid traps compared to which the imputation of treachery even accepted might have seemed a path of roses the acceptance strangely would have left her nothing to doshe could have remained had she liked all insolently passive whereas the failure to proceed against her as it might have been called left her everything and all the more that it was wrapped so in confidence she had to confirm day after day the rightness of her cause and the justice and felicity of her exemptionso that wouldnt there have been fairly in any explicit concern of father mitchells depths of practical derision of her success  the question was provisionally answered at all events by the time the party at luncheon had begun to dispersewith maggies version of mrs verver sharp to the point of representing her pretext for absence as a positive flight from derision she met the good priests eyes before they separated and priests were really at the worst so to speak such wonderful people that she believed him for an instant on the verge of saying to her in abysmal softness go to mrs verver my childyou go youll find that you can help her this didnt come however nothing came but the renewed twiddle of thumbs over the satisfied stomach and the full flush the comical candour of reference to the hand employed at fawns for mayonnaise of salmon nothing came but the receding backs of each of the othersher fathers slightly bent shoulders in especial which seemed to weave his spell by the force of habit not less patiently than if his wife had been present her husband indeed was present to feel anything there might be to feelwhich was perhaps exactly why this personage was moved promptly to emulate so definite an example of sloping he had his occupationsbooks to arrange perhaps even at fawns the idea of the siesta moreover in all the conditions had no need to be loudly invoked maggie was in the event left alone for a minute with mrs assingham who after waiting for safety appeared to have at heart to make a demonstration the stage of talking over had long passed for them when they communicated now it was on quite ultimate facts but fanny desired to testify to the existence on her part of an attention that nothing escaped she was like the kind lady who happening to linger at the circus while the rest of the spectators pour grossly through the exits falls in with the overworked little trapezist girlthe acrobatic support presumably of embarrassed and exacting parentsand gives her as an obscure and meritorious artist assurance of benevolent interest what was clearest always in our young womans imaginings was the sense of being herself left for any occasion in the breach she was essentially there to bear the burden in the last resort of surrounding omissions and evasions and it was eminently to that office she had been today abandonedwith this one alleviation as appeared of mrs assinghams keeping up with her mrs assingham suggested that she too was still on the rampartsthough her gallantry proved indeed after a moment to consist not a little of her curiosity she had looked about and seen their companions beyond earshot  dont you really want us to go  maggie found a faint smile do you really want to  it made her friend colour well thenno but we would you know at a look from you wed pack up and be offas a sacrifice  ah make no sacrifice said maggie see me through  thats itthats all i want i should be too base besides fanny went on youre too splendid  splendid  splendid also you know you are all but through youve done it said mrs assingham but maggie only half took it from her  what does it strike you that ive done  what you wanted theyre going  maggie continued to look at her is that what i wanted  oh it wasnt for you to say that was his business  my fathers maggie asked after an hesitation  your fathers he has chosenand now she knows she sees it all before herand she cant speak or resist or move a little finger thats whats the matter with her said fanny assingham  it made a picture somehow for the princess as they stood therethe picture that the words of others whatever they might be always made for her even when her vision was already charged better than any words of her own she saw round about her through the chinks of the shutters the hard glare of naturesaw charlotte somewhere in it virtually at bay and yet denied the last grace of any protecting truth she saw her off somewhere all unaided pale in her silence and taking in her fate has she told you she then asked  her companion smiled superior i dont need to be told either i see something thank god every day and then as maggie might appear to be wondering what for instance i see the long miles of ocean and the dreadful great country state after statewhich have never seemed to me so big or so terrible i see them at last day by day and step by step at the far end and i see them never come back but neversimply i see the extraordinary interesting placewhich ive never been to you know and you haveand the exact degree in which she will be expected to be interested  she will be maggie presently replied expected  interested  for a little after this their eyes met on it at the end of which fanny said shell beyeswhat shell have to be and it will bewont it for ever and ever she spoke as abounding in her friends sense but it made maggie still only look at her  these were large words and large visionsall the more that now really they spread and spread in the midst of them however mrs assingham had soon enough continued when i talk of knowing indeed i dont mean it as you would have a right to do you know because you seeand i dont see him i dont make him out she almost crudely confessed  maggie again hesitated you mean you dont make out amerigo  but fanny shook her head and it was quite as if as an appeal to ones intelligence the making out of amerigo had in spite of everything long been superseded then maggie measured the reach of her allusion and how what she next said gave her meaning a richness no other name was to be spoken and mrs assingham had taken that without delay from her eyeswith a discretion still that fell short but by an inch you know how he feels  maggie at this then slowly matched her headshake i know nothing  you know how you feel  but again she denied it i know nothing if i did  well if you did fanny asked as she faltered  she had had enough however i should die she said as she turned away  she went to her room through the quiet house she roamed there a moment picking up pointlessly a different fan and then took her way to the shaded apartments in which at this hour the principino would be enjoying his nap she passed through the first empty room the day nursery and paused at an open door the inner room large dim and cool was equally calm her boys ample antique historical royal crib consecrated reputedly by the guarded rest of heirsapparent and a gift early in his career from his grandfather ruled the scene from the centre in the stillness of which she could almost hear the childs soft breathing the prime protector of his dreams was installed beside him her father sat there with as little motionwith head thrown back and supported with eyes apparently closed with the fine foot that was so apt to betray nervousness at peace upon the other knee with the unfathomable heart folded in the constant flawless freshness of the white waistcoat that could always receive in its armholes the firm prehensile thumbs mrs noble had majestically melted and the whole place signed her temporary abdication yet the actual situation was regular and maggie lingered but to look she looked over her fan the top of which was pressed against her face long enough to wonder if her father really slept or if aware of her he only kept consciously quiet did his eyes truly fix her between lids partly open and was she to take thishis forebearance from any questiononly as a sign again that everything was left to her she at all events for a minute watched his immobilitythen as if once more renewing her total submission returned without a sound to her own quarters  a strange impulse was sharp in her but it was not for her part the desire to shift the weight she could as little have slept as she could have slept that morning days before when she had watched the first dawn from her window turned to the east this side of her room was now in shade with the two wings of the casement folded back and the charm she always found in her seemingly perched positionas if her outlook from above the high terraces was that of some castletower mounted on a rock when she stood there she hung over over the gardens and the woodsall of which drowsed below her at this hour in the immensity of light the miles of shade looked hot the banks of flowers looked dim the peacocks on the balustrades let their tails hang limp and the smaller birds lurked among the leaves nothing therefore would have appeared to stir in the brilliant void if maggie at the moment she was about to turn away had not caught sight of a moving spot a clear green sunshade in the act of descending a flight of steps it passed down from the terrace receding at a distance from sight and carried naturally so as to conceal the head and back of its bearer but maggie had quickly recognised the white dress and the particular motion of this adventurerhad taken in that charlotte of all people had chosen the glare of noon for an exploration of the gardens and that she could be betaking herself only to some unvisited quarter deep in them or beyond them that she had already marked as a superior refuge the princess kept her for a few minutes in sight watched her long enough to feel her by the mere betrayal of her pace and direction driven in a kind of flight and then understood for herself why the act of sitting still had become impossible to either of them there came to her confusedly some echo of an ancient fablesome vision of io goaded by the gadfly or of ariadne roaming the lone seastrand it brought with it all the sense of her own intention and desire she too might have been for the hour some faroff harassed heroineonly with a part to play for which she knew exactly no inspiring precedent she knew but that all the whileall the while of her sitting there among the others without hershe had wanted to go straight to this detached member of the party and make somehow for her support the last demonstration a pretext was all that was needful and maggie after another instant had found one she had caught a glimpse before mrs verver disappeared of her carrying a bookmade out half lost in the folds of her white dress the dark cover of a volume that was to explain her purpose in case of her being met with surprise and the mate of which precisely now lay on maggies table the book was an old novel that the princess had a couple of days before mentioned having brought down from portland place in the charming original form of its three volumes charlotte had hailed with a specious glitter of interest the opportunity to read it and our young woman had thereupon on the morrow directed her maid to carry it to mrs ververs apartments she was afterwards to observe that this messenger unintelligent or inadvertent had removed but one of the volumes which happened not to be the first still possessed accordingly of the first while charlotte going out fantastically at such an hour to cultivate romance in an arbour was helplessly armed with the second maggie prepared on the spot to sally forth with succour the right volume with a parasol was all she requiredin addition that is to the bravery of her general idea she passed again through the house unchallenged and emerged upon the terrace which she followed hugging the shade with that consciousness of turning the tables on her friend which we have already noted but so far as she went after descending into the open and beginning to explore the grounds mrs verver had gone still furtherwith the increase of the oddity moreover of her having exchanged the protection of her room for these exposed and shining spaces it was not fortunately however at last that by persisting in pursuit one didnt arrive at regions of admirable shade this was the asylum presumably that the poor wandering woman had had in view several wide alleys in particular of great length densely overarched with the climbing rose and the honeysuckle and converging in separate green vistas at a sort of umbrageous temple an ancient rotunda pillared and statued niched and roofed yet with its uncorrected antiquity like that of everything else at fawns conscious hitherto of no violence from the present and no menace from the future charlotte had paused there in her frenzy or what ever it was to be called the place was a conceivable retreat and she was staring before her from the seat to which she appeared to have sunk all unwittingly as maggie stopped at the beginning of one of the perspectives  it was a repetition more than ever then of the evening on the terrace the distance was too great to assure her she had been immediately seen but the princess waited with her intention as charlotte on the other occasion had waitedallowing oh allowing for the difference of the intention maggie was full of the sense of thatso full that it made her impatient whereupon she moved forward a little placing herself in range of the eyes that had been looking off elsewhere but that she had suddenly called to recognition charlotte had evidently not dreamed of being followed and instinctively with her pale stare she stiffened herself for protest maggie could make that outas well as further however that her second impression of her friends approach had an instant effect on her attitude the princess came nearer gravely and in silence but fairly paused again to give her time for whatever she would whatever she would whatever she could was what maggie wantedwanting above all to make it as easy for her as the case permitted that was not what charlotte had wanted the other night but this never matteredthe great thing was to allow her was fairly to produce in her the sense of highly choosing at first clearly she had been frightened she had not been pursued it had quickly struck her without some design on the part of her pursuer and what might she not be thinking of in addition but the way she had when herself the pursuer made her stepdaughter take in her spirit and her purpose it had sunk into maggie at the time that hard insistence and mrs verver had felt it and seen it and heard it sink which wonderful remembrance of pressure successfully applied had naturally till now remained with her but her stare was like a projected fear that the buried treasure so dishonestly come by for which her companions still countenance at the hour and afterwards had consented to serve as the deep soil might have worked up again to the surface to be thrown back upon her hands yes it was positive that during one of these minutes the princess had the vision of her particular alarm its her lie its her lie that has mortally disagreed with her she can keep down no longer her rebellion at it and she has come to retract it to disown it and denounce itto give me full in my face the truth instead this for a concentrated instant maggie felt her helplessly gaspbut only to let it bring home the indignity the pity of her state she herself could but tentatively hover place in view the book she carried look as little dangerous look as abjectly mild as possible remind herself really of people she had read about in stories of the wild west people who threw up their hands on certain occasions as a sign they werent carrying revolvers she could almost have smiled at last troubled as she yet knew herself to show how richly she was harmless she held up her volume which was so weak a weapon and while she continued for consideration to keep her distance she explained with as quenched a quaver as possible i saw you come outsaw you from my window and couldnt bear to think you should find yourself here without the beginning of your book this is the beginning youve got the wrong volume and ive brought you out the right  she remained after she had spoken it was like holding a parley with a possible adversary and her intense her exalted little smile asked for formal leave may i come nearer now she seemed to sayas to which however the next minute she saw charlottes reply lose itself in a strange process a thing of several sharp stages which she could stand there and trace the dread after a minute had dropped from her face though discernibly enough she still couldnt believe in her having in so strange a fashion been deliberately made up to if she had been made up to at least it was with an ideathe idea that had struck her at first as necessarily dangerous that it wasnt insistently wasnt this shone from maggie with a force finally not to be resisted and on that perception on the immense relief so constituted everything had by the end of three minutes extraordinarily changed maggie had come out to her really because she knew her doomed doomed to a separation that was like a knife in her heart and in the very sight of her uncontrollable her blinded physical quest of a peace not to be grasped something of mrs assinghams picture of her as thrown for a grim future beyond the great sea and the great continent had at first found fulfilment she had got away in this fashionburning behind her almost the ships of disguiseto let her horror of what was before her play up without witnesses and even after maggies approach had presented an innocent front it was still not to be mistaken that she bristled with the signs of her extremity it was not to be said for them either that they were draped at this hour in any of her usual graces unveiled and all but unashamed they were tragic to the princess in spite of the dissimulation that with the return of comparative confidence was so promptly to operate how tragic in essence the very change made vivid the instant stiffening of the spring of pridethis for possible defence if not for possible aggression pride indeed the next moment had become the mantle caught up for protection and perversity she flung it round her as a denial of any loss of her freedom to be doomed was in her situation to have extravagantly incurred a doom so that to confess to wretchedness was by the same stroke to confess to falsity she wouldnt confess she didnta thousand times no she only cast about her and quite frankly and fiercely for something else that would give colour to her having burst her bonds her eyes expanded her bosom heaved as she invoked it and the effect upon maggie was verily to wish she could only help her to it she presently got upwhich seemed to mean oh stay if you like and when she had moved about awhile at random looking away looking at anything at everything but her visitor when she had spoken of the temperature and declared that she revelled in it when she had uttered her thanks for the book which a little incoherently with her second volume she perhaps found less clever than she expected when she had let maggie approach sufficiently closer to lay untouched the tribute in question on a bench and take up obligingly its superfluous mate when she had done these things she sat down in another place more or less visibly in possession of her part our young woman was to have passed in all her adventure no stranger moments for she not only now saw her companion fairly agree to take her then for the poor little person she was finding it so easy to appear but fell in a secret responsive ecstasy to wondering if there were not some supreme abjection with which she might be inspired vague but increasingly brighter this possibility glimmered on her it at last hung there adequately plain to charlotte that she had presented herself once more to as they said grovel and that truly made the stage large it had absolutely within the time taken on the dazzling merit of being large for each of them alike  im glad to see you alonetheres something ive been wanting to say to you im tired said mrs verver im tired  tired it had dropped the next thing it couldnt all come at once but maggie had already guessed what it was and the flush of recognition was in her face  tired of this lifethe one weve been leading you like it i know but ive dreamed another dream she held up her head now her lighted eyes more triumphantly rested she was finding she was following her way maggie by the same influence sat in sight of it there was something she was saving some quantity of which she herself was judge and it was for a long moment even with the sacrifice the princess had come to make a good deal like watching her from the solid shore plunge into uncertain into possibly treacherous depths i see something else she went on ive an idea that greatly appeals to meive had it for a long time it has come over me that were wrong our real life isnt here  maggie held her breath ours  my husbands and mine im not speaking for you  oh said maggie only praying not to be not even to appear stupid  im speaking for ourselves im speaking charlotte brought out for him  i see for my father  for your father for whom else they looked at each other hard now but maggies face took refuge in the intensity of her interest she was not at all even so stupid as to treat her companions question as requiring an answer a discretion that her controlled stillness had after an instant justified i must risk your thinking me selfishfor of course you know what it involves let me admit iti am selfish i place my husband first  well said maggie smiling and smiling since thats where i place mine  you mean youll have no quarrel with me so much the better then for charlotte went on with a higher and higher flight my plan is completely formed  maggie waitedher glimmer had deepened her chance somehow was at hand the only danger was her spoiling it she felt herself skirting an abyss what then may i ask is your plan  it hung fire but ten seconds it came out sharp to take him hometo his real position and not to wait  do you meanathis season  i mean immediately andi may as well tell you nowi mean for my own time i want charlotte said to have him at last a little to myself i want strange as it may seem to youand she gave it all its weight to keep the man ive married and to do so i see i must act  maggie with the effort still to follow the right line felt herself colour to the eyes immediately she thoughtfully echoed  as soon as we can get off the removal of everything is after all but a detail that can always be done with money as he spends it everything can what i ask for charlotte declared is the definite break and i wish it now with which her head like her voice rose higher oh she added i know my difficulty  far down below the level of attention in she could scarce have said what sacred depths maggies inspiration had come and it had trembled the next moment into sound do you mean im your difficulty  you and he togethersince its always with you that ive had to see him but its a difficulty that im facing if you wish to know that ive already faced that i propose to myself to surmount the struggle with itnone too pleasanthasnt been for me as you may imagine in itself charming ive felt in it at times if i must tell you all too great and too strange an ugliness yet i believe it may succeed  she had risen with this mrs verver and had moved for the emphasis of it a few steps away while maggie motionless at first but sat and looked at her you want to take my father from me  the sharp successful almost primitive wail in it made charlotte turn and this movement attested for the princess the felicity of her deceit something in her throbbed as it had throbbed the night she stood in the drawingroom and denied that she had suffered she was ready to lie again if her companion would but give her the opening then she should know she had done all charlotte looked at her hard as if to compare her face with her note of resentment and maggie feeling this met it with the signs of an impression that might pass for the impression of defeat i want really to possess him said mrs verver i happen also to feel that hes worth it  maggie rose as if to receive her ohworth it she wonderfully threw off  the tone she instantly saw again had its effect charlotte flamed aloftmight truly have been believing in her passionate parade youve thought youve known what hes worth  indeed then my dear i believe i haveas i believe i still do  she had given it maggie straight back and again it had not missed charlotte for another moment only looked at her then broke into the wordsmaggie had known they would comeof which she had pressed the spring how i see that you loathed our marriage  do you ask me maggie after an instant demanded  charlotte had looked about her picked up the parasol she had laid on a bench possessed herself mechanically of one of the volumes of the relegated novel and then more consciously flung it down again she was in presence visibly of her last word she opened her sunshade with a click she twirled it on her shoulder in her pride ask you do i need how i see she broke out that youve worked against me  oh oh oh the princess exclaimed  her companion leaving her had reached one of the archways but on this turned round with a flare you havent worked against me  maggie took it and for a moment kept it held it with closed eyes as if it had been some captured fluttering bird pressed by both hands to her breast then she opened her eyes to speak what does it matterif ive failed  you recognise then that youve failed asked charlotte from the threshold  maggie waited she looked as her companion had done a moment before at the two books on the seat she put them together and laid them down then she made up her mind ive failed she sounded out before charlotte having given her time walked away she watched her splendid and erect float down the long vista then she sank upon a seat yes she had done all    part sixth                               xl  ill do anything you like she said to her husband on one of the last days of the month if our being here this way at this time seems to you too absurd or too uncomfortable or too impossible well either take leave of them now without waitingor well come back in time three days before they start ill go abroad with you if you but say the word to switzerland the tyrol the italian alps to whichever of your old high places you would like most to see againthose beautiful ones that used to do you good after rome and that you so often told me about  where they were in the conditions that prompted this offer and where it might indeed appear ridiculous that with the stale london september close at hand they should content themselves with remaining was where the desert of portland place looked blank as it had never looked and where a drowsy cabman scanning the horizon for a fare could sink to oblivion of the risks of immobility but amerigo was of the odd opinion day after day that their situation couldnt be bettered and he even went at no moment through the form of replying that should their ordeal strike her as exceeding their patience any step they might take would be for her own relief this was no doubt partly because he stood out so wonderfully to the end against admitting by a weak word at least that any element of their existence was or ever had been an ordeal no trap of circumstance no lapse of form no accident of irritation had landed him in that inconsequence his wife might verily have suggested that he was consequentconsequent with the admirable appearance he had from the first so undertaken and so continued to presentrather too rigidly at her expense only as it happened she was not the little person to do anything of the sort and the strange tacit compact actually in operation between them might have been founded on an intelligent comparison a definite collation positively of the kinds of patience proper to each she was seeing him throughhe had engaged to come out at the right end if she would see him this understanding tacitly renewed from week to week had fairly received with the procession of the weeks the consecration of time but it scarce needed to be insisted on that she was seeing him on his terms not all on hers or that in other words she must allow him his unexplained and uncharted his one practicably workable way if that way by one of the intimate felicities the liability to which was so far from having even yet completely fallen from him happened handsomely to show him as more bored than boring with advantages of his own freely to surrender but none to be persuadedly indebted to others for what did such a false face of the matter represent but the fact itself that she was pledged if she had questioned or challenged or interferedif she had reserved herself that rightshe wouldnt have been pledged whereas there were still and evidently would be yet a while long tense stretches during which their case might have been hanging for every eye on her possible her impossible defection she must keep it up to the last mustnt absent herself for three minutes from her post only on those lines assuredly would she show herself as with him and not against him  it was extraordinary how scant a series of signs she had invited him to make of being of truly having been at any time with his wife that reflection she was not exempt from as they now in their suspense supremely waiteda reflection under the brush of which she recognised her having had in respect to him as well to do all to go the whole way over to move indefatigably while he stood as fixed in his place as some statue of one of his forefathers the meaning of it would seem to be she reasoned in sequestered hours that he had a place and that this was an attribute somehow indefeasible unquenchable which laid upon othersfrom the moment they definitely wanted anything of him the necessity of taking more of the steps that he could of circling round him of remembering for his benefit the famous relation of the mountain to mahomet it was strange if one had gone into it but such a place as amerigos was like something made for him beforehand by innumerable facts facts largely of the sort known as historical made by ancestors examples traditions habits while maggies own had come to show simply as that improvised posta post of the kind spoken of as advancedwith which she was to have found herself connected in the fashion of a settler or a trader in a new country in the likeness even of some indian squaw with a papoose on her back and barbarous beadwork to sell maggies own in short would have been sought in vain in the most rudimentary map of the social relations as such the only geography marking it would be doubtless that of the fundamental passions the end that the prince was at all events holding out for was represented to expectation by his fatherinlaws announced departure for america with mrs verver just as that prospective event had originally figured as advising for discretion the flight of the younger couple to say nothing of the withdrawal of whatever other importunate company before the great upheaval of fawns this residence was to be peopled for a month by porters packers and hammerers at whose operations it had become peculiarly publicpublic that is for portland placethat charlotte was to preside in force operations the quite awful appointed scale and style of which had at no moment loomed so large to maggies mind as one day when the dear assinghams swam back into her ken besprinkled with sawdust and looking as pale as if they had seen samson pull down the temple they had seen at least what she was not seeing rich dim things under the impression of which they had retired she having eyes at present but for the clock by which she timed her husband or for the glassthe image perhaps would be truerin which he was reflected to her as he timed the pair in the country the accession of their friends from cadogan place contributed to all their intermissions at any rate a certain effect of resonance an effect especially marked by the upshot of a prompt exchange of inquiries between mrs assingham and the princess it was noted on the occasion of that anxious ladys last approach to her young friend at fawns that her sympathy had ventured after much accepted privation again to become inquisitive and it had perhaps never so yielded to that need as on this question of the present odd line of the distinguished eccentrics  you mean to say really that youre going to stick here and then before maggie could answer what on earth will you do with your evenings  maggie waited a momentmaggie could still tentatively smile when people learn were hereand of course the papers will be full of ittheyll flock back in their hundreds from wherever they are to catch us you see you and the colonel have yourselves done it as for our evenings they wont i dare say be particularly different from anything else thats ours they wont be different from our mornings or our afternoonsexcept perhaps that you two dears will sometimes help us to get through them ive offered to go anywhere she added to take a house if he will but thisjust this and nothing elseis amerigos idea he gave it yesterday she went on a name that as he said described and fitted it so you seeand the princess indulged again in her smile that didnt play but that only as might have been said workedso you see theres a method in our madness  it drew mrs assinghams wonder and what then is the name  the reduction to its simplest expression of what we are doingthats what he called it therefore as were doing nothing were doing it in the most aggravated waywhich is the way he desires with which maggie further said of course i understand  so do i her visitor after a moment breathed youve had to vacate the housethat was inevitable but at least here he doesnt funk  our young woman accepted the expression he doesnt funk  it only however half contented fanny who thoughtfully raised her eyebrows hes prodigious but what is thereas youve fixed itto dodge unless she pursued its her getting near him itsif youll pardon my vulgarityher getting at him that she suggested may count with him  but it found the princess prepared she can get near him here she can get at him she can come up  can she fanny assingham questioned  cant she maggie returned  their eyes for a minute intimately met on it after which the elder woman said i mean for seeing him alone  so do i said the princess  at which fanny for her reasons couldnt help smiling oh if its for that hes staying  hes stayingive made it outto take anything that comes or calls upon him to take maggie went on even that then she put it as she had at last put it to herself hes staying for high decency  decency mrs assingham gravely echoed  decency if she should try  well mrs assingham urged  well i hope  hope hell see her  maggie hesitated however she made no direct reply its useless hoping she presently said she wont but he ought to her friends expression of a moment before which had been apologised for as vulgar prolonged its sharpness to her ear that of an electric bell under continued pressure stated so simply what was it but dreadful truly that the feasibility of charlottes getting at the man who for so long had loved her should now be in question strangest of all things doubtless this care of maggies as to what might make for it or make against it stranger still her fairly lapsing at moments into a vague calculation of the conceivability on her own part with her husband of some direct sounding of the subject would it be too monstrous her suddenly breaking out to him as in alarm at the lapse of the weeks wouldnt it really seem that youre bound in honour to do something for her privately before they go maggie was capable of weighing the risk of this adventure for her own spirit capable of sinking to intense little absences even while conversing as now with the person who had most of her confidence during which she followed up the possibilities it was true that mrs assingham could at such times somewhat restore the balanceby not wholly failing to guess her thought her thought however just at present had more than one facehad a series that it successively presented these were indeed the possibilities involved in the adventure of her concerning herself for the quantity of compensation that mrs verver might still look to there was always the possibility that she was after all sufficiently to get at himthere was in fact that of her having again and again done so against this stood nothing but fanny assinghams apparent belief in her privation more mercilessly imposed or more hopelessly felt in the actual relation of the parties over and beyond everything that from more than three months back of course had fostered in the princess a like conviction these assumptions might certainly be baselessinasmuch as there were hours and hours of amerigos time that there was no habit no pretence of his accounting for inasmuch too as charlotte inevitably had had more than once to the undisguised knowledge of the pair in portland place been obliged to come up to eaton square whence so many of her personal possessions were in course of removal she didnt come to portland placedidnt even come to ask for luncheon on two separate occasions when it reached the consciousness of the household there that she was spending the day in london maggie hated she scorned to compare hours and appearances to weigh the idea of whether there hadnt been moments during these days when an assignation in easy conditions a snatched interview in an air the season had so cleared of prying eyes mightnt perfectly work but the very reason of this was partly that haunted with the vision of the poor woman carrying off with such bravery as she found to her hand the secret of her not being appeased she was conscious of scant room for any alternative image the alternative image would have been that the secret covered up was the secret of appeasement somehow obtained somehow extorted and cherished and the difference between the two kinds of hiding was too great to permit of a mistake charlotte was hiding neither pride nor joyshe was hiding humiliation and here it was that the princesss passion so powerless for vindictive flights most inveterately bruised its tenderness against the hard glass of her question  behind the glass lurked the whole history of the relation she had so fairly flattened her nose against it to penetratethe glass mrs verver might at this stage have been frantically tapping from within by way of supreme irrepressible entreaty maggie had said to herself complacently after that last passage with her stepmother in the garden of fawns that there was nothing left for her to do and that she could thereupon fold her hands but why wasnt it still left to push further and from the point of view of personal pride grovel lowerwhy wasnt it still left to offer herself as the bearer of a message reporting to him their friends anguish and convincing him of her need  she could thus have translated mrs ververs tap against the glass as i have called it into fifty forms could perhaps have translated it most into the form of a reminder that would pierce deep you dont know what it is to have been loved and broken with you havent been broken with because in your relation what can there have been worth speaking of to break ours was everything a relation could be filled to the brim with the wine of consciousness and if it was to have no meaning no better meaning than that such a creature as you could breathe upon it at your hour for blight why was i myself dealt with all for deception why condemned after a couple of short years to find the golden flameoh the golden flamea mere handful of black ashes our young woman so yielded at moments to what was insidious in these foredoomed ingenuities of her pity that for minutes together sometimes the weight of a new duty seemed to rest upon herthe duty of speaking before separation should constitute its chasm of pleading for some benefit that might be carried away into exile like the last saved object of price of the emigre the jewel wrapped in a piece of old silk and negotiable some day in the market of misery  this imagined service to the woman who could no longer help herself was one of the traps set for maggies spirit at every turn of the road the click of which catching and holding the divine faculty fast was followed inevitably by a flutter by a struggle of wings and even as we may say by a scattering of fine feathers for they promptly enough felt these yearnings of thought and excursions of sympathy the concussion that couldnt bring them downthe arrest produced by the so remarkably distinct figure that at fawns for the previous weeks was constantly crossing in its regular revolution the further end of any watched perspective whoever knew or whoever didnt whether or to what extent charlotte with natural business in eaton square had shuffled other opportunities under that cloak it was all matter for the kind of quiet ponderation the little man who so kept his wandering way had made his own it was part of the very inveteracy of his straw hat and his white waistcoat of the trick of his hands in his pockets of the detachment of the attention he fixed on his slow steps from behind his secure pincenez the thing that never failed now as an item in the picture was that gleam of the silken noose his wifes immaterial tether so marked to maggies sense during her last month in the country mrs ververs straight neck had certainly not slipped it nor had the other end of the long cordoh quite conveniently longdisengaged its smaller loop from the hooked thumb that with his fingers closed upon it her husband kept out of sight to have recognised for all its tenuity the play of this gathered lasso might inevitably be to wonder with what magic it was twisted to what tension subjected but could never be to doubt either of its adequacy to its office or of its perfect durability these reminded states for the princess were in fact states of renewed gaping so many things her father knew that she even yet didnt  all this at present with mrs assingham passed through her in quick vibrations she had expressed while the revolution of her thought was incomplete the idea of what amerigo ought on his side in the premises to be capable of and then had felt her companions answering stare but she insisted on what she had meant he ought to wish to see herand i mean in some protected and independent way as he used toin case of her being herself able to manage it that said maggie with the courage of her conviction he ought to be ready he ought to be happy he ought to feel himself swornlittle as it is for the end of such a historyto take from her its as if he wished to get off without taking anything  mrs assingham deferentially mused but for what purpose is it your idea that they should again so intimately meet  for any purpose they like thats their affair  fanny assingham sharply laughed then irrepressibly fell back to her constant position youre splendidperfectly splendid to which as the princess shaking an impatient head wouldnt have it again at all she subjoined or if youre not its because youre so sure i mean sure of him  ah im exactly not sure of him if i were sure of him i shouldnt doubt but maggie cast about her  doubt what fanny pressed as she waited  well that he must feel how much less than she he paysand how that ought to keep her present to him  this in its turn after an instant mrs assingham could meet with a smile trust him my dear to keep her present but trust him also to keep himself absent leave him his own way  ill leave him everything said maggie onlyyou know its my naturei think  its your nature to think too much fanny assingham a trifle coarsely risked  this but quickened however in the princess the act she reprobated that may be but if i hadnt thought  you wouldnt you mean have been where you are  yes because they on their side thought of everything but that they thought of everything but that i might think  or even her friend too superficially concurred that your father might  as to this at all events maggie discriminated no that wouldnt have prevented them for they knew that his first care would be not to make me do so as it is maggie added that has had to become his last  fanny assingham took it in deeperfor what it immediately made her give out louder hes splendid then she sounded it almost aggressively it was what she was reduced toshe had positively to place it  ah that as much as you please  maggie said this and left it but the tone of it had the next moment determined in her friend a fresh reaction you think both of you so abysmally and yet so quietly but its what will have saved you  oh maggie returned its whatfrom the moment they discovered we could think at allwill have saved them for theyre the ones who are saved she went on were the ones who are lost  lost  lost to each otherfather and i and then as her friend appeared to demur oh yes maggie quite lucidly declared lost to each other much more really than amerigo and charlotte are since for them its just its right its deserved while for us its only sad and strange and not caused by our fault but i dont know she went on why i talk about myself for its on father it really comes i let him go said maggie  you let him but you dont make him  i take it from him she answered  but what else can you do  i take it from him the princess repeated i do what i knew from the first i should do i get off by giving him up  but if he gives you mrs assingham presumed to object doesnt it moreover then she asked complete the very purpose with which he marriedthat of making you and leaving you more free  maggie looked at her long yesi help him to do that  mrs assingham hesitated but at last her bravery flared why not call it then frankly his complete success  well said maggie thats all thats left me to do  its a success her friend ingeniously developed with which youve simply not interfered and as if to show that she spoke without levity mrs assingham went further he has made it a success for them  ah there you are maggie responsively mused yes she said the next moment thats why amerigo stays  let alone its why charlotte goes that mrs assingham and emboldened smiled so he knows  but maggie hung back amerigo after which however she blushedto her companions recognition  your father he knows what you know i mean fanny faltered well how much does he know maggies silence and maggies eyes had in fact arrested the push of the questionwhich for a decent consistency she couldnt yet quite abandon what i should rather say is does he know how much she found it still awkward how much i mean they did how farshe touched it upthey went  maggie had waited but only with a question do you think he does  know at least something oh about him i cant think hes beyond me said fanny assingham  then do you yourself know  how much  how much  how far  how far  fanny had appeared to wish to make sure but there was something she rememberedremembered in time and even with a smile ive told you before that i know absolutely nothing  wellthats what i know said the princess  her friend again hesitated then nobody knows i mean mrs assingham explained how much your father does  oh maggie showed that she understood nobody  nota littlecharlotte  a little the princess echoed to know anything would be for her to know enough  and she doesnt know anything  if she did maggie answered amerigo would  and thats just itthat he doesnt  thats just it said the princess profoundly  on which mrs assingham reflected then how is charlotte so held  just by that  by her ignorance  by her ignorance fanny wondered a torment  a torment said maggie with tears in her eyes  her companion a moment watched them but the prince then  how is he held maggie asked  how is he held  oh i cant tell you that and the princess again broke off                                xli  a telegram in charlottes name arrived earlywe shall come and ask you for tea at five if convenient to you am wiring for the assinghams to lunch this document into which meanings were to be read maggie promptly placed before her husband adding the remark that her father and his wife who would have come up the previous night or that morning had evidently gone to an hotel the prince was in his own room where he often sat now alone halfadozen open newspapers the figaro notably as well as the times were scattered about him but with a cigar in his teeth and a visible cloud on his brow he appeared actually to be engaged in walking to and fro never yet on thus approaching himfor she had done it of late under one necessity or another several timeshad a particular impression so greeted her supremely strong for some reason as he turned quickly round on her entrance the reason was partly the look in his facea suffusion like the flush of fever which brought back to her fanny assinghams charge recently uttered under that roof of her thinking too impenetrably the word had remained with her and made her think still more so that at first as she stood there she felt responsible for provoking on his part an irritation of suspense at which she had not aimed she had been going about him these three months she perfectly knew with a maintained ideaof which she had never spoken to him but what had at last happened was that his way of looking at her on occasion seemed a perception of the presence not of one idea but of fifty variously prepared for uses with which he somehow must reckon she knew herself suddenly almost strangely glad to be coming to him at this hour with nothing more abstract than a telegram but even after she had stepped into his prison under her pretext while her eyes took in his face and then embraced the four walls that enclosed his restlessness she recognised the virtual identity of his condition with that aspect of charlottes situation for which early in the summer and in all the amplitude of a great residence she had found with so little seeking the similitude of the locked cage he struck her as caged the man who couldnt now without an instant effect on her sensibility give an instinctive push to the door she had not completely closed behind her he had been turning twenty ways for impatiences all his own and when she was once shut in with him it was yet again as if she had come to him in his more than monastic cell to offer him light or food there was a difference none the less between his captivity and charlottesthe difference as it might be of his lurking there by his own act and his own choice the admission of which had indeed virtually been in his starting on her entrance as if even this were in its degree an interference that was what betrayed for her practically his fear of her fifty ideas and what had begun after a minute to make her wish to repudiate or explain it was more wonderful than she could have told it was for all the world as if she was succeeding with him beyond her intention she had for these instants the sense that he exaggerated that the imputation of purpose had fairly risen too high in him she had begun a year ago by asking herself how she could make him think more of her but what was it after all he was thinking now he kept his eyes on her telegram he read it more than once easy as it was in spite of its conveyed deprecation to understand during which she found herself almost awestruck with yearning almost on the point of marking somehow what she had marked in the garden at fawns with charlottethat she had truly come unarmed she didnt bristle with intentionsshe scarce knew as he at this juncture affected her what had become of the only intention she had come with she had nothing but her old idea the old one he knew she hadnt the ghost of another presently in fact when four or five minutes had elapsed it was as if she positively hadnt so much even as that one he gave her back her paper asking with it if there were anything in particular she wished him to do  she stood there with her eyes on him doubling the telegram together as if it had been a precious thing and yet all the while holding her breath of a sudden somehow and quite as by the action of their merely having between them these few written words an extraordinary fact came up he was with her as if he were hers hers in a degree and on a scale with an intensity and an intimacy that were a new and a strange quantity that were like the irruption of a tide loosening them where they had stuck and making them feel they floated what was it that with the rush of this just kept her from putting out her hands to him from catching at him as in the other time with the superficial impetus he and charlotte had privately conspired to impart she had so often her breath failing her known the impulse to catch at her father she did however just yet nothing inconsequent though she couldnt immediately have said what saved her and by the time she had neatly folded her telegram she was doing something merely needful i wanted you simply to knowso that you maynt by accident miss them for its the last said maggie  the last  i take it as their goodbye and she smiled as she could always smile they come in stateto take formal leave they do everything thats proper tomorrow she said they go to southampton  if they do everything thats proper the prince presently asked why dont they at least come to dine  she hesitated yet she lightly enough provided her answer that we must certainly ask them it will be easy for you but of course theyre immensely taken  he wondered so immensely taken that they cantthat your father cantgive you his last evening in england  this for maggie was more difficult to meet yet she was still not without her stopgap that may be what theyll proposethat we shall go somewhere together the four of us for a celebrationexcept that to round it thoroughly off we ought also to have fanny and the colonel they dont want them at tea she quite sufficiently expresses they polish them off poor dears they get rid of them beforehand they want only us together and if they cut us down to tea she continued as they cut fanny and the colonel down to luncheon perhaps its for the fancy after all of their keeping their last night in london for each other  she said these things as they came to her she was unable to keep them back even though as she heard herself she might have been throwing everything to the winds but wasnt that the right way for sharing his last day of captivity with the man one adored it was every moment more and more for her as if she were waiting with him in his prisonwaiting with some gleam of remembrance of how noble captives in the french revolution the darkness of the terror used to make a feast or a high discourse of their last poor resources if she had broken with everything now every observance of all the past months she must simply then take it sotake it that what she had worked for was too near at last to let her keep her head she might have been losing her head verily in her husbands eyessince he didnt know all the while that the sudden freedom of her words was but the diverted intensity of her disposition personally to seize him he didnt know either that this was her mannernow she was with himof beguiling audaciously the supremacy of suspense for the people of the french revolution assuredly there wasnt suspense the scaffold for those she was thinking of was certainwhereas what charlottes telegram announced was short of some incalculable error clear liberation just the point however was in its being clearer to herself than to him her clearnesses clearancesthose she had so all but abjectly laboured for threatened to crowd upon her in the form of one of the clusters of angelic heads the peopled shafts of light beating down through iron bars that regale on occasion precisely the fevered vision of those who are in chains she was going to know she felt later onwas going to know with compunction doubtless on the very morrow how thumpingly her heart had beaten at this foretaste of their being left together she should judge at leisure the surrender she was making to the consciousness of complications about to be bodily lifted she should judge at leisure even that avidity for an issue which was making so little of any complication but the unextinguished presence of the others and indeed that she was already simplifying so much more than her husband came out for her next in the face with which he listened he might certainly well be puzzled in respect to his fatherinlaw and mrs verver by her glance at their possible preference for a concentrated evening but it isntis it he askedas if they were leaving each other  oh no it isnt as if they were leaving each other theyre only bringing to a closewithout knowing when it may open againa time that has been naturally awfully interesting to them yes she could talk so of their timeshe was somehow sustained she was sustained even to affirm more intensely her present possession of her ground they have their reasonsmany things to think of how can one tell but theres always also the chance of his proposing to me that we shall have our last hours together i mean that he and i shall he may wish to take me off to dine with him somewhere aloneand to do it in memory of old days i mean the princess went on the real old days before my grand husband was invented and much more before his grand wife was the wonderful times of his first great interest in what he has since done his first great plans and opportunities discoveries and bargains the way weve sat together late ever so late in foreign restaurants which he used to like the way that in every city in europe weve stayed on and on with our elbows on the table and most of the lights put out to talk over things he had that day seen or heard of or made his offer for the things he had secured or refused or lost there were places he took me toyou wouldnt believefor often he could only have left me with servants if he should carry me off with him tonight for old sakes sake to the earls court exhibition it will be a littlejust a very very littlelike our young adventures after which while amerigo watched her and in fact quite because of it she had an inspiration to which she presently yielded if he was wondering what she would say next she had found exactly the thing in that case he will leave you charlotte to take care of in our absence youll have to carry her off somewhere for your last evening unless you may prefer to spend it with her here i shall then see that you dine that you have everything quite beautifully youll be able to do as you like  she couldnt have been sure beforehand and had really not been but the most immediate result of this speech was his letting her see that he took it for no cheap extravagance either of irony or of oblivion nothing in the world of a truth had ever been so sweet to her as his look of trying to be serious enough to make no mistake about it she troubled himwhich hadnt been at all her purpose she mystified himwhich she couldnt help and comparatively didnt mind then it came over her that he had after all a simplicity very considerable on which she had never dared to presume it was a discoverynot like the other discovery she had once made but giving out a freshness and she recognised again in the light of it the number of the ideas of which he thought her capable they were all apparently queer for him but she had at least with the lapse of the months created the perception that there might be something in them whereby he stared there beautiful and sombre at what she was at present providing him with there was something of his own in his mind to which she was sure he referred everything for a measure and a meaning he had never let go of it from the evening weeks before when in her room after his encounter with the bloomsbury cup she had planted it there by flinging it at him on the question of her fathers view of him her determined find out for yourself she had been aware during the months that he had been trying to find out and had been seeking above all to avoid the appearance of any evasions of such a form of knowledge as might reach him with violence or with a penetration more insidious from any other source nothing however had reached him nothing he could at all conveniently reckon with had disengaged itself for him even from the announcement sufficiently sudden of the final secession of their companions charlotte was in pain charlotte was in torment but he himself had given her reason enough for that and in respect to the rest of the whole matter of her obligation to follow her husband that personage and she maggie had so shuffled away every link between consequence and cause that the intention remained like some famous poetic line in a dead language subject to varieties of interpretation what renewed the obscurity was her strange image of their common offer to him her fathers and her own of an opportunity to separate from mrs verver with the due amount of formand all the more that he was in so pathetic a way unable to treat himself to a quarrel with it on the score of taste taste in him as a touchstone was now all at sea for who could say but that one of her fifty ideas or perhaps fortynine of them wouldnt be exactly that taste by itself the taste he had always conformed to had no importance whatever if meanwhile at all events he felt her as serious this made the greater reason for her profiting by it as she perhaps might never be able to profit again she was invoking that reflection at the very moment he brought out in reply to her last words a remark which though perfectly relevant and perfectly just affected her at first as a high oddity theyre doing the wisest thing you know for if they were ever to go and he looked down at her over his cigar  if they were ever to go in short it was high time with her fathers age charlottes need of initiation and the general magnitude of the job of their getting settled and seasoned their learning to live into their queer futureit was high time that they should take up their courage this was eminent sense but it didnt arrest the princess who the next moment had found a form for her challenge but shant you then so much as miss her a little shes wonderful and beautiful and i feel somehow as if she were dying not really not physically maggie went on shes so far naturally splendid as she is from having done with life but dying for usfor you and me and making us feel it by the very fact of there being so much of her left  the prince smoked hard a minute as you say shes splendid but there isthere always will bemuch of her left only as you also say for others  and yet i think the princess returned that it isnt as if we had wholly done with her how can we not always think of her its as if her unhappiness had been necessary to usas if we had needed her at her own cost to build us up and start us  he took it in with consideration but he met it with a lucid inquiry why do you speak of the unhappiness of your fathers wife  they exchanged a long lookthe time that it took her to find her reply because not to  well not to  would make me have to speak of him and i cant said maggie speak of him  you cant  i cant she said it as for definite notice not to be repeated there are too many things she nevertheless added hes too great  the prince looked at his cigartip and then as he put back the weed too great for whom upon which as she hesitated not my dear too great for you he declared for meoh as much as you like  too great for me is what i mean i know why i think it maggie said thats enough  he looked at her yet again as if she but fanned his wonder he was on the very point she judged of asking her why she thought it but her own eyes maintained their warning and at the end of a minute he had uttered other words whats of importance is that youre his daughter that at least weve got and i suppose that if i may say nothing else i may say at least that i value it  oh yes you may say that you value it i myself make the most of it  this again he took in letting it presently put forth for him a striking connection she ought to have known you thats whats present to me she ought to have understood you better  better than you did  yes he gravely maintained better than i did and she didnt really know you at all she doesnt know you now  ah yes she does said maggie  but he shook his headhe knew what he meant she not only doesnt understand you more than i she understands you ever so much less though even i  well even you maggie pressed as he paused even i even i even yet again he paused and the silence held them  but maggie at last broke it if charlotte doesnt understand me it is that ive prevented her ive chosen to deceive her and to lie to her  the prince kept his eyes on her i know what youve chosen to do but ive chosen to do the same  yes said maggie after an instantmy choice was made when i had guessed yours but you mean she asked that she understands you  it presents small difficulty  are you so sure maggie went on  sure enough but it doesnt matter he waited an instant then looking up through the fumes of his smoke shes stupid he abruptly opined  ooh maggie protested in a long wail  it had made him in fact quickly change colour what i mean is that shes not as you pronounce her unhappy and he recovered with this all his logic why is she unhappy if she doesnt know  doesnt know she tried to make his logic difficult  doesnt know that you know  it came from him in such a way that she was conscious instantly of three or four things to answer but what she said first was do you think thats all it need take and before he could reply she knows she knows maggie proclaimed  well then what  but she threw back her head she turned impatiently away from him oh i neednt tell you she knows enough besides she went on she doesnt believe us  it made the prince stare a little ah she asks too much that drew however from his wife another moan of objection which determined in him a judgment she wont let you take her for unhappy  oh i know better than any one else what she wont let me take her for  very well said amerigo youll see  i shall see wonders i know ive already seen them and im prepared for them maggie recalledshe had memories enough its terribleher memories prompted her to speak i see its always terrible for women  the prince looked down in his gravity everythings terrible cara in the heart of man shes making her life he said shell make it  his wife turned back upon him she had wandered to a table vaguely setting objects straight a little by the way then too while shes about it shes making ours at this he raised his eyes which met her own and she held him while she delivered herself of some thing that had been with her these last minutes  you spoke just now of charlottes not having learned from you that i know am i to take from you then that you accept and recognise my knowledge  he did the inquiry all the honoursvisibly weighed its importance and weighed his response you think i might have been showing you that a little more handsomely  it isnt a question of any beauty said maggie its only a question of the quantity of truth  oh the quantity of truth the prince richly though ambiguously murmured  thats a thing by itself yes but there are also such things all the same as questions of good faith  of course there are the prince hastened to reply after which he brought up more slowly if ever a man since the beginning of time acted in good faith but he dropped it offering it simply for that  for that then when it had had time somewhat to settle like some handful of golddust thrown into the airfor that then maggie showed herself as deeply and strangely taking it i see and she even wished this form to be as complete as she could make it i see  the completeness clearly after an instant had struck him as divine ah my dear my dear my dear it was all he could say  she wasnt talking however at large youve kept up for so long a silence  yes yes i know what ive kept up but will you do he asked still one thing more for me  it was as if for an instant with her new exposure it had made her turn pale is there even one thing left  ah my dear my dear my dearit had pressed again in him the fine spring of the unspeakable there was nothing however that the princess herself couldnt say ill do anything if youll tell me what  then wait and his raised italian hand with its play of admonitory fingers had never made gesture more expressive his voice itself dropped to a tone wait he repeated wait  she understood but it was as if she wished to have it from him till theyve been here you mean  yes till theyve gone till theyre away  she kept it up till theyve left the country she had her eyes on him for clearness these were the conditions of a promiseso that he put the promise practically into his response till weve ceased to see themfor as long as god may grant till were really alone  oh if its only that when she had drawn from him thus then as she could feel the thick breath of the definitewhich was the intimate the immediate the familiar as she hadnt had them for so longshe turned away again she put her hand on the knob of the door but her hand rested at first without a grasp she had another effort to make the effort of leaving him of which everything that had just passed between them his presence irresistible overcharged with it doubled the difficulty there was somethingshe couldnt have told what it was as if shut in together they had come too fartoo far for where they were so that the mere act of her quitting him was like the attempt to recover the lost and gone she had taken in with her something that within the ten minutes and especially within the last three or four had slipped away from herwhich it was vain now wasnt it to try to appear to clutch or to pick up that consciousness in fact had a pang and she balanced intensely for the lingering moment almost with a terror of her endless power of surrender he had only to press really for her to yield inch by inch and she fairly knew at present while she looked at him through her cloud that the confession of this precious secret sat there for him to pluck the sensation for the few seconds was extraordinary her weakness her desire so long as she was yet not saving herself flowered in her face like a light or a darkness she sought for some word that would cover this up she reverted to the question of tea speaking as if they shouldnt meet sooner then about five i count on you  on him too however something had descended as to which this exactly gave him his chance ah but i shall see you no he said coming nearer  she had with her hand still on the knob her back against the door so that her retreat under his approach must be less than a step and yet she couldnt for her life with the other hand have pushed him away he was so near now that she could touch him taste him smell him kiss him hold him he almost pressed upon her and the warmth of his facefrowning smiling she mightnt know which only beautiful and strangewas bent upon her with the largeness with which objects loom in dreams she closed her eyes to it and so the next instant against her purpose she had put out her hand which had met his own and which he held then it was that from behind her closed eyes the right word came wait it was the word of his own distress and entreaty the word for both of them all they had left their plank now on the great sea their hands were locked and thus she said it again wait wait she kept her eyes shut but her hand she knew helped her meaningwhich after a minute she was aware his own had absorbed he let her gohe turned away with this message and when she saw him again his back was presented as he had left her and his face staring out of the window she had saved herself and she got off                                xlii  later on in the afternoon before the others arrived the form of their reunion was at least remarkable they might in their great eastward drawingroom have been comparing notes or nerves in apprehension of some stiff official visit maggies mind in its restlessness even played a little with the prospect the high cool room with its afternoon shade with its old tapestries uncovered with the perfect polish of its wide floor reflecting the bowls of gathered flowers and the silver and linen of the prepared teatable drew from her a remark in which this whole effect was mirrored as well as something else in the princes movement while he slowly paced and turned were distinctly bourgeois she a trifle grimly threw off as an echo of their old community though to a spectator sufficiently detached they might have been quite the privileged pair they were reputed granted only they were taken as awaiting the visit of royalty they might have been ready on the word passed up in advance to repair together to the foot of the staircasethe prince somewhat in front advancing indeed to the open doors and even going down for all his princedom to meet on the stopping of the chariot the august emergence the time was stale it was to be admitted for incidents of magnitude the september hush was in full possession at the end of the dull day and a couple of the long windows stood open to the balcony that overhung the desolation the balcony from which maggie in the springtime had seen amerigo and charlotte look down together at the hour of her return from the regents park near by with her father the principino and miss bogle amerigo now again in his punctual impatience went out a couple of times and stood there after which as to report that nothing was in sight he returned to the room with frankly nothing else to do the princess pretended to read he looked at her as he passed there hovered in her own sense the thought of other occasions when she had cheated appearances of agitation with a book at last she felt him standing before her and then she raised her eyes  do you remember how this morning when you told me of this event i asked you if there were anything particular you wished me to do you spoke of my being at home but that was a matter of course you spoke of something else he went on while she sat with her book on her knee and her raised eyes something that makes me almost wish it may happen you spoke he said of the possibility of my seeing her alone do you know if that comes he asked the use i shall make of it and then as she waited the use is all before me  ah its your own business now said his wife but it had made her rise  i shall make it my own he answered i shall tell her i lied to her  ah no she returned  and i shall tell her you did  she shook her head again oh still less  with which therefore they stood at difference he with his head erect and his happy idea perched in its eagerness on his crest and how then is she to know  she isnt to know  shes only still to think you dont  and therefore that im always a fool she may think said maggie what she likes  think it without my protest  the princess made a movement what business is it of yours  isnt it my right to correct her  maggie let his question ringring long enough for him to hear it himself only then she took it up correct herand it was her own now that really rang arent you rather forgetting who she is after which while he quite stared for it as it was the very first clear majesty he had known her to use she flung down her book and raised a warning hand the carriage come  the come had matched for lucid firmness the rest of her speech and when they were below in the hall there was a go for him through the open doors and between the ranged servants that matched even that he received royalty bareheaded therefore in the persons of mr and mrs verver as it alighted on the pavement and maggie was at the threshold to welcome it to her house later on upstairs again she even herself felt still more the force of the limit of which she had just reminded him at tea in charlottes affirmed presenceas charlotte affirmed itshe drew a long breath of richer relief it was the strangest once more of all impressions but what she most felt for the halfhour was that mr and mrs verver were making the occasion easy they were somehow conjoined in it conjoined for a present effect as maggie had absolutely never yet seen them and there occurred before long a moment in which amerigos look met her own in recognitions that he couldnt suppress the question of the amount of correction to which charlotte had laid herself open rose and hovered for the instant only to sink conspicuously by its own weight so high a pitch she seemed to give to the unconsciousness of questions so resplendent a show of serenity she succeeded in making the shade of the official in her beauty and security never for a moment dropped it was a cool high refuge like the deep arched recess of some coloured and gilded image in which she sat and smiled and waited drank her tea referred to her husband and remembered her mission her mission had quite taken formit was but another name for the interest of her great opportunitythat of representing the arts and the graces to a people languishing afar off in ignorance maggie had sufficiently intimated to the prince ten minutes before that she needed no showing as to what their friend wouldnt consent to be taken for but the difficulty now indeed was to choose for explicit tribute of admiration between the varieties of her nobler aspects she carried it off to put the matter coarsely with a taste and a discretion that held our young womans attention for the first quarterofanhour to the very point of diverting it from the attitude of her overshadowed her almost superseded companion but adam verver profited indeed at this time even with his daughter by his so marked peculiarity of seeming on no occasion to have an attitude and so long as they were in the room together she felt him still simply weave his web and play out his long fine cord knew herself in presence of this tacit process very much as she had known herself at fawns he had a way the dear man wherever he was of moving about the room noiselessly to see what it might contain and his manner of now resorting to this habit acquainted as he already was with the objects in view expressed with a certain sharpness the intention of leaving his wife to her devices it did even more than this it signified to the apprehension of the princess from the moment she more directly took thought of him almost a special view of these devices as actually exhibited in their rarity together with an independent a settled appreciation of their general handsome adequacy which scarcely required the accompaniment of his faint contemplative hum  charlotte throned as who should say between her hostess and her host the whole scene having crystallised as soon as she took her place to the right quiet lustre the harmony was not less sustained for being superficial and the only approach to a break in it was while amerigo remained standing long enough for his fatherinlaw vaguely wondering to appeal to him invite or address him and then in default of any such word selected for presentation to the other visitor a plate of petits fours maggie watched her husbandif it now could be called watchingoffer this refreshment she noted the consummate wayfor consummate was the term she privately appliedin which charlotte cleared her acceptance cleared her impersonal smile of any betrayal any slightest value of consciousness and then felt the slow surge of a vision that at the end of another minute or two had floated her across the room to where her father stood looking at a picture an early florentine sacred subject that he had given her on her marriage he might have been in silence taking his last leave of it it was a work for which he entertained she knew an unqualified esteem the tenderness represented for her by his sacrifice of such a treasure had become to her sense a part of the whole infusion of the immortal expression the beauty of his sentiment looked out at her always from the beauty of the rest as if the frame made positively a window for his spiritual face she might have said to herself at this moment that in leaving the thing behind him held as in her clasping arms he was doing the most possible toward leaving her a part of his palpable self she put her hand over his shoulder and their eyes were held again together by the abiding felicity they smiled in emulation vaguely as if speech failed them through their having passed too far she would have begun to wonder the next minute if it were reserved to them for the last stage to find their contact like that of old friends reunited too much on the theory of the unchanged subject to shy lapses  its all right eh  oh my dearrather  he had applied the question to the great fact of the picture as she had spoken for the picture in reply but it was as if their words for an instant afterwards symbolised another truth so that they looked about at everything else to give them this extension she had passed her arm into his and the other objects in the room the other pictures the sofas the chairs the tables the cabinets the important pieces supreme in their way stood out round them consciously for recognition and applause their eyes moved together from piece to piece taking in the whole noblenessquite as if for him to measure the wisdom of old ideas the two noble persons seated in conversation at tea fell thus into the splendid effect and the general harmony mrs verver and the prince fairly placed themselves however unwittingly as high expressions of the kind of human furniture required esthetically by such a scene the fusion of their presence with the decorative elements their contribution to the triumph of selection was complete and admirable though to a lingering view a view more penetrating than the occasion really demanded they also might have figured as concrete attestations of a rare power of purchase there was much indeed in the tone in which adam verver spoke again and who shall say where his thought stopped le compte y est youve got some good things  maggie met it afreshah dont they look well their companions at the sound of this gave them in a spacious intermission of slow talk an attention all of gravity that was like an ampler submission to the general duty of magnificence sitting as still to be thus appraised as a pair of effigies of the contemporary great on one of the platforms of madame tussaud im so gladfor your last look  with which after maggiequite in the airhad said it the note was struck indeed the note of that strange accepted finality of relation as from couple to couple which almost escaped an awkwardness only by not attempting a gloss yes this was the wonder that the occasion defied insistence precisely because of the vast quantities with which it dealtso that separation was on a scale beyond any compass of parting to do such an hour justice would have been in some degree to question its grounds which was why they remained in fine the four of them in the upper air united in the firmest abstention from pressure there was no point visibly at which face to face either amerigo or charlotte had pressed and how little she herself was in danger of doing so maggie scarce needed to remember that her father wouldnt by the tip of a toeof that she was equally conscious the only thing was that since he didnt she could but hold her breath for what he would do instead when at the end of three minutes more he had said with an effect of suddenness well magand the principino it was quite as if that were by contrast the hard the truer voice  she glanced at the clock i ordered him for halfpast five which hasnt yet struck trust him my dear not to fail you  oh i dont want him to fail me was mr ververs reply yet uttered in so explicitly jocose a relation to the possibilities of failure that even when just afterwards he wandered in his impatience to one of the long windows and passed out to the balcony she asked herself but for a few seconds if reality should she follow him would overtake or meet her there she followed him of necessityit came absolutely so near to his inviting her by stepping off into temporary detachment to give the others something of the chance that she and her husband had so fantastically discussed beside him then while they hung over the great dull place clear and almost coloured now coloured with the odd sad pictured oldfashioned look that empty london streets take on in waning afternoons of the summers end she felt once more how impossible such a passage would have been to them how it would have torn them to pieces if they had so much as suffered its suppressed relations to peep out of their eyes this danger would doubtless indeed have been more to be reckoned with if the instinct of eachshe could certainly at least answer for her ownhad not so successfully acted to trump up other apparent connexions for it connexions as to which they could pretend to be frank  you mustnt stay on here you know adam verver said as a result of his unobstructed outlook fawns is all there for you of courseto the end of my tenure but fawns so dismantled he added with mild ruefulness fawns with half its contents and half its best things removed wont seem to you im afraid particularly lively  no maggie answered we should miss its best things its best things my dear have certainly been removed to be back there she went on to be back there and she paused for the force of her idea  oh to be back there without anything good but she didnt hesitate now she brought her idea forth to be back there without charlotte is more than i think would do and as she smiled at him with it so she saw him the next instant take it take it in a way that helped her smile to pass all for an allusion to what she didnt and couldnt say this quantity was too clearthat she couldnt at such an hour be pretending to name to him what it was as he would have said going to be at fawns or anywhere else to want for him that was nowand in a manner exaltedly sublimelyout of their compass and their question so that what was she doing while they waited for the principino while they left the others together and their tension just sensibly threatened what was she doing but just offer a bold but substantial substitute nothing was stranger moreover under the action of charlottes presence than the fact of a felt sincerity in her words she felt her sincerity absolutely sound she gave it for all it might mean because charlotte dear you know she said is incomparable it took thirty seconds but she was to know when these were over that she had pronounced one of the happiest words of her life they had turned from the view of the street they leaned together against the balcony rail with the room largely in sight from where they stood but with the prince and mrs verver out of range nothing he could try she immediately saw was to keep his eyes from lighting not even his taking out his cigarettecase and saying before he said anything else may i smoke she met it for encouragement with her my dear again and then while he struck his match she had just another minute to be nervousa minute that she made use of however not in the least to falter but to reiterate with a high ring a ring that might for all she cared reach the pair inside father fathercharlottes great  it was not till after he had begun to smoke that he looked at her charlottes great  they could close upon itsuch a basis as they might immediately feel it make and so they stood together over it quite gratefully each recording to the others eyes that it was firm under their feet they had even thus a renewed wait as for proof of it much as if he were letting her see while the minutes lapsed for their concealed companions that this was finally just whybut just why you see he presently added how right i was right i mean to do it for you  ah rather she murmured with her smile and then as to be herself ideally right i dont see what you would have done without her  the point was he returned quietly that i didnt see what you were to do yet it was a risk  it was a risk said maggiebut i believed in it at least for myself she smiled  well now he smoked we see  we see  i know her better  you know her best  oh but naturally on which as the warranted truth of it hung in the airthe truth warranted as who should say exactly by the present opportunity to pronounce this opportunity created and acceptedshe found herself lost though with a finer thrill than she had perhaps yet known in the vision of all he might mean the sense of it in her rose higher rose with each moment that he invited her thus to see him linger and when after a little more he had said smoking again and looking up with head thrown back and hands spread on the balcony rail at the grey gaunt front of the house shes beautiful beautiful her sensibility reported to her the shade of a new note it was all she might have wished for it was with a kind of speaking competence the note of possession and control and yet it conveyed to her as nothing till now had done the reality of their parting they were parting in the light of it absolutely on charlottes valuethe value that was filling the room out of which they had stepped as if to give it play and with which the prince on his side was perhaps making larger acquaintance if maggie had desired at so late an hour some last conclusive comfortable category to place him in for dismissal she might have found it here in its all coming back to his ability to rest upon high values somehow when all was said and with the memory of her gifts her variety her power so much remained of charlottes what else had she herself meant three minutes before by speaking of her as great great for the world that was before herthat he proposed she should be she was not to be wasted in the application of his plan maggie held to this thenthat she wasnt to be wasted to let his daughter know it he had sought this brief privacy what a blessing accordingly that she could speak her joy in it his face meanwhile at all events was turned to her and as she met his eyes again her joy went straight its success father  its success and even this he added as the principino appearing alone deep within piped across an instant greeting even this isnt altogether failure  they went in to receive the boy upon whose introduction to the room by miss bogle charlotte and the prince got upseemingly with an impressiveness that had caused miss bogle not to give further effect to her own entrance she had retired but the principinos presence by itself sufficiently broke the tensionthe subsidence of which in the great room ten minutes later gave to the air something of the quality produced by the cessation of a sustained rattle stillness when the prince and princess returned from attending the visitors to their carriage might have been said to be not so much restored as created so that whatever next took place in it was foredoomed to remarkable salience that would have been the case even with so natural though so futile a movement as maggies going out to the balcony again to follow with her eyes her fathers departure the carriage was out of sightit had taken her too long solemnly to reascend and she looked awhile only at the great grey space on which as on the room still more the shadow of dusk had fallen here at first her husband had not rejoined her he had come up with the boy who clutching his hand abounded as usual in remarks worthy of the family archives but the two appeared then to have proceeded to report to miss bogle it meant something for the princess that her husband had thus got their son out of the way not bringing him back to his mother but everything now as she vaguely moved about struck her as meaning so much that the unheard chorus swelled yet this above allher just being there as she was and waiting for him to come in their freedom to be together there alwayswas the meaning most disengaged she stood in the cool twilight and took in all about her where it lurked her reason for what she had done she knew at last really why and how she had been inspired and guided how she had been persistently able how to her soul all the while it had been for the sake of this end here it was then the moment the golden fruit that had shone from afar only what were these things in the fact for the hand and for the lips when tested when tastedwhat were they as a reward closer than she had ever been to the measure of her course and the full face of her act she had an instant of the terror that when there has been suspense always precedes on the part of the creature to be paid the certification of the amount amerigo knew it the amount he still held it and the delay in his return making her heart beat too fast to go on was like a sudden blinding light on a wild speculation she had thrown the dice but his hand was over her cast  he opened the door however at lasthe hadnt been away ten minutes and then with her sight of him renewed to intensity she seemed to have a view of the number his presence alone as he paused to look at her somehow made it the highest and even before he had spoken she had begun to be paid in full with that consciousness in fact an extraordinary thing occurred the assurance of her safety so making her terror drop that already within the minute it had been changed to concern for his own anxiety for everything that was deep in his being and everything that was fair in his face so far as seeing that she was paid went he might have been holding out the moneybag for her to come and take it but what instantly rose for her between the act and her acceptance was the sense that she must strike him as waiting for a confession this in turn charged her with a new horror if that was her proper payment she would go without money his acknowledgment hung there too monstrously at the expense of charlotte before whose mastery of the greater style she had just been standing dazzled all she now knew accordingly was that she should be ashamed to listen to the uttered word all that is but that she might dispose of it on the spot forever  isnt she too splendid she simply said offering it to explain and to finish  oh splendid with which he came over to her  thats our help you see she addedto point further her moral  it kept him before her therefore taking inor trying towhat she so wonderfully gave he tried too clearly to please herto meet her in her own way but with the result only that close to her her face kept before him his hands holding her shoulders his whole act enclosing her he presently echoed see i see nothing but you and the truth of it had with this force after a moment so strangely lighted his eyes that as for pity and dread of them she buried her own in his breast
