receive your letter of the 17th of november last in which with some exceptions you are pleased to consider favorably the letter i have written on the affairs of france i shall ever accept any mark of approbation attended with instruction with more pleasure than general and unqualified praises the latter can serve only to flatter our vanity the former whilst it encourages us to proceed may help to improve us in our progress  some of the errors you point out to me in my printed letter are really such one only i find to be material it is corrected in the edition which i take the liberty of sending to you as to the cavils which may be made on some part of my remarks with regard to the gradations in your new constitution you observe justly that they do not affect the substance of my objections whether there be a round more or less in the ladder of representation by which your workmen ascend from their parochial tyranny to their federal anarchy when the whole scale is false appears to me of little or no importance  i published my thoughts on that constitution that my countrymen might be enabled to estimate the wisdom of the plans which were held out to their imitation i conceived that the true character of those plans would be best collected from the committee appointed to prepare them i thought that the scheme of their building would be better comprehended in the design of the architects than in the execution of the masons it was not worth my readers while to occupy himself with the alterations by which bungling practice corrects absurd theory such an investigation would be endless because every days past experience of impracticability has driven and every days future experience will drive those men to new devices as exceptionable as the old and which are no otherwise worthy of observation than as they give a daily proof of the delusion of their promises and the falsehood of their professions had i followed all these changes my letter would have been only a gazette of their wanderings a journal of their march from error to error through a dry dreary desert unguided by the lights of heaven or by the contrivance which wisdom has invented to supply their place  i am unalterably persuaded that the attempt to oppress degrade impoverish confiscate and extinguish the original gentlemen and landed property of a whole nation cannot be justified under any form it may assume i am satisfied beyond a doubt that the project of turning a great empire into a vestry or into a collection of vestries and of governing it in the spirit of a parochial administration is senseless and absurd in any mode or with any qualifications i can never be convinced that the scheme of placing the highest powers of the state in churchwardens and constables and other such officers guided by the prudence of litigious attorneys and jew brokers and set in action by shameless women of the lowest condition by keepers of hotels taverns and brothels by pert apprentices by clerks shopboys hairdressers fiddlers and dancers on the stage who in such a commonwealth as yours will in future overbear as already they have overborne the sober incapacity of dull uninstructed men of useful but laborious occupations can never be put into any shape that must not be both disgraceful and destructive the whole of this project even if it were what it pretends to be and was not in reality the dominion through that disgraceful medium of half a dozen or perhaps fewer intriguing politicians is so mean so lowminded so stupid a contrivance in point of wisdom as well as so perfectly detestable for its wickedness that i must always consider the correctives which might make it in any degree practicable to be so many new objections to it  in that wretched state of things some are afraid that the authors of your miseries may be led to precipitate their further designs by the hints they may receive from the very arguments used to expose the absurdity of their system to mark the incongruity of its parts and its inconsistency with their own principlesand that your masters may be led to render their schemes more consistent by rendering them more mischievous excuse the liberty which your indulgence authorizes me to take when i observe to you that such apprehensions as these would prevent all exertion of our faculties in this great cause of mankind  a rash recourse to force is not to be justified in a state of real weakness such attempts bring on disgrace and in their failure discountenance and discourage more rational endeavors but reason is to be hazarded though it may be perverted by craft and sophistry for reason can suffer no loss nor shame nor can it impede any useful plan of future policy in the unavoidable uncertainty as to the effect which attends on every measure of human prudence nothing seems a surer antidote to the poison of fraud than its detection it is true the fraud may be swallowed after this discovery and perhaps even swallowed the more greedily for being a detected fraud men sometimes make a point of honor not to be disabused and they had rather fall into an hundred errors than confess one but after all when neither our principles nor our dispositions nor perhaps our talents enable us to encounter delusion with delusion we must use our best reason to those that ought to be reasonable creatures and to take our chance for the event we cannot act on these anomalies in the minds of men i do not conceive that the persons who have contrived these things can be made much the better or the worse for anything which can be said to them they are reasonproof here and there some men who were at first carried away by wild good intentions may be led when their first fervors are abated to join in a sober survey of the schemes into which they had been deluded to those only and i am sorry to say they are not likely to make a large description we apply with any hope i may speak it upon an assurance almost approaching to absolute knowledge that nothing has been done that has not been contrived from the beginning even before the states had assembled nulla nova mihi res inopinave surgit they are the same men and the same designs that they were from the first though varied in their appearance it was the very same animal that at first crawled about in the shape of a caterpillar that you now see rise into the air and expand his wings to the sun  proceeding therefore as we are obliged to proceedthat is upon an hypothesis that we address rational mencan false political principles be more effectually exposed than by demonstrating that they lead to consequences directly inconsistent with and subversive of the arrangements grounded upon them if this kind of demonstration is not permitted the process of reasoning called deductio ad absurdum which even the severity of geometry does not reject could not be employed at all in legislative discussions one of our strongest weapons against folly acting with authority would be lost  you know sir that even the virtuous efforts of your patriots to prevent the ruin of your country have had this very turn given to them it has been said here and in france too that the reigning usurpers would not have carried their tyranny to such destructive lengths if they had not been stimulated and provoked to it by the acrimony of your opposition there is a dilemma to which every opposition to successful iniquity must in the nature of things be liable if you lie still you are considered as an accomplice in the measures in which you silently acquiesce if you resist you are accused of provoking irritable power to new excesses the conduct of a losing party never appears right at least it never can possess the only infallible criterion of wisdom to vulgar judgmentssuccess  the indulgence of a sort of undefined hope an obscure confidence that some lurking remains of virtue some degree of shame might exist in the breasts of the oppressors of france has been among the causes which have helped to bring on the common ruin of king and people there is no safety for honest men but by believing all possible evil of evil men and by acting with promptitude decision and steadiness on that belief i well remember at every epocha of this wonderful history in every scene of this tragic business that when your sophistic usurpers were laying down mischievous principles and even applying them in direct resolutions it was the fashion to say that they never intended to execute those declarations in their rigor this made men careless in their opposition and remiss in early precaution by holding out this fallacious hope the impostors deluded sometimes one description of men and sometimes another so that no means of resistance were provided against them when they came to execute in cruelty what they had planned in fraud  there are cases in which a man would be ashamed not to have been imposed on there is a confidence necessary to human intercourse and without which men are often more injured by their own suspicions than they would be by the perfidy of others but when men whom we know to be wicked impose upon us we are something worse than dupes when we know them their fair pretences become new motives for distrust there is one case indeed in which it would be madness not to give the fullest credit to the most deceitful of menthat is when they make declarations of hostility against us  i find that some persons entertain other hopes which i confess appear more specious than those by which at first so many were deluded and disarmed they flatter themselves that the extreme misery brought upon the people by their folly will at last open the eyes of the multitude if not of their leaders much the contrary i fear as to the leaders in this system of impostureyou know that cheats and deceivers never can repent the fraudulent have no resource but in fraud they have no other goods in their magazine they have no virtue or wisdom in their minds to which in a disappointment concerning the profitable effects of fraud and cunning they can retreat the wearing out of an old serves only to put them upon the invention of a new delusion unluckily too the credulity of dupes is as inexhaustible as the invention of knaves they never give people possession but they always keep them in hope your state doctors do not so much as pretend that any good whatsoever has hitherto been derived from their operations or that the public has prospered in any one instance under their management the nation is sick very sick by their medicines but the charlatan tells them that what is past cannot be helpedthey have taken the draught and they must wait its operation with patiencethat the first effects indeed are unpleasant but that the very sickness is a proof that the dose is of no sluggish operationthat sickness is inevitable in all constitutional revolutionsthat the body must pass through pain to easethat the prescriber is not an empiric who proceeds by vulgar experience but one who grounds his practice1 on the sure rules of art which cannot possibly fail you have read sir the last manifesto or mountebanks bill of the national assembly you see their presumption in their promises is not lessened by all their failures in the performance compare this last address of the assembly and the present state of your affairs with the early engagements of that body engagements which not content with declaring they solemnly deposed upon oathswearing lustily that if they were supported they would make their country glorious and happy and then judge whether those who can write such things or those who can bear to read them are of themselves to be brought to any reasonable course of thought or action  as to the people at large when once these miserable sheep have broken the fold and have got themselves loose not from the restraint but from the protection of all the principles of natural authority and legitimate subordination they become the natural prey of impostors when they have once tasted of the flattery of knaves they can no longer endure reason which appears to them only in the form of censure and reproach great distress has never hitherto taught and whilst the world lasts it never will teach wise lessons to any part of mankind men are as much blinded by the extremes of misery as by the extremes of prosperity desperate situations produce desperate councils and desperate measures the people of france almost generally have been taught to look for other resources than those which can be derived from order frugality and industry they are generally armed and they are made to expect much from the use of arms nihil non arrogant armis besides this the retrograde order of society has something flattering to the dispositions of mankind the life of adventurers gamesters gypsies beggars and robbers is not unpleasant it requires restraint to keep men from falling into that habit the shifting tides of fear and hope the flight and pursuit the peril and escape the alternate famine and feast of the savage and the thief after a time render all course of slow steady progressive unvaried occupation and the prospect only of a limited mediocrity at the end of long labor to the last degree tame languid and insipid those who have been once intoxicated with power and have derived any kind of emolument from it even though but for one year never can willingly abandon it they may be distressed in the midst of all their power but they will never look to anything but power for their relief when did distress ever oblige a prince to abdicate his authority and what effect will it have upon those who are made to believe themselves a people of princes  the more active and stirring part of the lower orders having got government and the distribution of plunder into their hands they will use its resources in each municipality to form a body of adherents these rulers and their adherents will be strong enough to overpower the discontents of those who have not been able to assert their share of the spoil the unfortunate adventurers in the cheating lottery of plunder will probably be the least sagacious or the most inactive and irresolute of the gang if on disappointment they should dare to stir they will soon be suppressed as rebels and mutineers by their brother rebels scantily fed for a while with the offal of plunder they will drop off by degrees they will be driven out of sight and out of thought and they will be left to perish obscurely like rats in holes and corners  from the forced repentance of invalid mutineers and disbanded thieves you can hope for no resource government itself which ought to constrain the more bold and dexterous of these robbers is their accomplice its arms its treasures its all are in their hands judicature which above all things should awe them is their creature and their instrument nothing seems to me to render your internal situation more desperate than this one circumstance of the state of your judicature many days are not passed since we have seen a set of men brought forth by your rulers for a most critical function your rulers brought forth a set of men steaming from the sweat and drudgery and all black with the smoke and soot of the forge of confiscation and robberyardentis massæ fuligine lipposa set of men brought forth from the trade of hammering arms of proof offensive and defensive in aid of the enterprises and for the subsequent protection of housebreakers murderers traitors and malefactorsmen who had their minds seasoned with theories perfectly conformable to their practice and who had always laughed at possession and prescription and defied all the fundamental maxims of jurisprudence to the horror and stupefaction of all the honest part of this nation and indeed of all nations who are spectators we have seen on the credit of those very practices and principles and to carry them further into effect these very men placed on the sacred seat of justice in the capital city of your late kingdom we see that in future you are to be destroyed with more form and regularity this is not peace it is only the introduction of a sort of discipline in their hostility their tyranny is complete in their justice and their lanterne is not half so dreadful as their court  one would think that out of common decency they would have given you men who had not been in the habit of trampling upon law and justice in the assembly neutral men or men apparently neutral for judges who are to dispose of your lives and fortunes  cromwell when he attempted to legalize his power and to settle his conquered country in a state of order did not look for dispensers of justice in the instruments of his usurpation quite the contrary he sought out with great solicitude and selection and even from the party most opposite to his designs men of weight and decorum of charactermen unstained with the violence of the times and with hands not fouled with confiscation and sacrilege for he chose an hale for his chief justice though he absolutely refused to take his civic oaths or to make any acknowledgment whatsoever of the legality of his government cromwell told this great lawyer that since he did not approve his title all he required of him was to administer in a manner agreeable to his pure sentiments and unspotted character that justice without which human society cannot subsistthat it was not his particular government but civil order itself which as a judge he wished him to support cromwell knew how to separate the institutions expedient to his usurpation from the administration of the public justice of his country for cromwell was a man in whom ambition had not wholly suppressed but only suspended the sentiments of religion and the love as far as it could consist with his designs of fair and honorable reputation accordingly we are indebted to this act of his for the preservation of our laws which some senseless assertors of the rights of men were then on the point of entirely erasing as relics of feudality and barbarism besides he gave in the appointment of that man to that age and to all posterity the most brilliant example of sincere and fervent piety exact justice and profound jurisprudence2 but these are not the things in which your philosophic usurpers choose to follow cromwell  one would think that after an honest and necessary revolution if they had a mind that theirs should pass for such your masters would have imitated the virtuous policy of those who have been at the head of revolutions of that glorious character burnet tells us that nothing tended to reconcile the english nation to the government of king william so much as the care he took to fill the vacant bishoprics with men who had attracted the public esteem by their learning eloquence and piety and above all by their known moderation in the state with you in your purifying revolution whom have you chosen to regulate the church m mirabeau is a fine speaker and a fine writer and a finea very fine man but really nothing gave more surprise to everybody here than to find him the supreme head of your ecclesiastical affairs the rest is of course your assembly addresses a manifesto to france in which they tell the people with an insulting irony that they have brought the church to its primitive condition in one respect their declaration is undoubtedly true for they have brought it to a state of poverty and persecution what can be hoped for after this have not men if they deserve the name under this new hope and head of the church been made bishops for no other merit than having acted as instruments of atheists for no other merit than having thrown the childrens bread to dogs and in order to gorge the whole gang of usurers peddlers and itinerant jew discounters at the corners of streets starved the poor of their christian flocks and their own brother pastors have not such men been made bishops to administer in temples in which if the patriotic donations have not already stripped them of their vessels the churchwardens ought to take security for the altar plate and not so much as to trust the chalice in their sacrilegious hands so long as jews have assignats on ecclesiastic plunder to exchange for the silver stolen from churches  i am told that the very sons of such jew jobbers have been made bishops persons not to be suspected of any sort of christian superstition fit colleagues to the holy prelate of autun and bred at the feet of that gamaliel we know who it was that drove the moneychangers out of the temple we see too who it is that brings them in again we have in london very respectable persons of the jewish nation whom we will keep but we have of the same tribe others of a very different descriptionhousebreakers and receivers of stolen goods and forgers of paper currency more than we can conveniently hang these we can spare to france to fill the new episcopal thrones men well versed in swearing and who will scruple no oath which the fertile genius of any of your reformers can devise  in matters so ridiculous it is hard to be grave on a view of their consequences it is almost inhuman to treat them lightly to what a state of savage stupid servile insensibility must your people be reduced who can endure such proceedings in their church their state and their judicature even for a moment but the deluded people of france are like other madmen who to a miracle bear hunger and thirst and cold and confinement and the chains and lash of their keeper whilst all the while they support themselves by the imagination that they are generals of armies prophets kings and emperors as to a change of mind in those men who consider infamy as honor degradation as preferment bondage to low tyrants as liberty and the practical scorn and contumely of their upstart masters as marks of respect and homage i look upon it as absolutely impracticable these madmen to be cured must first like other madmen be subdued the sound part of the community which i believe to be large but by no means the largest part has been taken by surprise and is disjointed terrified and disarmed that sound part of the community must first be put into a better condition before it can do anything in the way of deliberation or persuasion this must be an act of power as well as of wisdom of power in the hands of firm determined patriots who can distinguish the misled from traitors who will regulate the state if such should be their fortune with a discriminating manly and provident mercy men who are purged of the surfeit and indigestion of systems if ever they have been admitted into the habit of their minds men who will lay the foundation of a real reform in effacing every vestige of that philosophy which pretends to have made discoveries in the terra australia of morality men who will fix the state upon these bases of morals and politics which are our old and immemorial and i hope will be our eternal possession  this power to such men must come from without it may be given to you in pity for surely no nation ever called so pathetically on the compassion of all its neighbors it may be given by those neighbors on motives of safety to themselves never shall i think any country in europe to be secure whilst there is established in the very centre of it a state if so it may be called founded on principles of anarchy and which is in reality a college of armed fanatics for the propagation of the principles of assassination robbery rebellion fraud faction oppression and impiety mahomet hid as for a time he was in the bottom of the sands of arabia had his spirit and character been discovered would have been an object of precaution to provident minds what if he had erected his fanatic standard for the destruction of the christian religion in luce asiæ in the midst of the then noonday splendor of the then civilized world the princes of europe in the beginning of this century did well not to suffer the monarchy of france to swallow up the others they ought not now in my opinion to suffer all the monarchies and commonwealths to be swallowed up in the gulf of this polluted anarchy they may be tolerably safe at present because the comparative power of france for the present is little but times and occasions make dangers intestine troubles may arise in other countries there is a power always on the watch qualified and disposed to profit of every conjuncture to establish its own principles and modes of mischief wherever it can hope for success what mercy would these usurpers have on other sovereigns and on other nations when they treat their own king with such unparalleled indignities and so cruelly oppress their own countrymen  the king of prussia in concurrence with us nobly interfered to save holland from confusion the same power joined with the rescued holland and with great britain has put the emperor in the possession of the netherlands and secured under that prince from all arbitrary innovation the ancient hereditary constitution of those provinces the chamber of wetzlar has restored the bishop of liege unjustly dispossessed by the rebellion of his subjects the king of prussia was bound by no treaty nor alliance of blood nor had any particular reasons for thinking the emperors government would be more mischievous or more oppressive to human nature than that of the turk yet on mere motives of policy that prince has interposed with the threat of all his force to snatch even the turk from the pounces of the imperial eagle if this is done in favor of a barbarous nation with a barbarous neglect of police fatal to the human racein favor of a nation by principle in eternal enmity with the christian name a nation which will not so much as give the salutation of peace salam to any of us nor make any pact with any christian nation beyond a truceif this be done in favor of the turk shall it be thought either impolitic or unjust or uncharitable to employ the same power to rescue from captivity a virtuous monarch by the courtesy of europe considered as most christian who after an intermission of one hundred and seventyfive years had called together the states of his kingdom to reform abuses to establish a free government and to strengthen his thronea monarch who at the very outset without force even without solicitation had given to his people such a magna charta of privileges as never was given by any king to any subjects is it to be tamely borne by kings who love their subjects or by subjects who love their kings that this monarch in the midst of these gracious acts was insolently and cruelly torn from his palace by a gang of traitors and assassins and kept in close prison to this very hour whilst his royal name and sacred character were used for the total ruin of those whom the laws had appointed him to protect  the only offence of this unhappy monarch towards his people was his attempt under a monarchy to give them a free constitution for this by an example hitherto unheard of in the world he has been deposed it might well disgrace sovereigns to take part with a deposed tyrant it would suppose in them a vicious sympathy but not to make a common cause with a just prince dethroned by traitors and rebels who proscribe plunder confiscate and in every way cruelly oppress their fellowcitizens in my opinion is to forget what is due to the honor and to the rights of all virtuous and legal government  i think the king of france to be as much an object both of policy and compassion as the grand seignior or his states i do not conceive that the total annihilation of france if that could be effected is a desirable thing to europe or even to this its rival nation provident patriots did not think it good for rome that even carthage should be quite destroyed and he was a wise greek wise for the general grecian interests as well as a brave lacedæmonian enemy and generous conqueror who did not wish by the destruction of athens to pluck out the other eye of greece  however sir what i have here said of the interference of foreign princes is only the opinion of a private individual who is neither the representative of any state nor the organ of any party but who thinks himself bound to express his own sentiments with freedom and energy in a crisis of such importance to the whole human race  i am not apprehensive that in speaking freely on the subject of the king and queen of france i shall accelerate as you fear the execution of traitorous designs against them you are of opinion sir that the usurpers may and that they will gladly lay hold of any pretext to throw off the very name of a king assuredly i do not wish ill to your king but better for him not to live he does not reign than to live the passive instrument of tyranny and usurpation  i certainly meant to show to the best of my power that the existence of such an executive officer in such a system of republic as theirs is absurd in the highest degree but in demonstrating this to them at least i can have made no discovery they only held out the royal name to catch those frenchmen to whom the name of king is still venerable they calculate the duration of that sentiment and when they find it nearly expiring they will not trouble themselves with excuses for extinguishing the name as they have the thing they used it as a sort of navelstring to nourish their unnatural offspring from the bowels of royalty itself now that the monster can purvey for its own subsistence it will only carry the mark about it as a token of its having torn the womb it came from tyrants seldom want pretexts fraud is the ready minister of injustice and whilst the currency of false pretence and sophistic reasoning was expedient to their designs they were under no necessity of drawing upon me to furnish them with that coin but pretexts and sophisms have had their day and have done their work the usurpation no longer seeks plausibility it trusts to power  nothing that i can say or that you can say will hasten them by a single hour in the execution of a design which they have long since entertained in spite of their solemn declarations their soothing addresses and the multiplied oaths which they have taken and forced others to take they will assassinate the king when his name will no longer be necessary to their designsbut not a moment sooner they will probably first assassinate the queen whenever the renewed menace of such an assassination loses its effect upon the anxious mind of an affectionate husband at present the advantage which they derive from the daily threats against her life is her only security for preserving it they keep their sovereign alive for the purpose of exhibiting him like some wild beast at a fairas if they had a bajazet in a cage they choose to make monarchy contemptible by exposing it to derision in the person of the most benevolent of their kings  in my opinion their insolence appears more odious even than their crimes the horrors of the fifth and sixth of october were less detestable than the festival of the fourteenth of july there are situations god forbid i should think that of the 5th and 6th of october one of them in which the best men may be confounded with the worst and in the darkness and confusion in the press and medley of such extremities it may not be so easy to discriminate the one from the other tho necessities created even by ill designs have their excuse they may be forgotten by others when the guilty themselves do not choose to cherish their recollection and by ruminating their offences nourish themselves through the example of their past to the perpetration of future crimes it is in the relaxation of security it is in the expansion of prosperity it is in the hour of dilatation of the heart and of its softening into festivity and pleasure that the real character of men is discerned if there is any good in them it appears then or never even wolves and tigers when gorged with their prey are safe and gentle it is at such times that noble minds give all the reins to their good nature they indulge their genius even to intemperance in kindness to the afflicted in generosity to the conqueredforbearing insults forgiving injuries overpaying benefits full of dignity themselves they respect dignity in all but they feel it sacred in the unhappy but it is then and basking in the sunshine of unmerited fortune that low sordid ungenerous and reptile souls swell with their hoarded poisons it is then that they display their odious splendor and shine out in the full lustre of their native villany and baseness it is in that season that no man of sense or honor can be mistaken for one of them it was in such a season for them of political ease and security though their people were but just emerged from actual famine and were ready to be plunged into a gulf of penury and beggary that your philosophic lords chose with an ostentatious pomp and luxury to feast an incredible number of idle and thoughtless people collected with art and pains from all quarters of the world they constructed a vast amphitheatre in which they raised a species of pillory3 on this pillory they set their lawful king and queen with an insulting figure over their heads there they exposed these objects of pity and respect to all good minds to the derision of an unthinking and unprincipled multitude degenerated even from the versatile tenderness which marks the irregular and capricious feelings of the populace that their cruel insult might have nothing wanting to complete it they chose the anniversary of that day in which they exposed the life of their prince to the most imminent dangers and the vilest indignities just following the instant when the assassins whom they had hired without owning first openly took up arms against their king corrupted his guards surprised his castle butchered some of the poor invalids of his garrison murdered his governor and like wild beasts tore to pieces the chief magistrate of his capital city on account of his fidelity to his service  till the justice of the world is awakened such as these will go on without admonition and without provocation to every extremity those who have made the exhibition of the fourteenth of july are capable of every evil they do not commit crimes for their designs but they form designs that they may commit crimes it is not their necessity but their nature that impels them they are modern philosophers which when you say of them you express everything that is ignoble savage and hardhearted  besides the sure tokens which are given by the spirit of their particular arrangements there are some characteristic lineaments in the general policy of your tumultuous despotism which in my opinion indicate beyond a doubt that no revolution whatsoever in their disposition is to be expected i mean their scheme of educating the rising generation the principles which they intend to instil and the sympathies which they wish to form in the mind at the season in which it is the most susceptible instead of forming their young minds to that docility to that modesty which are the grace and charm of youth to an admiration of famous examples and to an averseness to anything which approaches to pride petulance and selfconceit distempers to which that time of life is of itself sufficiently liable they artificially foment these evil dispositions and even form them into springs of action nothing ought to be more weighed than the nature of books recommended by public authority so recommended they soon form the character of the age uncertain indeed is the efficacy limited indeed is the extent of a virtuous institution but if education takes in vice as any part of its system there is no doubt but that it will operate with abundant energy and to an extent indefinite the magistrate who in favor of freedom thinks himself obliged to suffer all sorts of publications is under a stricter duty than any other well to consider what sort of writers he shall authorize and shall recommend by the strongest of all sanctions that is by public honors and rewards he ought to be cautious how he recommends authors of mixed or ambiguous morality he ought to be fearful of putting into the hands of youth writers indulgent to the peculiarities of their own complexion lest they should teach the humors of the professor rather than the principles of the science he ought above all to be cautious in recommending any writer who has carried marks of a deranged understanding for where there is no sound reason there can be no real virtue and madness is ever vicious and malignant  the assembly proceeds on maxims the very reverse of these the assembly recommends to its youth a study of the bold experimenters in morality everybody knows that there is a great dispute amongst their leaders which of them is the best resemblance of rousseau in truth they all resemble him his blood they transfuse into their minds and into their manners him they study him they meditate him they turn over in all the time they can spare from the laborious mischief of the day or the debauches of the night rousseau is their canon of holy writ in his life he is their canon of polycletus he is their standard figure of perfection to this man and this writer as a pattern to authors and to frenchmen the foundries of paris are now running for statues with the kettles of their poor and the bells of their churches if an author had written like a great genius on geometry though his practical and speculative morals were vicious in the extreme it might appear that in voting the statue they honored only the geometrician but rousseau is a moralist or he is nothing it is impossible therefore putting the circumstances together to mistake their design in choosing the author with whom they have begun to recommend a course of studies  their great problem is to find a substitute for all the principles which hitherto have been employed to regulate the human will and action they find dispositions in the mind of such force and quality as may fit men far better than the old morality for the purposes of such a state as theirs and may go much further in supporting their power and destroying their enemies they have therefore chosen a selfish flattering seductive ostentatious vice in the place of plain duty true humility the basis of the christian system is the low but deep and firm foundation of all real virtue but this as very painful in the practice and little imposing in the appearance they have totally discarded their object is to merge all natural and all social sentiment in inordinate vanity in a small degree and conversant in little things vanity is of little moment when fullgrown it is the worst of vices and the occasional mimic of them all it makes the whole man false it leaves nothing sincere or trustworthy about him his best qualities are poisoned and perverted by it and operate exactly as the worst when your lords had many writers as immoral as the object of their statue such as voltaire and others they chose rousseau because in him that peculiar vice which they wished to erect into ruling virtue was by far the most conspicuous  we have had the great professor and founder of the philosophy of vanity in england as i had good opportunities of knowing his proceedings almost from day to day he left no doubt on my mind that he entertained no principle either to influence his heart or to guide his understanding but vanity with this vice he was possessed to a degree little short of madness it is from the same deranged eccentric vanity that this the insane socrates of the national assembly was impelled to publish a mad confession of his mad faults and to attempt a new sort of glory from bringing hardily to light the obscure and vulgar vices which we know may sometimes be blended with eminent talents he has not observed on the nature of vanity who does not know that it is omnivorousthat it has no choice in its foodthat it is fond to talk even of its own faults and vices as what will excite surprise and draw attention and what will pass at worst for openness and candor  it was this abuse and perversion which vanity makes even of hypocrisy which has driven rousseau to record a life not so much as checkered or spotted here and there with virtues or even distinguished by a single good action it is such a life he chooses to offer to the attention of mankind it is such a life that with a wild defiance he flings in the face of his creator whom he acknowledges only to brave your assembly knowing how much more powerful example is found than precept has chosen this man by his own account without a single virtue for a model to him they erect their first statue from him they commence their series of honors and distinctions  it is that newinvented virtue which your masters canonize that led their moral hero constantly to exhaust the stores of his powerful rhetoric in the expression of universal benevolence whilst his heart was incapable of harboring one spark of common parental affection benevolence to the whole species and want of feeling for every individual with whom the professors come in contact form the character of the new philosophy setting up for an unsocial independence this their hero of vanity refuses the just price of common labor as well as the tribute which opulence owes to genius and which when paid honors the giver and the receiver and then he pleads his beggary as an excuse for his crimes he melts with tenderness for those only who touch him by the remotest relation and then without one natural pang casts away as a sort of offal and excrement the spawn of his disgustful amours and sends his children to the hospital of foundlings the bear loves licks and forms her young but bears are not philosophers vanity however finds its account in reversing the train of our natural feelings thousands admire the sentimentalwriter the affectionate father is hardly known in his parish  under this philosophic instructor in the ethics of vanity they have attempted in france a regeneration of the moral constitution of man statesmen like your present rulers exist by everything which is spurious fictitious and falseby everything which takes the man from his house and sets him on a stagewhich makes him up an artificial creature with painted theatric sentiments fit to be seen by the glare of candlelight and formed to be contemplated at a due distance vanity is too apt to prevail in all of us and in all countries to the improvement of frenchmen it seems not absolutely necessary that it should be taught upon system but it is plain that the present rebellion was its legitimate offspring and it is piously fed by that rebellion with a daily dole  if the system of institution recommended by the assembly is false and theatric it is because their system of government is of the same character to that and to that alone it is strictly conformable to understand either we must connect the morals with the politics of the legislators your practical philosophers systematic in everything have wisely began at the source as the relation between parents and children is the first among the elements of vulgar natural morality4 they erect statues to a wild ferocious lowminded hardhearted father of fine general feelingsa lover of his kind but a hater of his kindred your masters reject the duties of this vulgar relation as contrary to liberty as not founded in the social compact and not binding according to the rights of men because the relation is not of course the result of free electionnever so on the side of the children not always on the part of the parents  the next relation which they regenerate by their statues to rousseau is that which is next in sanctity to that of a father they differ from those oldfashioned thinkers who considered pedagogues as sober and venerable characters and allied to the parental the moralists of the dark times præceptorem sancti voluere parentis esse loco in this age of light they teach the people that preceptors ought to be in the place of gallants they systematically corrupt a very corruptible race for some time a growing nuisance amongst youa set of pert petulant literators to whom instead of their proper but severe unostentatious duties they assign the brilliant part of men of wit and pleasure of gay young military sparks and danglers at toilets they call on the rising generation in france to take a sympathy in the adventures and fortunes and they endeavor to engage their sensibility on the side of pedagogues who betray the most awful family trusts and vitiate their female pupils they teach the people that the debauchers of virgins almost in the arms of their parents may be safe inmates in their house and even fit guardians of the honor of those husbands who succeed legally to the office which the young literators had preoccupied without asking leave of law or conscience  thus they dispose of all the family relations of parents and children husbands and wives through this same instructor by whom they corrupt the morals they corrupt the taste taste and elegance though they are reckoned only among the smaller and secondary morals yet are of no mean importance in the regulation of life a moral taste is not of force to turn vice into virtue but it recommends virtue with something like the blandishments of pleasure and it infinitely abates the evils of vice rousseau a writer of great force and vivacity is totally destitute of taste in any sense of the word your masters who are his scholars conceive that all refinement has an aristocratic character the last age had exhausted all its powers in giving a grace and nobleness to our natural appetites and in raising them into a higher class and order than seemed justly to belong to them through rousseau your masters are resolved to destroy these aristocratic prejudices the passion called love has so general and powerful an influence it makes so much of the entertainment and indeed so much the occupation of that part of life which decides the character forever that the mode and the principles on which it engages the sympathy and strikes the imagination become of the utmost importance to the morals and manners of every society your rulers were well aware of this and in their system of changing your manners to accommodate them to their politics they found nothing so convenient as rousseau through him they teach men to love after the fashion of philosophers that is they teach to men to frenchmen a love without gallantrya love without anything of that fine flower of youthfulness and gentility which places it if not among the virtues among the ornaments of life instead of this passion naturally allied to grace and manners they infuse into their youth an unfashioned indelicate sour gloomy ferocious medley of pedantry and lewdnessof metaphysical speculations blended with the coarsest sensuality such is the general morality of the passions to be found in their famous philosopher in his famous work of philosophic gallantry the nouvelle Éloise  when the fence from the gallantry of preceptors is broken down and your families are no longer protected by decent pride and salutary domestic prejudice there is but one step to a frightful corruption the rulers in the national assembly are in good hopes that the females of the first families in france may become an easy prey to dancingmasters fiddlers patterndrawers friseurs and valetsdechambre and other active citizens of that description who having the entry into your houses and being half domesticated by their situation may be blended with you by regular and irregular relations by a law they have made these people their equals by adopting the sentiments of rousseau they have made them your rivals in this manner these great legislators complete their plan of levelling and establish their rights of men on a sure foundation  i am certain that the writings of rousseau lead directly to this kind of shameful evil i have often wondered how he comes to be so much more admired and followed on the continent than he is here perhaps a secret charm in the language may have its share in this extraordinary difference we certainly perceive and to a degree we feel in this writer a style glowing animated enthusiastic at the same time that we find it lax diffuse and not in the best taste of compositionall the members of the piece being pretty equally labored and expanded without any due selection or subordination of parts he is generally too much on the stretch and his manner has little variety we cannot rest upon any of his works though they contain observations which occasionally discover a considerable insight into human nature but his doctrines on the whole are so inapplicable to real life and manners that we never dream of drawing from them any rule for laws or conduct or for fortifying or illustrating anything by a reference to his opinions they have with us the fate of older paradoxes      cum ventum ad verum est sensus moresque repugnant     atque ipsa utilitas justi prope mater et æqui  perhaps bold speculations are more acceptable because more new to you than to us who have been long since satiated with them we continue as in the two last ages to read more generally than i believe is now done on the continent the authors of sound antiquity these occupy our minds they give us another taste and turn and will not suffer us to be more than transiently amused with paradoxical morality it is not that i consider this writer as wholly destitute of just notions amongst his irregularities it must be reckoned that he is sometimes moral and moral in a very sublime strain but the general spirit and tendency of his works is mischievousand the more mischievous for this mixture for perfect depravity of sentiment is not reconcilable with eloquence and the mind though corruptible not complexionally vicious would reject and throw off with disgust a lesson of pure and unmixed evil these writers make even virtue a pander to vice  however i less consider the author than the system of the assembly in perverting morality through his means this i confess makes me nearly despair of any attempt upon the minds of their followers through reason honor or conscience the great object of your tyrants is to destroy the gentlemen of france and for that purpose they destroy to the best of their power all the effect of those relations which may render considerable men powerful or even safe to destroy that order they vitiate the whole community that no means may exist of confederating against their tyranny by the false sympathies of this nouvelle Éloise they endeavor to subvert those principles of domestic trust and fidelity which form the discipline of social life they propagate principles by which every servant may think it if not his duty at least his privilege to betray his master by these principles every considerable father of a family loses the sanctuary of his house debet sua cuique domus esse perfugium tutissimum says the law which your legislators have taken so much pains first to decry then to repeal they destroy all the tranquillity and security of domestic life turning the asylum of the house into a gloomy prison where the father of the family must drag out a miserable existence endangered in proportion to the apparent means of his safetywhere he is worse than solitary in a crowd of domestics and more apprehensive from his servants and inmates than from the hired bloodthirsty mob without doors who are ready to pull him to the lanterne  it is thus and for the same end that they endeavor to destroy that tribunal of conscience which exists independently of edicts and decrees your despots govern by terror they know that he who fears god fears nothing else and therefore they eradicate from the mind through their voltaire their helvétius and the rest of that infamous gang that only sort of fear which generates true courage their object is that their fellowcitizens may be under the dominion of no awe but that of their committee of research and of their lanterne  having found the advantage of assassination in the formation of their tyranny it is the grand resource in which they trust for the support of it whoever opposes any of their proceedings or is suspected of a design to oppose them is to answer it with his life or the lives of his wife and children this infamous cruel and cowardly practice of assassination they have the impudence to call merciful they boast that they operated their usurpation rather by terror than by force and that a few seasonable murders have prevented the bloodshed of many battles there is no doubt they will extend these acts of mercy whenever they see an occasion dreadful however will be the consequences of their attempt to avoid the evils of war by the merciful policy of murder if by effectual punishment of the guilty they do not wholly disavow that practice and the threat of it too as any part of their policy if ever a foreign prince enters into france he must enter it as into a country of assassins the mode of civilized war will not be practised nor are the french who act on the present system entitled to expect it they whose known policy it is to assassinate every citizen whom they suspect to be discontented by their tyranny and to corrupt the soldiery of every open enemy must look for no modified hostility all war which is not battle will be military execution this will beget acts of retaliation from you and every retaliation will beget a new revenge the hellhounds of war on all sides will be uncoupled and unmuzzled the new school of murder and barbarism set up in paris having destroyed so far as in it lies all the other manners and principles which have hitherto civilized europe will destroy also the mode of civilized war which more than anything else has distinguished the christian world such is the approaching golden age which the virgil5 of your assembly has sung to his pollios  in such a situation of your political your civil and your social morals and manners how can you be hurt by the freedom of any discussion caution is for those who have something to lose what i have said to justify myself in not apprehending any ill consequence from a free discussion of the absurd consequences which flow from the relation of the lawful king to the usurped constitution will apply to my vindication with regard to the exposure i have made of the state of the army under the same sophistic usurpation the present tyrants want no arguments to prove what they must daily feel that no good army can exist on their principles they are in no want of a monitor to suggest to them the policy of getting rid of the army as well as of the king whenever they are in a condition to effect that measure what hopes may be entertained of your army for the restoration of your liberties i know not at present yielding obedience to the pretended orders of a king who they are perfectly apprised has no will and who never can issue a mandate which is not intended in the first operation or in its certain consequences for his own destruction your army seems to make one of the principal links in the chain of that servitude of anarchy by which a cruel usurpation holds an undone people at once in bondage and confusion  you ask me what i think of the conduct of general monk how this affects your case i cannot tell i doubt whether you possess in france any persons of a capacity to serve the french monarchy in the same manner in which monk served the monarchy of england the army which monk commanded had been formed by cromwell to a perfection of discipline which perhaps has never been exceeded that army was besides of an excellent composition the soldiers were men of extraordinary piety after their mode of the greatest regularity and even severity of manners brave in the field but modest quiet and orderly in their quarters men who abhorred the idea of assassinating their officers or any other persons and who they at least who served in this island were firmly attached to those generals by whom they were well treated and ably commanded such an army once gained might be depended on i doubt much if you could now find a monk whether a monk could find in france such an army  i certainly agree with you that in all probability we owe our whole constitution to the restoration of the english monarchy the state of things from which monk relieved england was however by no means at that time so deplorable in any sense as yours is now and under the present sway is likely to continue cromwell had delivered england from anarchy his government though military and despotic had been regular and orderly under the iron and under the yoke the soil yielded its produce after his death the evils of anarchy were rather dreaded than felt every man was yet safe in his house and in his property but it must be admitted that monk freed this nation from great and just apprehensions both of future anarchy and of probable tyranny in some form or other the king whom he gave us was indeed the very reverse of your benignant sovereign who in reward for his attempt to bestow liberty on his subjects languishes himself in prison the person given to us by monk was a man without any sense of his duty as a prince without any regard to the dignity of his crown without any love to his peopledissolute false venal and destitute of any positive good quality whatsoever except a pleasant temper and the manners of a gentleman yet the restoration of our monarchy even in the person of such a prince was everything to us for without monarchy in england most certainly we never can enjoy either peace or liberty it was under this conviction that the very first regular step which we took on the revolution of 1688 was to fill the throne with a real king and even before it could be done in due form the chiefs of the nation did not attempt themselves to exercise authority so much as by interim they instantly requested the prince of orange to take the government on himself the throne was not effectively vacant for an hour  your fundamental laws as well as ours suppose a monarchy your zeal sir in standing so firmly for it as you have done shows not only a sacred respect for your honor and fidelity but a wellinformed attachment to the real welfare and true liberties of your country i have expressed myself ill if i have given you cause to imagine that i prefer the conduct of those who have retired from this warfare to your behavior who with a courage and constancy almost supernatural have struggled against tyranny and kept the field to the last you see i have corrected the exceptionable part in the edition which i now send you indeed in such terrible extremities as yours it is not easy to say in a political view what line of conduct is the most advisable in that state of things i cannot bring myself severely to condemn persons who are wholly unable to bear so much as the sight of those men in the throne of legislation who are only fit to be the objects of criminal justice if fatigue if disgust if unsurmountable nausea drive them away from such spectacles ubi miseriarum pars non minima erat videre et aspici i cannot blame them he must have an heart of adamant who could hear a set of traitors puffed up with unexpected and undeserved power obtained by an ignoble unmanly and perfidious rebellion treating their honest fellowcitizens as rebels because they refused to bind them selves through their conscience against the dictates of conscience itself and had declined to swear an active compliance with their own ruin how could a man of common flesh and blood endure that those who but the other day had skulked unobserved in their antechambers scornfully insulting men illustrious in their rank sacred in their function and venerable in their character now in decline of life and swimming on the wrecks of their fortunesthat those miscreants should tell such men scornfully and outrageously after they had robbed them of all their property that it is more than enough if they are allowed what will keep them from absolute famine and that for the rest they must let their gray hairs fall over the plough to make out a scanty subsistence with the labor of their hands last and worst who could endure to hear this unnatural insolent and savage despotism called liberty if at this distance sitting quietly by my fire i cannot read their decrees and speeches without indignation shall i condemn those who have fled from the actual sight and hearing of all these horrors no no mankind has no title to demand that we should be slaves to their guilt and insolence or that we should serve them in spite of themselves minds sore with the poignant sense of insulted virtue filled with high disdain against the pride of triumphant baseness often have it not in their choice to stand their ground their complexion which might defy the rack cannot go through such a trial something very high must fortify men to that proof but when i am driven to comparison surely i cannot hesitate for a moment to prefer to such men as are common those heroes who in the midst of despair perform all the tasks of hopewho subdue their feelings to their dutieswho in the cause of humanity liberty and honor abandon all the satisfactions of life and every day incur a fresh risk of life itself do me the justice to believe that i never can prefer any fastidious virtue virtue still to the unconquered perseverance to the affectionate patience of those who watch day and night by the bedside of their delirious countrywho for their love to that dear and venerable name bear all the disgusts and all the buffets they receive from their frantic mother sir i do look on you as true martyrs i regard you as soldiers who act far more in the spirit of our commanderinchief and the captain of our salvation than those who have left you though i must first bolt myself very thoroughly and know that i could do better before i can censure them i assure you sir that when i consider your unconquerable fidelity to your sovereign and to your countrythe courage fortitude magnanimity and longsuffering of yourself and the abbé maury and of m cazalès and of many worthy persons of all orders in your assemblyi forget in the lustre of these great qualities that on your side has been displayed an eloquence so rational manly and convincing that no time or country perhaps has ever excelled but your talents disappear in my admiration of your virtues  as to m mounier and m lally i have always wished to do justice to their parts and their eloquence and the general purity of their motives indeed i saw very well from the beginning the mischiefs which with all these talents and good intentions they would do their country through their confidence in systems but their distemper was an epidemic malady they were young and inexperienced and when will young and inexperienced men learn caution and distrust of themselves and when will men young or old if suddenly raised to far higher power than that which absolute kings and emperors commonly enjoy learn anything like moderation monarchs in general respect some settled order of things which they find it difficult to move from its basis and to which they are obliged to conform even when there are no positive limitations to their power these gentlemen conceived that they were chosen to newmodel the state and even the whole order of civil society itself no wonder that they entertained dangerous visions when the kings ministers trustees for the sacred deposit of the monarchy were so infected with the contagion of project and system i can hardly think it black premeditated treachery that they publicly advertised for plans and schemes of government as if they were to provide for the rebuilding of an hospital that had been burned down what was this but to unchain the fury of rash speculation amongst a people of itself but too apt to be guided by a heated imagination and a wild spirit of adventure  the fault of m mounier and m lally was very great but it was very general if those gentlemen stopped when they came to the brink of the gulf of guilt and public misery that yawned before them in the abyss of these dark and bottomless speculations i forgive their first error in that they were involved with many their repentance was their own  they who consider mounier and lally as deserters must regard themselves as murderers and as traitors for from what else than murder and treason did they desert for my part i honor them for not having carried mistake into crime if indeed i thought that they were not cured by experience that they were not made sensible that those who would reform a state ought to assume some actual constitution of government which is to be reformedif they are not at length satisfied that it is become a necessary preliminary to liberty in france to commence by the reëstablishment of order and property of every kind and through the reëstablishment of their monarchy of every one of the old habitual distinctions and classes of the stateif they do not see that these classes are not to be confounded in order to be afterwards revived and separatedif they are not convinced that the scheme of parochial and club governments takes up the state at the wrong end and is a low and senseless contrivance as making the sole constitution of a supreme poweri should then allow that their early rashness ought to be remembered to the last moment of their lives  you gently reprehend me because in holding out the picture of your disastrous situation i suggest no plan for a remedy alas sir the proposition of plans without an attention to circumstances is the very cause of all your misfortunes and never shall you find me aggravating by the infusion of any speculations of mine the evils which have arisen from the speculations of others your malady in this respect is a disorder of repletion you seem to think that my keeping back my poor ideas may arise from an indifference to the welfare of a foreign and sometimes an hostile nation no sir i faithfully assure you my reserve is owing to no such causes is this letter swelled to a second book a mark of national antipathy or even of national indifference i should act altogether in the spirit of the same caution in a similar state of our own domestic affairs if i were to venture any advice in any case it would be my best the sacred duty of an adviser one of the most inviolable that exists would lead me towards a real enemy to act as if my best friend were the party concerned but i dare not risk a speculation with no better view of your affairs than at present i can command my caution is not from disregard but from solicitude for your welfare it is suggested solely from my dread of becoming the author of inconsiderate counsel  it is not that as this strange series of actions has passed before my eyes i have not indulged my mind in a great variety of political speculations concerning them but compelled by no such positive duty as does not permit me to evade an opinion called upon by no ruling power without authority as i am and without confidence i should ill answer my own ideas of what would become myself or what would be serviceable to others if i were as a volunteer to obtrude any project of mine upon a nation to whose circumstances i could not be sure it might be applicable  permit me to say that if i were as confident as i ought to be diffident in my own loose general ideas i never should venture to broach them if but at twenty leagues distance from the centre of your affairs i must see with my own eyes i must in a manner touch with my own hands not only the fixed but the momentary circumstances before i could venture to suggest any political project whatsoever i must know the power and disposition to accept to execute to persevere i must see all the aids and all the obstacles i must see the means of correcting the plan where correctives would be wanted i must see the things i must see the men without a concurrence and adaptation of these to the design the very best speculative projects might become not only useless but mischievous plans must be made for men we cannot think of making men and binding nature to our designs people at a distance must judge ill of men they do not always answer to their reputation when you approach them nay the perspective varies and shows them quite otherwise than you thought them at a distance if we judge uncertainly of men we must judge worse of opportunities which continually vary their shapes and colors and pass away like clouds the eastern politicians never do anything without the opinion of the astrologers on the fortunate moment they are in the right if they can do no better for the opinion of fortune is something towards commanding it statesmen of a more judicious prescience look for the fortunate moment too but they seek it not in the conjunctions and oppositions of planets but in the conjunctions and oppositions of men and things these form their almanac  to illustrate the mischief of a wise plan without any attention to means and circumstances it is not necessary to go farther than to your recent history in the condition in which france was found three years ago what better system could be proposed what less even savoring of wild theory what fitter to provide for all the exigencies whilst it reformed all the abuses of government than the convention of the statesgeneral i think nothing better could be imagined but i have censured and do still presume to censure your parliament of paris for not having suggested to the king that this proper measure was of all measures the most critical and arduous one in which the utmost circumspection and the greatest number of precautions were the most absolutely necessary the very confession that a government wants either amendment in its conformation or relief to great distress causes it to lose half its reputation and as great a proportion of its strength as depends upon that reputation it was therefore necessary first to put government out of danger whilst at its own desire it suffered such an operation as a general reform at the hands of those who were much more filled with a sense of the disease than provided with rational means of a cure  it may be said that this care and these precautions were more naturally the duty of the kings ministers than that of the parliament they were so but every man must answer in his estimation for the advice he gives when he puts the conduct of his measure into hands who he does not know will execute his plans according to his ideas three or four ministers were not to be trusted with the being of the french monarchy of all the orders and of all the distinctions and all the property of the kingdom what must be the prudence of those who could think in the then known temper of the people of paris of assembling the states at a place situated as versailles  the parliament of paris did worse than to inspire this blind confidence into the king for as if names were things they took no notice of indeed they rather countenanced the deviations which were manifest in the execution from the true ancient principles of the plan which they recommended these deviations as guardians of the ancient laws usages and constitution of the kingdom the parliament of paris ought not to have suffered without the strongest remonstrances to the throne it ought to have sounded the alarm to the whole nation as it had often done on things of infinitely less importance under pretence of resuscitating the ancient constitution the parliament saw one of the strongest acts of innovation and the most leading in its consequences carried into effect before their eyesand an innovation through the medium of despotism that is they suffered the kings ministers to newmodel the whole representation of the tiers État and in a great measure that of the clergy too and to destroy the ancient proportions of the orders these changes unquestionably the king had no right to make and here the parliaments failed in their duty and along with their country have perished by this failure  what a number of faults have led to this multitude of misfortunes and almost all from this one sourcethat of considering certain general maxims without attending to circumstances to times to places to conjunctures and to actors if we do not attend scrupulously to all these the medicine of today becomes the poison of tomorrow if any measure was in the abstract better than another it was to call the states ea visa salus morientibus una certainly it had the appearance but see the consequences of not attending to critical moments of not regarding the symptoms which discriminate diseases and which distinguish constitutions complexions and humors      mox erat hoc ipsum exitio furiisque refecti     ardebant ipsique suos jam morte sub ægra     discissos nudis laniabant dentibus artus  thus the potion which was given to strengthen the constitution to heal divisions and to compose the minds of men became the source of debility frenzy discord and utter dissolution  in this perhaps i have answered i think another of your questionswhether the british constitution is adapted to your circumstances when i praised the british constitution and wished it to be well studied i did not mean that its exterior form and positive arrangement should become a model for you or for any people servilely to copy i meant to recommend the principles from which it has grown and the policy on which it has been progressively improved out of elements common to you and to us i am sure it is no visionary theory of mine it is not an advice that subjects you to the hazard of any experiment i believed the ancient principles to be wise in all cases of a large empire that would be free i thought you possessed our principles in your old forms in as great a perfection as we did originally if your states agreed as i think they did with your circumstances they were best for you as you had a constitution formed upon principles similar to ours my idea was that you might have improved them as we have done conforming them to the state and exigencies of the times and the condition of property in your countryhaving the conservation of that property and the substantial basis of your monarchy as principal objects in all your reforms  i do not advise an house of lords to you your ancient course by representatives of the noblesse in your circumstances appears to me rather a better institution i know that with you a set of men of rank have betrayed their constituents their honor their trust their king and their country and levelled themselves with their footmen that through this degradation they might afterwards put themselves above their natural equals some of these persons have entertained a project that in reward of this their black perfidy and corruption they may be chosen to give rise to a new order and to establish themselves into an house of lords do you think that under the name of a british constitution i mean to recommend to you such lords made of such kind of stuff i do not however include in this description all of those who are fond of this scheme  if you were now to form such an house of peers it would bear in my opinion but little resemblance to ours in its origin character or the purposes which it might answer at the same time that it would destroy your true natural nobility but if you are not in a condition to frame a house of lords still less are you capable in my opinion of framing anything which virtually and substantially could be answerable for the purposes of a stable regular government to our house of commons that house is within itself a much more subtle and artificial combination of parts and powers than people are generally aware of what knits it to the other members of the constitution what fits it to be at once the great support and the great control of government what makes it of such admirable service to that monarchy which if it limits it secures and strengthens would require a long discourse belonging to the leisure of a contemplative man not to one whose duty it is to join in communicating practically to the people the blessings of such a constitution  your tiers État was not in effect and substance an house of commons you stood in absolute need of something else to supply the manifest defects in such a body as your tiers État on a sober and dispassionate view of your old constitution as connected with all the present circumstances i was fully persuaded that the crown standing as things have stood and are likely to stand if you are to have any monarchy at all was and is incapable alone and by itself of holding a just balance between the two orders and at the same time of effecting the interior and exterior purposes of a protecting government i whose leading principle it is in a reformation of the state to make use of existing materials am of opinion that the representation of the clergy as a separate order was an institution which touched all the orders more nearly than any of them touched the other that it was well fitted to connect them and to hold a place in any wise monarchical commonwealth if i refer you to your original constitution and think it as i do substantially a good one i do not amuse you in this more than in other things with any inventions of mine a certain intemperance of intellect is the disease of the time and the source of all its other diseases i will keep myself as untainted by it as i can your architects build without a foundation i would readily lend an helping hand to any superstructure when once this is effectually securedbut first i would say Δός πον στῶ  you think sir and you might think rightly upon the first view of the theory that to provide for the exigencies of an empire so situated and so related as that of france its king ought to be invested with powers very much superior to those which the king of england possesses under the letter of our constitution every degree of power necessary to the state and not destructive to the rational and moral freedom of individuals to that personal liberty and personal security which contribute so much to the vigor the prosperity the happiness and the dignity of a nationevery degree of power which does not suppose the total absence of all control and all responsibility on the part of ministersa king of france in common sense ought to possess but whether the exact measure of authority assigned by the letter of the law to the king of great britain can answer to the exterior or interior purposes of the french monarchy is a point which i cannot venture to judge upon here both in the power given and its limitations we have always cautiously felt our way the parts of our constitution have gradually and almost insensibly in a long course of time accommodated themselves to each other and to their common as well as to their separate purposes but this adaptation of contending parts as it has not been in ours so it can never be in yours or in any country the effect of a single instantaneous regulation and no sound heads could ever think of doing it in that manner  i believe sir that many on the continent altogether mistake the condition of a king of great britain he is a real king and not an executive officer if he will not trouble himself with contemptible details nor wish to degrade himself by becoming a party in little squabbles i am far from sure that a king of great britain in whatever concerns him as a king or indeed as a rational man who combines his public interest with his personal satisfaction does not possess a more real solid extensive power than the king of france was possessed of before this miserable revolution the direct power of the king of england is considerable his indirect and far more certain power is great indeed he stands in need of nothing towards dignityof nothing towards splendorof nothing towards authorityof nothing at all towards consideration abroad when was it that a king of england wanted wherewithal to make him respected courted or perhaps even feared in every state in europe  i am constantly of opinion that your states in three orders on the footing on which they stood in 1614 were capable of being brought into a proper and harmonious combination with royal authority this constitution by estates was the natural and only just representation of france it grew out of the habitual conditions relations and reciprocal claims of men it grew out of the circumstances of the country and out of the state of property the wretched scheme of your present masters is not to fit the constitution to the people but wholly to destroy conditions to dissolve relations to change the state of the nation and to subvert property in order to fit their country to their theory of a constitution  until you make out practically that great work a combination of opposing forces a work of labor long and endless praise the utmost caution ought to have been used in the reduction of the royal power which alone was capable of holding together the comparatively heterogeneous mass of your states but at this day all these considerations are unseasonable to what end should we discuss the limitations of royal power your king is in prison why speculate on the measure and standard of liberty i doubt much very much indeed whether france is at all ripe for liberty on any standard men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetitesin proportion as their love to justice is above their rapacityin proportion as their soundness and sobriety of understanding is above their vanity and presumptionin proportion as they are more disposed to listen to the counsels of the wise and good in preference to the flattery of knaves society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere and the less of it there is within the more there must be without it is ordained in the eternal constitution of things that men of intemperate minds cannot be free their passions forge their fetters  this sentence the prevalent part of your countrymen execute on themselves they possessed not long since what was next to freedom a mild paternal monarchy they despised it for its weakness they were offered a wellpoised free constitution it did not suit their taste or their temper they carved for themselves they flew out murdered robbed and rebelled they have succeeded and put over their country an insolent tyranny made up of cruel and inexorable masters and that too of a description hitherto not known in the world the powers and policies by which they have succeeded are not those of great statesmen or great military commanders but the practices of incendiaries assassins housebreakers robbers spreaders of false news forgers of false orders from authority and other delinquencies of which ordinary justice takes cognizance accordingly the spirit of their rule is exactly correspondent to the means by which they obtained it they act more in the manner of thieves who have got possession of an house than of conquerors who have subdued a nation  opposed to these in appearance but in appearance only is another band who call themselves the moderate these if i conceive rightly of their conduct are a set of men who approve heartily of the whole new constitution but wish to lay heavy on the most atrocious of those crimes by which this fine constitution of theirs has been obtained they are a sort of people who affect to proceed as if they thought that men may deceive without fraud rob without injustice and overturn everything without violence they are men who would usurp the government of their country with decency and moderation in fact they are nothing more or better than men engaged in desperate designs with feeble minds they are not honest they are only ineffectual and unsystematic in their iniquity they are persons who want not the dispositions but the energy and vigor that is necessary for great evil machinations they find that in such designs they fall at best into a secondary rank and others take the place and lead in usurpation which they are not qualified to obtain or to hold they envy to their companions the natural fruit of their crimes they join to run them down with the hue and cry of mankind which pursues their common offences and then hope to mount into their places on the credit of the sobriety with which they show themselves disposed to carry on what may seem most plausible in the mischievous projects they pursue in common but these men are naturally despised by those who have heads to know and hearts that are able to go through the necessary demands of bold wicked enterprises they are naturally classed below the latter description and will only be used by them as inferior instruments they will be only the fairfaxes of your cromwells if they mean honestly why do they not strengthen the arms of honest men to support their ancient legal wise and free government given to them in the spring of 1788 against the inventions of craft and the theories of ignorance and folly if they do not they must continue the scorn of both partiessometimes the tool sometimes the incumbrance of that whose views they approve whose conduct they decry these people are only made to be the sport of tyrants they never can obtain or communicate freedom  you ask me too whether we have a committee of research no sirgod forbid it is the necessary instrument of tyranny and usurpation and therefore i do not wonder that it has had an early establishment under your present lords we do not want it  excuse my length i have been somewhat occupied since i was honored with your letter and i should not have been able to answer it at all but for the holidays which have given me means of enjoying the leisure of the country i am called to duties which i am neither able nor willing to evade i must soon return to my old conflict with the corruptions and oppressions which have prevailed in our eastern dominions i must turn myself wholly from those of france  in england we cannot work so hard as frenchmen frequent relaxation is necessary to us you are naturally more intense in your application i did not know this part of your national character until i went into france in 1773 at present this your disposition to labor is rather increased than lessened in your assembly you do not allow yourselves a recess even on sundays we have two days in the week besides the festivals and besides five or six months of the summer and autumn this continued unremitted effort of the members of your assembly i take to be one among the causes of the mischief they have done they who always labor can have no true judgment you never give yourselves time to cool you can never survey from its proper point of sight the work you have finished before you decree its final execution you can never plan the future by the past you never go into the country soberly and dispassionately to observe the effect of your measures on their objects you cannot feel distinctly how far the people are rendered better and improved or more miserable and depraved by what you have done you cannot see with your own eyes the sufferings and afflictions you cause you know them but at a distance on the statements of those who always flatter the reigning power and who amidst their representations of the grievances inflame your minds against those who are oppressed these are amongst the effects of unremitted labor when men exhaust their attention burn out their candles and are left in the darkmalo meorum negligentiam quam istorum obscuram diligentiam  i have the honor c  edmund burke  beaconsfield january 19th 1791  footnotes  1 it is said in the last quackish address of

concerning universal peace     an  appeal  from  the new to the old whigs  in consequence of some late  discussions in parliament  relative to the  reflections on the french revolution  1791     advertisement  to the second edition   there are some corrections in this edition which tend to render the sense less obscure in one or two places the order of the two last members is also changed and i believe for the better this change was made on the suggestion of a very learned person to the partiality of whose friendship i owe much to the severity of whose judgment i owe more     an appeal  from  the new to the old whigs   at mr burkes time of life and in his dispositions petere honestam missionem was all he had to do with his political associates this boon they have not chosen to grant him with many expressions of goodwill in effect they tell him he has loaded the stage too long they conceive it though an harsh yet a necessary office in full parliament to declare to the present age and to as late a posterity as shall take any concern in the proceedings of our day that by one book he has disgraced the whole tenor of his lifethus they dismiss their old partner of the war he is advised to retire whilst they continue to serve the public upon wiser principles and under better auspices  whether diogenes the cynic was a true philosopher cannot easily be determined he has written nothing but the sayings of his which are handed down by others are lively and may be easily and aptly applied on many occasions by those whose wit is not so perfect as their memory this diogenes as every one will recollect was citizen of a little bleak town situated on the coast of the euxine and exposed to all the buffets of that inhospitable sea he lived at a great distance from those weatherbeaten walls in ease and indolence and in the midst of literary leisure when he was informed that his townsmen had condemned him to be banished from sinope he answered coolly and i condemn them to live in sinope  the gentlemen of the party in which mr burke has always acted in passing upon him the sentence of retirement6 have done nothing more than to confirm the sentence which he had long before passed upon himself when that retreat was choice which the tribunal of his peers inflict as punishment it is plain he does not think their sentence intolerably severe whether they who are to continue in the sinope which shortly he is to leave will spend the long years which i hope remain to them in a manner more to their satisfaction than he shall slide down in silence and obscurity the slope of his declining days is best known to him who measures out years and days and fortunes  the quality of the sentence does not however decide on the justice of it angry friendship is sometimes as bad as calm enmity for this reason the cold neutrality of abstract justice is to a good and clear cause a more desirable thing than an affection liable to be any way disturbed when the trial is by friends if the decision should happen to be favorable the honor of the acquittal is lessened if adverse the condemnation is exceedingly embittered it is aggravated by coming from lips professing friendship and pronouncing judgment with sorrow and reluctance taking in the whole view of life it is more safe to live under the jurisdiction of severe but steady reason than under the empire of indulgent but capricious passion it is certainly well for mr burke that there are impartial men in the world to them i address myself pending the appeal which on his part is made from the living to the dead from the modern whigs to the ancient  the gentlemen who in the name of the party have passed sentence on mr burkes book in the light of literary criticism are judges above all challenge he did not indeed flatter himself that as a writer he could claim the approbation of men whose talents in his judgment and in the public judgment approach to prodigies if ever such persons should be disposed to estimate the merit of a composition upon the standard of their own ability  in their critical censure though mr burke may find himself humbled by it as a writer as a man and as an englishman he finds matter not only of consolation but of pride he proposed to convey to a foreign people not his own ideas but the prevalent opinions and sentiments of a nation renowned for wisdom and celebrated in all ages for a wellunderstood and wellregulated love of freedom this was the avowed purpose of the far greater part of his work as that work has not been ill received and as his critics will not only admit but contend that this reception could not be owing to any excellence in the composition capable of perverting the public judgment it is clear that he is not disavowed by the nation whose sentiments he had undertaken to describe his representation is authenticated by the verdict of his country had his piece as a work of skill been thought worthy of commendation some doubt might have been entertained of the cause of his success but the matter stands exactly as he wishes it he is more happy to have his fidelity in representation recognized by the body of the people than if he were to be ranked in point of ability and higher he could not be ranked with those whose critical censure he has had the misfortune to incur  it is not from this part of their decision which the author wishes an appeal there are things which touch him more nearly to abandon them would argue not diffidence in his abilities but treachery to his cause had his work been recognized as a pattern for dexterous argument and powerful eloquence yet if it tended to establish maxims or to inspire sentiments adverse to the wise and free constitution of this kingdom he would only have cause to lament that it possessed qualities fitted to perpetuate the memory of his offence oblivion would be the only means of his escaping the reproaches of posterity but after receiving the common allowance due to the common weakness of man he wishes to owe no part of the indulgence of the world to its forgetfulness he is at issue with the party before the present and if ever he can reach it before the coming generation  the author several months previous to his publication well knew that two gentlemen both of them possessed of the most distinguished abilities and of a most decisive authority in the party had differed with him in one of the most material points relative to the french revolution that is in their opinion of the behavior of the french soldiery and its revolt from its officers at the time of their public declaration on this subject he did not imagine the opinion of these two gentlemen had extended a great way beyond themselves he was however well aware of the probability that persons of their just credit and influence would at length dispose the greater number to an agreement with their sentiments and perhaps might induce the whole body to a tacit acquiescence in their declarations under a natural and not always an improper dislike of showing a difference with those who lead their party i will not deny that in general this conduct in parties is defensible but within what limits the practice is to be circumscribed and with what exceptions the doctrine which supports it is to be received it is not my present purpose to define the present question has nothing to do with their motives it only regards the public expression of their sentiments  the author is compelled however reluctantly to receive the sentence pronounced upon him in the house of commons as that of the party it proceeded from the mouth of him who must be regarded as its authentic organ in a discussion which continued for two days no one gentleman of the opposition interposed a negative or even a doubt in favor of him or his opinions if an idea consonant to the doctrine of his book or favorable to his conduct lurks in the minds of any persons in that description it is to be considered only as a peculiarity which they indulge to their own private liberty of thinking the author cannot reckon upon it it has nothing to do with them as members of a party in their public capacity in everything that meets the public ear or public eye the body must be considered as unanimous  they must have been animated with a very warm zeal against those opinions because they were under no necessity of acting as they did from any just cause of apprehension that the errors of this writer should be taken for theirs they might disapprove it was not necessary they should disavow him as they have done in the whole and in all the parts of his book because neither in the whole nor in any of the parts were they directly or by any implication involved the author was known indeed to have been warmly strenuously and affectionately against all allurements of ambition and all possibility of alienation from pride or personal pique or peevish jealousy attached to the whig party with one of them he has had a long friendship which he must ever remember with a melancholy pleasure to the great real and amiable virtues and to the unequalled abilities of that gentleman he shall always join with his country in paying a just tribute of applause there are others in that party for whom without any shade of sorrow he bears as high a degree of love as can enter into the human heart and as much veneration as ought to be paid to human creatures because he firmly believes that they are endowed with as many and as great virtues as the nature of man is capable of producing joined to great clearness of intellect to a just judgment to a wonderful temper and to true wisdom his sentiments with regard to them can never vary without subjecting him to the just indignation of mankind who are bound and are generally disposed to look up with reverence to the best patterns of their species and such as give a dignity to the nature of which we all participate for the whole of the party he has high respect upon a view indeed of the composition of all parties he finds great satisfaction it is that in leaving the service of his country he leaves parliament without all comparison richer in abilities than he found it very solid and very brilliant talents distinguish the ministerial benches the opposite rows are a sort of seminary of genius and have brought forth such and so great talents as never before amongst us at least have appeared together if their owners are disposed to serve their country he trusts they are they are in a condition to render it services of the highest importance if through mistake or passion they are led to contribute to its ruin we shall at least have a consolation denied to the ruined country that adjoins us we shall not be destroyed by men of mean or secondary capacities  all these considerations of party attachment of personal regard and of personal admiration rendered the author of the reflections extremely cautious lest the slightest suspicion should arise of his having undertaken to express the sentiments even of a single man of that description his words at the outset of his reflections are these  in the first letter i had the honor to write to you and which at length i send i wrote neither for nor from any description of men nor shall i in this my errors if any are my own my reputation alone is to answer for them in another place he says p 1267 i have no mans proxy i speak only from myself when i disclaim as i do with all possible earnestness all communion with the actors in that triumph or with the admirers of it when i assert anything else as concerning the people of england i speak from observation not from authority  to say then that the book did not contain the sentiments of their party is not to contradict the author or to clear themselves if the party had denied his doctrines to be the current opinions of the majority in the nation they would have put the question on its true issue there i hope and believe his censurers will find on the trial that the author is as faithful a representative of the general sentiment of the people of england as any person amongst them can be of the ideas of his own party  the french revolution can have no connection with the objects of any parties in england formed before the period of that event unless they choose to imitate any of its acts or to consolidate any principles of that revolution with their own opinions the french revolution is no part of their original contract the matter standing by itself is an open subject of political discussion like all the other revolutions and there are many which have been attempted or accomplished in our age but if any considerable number of british subjects taking a factious interest in the proceedings of france begin publicly to incorporate themselves for the subversion of nothing short of the whole constitution of this kingdomto incorporate themselves for the utter overthrow of the body of its laws civil and ecclesiastical and with them of the whole system of its manners in favor of the new constitution and of the modern usages of the french nationi think no party principle could bind the author not to express his sentiments strongly against such a faction on the contrary he was perhaps bound to mark his dissent when the leaders of the party were daily going out of their way to make public declarations in parliament which notwithstanding the purity of their intentions had a tendency to encourage illdesigning men in their practices against our constitution  the members of this faction leave no doubt of the nature and the extent of the mischief they mean to produce they declare it openly and decisively their intentions are not left equivocal they are put out of all dispute by the thanks which formally and as it were officially they issue in order to recommend and to promote the circulation of the most atrocious and treasonable libels against all the hitherto cherished objects of the love and veneration of this people is it contrary to the duty of a good subject to reprobate such proceedings is it alien to the office of a good member of parliament when such practices increase and when the audacity of the conspirators grows with their impunity to point out in his place their evil tendency to the happy constitution which he is chosen to guard is it wrong in any sense to render the people of england sensible how much they must suffer if unfortunately such a wicked faction should become possessed in this country of the same power which their allies in the very next to us have so perfidiously usurped and so outrageously abused is it inhuman to prevent if possible the spilling their blood or imprudent to guard against the effusion of our own is it contrary to any of the honest principles of party or repugnant to any of the known duties of friendship for any senator respectfully and amicably to caution his brother members against countenancing by inconsiderate expressions a sort of proceeding which it is impossible they should deliberately approve  he had undertaken to demonstrate by arguments which he thought could not be refuted and by documents which he was sure could not be denied that no comparison was to be made between the british government and the french usurpationthat they who endeavored madly to compare them were by no means making the comparison of one good system with another good system which varied only in local and circumstantial differences much less that they were holding out to us a superior pattern of legal liberty which we might substitute in the place of our old and as they describe it superannuated constitution he meant to demonstrate that the french scheme was not a comparative good but a positive evilthat the question did not at all turn as it had been stated on a parallel between a monarchy and a republic he denied that the present scheme of things in france did at all deserve the respectable name of a republic he had therefore no comparison between monarchies and republics to makethat what was done in france was a wild attempt to methodize anarchy to perpetuate and fix disorder that it was a foul impious monstrous thing wholly out of the course of moral nature he undertook to prove that it was generated in treachery fraud falsehood hypocrisy and unprovoked murderhe offered to make out that those who have led in that business had conducted themselves with the utmost perfidy to their colleagues in function and with the most flagrant perjury both towards their king and their constituents to the one of whom the assembly had sworn fealty and to the other when under no sort of violence or constraint they had sworn a full obedience to instructionsthat by the terror of assassination they had driven away a very great number of the members so as to produce a false appearance of a majoritythat this fictitious majority had fabricated a constitution which as now it stands is a tyranny far beyond any example that can be found in the civilized european world of our age that therefore the lovers of it must be lovers not of liberty but if they really understand its nature of the lowest and basest of all servitude  he proposed to prove that the present state of things in france is not a transient evil productive as some have too favorably represented it of a lasting good but that the present evil is only the means of producing future and if that were possible worse evilsthat it is not an undigested imperfect and crude scheme of liberty which may gradually be mellowed and ripened into an orderly and social freedom but that it is so fundamentally wrong as to be utterly incapable of correcting itself by any length of time or of being formed into any mode of polity of which a member of the house of commons could publicly declare his approbation  if it had been permitted to mr burke he would have shown distinctly and in detail that what the assembly calling itself national had held out as a large and liberal toleration is in reality a cruel and insidious religious persecution infinitely more bitter than any which had been heard of within this centurythat it had a feature in it worse than the old persecutionsthat the old persecutors acted or pretended to act from zeal towards some system of piety and virtue they gave strong preferences to their own and if they drove people from one religion they provided for them another in which men might take refuge and expect consolationthat their new persecution is not against a variety in conscience but against all conscience that it professes contempt towards its object and whilst it treats all religion with scorn is not so much as neutral about the modes it unites the opposite evils of intolerance and of indifference  he could have proved that it is so far from rejecting tests as unaccountably had been asserted that the assembly had imposed tests of a peculiar hardship arising from a cruel and premeditated pecuniary fraud tests against old principles sanctioned by the laws and binding upon the consciencethat these tests were not imposed as titles to some new honor or some new benefit but to enable men to hold a poor compensation for their legal estates of which they had been unjustly deprived and as they had before been reduced from affluence to indigence so on refusal to swear against their conscience they are now driven from indigence to famine and treated with every possible degree of outrage insult and inhumanitythat these tests which their imposers well knew would not be taken were intended for the very purpose of cheating their miserable victims out of the compensation which the tyrannic impostors of the assembly had previously and purposely rendered the public unable to pay that thus their ultimate violence arose from their original fraud  he would have shown that the universal peace and concord amongst nations which these common enemies to mankind had held out with the same fraudulent ends and pretences with which they had uniformly conducted every part of their proceeding was a coarse and clumsy deception unworthy to be proposed as an example by an informed and sagacious british senator to any other countrythat far from peace and goodwill to men they meditated war against all other governments and proposed systematically to excite in them all the very worst kind of seditions in order to lead to their common destructionthat they had discovered in the few instances in which they have hitherto had the power of discovering it as at avignon and in the comtat at cavaillon and at carpentras in what a savage manner they mean to conduct the seditions and wars they have planned against their neighbors for the sake of putting themselves at the head of a confederation of republics as wild and as mischievous as their own he would have shown in what manner that wicked scheme was carried on in those places without being directly either owned or disclaimed in hopes that the undone people should at length be obliged to fly to their tyrannic protection as some sort of refuge from their barbarous and treacherous hostility he would have shown from those examples that neither this nor any other society could be in safety as long as such a public enemy was in a condition to continue directly or indirectly such practices against its peacethat great britain was a principal object of their machinations and that they had begun by establishing correspondences communications and a sort of federal union with the factious herethat no practical enjoyment of a thing so imperfect and precarious as human happiness must be even under the very best of governments could be a security for the existence of these governments during the prevalence of the principles of france propagated from that grand school of every disorder and every vice  he was prepared to show the madness of their declaration of the pretended rights of manthe childish futility of some of their maxims the gross and stupid absurdity and the palpable falsity of others and the mischievous tendency of all such declarations to the wellbeing of men and of citizens and to the safety and prosperity of every just commonwealth he was prepared to show that in their conduct the assembly had directly violated not only every sound principle of government but every one without exception of their own false or futile maxims and indeed every rule they had pretended to lay down for their own direction  in a word he was ready to show that those who could after such a full and fair exposure continue to countenance the french insanity were not mistaken politicians but bad men but he thought that in this case as in many others ignorance had been the cause of admiration  these are strong assertions they required strong proofs the member who laid down these positions was and is ready to give in his place to each position decisive evidence correspondent to the nature and quality of the several allegations  in order to judge on the propriety of the interruption given to mr burke in his speech in the committee of the quebec bill it is necessary to inquire first whether on general principles he ought to have been suffered to prove his allegations secondly whether the time he had chosen was so very unseasonable as to make his exercise of a parliamentary right productive of ill effects on his friends or his country thirdly whether the opinions delivered in his book and which he had begun to expatiate upon that day were in contradiction to his former principles and inconsistent with the general tenor of his public conduct  they who have made eloquent panegyrics on the french revolution and who think a free discussion so very advantageous in every case and under every circumstance ought not in my opinion to have prevented their eulogies from being tried on the test of facts if their panegyric had been answered with an invective bating the difference in point of eloquence the one would have been as good as the other that is they would both of them have been good for nothing the panegyric and the satire ought to be suffered to go to trial and that which shrinks from if must be contented to stand at best as a mere declamation  i do not think mr burke was wrong in the course he took that which seemed to be recommended to him by mr pitt was rather to extol the english constitution than to attack the french i do not determine what would be best for mr pitt to do in his situation i do not deny that he may have good reasons for his reserve perhaps they might have been as good for a similar reserve on the part of mr fox if his zeal had suffered him to listen to them but there were no motives of ministerial prudence or of that prudence which ought to guide a man perhaps on the eve of being minister to restrain the author of the reflections he is in no office under the crown he is not the organ of any party  the excellencies of the british constitution had already exercised and exhausted the talents of the best thinkers and the most eloquent writers and speakers that the world ever saw but in the present case a system declared to be far better and which certainly is much newer to restless and unstable minds no small recommendation was held out to the admiration of the good people of england in that case it was surely proper for those who had far other thoughts of the french constitution to scrutinize that plan which has been recommended to our imitation by active and zealous factions at home and abroad our complexion is such that we are palled with enjoyment and stimulated with hopethat we become less sensible to a longpossessed benefit from the very circumstance that it is become habitual specious untried ambiguous prospects of new advantage recommend themselves to the spirit of adventure which more or less prevails in every mind from this temper men and factions and nations too have sacrificed the good of which they had been in assured possession in favor of wild and irrational expectations what should hinder mr burke if he thought this temper likely at one time or other to prevail in our country from exposing to a multitude eager to game the false calculations of this lottery of fraud  i allow as i ought to do for the effusions which come from a general zeal for liberty this is to be indulged and even to be encouraged as long as the question is general an orator above all men ought to be allowed a full and free use of the praise of liberty a commonplace in favor of slavery and tyranny delivered to a popular assembly would indeed be a bold defiance to all the principles of rhetoric but in a question whether any particular constitution is or is not a plan of rational liberty this kind of rhetorical flourish in favor of freedom in general is surely a little out of its place it is virtually a begging of the question it is a song of triumph before the battle  but mr fox does not make the panegyric of the new constitution it is the destruction only of the absolute monarchy he commends when that nameless thing which has been lately set up in france was described as the most stupendous and glorious edifice of liberty which had been erected on the foundation of human integrity in any time or country it might at first have led the hearer into an opinion that the construction of the new fabric was an object of admiration as well as the demolition of the old mr fox however has explained himself and it would be too like that captious and cavilling spirit which i so perfectly detest if i were to pin down the language of an eloquent and ardent mind to the punctilious exactness of a pleader then mr fox did not mean to applaud that monstrous thing which by the courtesy of france they call a constitution i easily believe it far from meriting the praises of a great genius like mr fox it cannot be approved by any man of common sense or common information he cannot admire the change of one piece of barbarism for another and a worse he cannot rejoice at the destruction of a monarchy mitigated by manners respectful to laws and usages and attentive perhaps but too attentive to public opinion in favor of the tyranny of a licentious ferocious and savage multitude without laws manners or morals and which so far from respecting the general sense of mankind insolently endeavors to alter all the principles and opinions which have hitherto guided and contained the world and to force them into a conformity to their views and actions his mind is made to better things  that a man should rejoice and triumph in the destruction of an absolute monarchythat in such an event he should overlook the captivity disgrace and degradation of an unfortunate prince and the continual danger to a life which exists only to be endangeredthat he should overlook the utter ruin of whole orders and classes of men extending itself directly or in its nearest consequences to at least a million of our kind and to at least the temporary wretchedness of a whole communityi do not deny to be in some sort natural because when people see a political object which they ardently desire but in one point of view they are apt extremely to palliate or underrate the evils which may arise in obtaining it this is no reflection on the humanity of those persons their goodnature i am the last man in the world to dispute it only shows that they are not sufficiently informed or sufficiently considerate when they come to reflect seriously on the transaction they will think themselves bound to examine what the object is that has been acquired by all this havoc they will hardly assert that the destruction of an absolute monarchy is a thing good in itself without any sort of reference to the antecedent state of things or to consequences which result from the changewithout any consideration whether under its ancient rule a country was to a considerable degree flourishing and populous highly cultivated and highly commercial and whether under that domination though personal liberty had been precarious and insecure property at least was ever violated they cannot take the moral sympathies of the human mind along with them in abstractions separated from the good or evil condition of the state from the quality of actions and the character of the actors none of us love absolute and uncontrolled monarchy but we could not rejoice at the sufferings of a marcus aurelius or a trajan who were absolute monarchs as we do when nero is condemned by the senate to be punished more majorum nor when that monster was obliged to fly with his wife sporus and to drink puddle were men affected in the same manner as when the venerable galba with all his faults and errors was murdered by a revolted mercenary soldiery with such things before our eyes our feelings contradict our theories and when this is the case the feelings are true and the theory is false what i contend for is that in commending the destruction of an absolute monarchy all the circumstances ought not to be wholly overlooked as considerations fit only for shallow and superficial minds the words of mr fox or to that effect  the subversion of a government to deserve any praise must be considered but as a step preparatory to the formation of something better either in the scheme of the government itself or in the persons who administer it or in both these events cannot in reason be separated for instance when we praise our revolution of 1688 though the nation in that act was on the defensive and was justified in incurring all the evils of a defensive war we do not rest there we always combine with the subversion of the old government the happy settlement which followed when we estimate that revolution we mean to comprehend in our calculation both the value of the thing parted with and the value of the thing received in exchange  the burden of proof lies heavily on those who tear to pieces the whole frame and contexture of their country that they could find no other way of settling a government fit to obtain its rational ends except that which they have pursued by means unfavorable to all the present happiness of millions of people and to the utter ruin of several hundreds of thousands in their political arrangements men have no right to put the wellbeing of the present generation wholly out of the question perhaps the only moral trust with any certainty in our hands is the care of our own time with regard to futurity we are to treat it like a ward we are not so to attempt an improvement of his fortune as to put the capital of his estate to any hazard  it is not worth our while to discuss like sophisters whether in no case some evil for the sake of some benefit is to be tolerated nothing universal can be rationally affirmed on any moral or any political subject pure metaphysical abstraction does not belong to these matters the lines of morality are not like the ideal lines of mathematics they are broad and deep as well as long they admit of exceptions they demand modifications these exceptions and modifications are not made by the process of logic but by the rules of prudence prudence is not only the first in rank of the virtues political and moral but she is the director the regulator the standard of them all metaphysics cannot live without definition but prudence is cautious how she defines our courts cannot be more fearful in suffering fictitious cases to be brought before them for eliciting their determination on a point of law than prudent moralists are in putting extreme and hazardous cases of conscience upon emergencies not existing without attempting therefore to define what never can be defined the case of a revolution in government this i think may be safely affirmedthat a sore and pressing evil is to be removed and that a good great in its amount and unequivocal in its nature must be probable almost to certainty before the inestimable price of our own morals and the wellbeing of a number of our fellowcitizens is paid for a revolution if ever we ought to be economists even to parsimony it is in the voluntary production of evil every revolution contains in it something of evil  it must always be to those who are the greatest amateurs or even professors of revolutions a matter very hard to prove that the late french government was so bad that nothing worse in the infinite devices of men could come in its place they who have brought france to its present condition ought to prove also by something better than prattling about the bastile that their subverted government was as incapable as the present certainly is of all improvement and correction how dare they to say so who have never made that experiment they are experimenters by their trade they have made an hundred others infinitely more hazardous  the english admirers of the fortyeight thousand republics which form the french federation praise them not for what they are but for what they are to become they do not talk as politicians but as prophets but in whatever character they choose to found panegyric on prediction it will be thought a little singular to praise any work not for its own merits but for the merits of something else which may succeed to it when any political institution is praised in spite of great and prominent faults of every kind and in all its parts it must be supposed to have something excellent in its fundamental principles it must be shown that it is right though imperfectthat it is not only by possibility susceptible of improvement but that it contains in it a principle tending to its melioration  before they attempt to show this progression of their favorite work from absolute pravity to finished perfection they will find themselves engaged in a civil war with those whose cause they maintain what alter our sublime constitution the glory of france the envy of the world the pattern for mankind the masterpiece of legislation the collected and concentrated glory of this enlightened age have we not produced it readymade and readyarmed mature in its birth a perfect goddess of wisdom and of war hammered by our blacksmith midwives out of the brain of jupiter himself have we not sworn our devout profane believing infidel people to an allegiance to this goddess even before she had burst the dura mater and as yet existed only in embryo have we not solemnly declared this constitution unalterable by any future legislature have we not bound it on posterity forever though our abettors have declared that no one generation is competent to bind another have we not obliged the members of every future assembly to qualify themselves for their seats by swearing to its conservation  indeed the french constitution always must be if a change is not made in all their principles and fundamental arrangements a government wholly by popular representation it must be this or nothing the french faction considers as an usurpation as an atrocious violation of the indefensible rights of man every other description of government take it or leave it there is no medium let the irrefragable doctors fight out their own controversy in their own way and with their own weapons and when they are tired let them commence a treaty of peace let the plenipotentiary sophisters of england settle with the diplomatic sophisters of france in what manner right is to be corrected by an infusion of wrong and how truth may be rendered more true by a due intermixture of falsehood                                       having sufficiently proved that nothing could make it generally improper for mr burke to prove what he had alleged concerning the object of this dispute i pass to the second question that is whether he was justified in choosing the committee on the quebec bill as the field for this discussion if it were necessary it might be shown that he was not the first to bring these discussions into parliament nor the first to renew them in this session the fact is notorious as to the quebec bill they were introduced into the debate upon that subject for two plain reasons first that as he thought it then not advisable to make the proceedings of the factious societies the subject of a direct motion he had no other way open to him nobody has attempted to show that it was at all admissible into any other business before the house here everything was favorable here was a bill to form a new constitution for a french province under english dominion the question naturally arose whether we should settle that constitution upon english ideas or upon french this furnished an opportunity for examining into the value of the french constitution either considered as applicable to colonial government or in its own nature the bill too was in a committee by the privilege of speaking as often as he pleased he hoped in some measure to supply the want of support which he had but too much reason to apprehend in a committee it was always in his power to bring the questions from generalities to facts from declamation to discussion some benefit he actually received from this privilege these are plain obvious natural reasons for his conduct i believe they are the true and the only true ones  they who justify the frequent interruptions which at length wholly disabled him from proceeding attribute their conduct to a very different interpretation of his motives they say that through corruption or malice or folly he was acting his part in a plot to make his friend mr fox pass for a republican and thereby to prevent the gracious intentions of his sovereign from taking effect which at that time had begun to disclose themselves in his favor8 this is a pretty serious charge this on mr burkes part would be something more than mistake something worse than formal irregularity any contumely any outrage is readily passed over by the indulgence which we all owe to sudden passion these things are soon forgot upon occasions in which all men are so apt to forget themselves deliberate injuries to a degree must be remembered because they require deliberate precautions to be secured against their return  i am authorized to say for mr burke that he considers that cause assigned for the outrage offered to him as ten times worse than the outrage itself there is such a strange confusion of ideas on this subject that it is far more difficult to understand the nature of the charge than to refute it when understood mr foxs friends were it seems seized with a sudden panic terror lest he should pass for a republican i do not think they had any ground for this apprehension but let us admit they had what was there in the quebec bill rather than in any other which could subject him or them to that imputation nothing in a discussion of the french constitutions which might arise on the quebec bill could tend to make mr fox pass for a republican except he should take occasion to extol that state of things in france which affects to be a republic or a confederacy of republics if such an encomium could make any unfavorable impression on the kings mind surely his voluntary panegyrics on that event not so much introduced as intruded into other debates with which they had little relation must have produced that effect with much more certainty and much greater force the quebec bill at worst was only one of those opportunities carefully sought and industriously improved by himself mr sheridan had already brought forth a panegyric on the french system in a still higher strain with full as little demand from the nature of the business before the house in a speech too good to be speedily forgotten mr fox followed him without any direct call from the subjectmatter and upon the same ground to canvass the merits of the french constitution on the quebec bill could not draw forth any opinions which were not brought forward before with no small ostentation and with very little of necessity or perhaps of propriety what mode or what time of discussing the conduct of the french faction in england would not equally tend to kindle this enthusiasm and afford those occasions for panegyric which far from shunning mr fox has always industriously sought he himself said very truly in the debate that no artifices were necessary to draw from him his opinions upon that subject but to fall upon mr burke for making an use at worst not more irregular of the same liberty is tantamount to a plain declaration that the topic of franco is tabooed or forbidden ground to mr burke and to mr burke alone but surely mr fox is not a republican and what should hinder him when such a discussion came on from clearing himself unequivocally as his friends say he had done near a fortnight before of all such imputations instead of being a disadvantage to him he would have defeated all his enemies and mr burke since he has thought proper to reckon him amongst them  but it seems some newspaper or other had imputed to him republican principles on occasion of his conduct upon the quebec bill supposing mr burke to have seen these newspapers which is to suppose more than i believe to be true i would ask when did the newspapers forbear to charge mr fox or mr burke himself with republican principles or any other principles which they thought could render both of them odious sometimes to one description of people sometimes to another mr burke since the publication of his pamphlet has been a thousand times charged in the newspapers with holding despotic principles he could not enjoy one moment of domestic quiet he could not perform the least particle of public duty if he did not altogether disregard the language of those libels but however his sensibility might be affected by such abuse it would in him have been thought a most ridiculous reason for shutting up the mouths of mr fox or mr sheridan so as to prevent their delivering their sentiments of the french revolution that forsooth the newspapers had lately charged mr burke with being an enemy to liberty  i allow that those gentlemen have privileges to which mr burke has no claim but their friends ought to plead those privileges and not to assign bad reasons on the principle of what is fair between man and man and thereby to put themselves on a level with those who can so easily refute them let them say at once that his reputation is of no value and that he has no call to assert itbut that theirs is of infinite concern to the party and the public and to that consideration he ought to sacrifice all his opinions and all his feelings  in that language i should hear a style correspondent to the proceedinglofty indeed but plain and consistent admit however for a moment and merely for argument that this gentleman had as good a right to continue as they had to begin these discussions in candor and equity they must allow that their voluntary descant in praise of the french constitution was as much an oblique attack on mr burke as mr burkes inquiry into the foundation of this encomium could possibly be construed into an imputation upon them they well knew that he felt like other men and of course he would think it mean and unworthy to decline asserting in his place and in the front of able adversaries the principles of what he had penned in his closet and without an opponent before him they could not but be convinced that declamations of this kind would rouse himthat he must think coming from men of their calibre they were highly mischievousthat they gave countenance to bad men and bad designs and though he was aware that the handling such matters in parliament was delicate yet he was a man very likely whenever much against his will they were brought there to resolve that there they should be thoroughly sifted mr fox early in the preceding session had public notice from mr burke of the light in which he considered every attempt to introduce the example of france into the politics of this country and of his resolution to break with his host friends and to join with his worst enemies to prevent it he hoped that no such necessity would ever exist but in case it should his determination was made the party knew perfectly that he would at least defend himself he never intended to attack mr fox nor did he attack him directly or indirectly his speech kept to its matter no personality was employed even in the remotest allusion he never did impute to that gentleman any republican principles or any other bad principles or bad conduct whatsoever it was far from his words it was far from his heart it must be remembered that notwithstanding the attempt of mr fox to fix on mr burke an unjustifiable change of opinion and the foul crime of teaching a set of maxims to a boy and afterwards when these maxims became adult in his mature age of abandoning both the disciple and the doctrine mr burke never attempted in any one particular either to criminate or to recriminate it may be said that he had nothing of the kind in his power this he does not controvert he certainly had it not in his inclination that gentleman had as little ground for the charges which he was so easily provoked to make upon him  the gentlemen of the party i include mr fox have been kind enough to consider the dispute brought on by this business and the consequent separation of mr burke from their corps as a matter of regret and uneasiness i cannot be of opinion that by his exclusion they have had any loss at all a man whose opinions are so very adverse to theirs adverse as it was expressed as pole to pole so mischievously as well as so directly adverse that they found themselves under the necessity of solemnly disclaiming them in full parliamentsuch a man must ever be to them a most unseemly and unprofitable incumbrance a coöperation with him could only serve to embarrass them in all their councils they have besides publicly represented him as a man capable of abusing the docility and confidence of ingenuous youthand for a bad reason or for no reason of disgracing his whole public life by a scandalous contradiction of every one of his own acts writings and declarations if these charges be true their exclusion of such a person from their body is a circumstance which does equal honor to their justice and their prudence if they express a degree of sensibility in being obliged to execute this wise and just sentence from a consideration of some amiable or some pleasant qualities which in his private life their former friend may happen to possess they add to the praise of their wisdom and firmness the merit of great tenderness of heart and humanity of disposition  on their ideas the new whig party have in my opinion acted as became them the author of the reflections however on his part cannot without great shame to himself and without entailing everlasting disgrace on his posterity admit the truth or justice of the charges which have been made upon him or allow that he has in those reflections discovered any principles to which honest men are bound to declare not a shade or two of dissent but a total fundamental opposition he must believe if he does not mean wilfully to abandon his cause and his reputation that principles fundamentally at variance with those of his book are fundamentally false what those principles the antipodes to his really are he can only discover from their contrariety he is very unwilling to suppose that the doctrines of some books lately circulated are the principles of the party though from the vehement declarations against his opinions he is at some loss how to judge otherwise  for the present my plan does not render it necessary to say anything further concerning the merits either of the one set of opinions or the other the author would have discussed the merits of both in his place but he was not permitted to do so                                       i pass to the next head of chargemr burkes inconsistency it is certainly a great aggravation of his fault in embracing false opinions that in doing so he is not supposed to fill up a void but that he is guilty of a dereliction of opinions that are true and laudable this is the great gist of the charge against him it is not so much that he is wrong in his book that however is alleged also as that he has therein belied his whole life i believe if he could venture to value himself upon anything it is on the virtue of consistency that he would value himself the most strip him of this and you leave him naked indeed  in the case of any man who had written something and spoken a great deal upon very multifarious matter during upwards of twentyfive years public service and in as great a variety of important events as perhaps have ever happened in the same number of years it would appear a little hard in order to charge such a man with inconsistency to see collected by his friend a sort of digest of his sayings even to such as were merely sportive and jocular this digest however has been made with equal pains and partiality and without bringing out those passages of his writings which might tend to show with what restrictions any expressions quoted from him ought to have been understood from a great statesman he did not quite expect this mode of inquisition if it only appeared in the works of common pamphleteers mr burke might safely trust to his reputation when thus urged he ought perhaps to do a little more it shall be as little as possible for i hope not much is wanting to be totally silent on his charges would not be respectful to mr fox accusations sometimes derive a weight from the persons who make them to which they are not entitled from their matter  he who thinks that the british constitution ought to consist of the three members of three very different natures of which it does actually consist and thinks it his duty to preserve each of those members in its proper place and with its proper proportion of power must as each shall happen to be attacked vindicate the three several parts on the several principles peculiarly belonging to them he cannot assert the democratic part on the principles on which monarchy is supported nor can he support monarchy on the principles of democracy nor can he maintain aristocracy on the grounds of the one or of the other or of both all these he must support on grounds that are totally different though practically they may be and happily with us they are brought into one harmonious body a man could not be consistent in defending such various and at first view discordant parts of a mixed constitution without that sort of inconsistency with which mr burke stands charged  as any one of the great members of this constitution happens to be endangered he that is a friend to all of them chooses and presses the topics necessary for the support of the part attacked with all the strength the earnestness the vehemence with all the power of stating of argument and of coloring which he happens to possess and which the case demands he is not to embarrass the minds of his hearers or to incumber or overlay his speech by bringing into view at once as if he were reading an academic lecture all that may and ought when a just occasion presents itself to be said in favor of the other members at that time they are out of the court there is no question concerning them whilst he opposes his defence on the part where the attack is made he presumes that for his regard to the just rights of all the rest he has credit in every candid mind he ought not to apprehend that his raising fences about popular privileges this day will infer that he ought on the next to concur with those who would pull down the throne because on the next he defends the throne it ought not to be supposed that he has abandoned the rights of the people  a man who among various objects of his equal regard is secure of some and full of anxiety for the fate of others is apt to go to much greater lengths in his preference of the objects of his immediate solicitude than mr burke has ever done a man so circumstanced often seems to undervalue to vilify almost to reprobate and disown those that are out of danger this is the voice of nature and truth and not of inconsistency and false pretence the danger of anything very dear to us removes for the moment every other affection from the mind when priam had his whole thoughts employed on the body of his hector he repels with indignation and drives from him with a thousand reproaches his surviving sons who with an officious piety crowded about him to offer their assistance a good critic there is no better than mr fox would say that this is a masterstroke and marks a deep understanding of nature in the father of poetry he would despise a zoïlus who would conclude from this passage that homer meant to represent this man of affliction as hating or being indifferent and cold in his affections to the poor relics of his house or that he preferred a dead carcass to his living children  mr burke does not stand in need of an allowance of this kind which if he did by candid critics ought to be granted to him if the principles of a mixed constitution be admitted he wants no more to justify to consistency everything he has said and done during the course of a political life just touching to its close i believe that gentleman has kept himself more clear of running into the fashion of wild visionary theories or of seeking popularity through every means than any man perhaps ever did in the same situation  he was the first man who on the hustings at a popular election rejected the authority of instructions from constituentsor who in any place has argued so fully against it perhaps the discredit into which that doctrine of compulsive instructions under our constitution is since fallen may be due in a great degree to his opposing himself to it in that manner and on that occasion  the reforms in representation and the bills for shortening the duration of parliaments he uniformly and steadily opposed for many years together in contradiction to many of his best friends these friends however in his better days when they had more to hope from his service and more to fear from his loss than now they have never chose to find any inconsistency between his acts and expressions in favor of liberty and his votes on those questions but there is a time for all things  against the opinion of many friends even against the solicitation of some of them he opposed those of the church clergy who had petitioned the house of commons to be discharged from the subscription although he supported the dissenters in their petition for the indulgence which he had refused to the clergy of the established church in this as he was not guilty of it so he was not reproached with inconsistency at the same time he promoted and against the wish of several the clause that gave the dissenting teachers another subscription in the place of that which was then taken away neither at that time was the reproach of inconsistency brought against him people could then distinguish between a difference in conduct under a variation of circumstances and an inconsistency in principle it was not then thought necessary to be freed of him as of an incumbrance  these instances a few among many are produced as an answer to the insinuation of his having pursued high popular courses which in his late book he has abandoned perhaps in his whole life he has never omitted a fair occasion with whatever risk to him of obloquy as an individual with whatever detriment to his interest as a member of opposition to assert the very same doctrines which appear in that book he told the house upon an important occasion and pretty early in his service that being warned by the ill effect of a contrary procedure in great examples he had taken his ideas of liberty very low in order that they should stick to him and that he might stick to them to the end of his life  at popular elections the most rigorous casuists will remit a little of their severity they will allow to a candidate some unqualified effusions in favor of freedom without binding him to adhere to them in their utmost extent but mr burke put a more strict rule upon himself than most moralists would put upon others at his first offering himself to bristol where he was almost sure he should not obtain on that or any occasion a single tory vote in fact he did obtain but one and rested wholly on the whig interest he thought himself bound to tell to the electors both before and after his election exactly what a representative they had to expect in him  the distinguishing part of our constitution he said is its liberty to preserve that liberty inviolate is the peculiar duty and proper trust of a member of the house of commons but the liberty the only liberty i mean is a liberty connected with order and that not only exists with order and virtue but cannot exist at all without them it inheres in good and steady government as in its substance and vital principle  the liberty to which mr burke declared himself attached is not french liberty that liberty is nothing but the rein given to vice and confusion mr burke was then as he was at the writing of his reflections awfully impressed with the difficulties arising from the complex state of our constitution and our empire and that it might require in different emergencies different sorts of exertions and the successive call upon all the various principles which uphold and justify it this will appear from what he said at the close of the poll  to be a good member of parliament is let me tell you no easy taskespecially at this time when there is so strong a disposition to run into the perilous extremes of servile compliance or wild popularity to unite circumspection with vigor is absolutely necessary but it is extremely difficult we are now members for a rich commercial city this city however is but a part of a rich commercial nation the interests of which are various multiform and intricate we are members for that great nation which however is itself but part of a great empire extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthest limits of the east and of the west all these widespread interests must be consideredmust be comparedmust be reconciled if possible we are members for a free country and surely we all know that the machine of a free constitution is no simple thing but as intricate and as delicate as it is valuable we are members in a great and ancient monarchy and we must preserve religiously the true legal rights of the sovereign which form the keystone that binds together the noble and wellconstructed arch of our empire and our constitution a constitution made up of balanced powers must ever be a critical thing as such i mean to touch that part of it which comes within my reach  in this manner mr burke spoke to his constituents seventeen years ago he spoke not like a partisan of one particular member of our constitution but as a person strongly and on principle attached to them all he thought these great and essential members ought to be preserved and preserved each in its placeand that the monarchy ought not only to be secured in its peculiar existence but in its preeminence too as the presiding and connecting principle of the whole let it be considered whether the language of his book printed in 1790 differs from his speech at bristol in 1774  with equal justice his opinions on the american war are introduced as if in his late work he had belied his conduct and opinions in the debates which arose upon that great event on the american war he never had any opinions which he has seen occasion to retract or which he has ever retracted he indeed differs essentially from mr fox as to the cause of that war mr fox has been pleased to say that the americans rebelled because they thought they had not enjoyed liberty enough this cause of the war from him i have heard of for the first time it is true that those who stimulated the nation to that measure did frequently urge this topic they contended that the americans had from the beginning aimed at independencethat from the beginning they meant wholly to throw off the authority of the crown and to break their connection with the parent country this mr burke never believed when he moved his second conciliatory proposition in the year 1776 he entered into the discussion of this point at very great length and from nine several heads of presumption endeavored to prove the charge upon that people not to be true  if the principles of all he has said and wrote on the occasion be viewed with common temper the gentlemen of the party will perceive that on a supposition that the americans had rebelled merely in order to enlarge their liberty mr burke would have thought very differently of the american cause what might have been in the secret thoughts of some of their leaders it is impossible to say as far as a man so locked up as dr franklin could be expected to communicate his ideas i believe he opened them to mr burke it was i think the very day before he set out for america that a very long conversation passed between them and with a greater air of openness on the doctors side than mr burke had observed in him before in this discourse dr franklin lamented and with apparent sincerity the separation which he feared was inevitable between great britain and her colonies he certainly spoke of it as an event which gave him the greatest concern america he said would never again see such happy days as she had passed under the protection of england he observed that ours was the only instance of a great empire in which the most distant parts and members had been as well governed as the metropolis and its vicinage but that the americans were going to lose the means which secured to them this rare and precious advantage the question with them was not whether they were to remain as they had been before the troublesfor better he allowed they could not hope to bebut whether they were to give up so happy a situation without a struggle mr burke had several other conversations with him about that time in none of which soured and exasperated as his mind certainly was did he discover any other wish in favor of america than for a security to its ancient condition mr burkes conversation with other americans was large indeed and his inquiries extensive and diligent trusting to the result of all these means of information but trusting much more in the public presumptive indications i have just referred to and to the reiterated solemn declarations of their assemblies he always firmly believed that they were purely on the defensive in that rebellion he considered the americans as standing at that time and in that controversy in the same relation to england as england did to king james the second in 1688 he believed that they had taken up arms from one motive only that is our attempting to tax them without their consentto tax them for the purposes of maintaining civil and military establishments if this attempt of ours could have been practically established he thought with them that their assemblies would become totally uselessthat under the system of policy which was then pursued the americans could have no sort of security for their laws or liberties or for any part of themand that the very circumstance of our freedom would have augmented the weight of their slavery  considering the americans on that defensive footing he thought great britain ought instantly to have closed with them by the repeal of the taxing act he was of opinion that our general rights over that country would have been preserved by this timely concession9 when instead of this a boston port bill a massachusetts charter bill a fishery bill an intercourse bill i know not how many hostile bills rushed out like so many tempests from all points of the compass and were accompanied first with great fleets and armies of english and followed afterwards with great bodies of foreign troops he thought that their cause grew daily better because daily more defensiveand that ours because daily more offensive grew daily worse he therefore in two motions in two successive years proposed in parliament many concessions beyond what he had reason to think in the beginning of the troubles would ever be seriously demanded  so circumstanced he certainly never could and never did wish the colonists to be subdued by arms he was fully persuaded that if such should be the event they must be held in that subdued state by a great body of standing forces and perhaps of foreign forces he was strongly of opinion that such armies first victorious over englishmen in a conflict for english constitutional rights and privileges and afterwards habituated though in america to keep an english people in a state of abject subjection would prove fatal in the end to the liberties of england itself that in the mean time this military system would lie as an oppressive burden upon the national finances that it would constantly breed and feed new discussions full of heat and acrimony leading possibly to a new series of wars and that foreign powers whilst we continued in a state at once burdened and distracted must at length obtain a decided superiority over us on what part of his late publication or on what expression that might have escaped him in that work is any man authorized to charge mr burke with a contradiction to the line of his conduct and to the current of his doctrines on the american war the pamphlet is in the hands of his accusers let them point out the passage if they can  indeed the author has been well sifted and scrutinized by his friends he is even called to an account for every jocular and light expression a ludicrous picture which he made with regard to a passage in the speech of a late minister10 has been brought up against him that passage contained a lamentation for the loss of monarchy to the americans after they had separated from great britain he thought it to be unseasonable illjudged and illsorted with the circumstances of all the parties mr burke it seems considered it ridiculous to lament the loss of some monarch or other to a rebel people at the moment they had forever quitted their allegiance to theirs and our sovereign at the time when they had broken off all connection with this nation and had allied themselves with its enemies he certainly must have thought it open to ridicule and now that it is recalled to his memory he had i believe wholly forgotten the circumstance he recollects that he did treat it with some levity but is it a fair inference from a jest on this unseasonable lamentation that he was then an enemy to monarchy either in this or in any other country the contrary perhaps ought to be inferredif anything at all can be argued from pleasantries good or bad is it for this reason or for anything he has said or done relative to the american war that he is to enter into an alliance offensive and defensive with every rebellion in every country under every circumstance and raised upon whatever pretence is it because he did not wish the americans to be subdued by arms that he must be inconsistent with himself if he reprobates the conduct of those societies in england who alleging no one act of tyranny or oppression and complaining of no hostile attempt against our ancient laws rights and usages are now endeavoring to work the destruction of the crown of this kingdom and the whole of its constitution is he obliged from the concessions he wished to be made to the colonies to keep any terms with those clubs and federations who hold out to us as a pattern for imitation the proceedings in france in which a king who had voluntarily and formally divested himself of the right of taxation and of all other species of arbitrary power has been dethroned is it because mr burke wished to have america rather conciliated than vanquished that he must wish well to the army of republics which are set up in francea country wherein not the people but the monarch was wholly on the defensive a poor indeed and feeble defensive to preserve some fragments of the royal authority against a determined and desperate body of conspirators whose object it was with whatever certainty of crimes with whatever hazard of war and every other species of calamity to annihilate the whole of that authority to level all ranks orders and distinctions in the state and utterly to destroy property not more by their acts than in their principles  mr burke has been also reproached with an inconsistency between his late writings and his former conduct because he had proposed in parliament several economical leading to several constitutional reforms mr burke thought with a majority of the house of commons that the influence of the crown at one time was too great but after his majesty had by a gracious message and several subsequent acts of parliament reduced it to a standard which satisfied mr fox himself and apparently at least contented whoever wished to go farthest in that reduction is mr burke to allow that it would be right for us to proceed to indefinite lengths upon that subject that it would therefore be justifiable in a people owing allegiance to a monarchy and professing to maintain it not to reduce but wholly to take away all prerogative and all influence whatsoever must his having made in virtue of a plan of economical regulation a reduction of the influence of the crown compel him to allow that it would be right in the french or in us to bring a king to so abject a state as in function not to be so respectable as an undersheriff but in person not to differ from the condition of a mere prisoner one would think that such a thing as a medium had never been heard of in the moral world  this mode of arguing from your having done any thing in a certain line to the necessity of doing every thing has political consequences of other moment than those of a logical fallacy if no man can propose any diminution or modification of an invidious or dangerous power or influence in government without entitling friends turned into adversaries to argue him into the destruction of all prerogative and to a spoliation of the whole patronage of royalty i do not know what can more effectually deter persons of sober minds from engaging in any reform nor how the worst enemies to the liberty of the subject could contrive any method more fit to bring all correctives on the power of the crown into suspicion and disrepute  if say his accusers the dread of too great influence in the crown of great britain could justify the degree of reform which he adopted the dread of a return under the despotism of a monarchy might justify the people of france in going much further and reducing monarchy to its present nothingmr burke does not allow that a sufficient argument ad hominem is inferable from these premises if the horror of the excesses of an absolute monarchy furnishes a reason for abolishing it no monarchy once absolute all have been so at one period or other could ever be limited it must be destroyed otherwise no way could be found to quiet the fears of those who were formerly subjected to that sway but the principle of mr burkes proceeding ought to lead him to a very different conclusionto this conclusionthat a monarchy is a thing perfectly susceptible of reform perfectly susceptible of a balance of power and that when reformed and balanced for a great country it is the best of all governments the example of our country might have led france as it has led him to perceive that monarchy is not only reconcilable to liberty but that it may be rendered a great and stable security to its perpetual enjoyment no correctives which he proposed to the power of the crown could lead him to approve of a plan of a republic if so it may be reputed which has no correctives and which he believes to be incapable of admitting any no principle of mr burkes conduct or writings obliged him from consistency to become an advocate for an exchange of mischiefs no principle of his could compel him to justify the setting up in the place of a mitigated monarchy a new and far more despotic power under which there is no trace of liberty except what appears in confusion and in crime  mr burke does not admit that the faction predominant in france have abolished their monarchy and the orders of their state from any dread of arbitrary power that lay heavy on the minds of the people it is not very long since he has been in that country whilst there he conversed with many descriptions of its inhabitants a few persons of rank did he allows discover strong and manifest tokens of such a spirit of liberty as might be expected one day to break all bounds such gentlemen have since had more reason to repent of their want of foresight than i hope any of the same class will ever have in this country but this spirit was far from general even amongst the gentlemen as to the lower orders and those little above them in whose name the present powers domineer they were far from discovering any sort of dissatisfaction with the power and prerogatives of the crown that vain people were rather proud of them they rather despised the english for not having a monarch possessed of such high and perfect authority they had felt nothing from lettres de cachet the bastile could inspire no horrors into them this was a treat for their betters it was by art and impulse it was by the sinister use made of a season of scarcity it was under an infinitely diversified succession of wicked pretences wholly foreign to the question of monarchy or aristocracy that this light people were inspired with their present spirit of levelling their old vanity was led by art to take another turn it was dazzled and seduced by military liveries cockades and epaulets until the french populace was led to become the willing but still the proud and thoughtless instrument and victim of another domination neither did that people despise or hate or fear their nobility on the contrary they valued themselves on the generous qualities which distinguished the chiefs of their nation  so far as to the attack on mr burke in consequence of his reforms  to show that he has in his last publication abandoned those principles of liberty which have given energy to his youth and in spite of his censors will afford repose and consolation to his declining age those who have thought proper in parliament to declare against his book ought to have produced something in it which directly or indirectly militates with any rational plan of free government it is something extraordinary that they whose memories have so well served them with regard to light and ludicrous expressions which years had consigned to oblivion should not have been able to quote a single passage in a piece so lately published which contradicts anything he has formerly ever said in a style either ludicrous or serious they quote his former speeches and his former votes but not one syllable from the book it is only by a collation of the one with the other that the alleged inconsistency can be established but as they are unable to cite any such contradictory passage so neither can they show anything in the general tendency and spirit of the whole work unfavorable to a rational and generous spirit of liberty unless a warm opposition to the spirit of levelling to the spirit of impiety to the spirit of proscription plunder murder and cannibalism be adverse to the true principles of freedom  the author of that book is supposed to have passed from extreme to extreme but he has always kept himself in a medium this charge is not so wonderful it is in the nature of things that they who are in the centre of a circle should appear directly opposed to those who view them from any part of the circumference in that middle point however he will still remain though he may hear people who themselves run beyond aurora and the ganges cry out that he is at the extremity of the west  in the same debate mr burke was represented by mr fox as arguing in a manner which implied that the british constitution could not be defended but by abusing all republics ancient and modern he said nothing to give the least ground for such a censure he never abused all republics he has never professed himself a friend or an enemy to republics or to monarchies in the abstract he thought that the circumstances and habits of every country which it is always perilous and productive of the greatest calamities to force are to decide upon the form of its government there is nothing in his nature his temper or his faculties which should make him an enemy to any republic modern or ancient far from it he has studied the form and spirit of republics very early in life he has studied them with great attention and with a mind undisturbed by affection or prejudice he is indeed convinced that the science of government would be poorly cultivated without that study but the result in his mind from that investigation has been and is that neither england nor france without infinite detriment to them as well in the event as in the experiment could be brought into a republican form but that everything republican which can be introduced with safety into either of them must be built upon a monarchybuilt upon a real not a nominal monarchy as its essential basis that all such institutions whether aristocratic or democratic must originate from their crown and in all their proceedings must refer to it that by the energy of that mainspring alone those republican parts must be set in action and from thence must derive their whole legal effect as amongst us they actually do or the whole will fall into confusion these republican members have no other point but the crown in which they can possibly unite  this is the opinion expressed in mr burkes book he has never varied in that opinion since he came to years of discretion but surely if at any time of his life he had entertained other notions which however he has never held or professed to hold the horrible calamities brought upon a great people by the wild attempt to force their country into a republic might be more than sufficient to undeceive his understanding and to free it forever from such destructive fancies he is certain that many even in france have been made sick of their theories by their very success in realizing them  to fortify the imputation of a desertion from his principles his constant attempts to reform abuses have been brought forward it is true it has been the business of his strength to reform abuses in government and his last feeble efforts are employed in a struggle against them politically he has lived in that element politically he will die in it before he departs i will admit for him that he deserves to have all his titles of merit brought forth as they have been for grounds of condemnation if one word justifying or supporting abuses of any sort is to be found in that book which has kindled so much indignation in the mind of a great man on the contrary it spares no existing abuse its very purpose is to make war with abusesnot indeed to make war with the dead but with those which live and flourish and reign  the purpose for which the abuses of government are brought into view forms a very material consideration in the mode of treating them the complaints of a friend are things very different from the invectives of an enemy the charge of abuses on the late monarchy of france was not intended to lead to its reformation but to justify its destruction they who have raked into all history for the faults of kings and who have aggravated every fault they have found have acted consistently because they acted as enemies no man can be a friend to a tempered monarchy who bears a decided hatred to monarchy itself he who at the present time is favorable or even fair to that system must act towards it as towards a friend with frailties who is under the prosecution of implacable foes i think it a duty in that case not to inflame the public mind against the obnoxious person by any exaggeration of his faults it is our duty rather to palliate his errors and defects or to cast them into the shade and industriously to bring forward any good qualities that he may happen to possess but when the man is to be amended and by amendment to be preserved then the line of duty takes another direction when his safety is effectually provided for it then becomes the office of a friend to urge his faults and vices with all the energy of enlightened affection to paint them in their most vivid colors and to bring the moral patient to a better habit thus i think with regard to individuals thus i think with regard to ancient and respected governments and orders of men a spirit of reformation is never more consistent with itself than when it refuses to be rendered the means of destruction  i suppose that enough is said upon these heads of accusation one more i had nearly forgotten but i shall soon dispatch it the author of the reflections in the opening of the last parliament entered on the journals of the house of commons a motion for a remonstrance to the crown which is substantially a defence of the preceding parliament that had been dissolved under displeasure it is a defence of mr fox it is a defence of the whigs by what connection of argument by what association of ideas this apology for mr fox and his party is by him and them brought to criminate his and their apologist i cannot easily divine it is true that mr burke received no previous encouragement from mr fox nor any the least countenance or support at the time when the motion was made from him or from any gentleman of the partyone only excepted from whose friendship on that and on other occasions he derives an honor to which he must be dull indeed to be insensible11 if that remonstrance therefore was a false or feeble defence of the measures of the party they were in no wise affected by it it stands on the journals this secures to it a permanence which the author cannot expect to any other work of his let it speak for itself to the present age and to all posterity the party had no concern in it and it can never be quoted against them but in the late debate it was produced not to clear the party from an improper defence in which they had no share but for the kind purpose of insinuating an inconsistency between the principles of mr burkes defence of the dissolved parliament and those on which he proceeded in his late reflections on france  it requires great ingenuity to make out such a parallel between the two cases as to found a charge of inconsistency in the principles assumed in arguing the one and the other what relation had mr foxs india bill to the constitution of france what relation had that constitution to the question of right in an house of commons to give or to withhold its confidence from ministers and to state that opinion to the crown what had this discussion to do with mr burkes idea in 1784 of the ill consequences which must in the end arise to the crown from setting up the commons at large as an opposite interest to the commons in parliament what has this discussion to do with a recorded warning to the people of their rashly forming a precipitate judgment against their representatives what had mr burkes opinion of the danger of introducing new theoretic language unknown to the records of the kingdom and calculated to excite vexatious questions into a parliamentary proceeding to do with the french assembly which defies all precedent and places its whole glory in realizing what had been thought the most visionary theories what had this in common with the abolition of the french monarchy or with the principles upon which the english revolution was justifieda revolution in which parliament in all its acts and all its declarations religiously adheres to the form of sound words without excluding from private discussions such terms of art as may serve to conduct an inquiry for which none but private persons are responsible these were the topics of mr burkes proposed remonstrance all of which topics suppose the existence and mutual relation of our three estatesas well as the relation of the east india company to the crown to parliament and to the peculiar laws rights and usages of the people of hindostan what reference i say had these topics to the constitution of france in which there is no king no lords no commons no india company to injure or support no indian empire to govern or oppress what relation had all or any of these or any question which could arise between the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of parliament with the censure of those factious persons in great britain whom mr burke states to be engaged not in favor of privilege against prerogative or of prerogative against privilege but in an open attempt against our crown and our parliament against our constitution in church and state against all the parts and orders which compose the one and the other  no persons were more fiercely active against mr fox and against the measures of the house of commons dissolved in 1784 which mr burke defends in that remonstrance than several of those revolutionmakers whom mr burke condemns alike in his remonstrance and in his book these revolutionists indeed may be well thought to vary in their conduct he is however far from accusing them in this variation of the smallest degree of inconsistency he is persuaded that they are totally indifferent at which end they begin the demolition of the constitution some are for commencing their operations with the destruction of the civil powers in order the better to pull down the ecclesiasticalsome wish to begin with the ecclesiastical in order to facilitate the ruin of the civil some would destroy the house of commons through the crown some the crown through the house of commons and some would overturn both the one and the other through what they call the people but i believe that this injured writer will think it not at all inconsistent with his present duty or with his former life strenuously to oppose all the various partisans of destruction let them begin where or when or how they will no man would set his face more determinedly against those who should attempt to deprive them or any description of men of the rights they possess no man would be more steady in preventing them from abusing those rights to the destruction of that happy order under which they enjoy them as to their title to anything further it ought to be grounded on the proof they give of the safety with which power may be trusted in their hands when they attempt without disguise not to win it from our affections but to force it from our fears they show in the character of their means of obtaining it the use they would make of their dominion that writer is too well read in men not to know how often the desire and design of a tyrannic domination lurks in the claim of an extravagant liberty perhaps in the beginning it always displays itself in that manner no man has ever affected power which he did not hope from the favor of the existing government in any other mode                                       the attacks on the authors consistency relative to france are however grievous they may be to his feelings in a great degree external to him and to us and comparatively of little moment to the people of england the substantial charge upon him is concerning his doctrines relative to the revolution of 1688 here it is that they who speak in the name of the party have thought proper to censure him the most loudly and with the greatest asperity here they fasten and if they are right in their fact with sufficient judgment in their selection if he be guilty in this point he is equally blamable whether he is consistent or not if he endeavors to delude his countrymen by a false representation of the spirit of that leading event and of the true nature and tenure of the government formed in consequence of it he is deeply responsible he is an enemy to the free constitution of the kingdom but he is not guilty in any sense i maintain that in his reflections he has stated the revolution and the settlement upon their true principles of legal reason and constitutional policy  his authorities are the acts and declarations of parliament given in their proper words so far as these go nothing can be added to what he has quoted the question is whether he has understood them rightly i think they speak plain enough but we must now see whether he proceeds with other authority than his own constructions and if he does on what sort of authority he proceeds in this part his defence will not be made by argument but by wager of law he takes his compurgators his vouchers his guaranties along with him i know that he will not be satisfied with a justification proceeding on general reasons of policy he must be defended on party grounds too or his cause is not so tenable as i wish it to appear it must be made out for him not only that in his construction of these public acts and monuments he conforms himself to the rules of fair legal and logical interpretation but it must be proved that his construction is in perfect harmony with that of the ancient whigs to whom against the sentence of the modern on his part i here appeal  this july it will be twentysix years12 since he became connected with a man whose memory will ever be precious to englishmen of all parties as long as the ideas of honor and virtue public and private are understood and cherished in this nation that memory will be kept alive with particular veneration by all rational and honorable whigs mr burke entered into a connection with that party through that man at an age far from raw and immatureat those years when men are all they are ever likely to becomewhen he was in the prime and vigor of his lifewhen the powers of his understanding according to their standard were at the best his memory exercised his judgment formed and his reading much fresher in the recollection and much readier in the application than now it is he was at that time as likely as most men to know what were whig and what were tory principles he was in a situation to discern what sort of whig principles they entertained with whom it was his wish to form an eternal connection foolish he would have been at that time of life more foolish than any man who undertakes a public trust would be thought to adhere to a cause which he amongst all those who were engaged in it had the least sanguine hopes of as a road to power  there are who remember that on the removal of the whigs in the year 1766 he was as free to choose another connection as any man in the kingdom to put himself out of the way of the negotiations which were then carrying on very eagerly and through many channels with the earl of chatham he went to ireland very soon after the change of ministry and did not return until the meeting of parliament he was at that time free from anything which looked like an engagement he was further free at the desire of his friends for the very day of his return the marquis of rockingham wished him to accept an employment under the new system he believes he might have had such a situation but again he cheerfully took his fate with the party  it would be a serious imputation upon the prudence of my friend to have made even such trivial sacrifices as it was in his power to make for principles which he did not truly embrace or did not perfectly understand in either case the folly would have been great the question now is whether when he first practically professed whig principles he understood what principles he professed and whether in his book he has faithfully expressed them  when he entered into the whig party he did not conceive that they pretended to any discoveries they did not affect to be better whigs than those were who lived in the days in which principle was put to the test some of the whigs of those days were then living they were what the whigs had been at the revolutionwhat they had been during the reign of queen annewhat they had been at the accession of the present royal family  what they were at those periods is to be seen it rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a clear authentic recorded declaration of their political tenets upon the subject of a great constitutional event like that of the revolution the whigs had that opportunityor to speak more properly they made it the impeachment of dr sacheverell was undertaken by a whig ministry and a whig house of commons and carried on before a prevalent and steady majority of whig peers it was carried on for the express purpose of stating the true grounds and principles of the revolutionwhat the commons emphatically called their foundation it was carried on for the purpose of condemning the principles on which the revolution was first opposed and afterwards calumniated in order by a juridical sentence of the highest authority to confirm and fix whig principles as they had operated both in the resistance to king james and in the subsequent settlement and to fix them in the extent and with the limitations with which it was meant they should be understood by posterity the ministers and managers for the commons were persons who had many of them an active share in the revolution most of them had seen it at an age capable of reflection the grand event and all the discussions which led to it and followed it were then alive in the memory and conversation of all men the managers for the commons must be supposed to have spoken on that subject the prevalent ideas of the leading party in the commons and of the whig ministry undoubtedly they spoke also their own private opinions and the private opinions of such men are not without weight they were not umbratiles doctores men who had studied a free constitution only in its anatomy and upon dead systems they knew it alive and in action  in this proceeding the whig principles as applied to the revolution and settlement are to be found or they are to be found nowhere i wish the whig readers of this appeal first to turn to mr burkes reflections from page 20 to page 5013 and then to attend to the following extracts from the trial of dr sacheverell after this they will consider two things first whether the doctrine in mr burkes reflections be consonant to that of the whigs of that period and secondly whether they choose to abandon the principles which belonged to the progenitors of some of them and to the predecessors of them all and to learn new principles of whiggism imported from france and disseminated in this country from dissenting pulpits from federation societies and from the pamphlets which as containing the political creed of those synods are industriously circulated in all parts of the two kingdoms this is their affair and they will make their option  these new whigs hold that the sovereignty whether exercised by one or many did not only originate from the people a position not denied nor worth denying or assenting to but that in the people the same sovereignty constantly and unalienably resides that the people may lawfully depose kings not only for misconduct but without any misconduct at all that they may set up any new fashion of government for themselves or continue without any government at their pleasure that the people are essentially their own rule and their will the measure of their conduct that the tenure of magistracy is not a proper subject of contract because magistrates have duties but no rights and that if a contract de facto is made with them in one age allowing that it binds at all it only binds those who are immediately concerned in it but does not pass to posterity these doctrines concerning the people a term which they are far from accurately defining but by which from many circumstances it is plain enough they mean their own faction if they should grow by early arming by treachery or violence into the prevailing force tend in my opinion to the utter subversion not only of all government in all modes and to all stable securities to rational freedom but to all the rules and principles of morality itself  i assert that the ancient whigs held doctrines totally different from those i have last mentioned i assert that the foundations laid down by the commons on the trial of dr sacheverell for justifying the revolution of 1688 are the very same laid down in mr burkes reflectionsthat is to say a breach of the original contrast implied and expressed in the constitution of this country as a scheme of government fundamentally and inviolably fixed in king lords and commonsthat the fundamental subversion of this ancient constitution by one of its parts having been attempted and in effect accomplished justified the revolutionthat it was justified only upon the necessity of the case as the only means left for the recovery of that ancient constitution formed by the original contract of the british state as well as for the future preservation of the same government these are the points to be proved  a general opening to the charge against dr sacheverell was made by the attorneygeneral sir john montague but as there is nothing in that opening speech which tends very accurately to settle the principle upon which the whigs proceeded in the prosecution the plan of the speech not requiring it i proceed to that of mr lechmere the manager who spoke next after him the following are extracts given not in the exact order in which they stand in the printed trial but in that which is thought most fit to bring the ideas of the whig commons distinctly under our view                                       mr lechmere14  it becomes an indispensable duty upon us who appear in the name and on the behalf of all the commons of great britain not only to demand your lordships justice on such a criminal dr sacheverell but clearly and openly to assert our foundations  sidenote that the terms of our constitution imply and express an original contract  sidenote that the contract is mutual consent and binding at all times upon the parties  sidenote the mixed constitution uniformly preserved for many ages and is a proof of the contract  the nature of our constitution is that of a limited monarchy wherein the supreme power is communicated and divided between queen lords and commons though the executive power and administration be wholly in the crown the terms of such a constitution do not only suppose but express an original contract between the crown and the people by which that supreme power was by mutual consent and not by accident limited and lodged in more hands than one and the uniform preservation of such a constitution for so many ages without any fundamental change demonstrates to your lordships the continuance of the same contract  sidenote laws the common measure to king and subject  sidenote case of fundamental injury and breach of original contract  the consequences of such a frame of government are obvious that the laws are the rule to both the common measure of the power of the crown and of the obedience of the subject and if the executive part endeavors the subversion and total destruction of the government the original contract is thereby broke and the right of allegiance ceases that part of the government thus fundamentally injured hath a right to save or recover that constitution in which it had an original interest  sidenote words necessary means selected with caution  the necessary means which is the phrase used by the commons in their first article words made choice of by them with the greatest caution those means are described in the preamble to their charge to be that glorious enterprise which his late majesty undertook with an armed force to deliver this kingdom from popery and arbitrary power the concurrence of many subjects of the realm who came over with him in that enterprise and of many others of all ranks and orders who appeared in arms in many parts of the kingdom in aid of that enterprise  these were the means that brought about the revolution and which the act that passed soon after declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and settling the succession of the crown intends when his late majesty is therein called the glorious instrument of delivering the kingdom and which the commons in the last part of their first article express by the word resistance  sidenote regard of the commons to their allegiance to the crown and to the ancient constitution  but the commons who will never be unmindful of the allegiance of the subjects to the crown of this realm judged it highly incumbent upon them out of regard to the safety of her majestys person and government and the ancient and legal constitution of this kingdom to call that resistance the necessary means thereby plainly founding that power of right and resistance which was exercised by the people at the time of the happy revolution and which the duties of selfpreservation and religion called them to upon the necessity of the case and at the same time effectually securing her majestys government and the due allegiance of all her subjects  sidenote all ages have the same interest in preservation of the contract and the same constitution  the nature of such an original contract of government proves that there is not only a power in the people who have inherited its freedom to assert their own title to it but they are bound in duty to transmit the same constitution to their posterity also                                       mr lechmere made a second speech notwithstanding the clear and satisfactory manner in which he delivered himself in his first upon this arduous question he thinks himself bound again distinctly to assert the same foundation and to justify the revolution on the case of necessity only upon principles perfectly coinciding with those laid down in mr burkes letter on the french affairs                                       mr lechmere  sidenote the commons strictly confine their ideas of a revolution to necessity alone and selfdefence  sidenote a nb the remark implies that allegiance would be insecure without this restriction  your lordships were acquainted in opening the charge with how great caution and with what unfeigned regard to her majesty and her government and to the duty and allegiance of her subjects the commons made choice of the words necessary means to express the resistance that was made use of to bring about the revolution and with the condemning of which the doctor is charged by this article not doubting but that the honor and justice of that resistance from the necessity of that case and to which alone we have strictly confined ourselves when duly considered would confirm and strengthena and be understood to be an effectual security of the allegiance of the subject to the crown of this realm in every other case where there is not the same necessity and that the right of the people to selfdefence and preservation of their liberties by resistance as their last remedy is the result of a case of such necessity only and by which the original contract between king and people is broke this was the principle laid down and carried through all that was said with respect to allegiance and on which foundation in the name and on the behalf of all the commons of great britain we assert and justify that resistance by which the late happy revolution was brought about  it appears to your lordships and the world that breaking the original contract between king and people were the words made choice of by that house of commons the house of commons which originated the declaration of right with the greatest deliberation and judgment and approved of by your lordships in that first and fundamental step made towards the reestablishment of the government which had received so great a shock from the evil counsels which had been given to that unfortunate prince                                       sir john hawles another of the managers follows the steps of his brethren positively affirming the doctrine of nonresistance to government to be the general moral religious and political rule for the subject and justifying the revolution on the same principle with mr burkethat is as an exception from necessity indeed he carries the doctrine on the general idea of nonresistance much further than mr burke has done and full as far as it can perhaps be supported by any duty of perfect obligation however noble and heroic it may be in many cases to suffer death rather than disturb the tranquillity of our country                                       sir john hawles15  certainly it must be granted that the doctrine that commands obedience to the supreme power though in things contrary to nature even to suffer death which is the highest injustice that can be done a man rather than make an opposition to the supreme power is reasonable16 because the death of one or some few private persons is a less evil than disturbing the whole government that law must needs be understood to forbid the doing or saying anything to disturb the government the rather because the obeying that law cannot be pretended to be against nature and the doctors refusing to obey that implicit law is the reason for which he is now prosecuted though he would have it believed that the reason he is now prosecuted was for the doctrine he asserted of obedience to the supreme power which he might have preached as long as he had pleased and the commons would have taken no offence at it if he had stopped there and not have taken upon him on that pretence or occasion to have cast odious colors upon the revolution                                       general stanhope was among the managers he begins his speech by a reference to the opinion of his fellowmanagers which he hoped had put beyond all doubt the limits and qualifications that the commons had placed to their doctrines concerning the revolution yet not satisfied with this general reference after condemning the principle of nonresistance which is asserted in the sermon without any exception and stating that under the specious pretence of preaching a peaceable doctrine sacheverell and the jacobites meant in reality to excite a rebellion in favor of the pretender he explicitly limits his ideas of resistance with the boundaries laid down by his colleagues and by mr burke                                       general stanhope  sidenote rights of the subject and the crown equally legal  the constitution of england is founded upon compact and the subjects of this kingdom have in their several public and private capacities as legal a title to what are their rights by law as a prince to the possession of his crown  sidenote justice of resistance founded on necessity  your lordships and most that hear me are witnesses and must remember the necessities of those times which brought about the revolution that no other remedy was left to preserve our religion and liberties that resistance was necessary and consequently just  had the doctor in the remaining part of his sermon preached up peace quietness and the like and shown how happy we are under her majestys administration and exhorted obedience to it he had never been called to answer a charge at your lordships bar but the tenor of all his subsequent discourse is one continued invective against the government                                       mr walpole afterwards sir robert was one of the managers on this occasion he was an honorable man and a sound whig he was not as the jacobites and discontented whigs of his time have represented him and as illinformed people still represent him a prodigal and corrupt minister they charged him in their libels and seditious conversations as having first reduced corruption to a system such was their cant but he was far from governing by corruption he governed by party attachments the charge of systematic corruption is less applicable to him perhaps than to any minister who ever served the crown for so great a length of time he gained over very few from the opposition without being a genius of the first class he was an intelligent prudent and safe minister he loved peace and he helped to communicate the same disposition to nations at least as warlike and restless as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs though he served a master who was fond of martial fame he kept all the establishments very low the land tax continued at two shillings in the pound for the greater part of his administration the other impositions were moderate the profound repose the equal liberty the firm protection of just laws during the long period of his power were the principal causes of that prosperity which afterwards took such rapid strides towards perfection and which furnished to this nation ability to acquire the military glory which it has since obtained as well as to bear the burdens the cause and consequence of that warlike reputation with many virtues public and private he had his faults but his faults were superficial a careless coarse and overfamiliar style of discourse without sufficient regard to persons or occasions and an almost total want of political decorum were the errors by which he was most hurt in the public opinion and those through which his enemies obtained the greatest advantage over him but justice must be done the prudence steadiness and vigilance of that man joined to the greatest possible lenity in his character and his politics preserved the crown to this royal family and with it their laws and liberties to this country walpole had no other plan of defence for the revolution than that of the other managers and of mr burke and he gives full as little countenance to any arbitrary attempts on the part of restless and factious men for framing new governments according to their fancies                                       mr walpole  sidenote case of resistance out of the law and the highest offence  sidenote utmost necessity justifies it  resistance is nowhere enacted to be legal but subjected by all the laws now in being to the greatest penalties tis what is not cannot nor ought ever to be described or affirmed in any positive law to be excusable when and upon what nevertobeexpected occasions it may be exercised no man can foresee and ought never to be thought of but when an utter subversion of the laws of the realm threatens the whole frame of a constitution and no redress can otherwise be hoped for it therefore does and ought forever to stand in the eye and letter of the law as the highest offence but because any man or party of men may not out of folly or wantonness commit treason or make their own discontents ill principles or disguised affections to another interest a pretence to resist the supreme power will it follow from thence that the utmost necessity ought not to engage a nation in its own defence for the preservation of the whole                                       sir joseph jekyl was as i have always heard and believed as nearly as any individual could be the very standard of whig principles in his age he was a learned and an able man full of honor integrity and public spirit no lover of innovation nor disposed to change his solid principles for the giddy fashion of the hour let us hear this whig                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote commons do not state the limits of submission  sidenote to secure the laws the only aim of the revolution  in clearing up and vindicating the justice of the revolution which was the second thing proposed it is far from the intent of the commons to state the limits and bounds of the subjects submission to the sovereign that which the law hath been wisely silent in the commons desire to be silent in too nor will they put any case of a justifiable resistance but that of the revolution only and they persuade themselves that the doing right to that resistance will be so far from promoting popular license or confusion that it will have a contrary effect and be a means of settling mens minds in the love of and veneration for the laws to rescue and secure which was the only aim and intention of those concerned in that resistance                                       dr sacheverells counsel defended him on this principle namelythat whilst he enforced from the pulpit the general doctrine of nonresistance he was not obliged to take notice of the theoretic limits which ought to modify that doctrine sir joseph jekyl in his reply whilst he controverts its application to the doctors defence fully admits and even enforces the principle itself and supports the revolution of 1688 as he and all the managers had done before exactly upon the same grounds on which mr burke has built in his reflections on the french revolution                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote blamable to state the bounds of nonresistance  sidenote resistance lawful only in case of extreme and obvious necessity  if the doctor had pretended to have stated the particular bounds and limits of nonresistance and told the people in what cases they might or might not resist he would have been much to blame nor was one word said in the articles or by the managers as if that was expected from him but on the contrary we have insisted that in no case can resistance be lawful but in case of extreme necessity and where the constitution cant otherwise be preserved and such necessity ought to be plain and obvious to the sense and judgment of the whole nation and this was the case at the revolution                                       the counsel for doctor sacheverell in defending their client were driven in reality to abandon the fundamental principles of his doctrine and to confess that an exception to the general doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance did exist in the case of the revolution this the managers for the commons considered as having gained their cause as their having obtained the whole of what they contended for they congratulated themselves and the nation on a civil victory as glorious and as honorable as any that had obtained in arms during that reign of triumphs  sir joseph jekyl in his reply to harcourt and the other great men who conducted the cause for the tory side spoke in the following memorable terms distinctly stating the whole of what the whig house of commons contended for in the name of all their constituents                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote necessity creates an exception and the revolution a case of necessity the utmost extent of the demand of the commons  my lords the concessions the concessions of sacheverells counsel are these that necessity creates an exception to the general rule of submission to the prince that such exception is understood or implied in the laws that require such submission and that the case of the revolution was a case of necessity  these are concessions so ample and do so fully answer the drift of the commons in this article and are to the utmost extent of their meaning in it that i cant forbear congratulating them upon this success of their impeachmentthat in full parliament this erroneous doctrine of unlimited nonresistance is given up and disclaimed and may it not in after ages be an addition to the glories of this bright reign that so many of those who are honored with being in her majestys service have been at your lordships bar thus successfully contending for the national rights of her people and proving they are not precarious or remediless  but to return to these concessions i must appeal to your lordships whether they are not a total departure from the doctors answer                                       i now proceed to show that the whig managers for the commons meant to preserve the government on a firm foundation by asserting the perpetual validity of the settlement then made and its coercive power upon posterity i mean to show that they gave no sort of countenance to any doctrine tending to impress the people taken separately from the legislature which includes the crown with an idea that they had acquired a moral or civil competence to alter without breach of the original compact on the part of the king the succession to the crown at their pleasuremuch less that they had acquired any right in the case of such an event as caused the revolution to set up any new form of government the author of the reflections i believe thought that no man of common understanding could oppose to this doctrine the ordinary sovereign power as declared in the act of queen anne that is that the kings or queens of the realm with the consent of parliament are competent to regulate and to settle the succession of the crown this power is and ever was inherent in the supreme sovereignty and was not as the political divines vainly talk acquired by the revolution it is declared in the old statute of queen elizabeth such a power must reside in the complete sovereignty of every kingdom and it is in fact exercised in all of them but this right of competence in the legislature not in the people is by the legislature itself to be exercised with sound discretion that is to say it is to be exercised or not in conformity to the fundamental principles of this government to the rules of moral obligation and to the faith of pacts either contained in the nature of the transaction or entered into by the body corporate of the kingdomwhich body in juridical construction never dies and in fact never loses its members at once by death  whether this doctrine is reconcilable to the modern philosophy of government i believe the author neither knows nor cares as he has little respect for any of that sort of philosophy this may be because his capacity and knowledge do not reach to it if such be the case he cannot be blamed if he acts on the sense of that incapacity he cannot be blamed if in the most arduous and critical questions which can possibly arise and which affect to the quick the vital parts of our constitution he takes the side which leans most to safety and settlement that he is resolved not to be wise beyond what is written in the legislative record and practice that when doubts arise on them he endeavors to interpret one statute by another and to reconcile them all to established recognized morals and to the general ancient known policy of the laws of england two things are equally evident the first is that the legislature possesses the power of regulating the succession of the crown the second that in the exercise of that right it has uniformly acted as if under the restraints which the author has stated that author makes what the ancients call mos majorum not indeed his sole but certainly his principal rule of policy to guide his judgment in whatever regards our laws uniformity and analogy can be preserved in them by this process only that point being fixed and laying fast hold of a strong bottom our speculations may swing in all directions without public detriment because they will ride with sure anchorage  in this manner these things have been always considered by our ancestors there are some indeed who have the art of turning the very acts of parliament which were made for securing the hereditary succession in the present royal family by rendering it penal to doubt of the validity of those acts of parliament into an instrument for defeating all their ends and purposesbut upon grounds so very foolish that it is not worth while to take further notice of such sophistry  to prevent any unnecessary subdivision i shall here put together what may be necessary to show the perfect agreement of the whigs with mr burke in his assertions that the revolution made no essential change in the constitution of the monarchy or in any of its ancient sound and legal principles that the succession was settled in the hanover family upon the idea and in the mode of an hereditary succession qualified with protestantism that it was not settled upon elective principles in any sense of the word elective or under any modification or description of election whatsoever but on the contrary that the nation after the revolution renewed by a fresh compact the spirit of the original compact of the state binding itself both in its existing members and all its posterity to adhere to the settlement of an hereditary succession in the protestant line drawn from james the first as the stock of inheritance                                       sir john hawles  sidenote necessity of settling the right of the crown and submission to the settlement  if he dr sacheverell is of the opinion he pretends i cant imagine how it comes to pass that he that pays that deference to the supreme power has preached so directly contrary to the determinations of the supreme power in this government he very well knowing that the lawfulness of the revolution and of the means whereby it was brought about has already been determined by the aforesaid acts of parliamentand do it in the worst manner that he could invent for questioning the right to the crown here in england has procured the shedding of more blood and caused more slaughter than all the other matters tending to disturbances in the government put together if therefore the doctrine which the apostles had laid down was only to continue the peace of the world as thinking the death of some few particular persons better to be borne with than a civil war sure it is the highest breach of that law to question the first principles of this government  if the doctor had been contented with the liberty he took of preaching up the duty of passive obedience in the most extensive manner he had thought fit and would have stopped there your lordships would not have had the trouble in relation to him that you now have but it is plain that he preached up his absolute and unconditional obedience not to continue the peace and tranquillity of this nation but to set the subjects at strife and to raise a war in the bowels of this nation and it is for this that he is now prosecuted though he would fain have it believed that the prosecution was for preaching the peaceable doctrine of absolute obedience                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote whole frame of government restored unhurt on the revolution  the whole tenor of the administration then in being was agreed to by all to be a total departure from the constitution the nation was at that time united in that opinion all but the criminal part of it and as the nation joined in the judgment of their disease so they did in the remedy they saw there was no remedy left but the last and when that remedy took place the whole frame of the government was restored entire and unhurt17 this showed the excellent temper the nation was in at that time that after such provocations from an abuse of the regal power and such a convulsion no one part of the constitution was altered or suffered the least damage but on the contrary the whole received new life and vigor                                       the tory counsel for dr sacheverell having insinuated that a great and essential alteration in the constitution had been wrought by the revolution sir joseph jekyl is so strong on this point that he takes fire even at the insinuation of his being of such an opinion                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote no innovation at the revolution  if the doctor instructed his counsel to insinuate that there was any innovation in the constitution wrought by the revolution it is an addition to his crime the revolution did not introduce any innovation it was a restoration of the ancient fundamental constitution of the kingdom and giving it its proper force and energy                                       the solicitorgeneral sir robert eyre distinguishes expressly the case of the revolution and its principles from a proceeding at pleasure on the part of the people to change their ancient constitution and to frame a new government for themselves he distinguishes it with the same care from the principles of regicide and republicanism and the sorts of resistance condemned by the doctrines of the church of england and which ought to be condemned by the doctrines of all churches professing christianity                                       mr solicitorgeneral sir robert eyre  sidenote revolution no precedent for voluntary cancelling allegiance  sidenote revolution not like the case of charles the first  the resistance at the revolution which was founded in unavoidable necessity could be no defence to a man that was attacked for asserting that the people might cancel their allegiance at pleasure or dethrone and murder their sovereign by a judiciary sentence for it can never be inferred from the lawfulness of resistance at a time when a total subversion of the government both in church and state was intended that a people may take up arms and call their sovereign to account at pleasure and therefore since the revolution could be of no service in giving the least color for asserting any such wicked principle the doctor could never intend to put it into the mouths of those new preachers and new politicians for a defenceunless it be his opinion that the resistance at the revolution can bear any parallel with the execrable murder of the royal martyr so justly detested by the whole nation  sidenote sacheverells doctrine intended to bring an odium on the revolution  sidenote true defence of the revolution an absolute necessity  tis plain that the doctor is not impeached for preaching a general doctrine and enforcing the general duty of obedience but for preaching against an excepted case after he has stated the exception he is not impeached for preaching the general doctrine of obedience and the utter illegality of resistance upon any pretence whatsoever but because having first laid down the general doctrine as true without any exception he states the excepted case the revolution in express terms as an objection and then assumes the consideration of that excepted case denies there was any resistance in the revolution and asserts that to impute resistance to the revolution would cast black and odious colors upon it this my lords is not preaching the doctrine of nonresistance in the general terms used by the homilies and the fathers of the church where cases of necessity may be understood to be excepted by a tacit implication as the counsel have allowedbut is preaching directly against the resistance at the revolution which in the course of this debate has been all along admitted to be necessary and just and can have no other meaning than to bring a dishonor upon the revolution and an odium upon those great and illustrious persons those friends to the monarchy and the church that assisted in bringing it about for had the doctor intended anything else he would have treated the case of the revolution in a different manner and have given it the true and fair answer he would have said that the resistance at the revolution was of absolute necessity and the only means left to revive the constitution and must be therefore taken as an excepted case and could never come within the reach or intention of the general doctrine of the church  your lordships take notice on what grounds the doctor continues to assert the same position in his answer but is it not most evident that the general exhortations to be met with in the homilies of the church of england and such like declarations in the statutes of the kingdom are meant only as rules for the civil obedience of the subject to the legal administration of the supreme power in ordinary cases and it is equally absurd to construe any words in a positive law to authorize the destruction of the whole as to expect that king lords and commons should in express terms of law declare such an ultimate resort as the right of resistance at a time when the case supposes that the force of all law is ceased18  sidenote commons abhor whatever shakes the submission of posterity to the settlement of the crown  the commons must always resent with the utmost detestation and abhorrence every position that may shake the authority of that act of parliament whereby the crown is settled upon her majesty and whereby the lords spiritual and temporal and commons do in the name of all the people of england most humbly and faithfully submit themselves their heirs and posterities to her majesty which this general principle of absolute nonresistance must certainly shake  for if the resistance at the revolution was illegal the revolution settled in usurpation and this act can have no greater force and authority than an act passed under a usurper  and the commons take leave to observe that the authority of this parliamentary settlement is a matter of the greatest consequence to maintain in a case where the hereditary right to the crown is contested  it appears by the several instances mentioned in the act declaring the rights and liberties of the subject and settling the succession of the crown that at the time of the revolution there was a total subversion of the constitution of government both in church and state which is a case that the laws of england could never suppose provide for or have in view                                       sir joseph jekyl so often quoted considered the preservation of the monarchy and of the rights and prerogatives of the crown as essential objects with all sound whigs and that they were bound not only to maintain them when injured or invaded but to exert themselves as much for their reëstablishment if they should happen to be overthrown by popular fury as any of their own more immediate and popular rights and privileges if the latter should be at any time subverted by the crown for this reason he puts the cases of the revolution and the restoration exactly upon the same footing he plainly marks that it was the object of all honest men not to sacrifice one part of the constitution to another and much more not to sacrifice any of them to visionary theories of the rights of man but to preserve our whole inheritance in the constitution in all its members and all its relations entire and unimpaired from generation to generation in this mr burke exactly agrees with him                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote what are the rights of the people  sidenote restoration and revolution  sidenote people have an equal interest in the legal rights of the crown and of their own  nothing is plainer than that the people have a right to the laws and the constitution this right the nation hath asserted and recovered out of the hands of those who had dispossessed them of it at several times there are of this two famous instances in the knowledge of the present age i mean that of the restoration and that of the revolution in both these great events were the regal power and the rights of the people recovered and it is hard to say in which the people have the greatest interest for the commons are sensible that there it not one legal power belonging to the crown but they have an interest in it and i doubt not but they will always be as careful to support the rights of the crown as their own privileges                                       the other whig managers regarded as he did the overturning of the monarchy by a republican faction with the very same horror and detestation with which they regarded the destruction of the privileges of the people by an arbitrary monarch                                       mr lechmere  sidenote constitution recovered at the restoration and revolution  speaking of our constitution states it as a constitution which happily recovered itself at the restoration from the confusions and disorders which the horrid and detestable proceedings of faction and usurpation had thrown it into and which after many convulsions and struggles was providentially saved at the late happy revolution and by the many good laws passed since that time stands now upon a firmer foundation together with the most comfortable prospect of security to all posterity by the settlement of the crown in the protestant line                                       i mean now to show that the whigs if sir joseph jekyl was one and if he spoke in conformity to the sense of the whig house of commons and the whig ministry who employed him did carefully guard against any presumption that might arise from the repeal of the nonresistance oath of charles the second as if at the revolution the ancient principles of our government were at all changed or that republican doctrines were countenanced or any sanction given to seditious proceedings upon general undefined ideas of misconduct or for changing the form of government or for resistance upon any other ground than the necessity so often mentioned for the purpose of selfpreservation it will show still more clearly the equal care of the then whigs to prevent either the regal power from being swallowed up on pretence of popular rights or the popular rights from being destroyed on pretence of regal prerogatives                                       sir joseph jekyl  sidenote mischief of broaching antimonarchical principles  sidenote two cases of resistance one to preserve the crown the other the rights of the subject  further i desire it may be considered these legislators the legislators who framed the nonresistance oath of charles the second were guarding against the consequences of those pernicious and antimonarchical principles which had been broached a little before in this nation and those large declarations in favor of nonresistance were made to encounter or obviate the mischief of those principlesas appears by the preamble to the fullest of those acts which is the militia act in the 13th and 14th of king charles the second the words of that act are these and during the late usurped governments many evil and rebellious principles have been instilled into the minds of the people of this kingdom which may break forth unless prevented to the disturbance of the peace and quiet thereof be it therefore enacted c here your lordships may see the reason that inclined those legislators to express themselves in such a manner against resistance they had seen the regal rights swallowed up under the pretence of popular ones and it is no imputation on them that they did not then foresee a quite different case as was that of the revolution where under the pretence of regal authority a total subversion of the rights of the subject was advanced and in a manner effected and this may serve to show that it was not the design of those legislators to condemn resistance in a case of absolute necessity for preserving the constitution when they were guarding against principles which had so lately destroyed it  sidenote nonresistance oath not repealed because with the restriction of necessity it was false but to prevent false interpretations  as to the truth of the doctrine in this declaration which was repealed ill admit it to be as true as the doctors counsel assert itthat is with an exception of cases of necessity and it was not repealed because it was false understanding it with that restriction but it was repealed because it might be interpreted in an unconfined sense and exclusive of that restriction and being so understood would reflect on the justice of the revolution and this the legislature had at heart and were very jealous of and by this repeal of that declaration gave a parliamentary or legislative admonition against asserting this doctrine of nonresistance in an unlimited sense  sidenote general doctrine of nonresistance godly and wholesome not bound to state explicitly the exceptions  though the general doctrine of nonresistance the doctrine of the church of england as stated in her homilies or elsewhere delivered by which the general duty of subjects to the higher powers is taught be owned to be as unquestionably it is a godly and wholesome doctrinethough this general doctrine has been constantly inculcated by the reverend fathers of the church dead and living and preached by them as a preservative against the popish doctrine of deposing princes and as the ordinary rule of obedienceand though the same doctrine has been preached maintained and avowed by our most orthodox and able divines from the time of the reformationand how innocent a man soever dr sacheverell had been if with an honest and wellmeant zeal he had preached the same doctrine in the same general terms in which he found it delivered by the apostles of christ as taught by the homilies and the reverend fathers of our church and in imitation of those great examples had only pressed the general duty of obedience and the illegality of resistance without taking notice of any exception c                                       another of the managers for the house of commons sir john holland was not less careful in guarding against a confusion of the principles of the revolution with any loose general doctrines of a right in the individual or even in the people to undertake for themselves on any prevalent temporary opinions of convenience or improvement any fundamental change in the constitution or to fabricate a new government for themselves and thereby to disturb the public peace and to unsettle the ancient constitution of this kingdom                                       sir john holland  sidenote submission to the sovereign a conscientious duty except in cases of necessity  the commons would not be understood as if they were pleading for a licentious resistance as if subjects were left to their goodwill and pleasure when they are to obey and when to resist no my lords they know they are obliged by all the ties of social creatures and christians for wrath and conscience sake to submit to their sovereign the commons do not abet humorsome factious arms they aver them to be rebellions but yet they maintain that that resistance at the revolution which was so necessary was lawful and just from that necessity  sidenote right of resistance how to be understood  these general rules of obedience may upon a real necessity admit a lawful exception and such a necessary exception we assert the revolution to be  tis with this view of necessity only absolute necessity of preserving our laws liberties and religiontis with this limitation that we desire to be understood when any of us speak of resistance in general the necessity of the resistance at the revolution was at that time obvious to every man                                       i shall conclude these extracts with a reference to the prince of oranges declaration in which he gives the nation the fullest assurance that in his enterprise he was far from the intention of introducing any change whatever in the fundamental law and constitution of the state he considered the object of his enterprise not to be a precedent for further revolutions but that it was the great end of his expedition to make such revolutions so far as human power and wisdom could provide unnecessary                                       extracts from the prince of oranges declaration  all magistrates who have been unjustly turned out shall forthwith resume their former employments as well as all the boroughs of england shall return again to their ancient prescriptions and charters and more particularly that the ancient charter of the great and famous city of london shall again be in force and that the writs for the members of parliament shall be addressed to the proper officers according to law and custom  and for the doing of all other things which the two houses of parliament shall find necessary for the peace honor and safety of the nation so that there may be no more danger of the nations falling at any time hereafter under arbitrary government                                       extract from the prince of oranges additional declaration  sidenote principal nobility and gentry well affected to the church and crown security against the design of innovation  we are confident that no persons can have such hard thoughts of us as to imagine that we have any other design in this undertaking than to procure a settlement of the religion and of the liberties and properties of the subjects upon so sure a foundation that there may be no danger of the nations relapsing into the like miseries at any time hereafter and as the forces that we have brought along with us are utterly disproportioned to that wicked design of conquering the nation if we were capable of intending it so the great numbers of the principal nobility and gentry that are men of eminent quality and estates and persons of known integrity and zeal both for the religion and government of england many of them also being distinguished by their constant fidelity to the crown who do both accompany us in this expedition and have earnestly solicited us to it will cover us from all such malicious insinuations                                       in the spirit and upon one occasion in the words19 of this declaration the statutes passed in that reign made such provisions for preventing these dangers that scarcely anything short of combination of king lords and commons for the destruction of the liberties of the nation can in any probability make us liable to similar perils in that dreadful and i hope not to be lookedfor case any opinion of a right to make revolutions grounded on this precedent would be but a poor resource dreadful indeed would be our situation                                       these are the doctrines held by the whigs of the revolution delivered with as much solemnity and as authentically at least as any political dogmas were ever promulgated from the beginning of the world if there be any difference between their tenets and those of mr burke it is that the old whigs oppose themselves still more strongly than he does against the doctrines which are now propagated with so much industry by those who would be thought their successors  it will be said perhaps that the old whigs in order to guard themselves against popular odium pretended to assert tenets contrary to those which they secretly held this if true would prove what mr burke has uniformly asserted that the extravagant doctrines which he meant to expose were disagreeable to the body of the peoplewho though they perfectly abhor a despotic government certainly approached more nearly to the love of mitigated monarchy than to anything which bears the appearance even of the best republic but if these old whigs deceived the people their conduct was unaccountable indeed they exposed their power as every one conversant in history knows to the greatest peril for the propagation of opinions which on this hypothesis they did not hold it is a new kind of martyrdom this supposition does as little credit to their integrity as their wisdom it makes them at once hypocrites and fools i think of those great men very differently i hold them to have been what the world thought them men of deep understanding open sincerity and clear honor however be that matter as it may what these old whigs pretended to be mr burke is this is enough for him  i do indeed admit that though mr burke has proved that his opinions were those of the old whig party solemnly declared by one house in effect and substance by both houses of parliament this testimony standing by itself will form no proper defence for his opinions if he and the old whigs were both of them in the wrong but it is his present concern not to vindicate these old whigs but to show his agreement with them he appeals to them as judges he does not vindicate them as culprits it is current that these old politicians knew little of the rights of menthat they lost their way by groping about in the dark and fumbling among rotten parchments and musty records great lights they say are lately obtained in the world and mr burke instead of shrouding himself in exploded ignorance ought to have taken advantage of the blaze of illumination which has been spread about him it may be so the enthusiasts of this time it seems like their predecessors in another faction of fanaticism deal in lights hudibras pleasantly says of them they      have lights where better eyes are blind      as pigs are said to see the wind  the author of the reflections has heard a great deal concerning the modern lights but he has not yet had the good fortune to see much of them he has read more than he can justify to anything but the spirit of curiosity of the works of these illuminators of the world he has learned nothing from the far greater number of them than a full certainty of their shallowness levity pride petulance presumption and ignorance where the old authors whom he has read and the old men whom he has conversed with have left him in the dark he is in the dark still if others however have obtained any of this extraordinary light they will use it to guide them in their researches and their conduct i have only to wish that the nation may be as happy and as prosperous under the influence of the new light as it has been in the sober shade of the old obscurity as to the rest it will be difficult for the author of the reflections to conform to the principles of the avowed leaders of the party until they appear otherwise than negatively all we can gather from them is thisthat their principles are diametrically opposite to his this is all that we know from authority their negative declaration obliges me to have recourse to the books which contain positive doctrines they are indeed to those mr burke holds diametrically opposite and if it be true as the oracles of the party have said i hope hastily that their opinions differ so widely it should seem they are the most likely to form the creed of the modern whigs                                       i have stated what were the avowed sentiments of the old whigs not in the way of argument but narratively it is but fair to set before the reader in the same simple manner the sentiments of the modern to which they spare neither pains nor expense to make proselytes i choose them from the books upon which most of that industry and expenditure in circulation have been employed i choose them not from those who speak with a politic obscurity not from those who only controvert the opinions of the old whigs without advancing any of their own but from those who speak plainly and affirmatively the whig reader may make his choice between the two doctrines  the doctrine then propagated by these societies which gentlemen think they ought to be very tender in discouraging as nearly as possible in their own words is as follows that in great britain we are not only without a good constitution but that we have no constitutionthat though it is much talked about no such thing as a constitution exists or ever did exist and consequently that the people have a constitution yet to formthat since william the conqueror the country has never yet regenerated itself and is therefore without a constitutionthat where it cannot be produced in a visible form there is nonethat a constitution is a thing antecedent to government and that the constitution of a country is not the act of its government but of a people constituting a governmentthat everything in the english government is the reverse of what it ought to be and what it is said to be in englandthat the right of war and peace resides in a metaphor shown at the tower for sixpence or a shilling apiecethat it signifies not where the right resides whether in the crown or in parliament war is the common harvest of those who participate in the division and expenditure of public moneythat the portion of liberty enjoyed in england is just enough to enslave a country more productively than by despotism  so far as to the general state of the british constitutionas to our house of lords the chief virtual representative of our aristocracy the great ground and pillar of security to the landed interest and that main link by which it is connected with the law and the crown these worthy societies are pleased to tell us that whether we view aristocracy before or behind or sideways or any way else domestically or publicly it is still a monsterthat aristocracy in france had one feature less in its countenance than what it has in some other countries it did not compose a body of hereditary legislators it was not a corporation of aristocracy for such it seems that profound legislator m de la fayette describes the house of peersthat it is kept up by family tyranny and injusticethat there is an unnatural unfitness in aristocracy to be legislators for a nationthat their ideas of distributive justice are corrupted at the very source they begin life by trampling on all their younger brothers and sisters and relations of every kind and are taught and educated so to dothat the idea of an hereditary legislator is as absurd as an hereditary mathematicianthat a body holding themselves unaccountable to anybody ought to be trusted by nobodythat it is continuing the uncivilized principles of governments founded in conquest and the base idea of man having a property in man and governing him by a personal rightthat aristocracy has a tendency to degenerate the human species c c  as to our law of primogeniture which with few and inconsiderable exceptions is the standing law of all our landed inheritance and which without question has a tendency and i think a most happy tendency to preserve a character of consequence weight and prevalent influence over others in the whole body of the landed interest they call loudly for its destruction they do this for political reasons that are very manifest they have the confidence to say that it is a law against every law of nature and nature herself calls for its destruction establish family justice and aristocracy falls by the aristocratical law of primogenitureship in a family of six children five are exposed aristocracy has never but one child the rest are begotten to be devoured they are thrown to the cannibal for prey and the natural parent prepares the unnatural repast  as to the house of commons they treat it far worse than the house of lords or the crown have been ever treated perhaps they thought they had a greater right to take this amicable freedom with those of their own family for many years it has been the perpetual theme of their invectives mockery insult usurpation are amongst the best names they bestow upon it they damn it in the mass by declaring that it does not arise out of the inherent rights of the people as the national assembly does in france and whose name designates its original  of the charters and corporations to whose rights a few years ago these gentlemen were so tremblingly alive they say that when the people of england come to reflect upon them they will like france annihilate those badges of oppression those traces of a conquered nation  as to our monarchy they had formerly been more tender of that branch of the constitution and for a good reason the laws had guarded against all seditious attacks upon it with a greater degree of strictness and severity the tone of these gentlemen is totally altered since the french revolution they now declaim as vehemently against the monarchy as on former occasions they treacherously flattered and soothed it  when we survey the wretched condition of man under the monarchical and hereditary systems of government dragged from his home by one power or driven by another and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies it becomes evident that those systems are bad and that a general revolution in the principle and construction of governments is necessary  what is government more than the management of the affairs of a nation it is not and from its nature cannot be the property of any particular man or family but of the whole community at whose expense it is supported and though by force or contrivance it has been usurped into an inheritance the usurpation cannot alter the right of things sovereignty as a matter of right appertains to the nation only and not to any individual and a nation has at all times an inherent indefeasible right to abolish any form of government it finds inconvenient and establish such as accords with its interest disposition and happiness the romantic and barbarous distinction of men into kings and subjects though it may suit the condition of courtiers cannot that of citizens and is exploded by the principle upon which governments are now founded every citizen is a member of the sovereignty and as such can acknowledge no personal subjection and his obedience can be only to the laws  warmly recommending to us the example of prance where they have destroyed monarchy they say  monarchical sovereignty the enemy of mankind and the source of misery is abolished and sovereignty itself is restored to its natural and original place the nation were this the case throughout europe the cause of wars would be taken away  but after all what is this metaphor called a crown or rather what is monarchy is it a thing or is it a name or is it a fraud is it a contrivance of human wisdom or of human craft to obtain money from a nation under specious pretences is it a thing necessary to a nation if it is in what does that necessity consist what services does it perform what is its business and what are its merits doth the virtue consist in the metaphor or in the man doth the goldsmith that makes the crown make the virtue also doth it operate like fortunatuss wishingcap or harlequins wooden sword doth it make a man a conjurer in fine what is it it appears to be a something going much out of fashion falling into ridicule and rejected in some countries both as unnecessary and expensive in america it is considered as an absurdity and in france it has so far declined that the goodness of the man and the respect for his personal character are the only things that preserve the appearance of its existence  mr burke talks about what he calls an hereditary crown as if it were some production of natureor as if like time it had a power to operate not only independently but in spite of manor as if it were a thing or a subject universally consented to alas it has none of those properties but is the reverse of them all it is a thing in imagination the propriety of which is more than doubted and the legality of which in a few years will be denied  if i ask the farmer the manufacturer the merchant the tradesman and down through all the occupations of life to the common laborer what service monarchy is to him he can give me no answer if i ask him what monarchy is he believes it is something like a sinecure  the french constitution says that the right of war and peace is in the nation where else should it reside but in those who are to pay the expense  in england this right is said to reside in a metaphor shown at the tower for sixpence or a shilling apiece so are the lions and it would be a step nearer to reason to say it resided in them for any inanimate metaphor is no more than a hat or a cap we can all see the absurdity of worshipping aarons molten calf or nebuchadnezzars golden image but why do men continue to practise themselves the absurdities they despise in others  the revolution and hanover succession had been objects of the highest veneration to the old whigs they thought them not only proofs of the sober and steady spirit of liberty which guided their ancestors but of their wisdom and provident care of posterity the modern whigs have quite other notions of these events and actions they do not deny that mr burke has given truly the words of the acts of parliament which secured the succession and the just sense of them they attack not him but the law  mr burke say they has done some service not to his cause but to his country by bringing those clauses into public view they serve to demonstrate how necessary it is at all times to watch against the attempted encroachment of power and to prevent its running to excess it is somewhat extraordinary that the offence for which james the second was expelled that of setting up power by assumption should be reacted under another shape and form by the parliament that expelled him it shows that the rights of man were but imperfectly understood at the revolution for certain it is that the right which that parliament set up by assumption for by delegation it had it not and could not have it because none could give it over the persons and freedom of posterity forever was of the same tyrannical unfounded kind which james attempted to set up over the parliament and the nation and for which he was expelled the only difference is for in principle they differ not that the one was an usurper over the living and the other over the unborn and as the one has no better authority to stand upon than the other both of them must be equally null and void and of no effect  as the estimation of all things is by comparison the revolution of 1688 however from circumstances it may have been exalted beyond its value will find its level it is already on the wane eclipsed by the enlarging orb of reason and the luminous revolutions of america and france in less than another century it will go as well as mr burkes labors to the family vault of all the capulets mankind will then scarcely believe that a country calling itself free would send to holland for a man and clothe him with power on purpose to put themselves in fear of him and give him almost a million sterling a year for leave to submit themselves and their posterity like bondmen and bondwomen forever  mr burke having said that the king holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the revolution society who individually or collectively have not as most certainly they have not a vote for a king amongst them they take occasion from thence to infer that the king who does not hold his crown by election despises the people  the king of england says he holds his crown for it does not belong to the nation according to mr burke in contempt of the choice of the revolution society c  as to who is king in england or elsewhere or whether there is any king at all or whether the people choose a cherokee chief or a hessian hussar for a king it is not a matter that i trouble myself aboutbe that to themselves but with respect to the doctrine so far as it relates to the rights of men and nations it is as abominable as anything ever uttered in the most enslaved country under heaven whether it sounds worse to my ear by not being accustomed to hear such despotism than what it does to the ear of another person i am not so well a judge of but of its abominable principle i am at no loss to judge  these societies of modern whigs push their insolence as far as it can go in order to prepare the minds of the people for treason and rebellion they represent the king as tainted with principles of despotism from the circumstance of his having dominions in germany in direct defiance of the most notorious truth they describe his government there to be a despotism whereas it is a free constitution in which the states of the electorate have their part in the government and this privilege has never been infringed by the king or that i have heard of by any of his predecessors the constitution of the electoral dominions has indeed a double control both from the laws of the empire and from the privileges of the country whatever rights the king enjoys as elector have been always parentally exercised and the calumnies of these scandalous societies have not been authorized by a single complaint of oppression  when mr burke says that his majestys heirs and successors each in their time and order will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his majesty has succeeded to that he wears it is saying too much even to the humblest individual in the country part of whose daily labor goes towards making up the million sterling a year which the country gives the person it styles a king government with insolence is despotism but when contempt is added it becomes worse and to pay for contempt is the excess of slavery this species of government comes from germany and reminds me of what one of the brunswick soldiers told me who was taken prisoner by the americans in the late war ah said he america is a fine free country it is worth the peoples fighting for i know the difference by knowing my own in my country if the prince says eat straw we eat straw god help that country thought i be it england or elsewhere whose liberties are to be protected by german principles of government and princes of brunswick  it is somewhat curious to observe that although the people of england have been in the habit of talking about kings it is always a foreign house of kingshating foreigners yet governed by them it is now the house of brunswick one of the petty tribes of germany  if government be what mr burke describes it a contrivance of human wisdom i might ask him if wisdom was at such a low ebb in england that it was become necessary to import it from holland and from hanover but i will do the country the justice to say that was not the case and even if it was it mistook the cargo the wisdom of every country when properly exerted is sufficient for all its purposes and there could exist no more real occasion in england to have sent for a dutch stadtholder or a german elector than there was in america to have done a similar thing if a country does not understand its own affairs how is a foreigner to understand them who knows neither its laws its manners nor its language if there existed a man so transcendently wise above all others that his wisdom was necessary to instruct a nation some reason might be offered for monarchy but when we cast our eyes about a country and observe how every part understands its own affairs and when we look around the world and see that of all men in it the race of kings are the most insignificant in capacity our reason cannot fail to ask us what are those men kept for20                                       these are the notions which under the idea of whig principles several persons and among them persons of no mean mark have associated themselves to propagate i will not attempt in the smallest degree to refute them this will probably be done if such writings shall be thought to deserve any other than the refutation of criminal justice by others who may think with mr burke he has performed his part  i do not wish to enter very much at large into the discussions which diverge and ramify in all ways from this productive subject but there is one topic upon which i hope i shall be excused in going a little beyond my design the factions now so busy amongst us in order to divest men of all love for their country and to remove from their minds all duty with regard to the state endeavor to propagate an opinion that the people in forming their commonwealth have by no means parted with their power over it this is an impregnable citadel to which these gentlemen retreat whenever they are pushed by the battery of laws and usages and positive conventions indeed it is such and of so great force that all they have done in defending their outworks is so much time and labor thrown away discuss any of their schemes their answer is it is the act of the people and that is sufficient are we to deny to a majority of the people the right of altering even the whole frame of their society if such should be their pleasure they may change it say they from a monarchy to a republic today and tomorrow back again from a republic to a monarchy and so backward and forward as often as they like they are masters of the commonwealth because in substance they are themselves the commonwealth the french revolution say they was the act of the majority of the people and if the majority of any other people the people of england for instance wish to make the same change they have the same right  just the same undoubtedly that is none at all neither the few nor the many have a right to act merely by their will in any matter connected with duty trust engagement or obligation the constitution of a country being once settled upon some compact tacit or expressed there is no power existing of force to alter it without the breach of the covenant or the consent of all the parties such is the nature of a contract and the votes of a majority of the people whatever their infamous flatterers may teach in order to corrupt their minds cannot alter the moral any more than they can alter the physical essence of things the people are not to be taught to think lightly of their engagements to their governors else they teach governors to think lightly of their engagements towards them in that kind of game in the end the people are sure to be losers to flatter them into a contempt of faith truth and justice is to ruin them for in these virtues consists their whole safety to flatter any man or any part of mankind in any description by asserting that in engagements he or they are free whilst any other human creature is bound is ultimately to vest the rule of morality in the pleasure of those who ought to be rigidly submitted to itto subject the sovereign reason of the world to the caprices of weak and giddy men  but as no one of us men can dispense with public or private faith or with any other tie of moral obligation so neither can any number of us the number engaged in crimes instead of turning them into laudable acts only augments the quantity and intensity of the guilt i am well aware that men love to hear of their power but have an extreme disrelish to be told of their duty this is of course because every duty is a limitation of some power indeed arbitrary power is so much to the depraved taste of the vulgar of the vulgar of every description that almost all the dissensions which lacerate the commonwealth are not concerning the manner in which it is to be exercised but concerning the hands in which it is to be placed somewhere they are resolved to have it whether they desire it to be vested in the many or the few depends with most men upon the chance which they imagine they themselves may have of partaking in the exercise of that arbitrary sway in the one mode or in the other  it is not necessary to teach men to thirst after power but it is very expedient that by moral instruction they should be taught and by their civil constitutions they should be compelled to put many restrictions upon the immoderate exercise of it and the inordinate desire the best method of obtaining these two great points forms the important but at the same time the difficult problem to the true statesman he thinks of the place in which political power is to be lodged with no other attention than as it may render the more or the less practicable its salutary restraint and its prudent direction for this reason no legislator at any period of the world has willingly placed the seat of active power in the hands of the multitude because there it admits of no control no regulation no steady direction whatsoever the people are the natural control on authority but to exercise and to control together is contradictory and impossible  as the exorbitant exercise of power cannot under popular sway be effectually restrained the other great object of political arrangement the means of abating an excessive desire of it is in such a state still worse provided for the democratic commonwealth is the foodful nurse of ambition under the other forms it meets with many restraints whenever in states which have had a democratic basis the legislators have endeavored to put restraints upon ambition their methods were as violent as in the end they were ineffectualas violent indeed as any the most jealous despotism could invent the ostracism could not very long save itself and much less the state which it was meant to guard from the attempts of ambitionone of the natural inbred incurable distempers of a powerful democracy  but to return from this short digressionwhich however is not wholly foreign to the question of the effect of the will of the majority upon the form or the existence of their society i cannot too often recommend it to the serious consideration of all men who think civil society to be within the province of moral jurisdiction that if we owe to it any duty it is not subject to our will duties are not voluntary duty and will are even contradictory terms now though civil society might be at first a voluntary act which in many cases it undoubtedly was its continuance is under a permanent standing covenant coexisting with the society and it attaches upon every individual of that society without any formal act of his own this is warranted by the general practice arising out of the general sense of mankind men without their choice derive benefits from that association without their choice they are subjected to duties in consequence of these benefits and without their choice they enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual look through the whole of life and the whole system of duties much the strongest moral obligations are such as were never the results of our option i allow that if no supreme ruler exists wise to form and potent to enforce the moral law there is no sanction to any contract virtual or even actual against the will of prevalent power on that hypothesis let any set of men be strong enough to set their duties at defiance and they cease to be duties any longer we have but this one appeal against irresistible power      si genus humanum et mortalia temnitis arma     at sperate deos memores fandi atque nefandi  taking it for granted that i do not write to the disciples of the parisian philosophy i may assume that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of existenceand that having disposed and marshalled us by a divine tactic not according to our will but according to his he has in and by that disposition virtually subjected us to act the part which belongs to the place assigned us we have obligations to mankind at large which are not in consequence of any special voluntary pact they arise from the relation of man to man and the relation of man to god which relations are not matters of choice on the contrary the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any particular person or number of persons amongst mankind depends upon those prior obligations in some cases the subordinate relations are voluntary in others they are necessarybut the duties are all compulsive when we marry the choice is voluntary but the duties are not matter of choice they are dictated by the nature of the situation dark and inscrutable are the ways by which we come into the world the instincts which give rise to this mysterious process of nature are not of our making but out of physical causes unknown to us perhaps unknowable arise moral duties which as we are able perfectly to comprehend we are bound indispensably to perform parents may not be consenting to their moral relation but consenting or not they are bound to a long train of burdensome duties towards those with whom they have never made a convention of any sort children are not consenting to their relation but their relation without their actual consent binds them to its dutiesor rather it implies their consent because the presumed consent of every rational creature is in unison with the predisposed order of things men come in that manner into a community with the social state of their parents endowed with all the benefits loaded with all the duties of their situation if the social ties and ligaments spun out of those physical relations which are the elements of the commonwealth in most cases begin and always continue independently of our will so without any stipulation on our own part are we bound by that relation called our country which comprehends as it has been well said all the charities of all21 nor are we left without powerful instincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us as it is awful and coercive our country is not a thing of mere physical locality it consists in a great measure in the ancient order into which we are born we may have the same geographical situation but another country as we may have the same country in another soil the place that determines our duty to our country is a social civil relation  these are the opinions of the author whose cause i defend i lay them down not to enforce them upon others by disputation but as an account of his proceedings on them he acts and from them he is convinced that neither he nor any man or number of men have a right except what necessity which is out of and above all rule rather imposes than bestows to free themselves from that primary engagement into which every man born into a community as much contracts by his being born into it as he contracts an obligation to certain parents by his having been derived from their bodies the place of every man determines his duty if you ask quem te deus esse jussit you will be answered when you resolve this other question humana qua parte locatus es in re22  i admit indeed that in morals as in all things else difficulties will sometimes occur duties will sometimes cross one another then questions will arise which of them is to be placed in subordination which of them may be entirely superseded these doubts give rise to that part of moral science called casuistry which though necessary to be well studied by those who would become expert in that learning who aim at becoming what i think cicero somewhere calls artifices officiorum it requires a very solid and discriminating judgment great modesty and caution and much sobriety of mind in the handling else there is a danger that it may totally subvert those offices which it is its object only to methodize and reconcile duties at their extreme bounds are drawn very fine so as to become almost evanescent in that state some shade of doubt will always rest on these questions when they are pursued with great subtilty but the very habit of stating these extreme cases is not very laudable or safe because in general it is not right to turn our duties into doubts they are imposed to govern our conduct not to exercise our ingenuity and therefore our opinions about them ought not to be in a state of fluctuation but steady sure and resolved  amongst these nice and therefore dangerous points of casuistry may be reckoned the question so much agitated in the present hourwhether after the people have discharged themselves of their original power by an habitual delegation no occasion can possibly occur which may justify the resumption of it this question in this latitude is very hard to affirm or deny but i am satisfied that no occasion can justify such a resumption which would not equally authorize a dispensation with any other moral duty perhaps with all of them together however if in general it be not easy to determine concerning the lawfulness of such devious proceedings which must be ever on the edge of crimes it is far from difficult to foresee the perilous consequences of the resuscitation of such a power in the people the practical consequences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value political problems do not primarily concern truth or falsehood they relate to good or evil what in the result is likely to produce evil is politically false that which is productive of good politically true  believing it therefore a question at least arduous in the theory and in the practice very critical it would become us to ascertain as well as we can what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkness and the sleep of ages when the supreme authority of the people is in question before we attempt to extend or to confine it we ought to fix in our minds with some degree of distinctness an idea of what it is we mean when we say the people  in a state of rude nature there is no such thing as a people a number of men in themselves have no collective capacity the idea of a people is the idea of a corporation it is wholly artificial and made like all other legal fictions by common agreement what the particular nature of that agreement was is collected from the form into which the particular society has been cast any other is not their covenant when men therefore break up the original compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a state they are no longer a peoplethey have no longer a corporate existencethey have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within nor a claim to be recognized abroad they are a number of vague loose individuals and nothing more with them all is to begin again alas they little know how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form themselves into a mass which has a true politic personality  we hear much from men who have not acquired their hardiness of assertion from the profundity of their thinking about the omnipotence of a majority in such a dissolution of an ancient society as hath taken place in france but amongst men so disbanded there can be no such thing as majority or minority or power in any one person to bind another the power of acting by a majority which the gentlemen theorists seem to assume so readily after they have violated the contract out of which it has arisen if at all it existed must be grounded on two assumptions first that of an incorporation produced by unanimity and secondly an unanimous agreement that the act of a mere majority say of one shall pass with them and with others as the act of the whole  we are so little affected by things which are habitual that we consider this idea of the decision of a majority as if it were a law of our original nature but such constructive whole residing in a part only is one of the most violent fictions of positive law that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artificial incorporation out of civil society nature knows nothing of it nor are men even when arranged according to civil order otherwise than by very long training brought at all to submit to it the mind is brought far more easily to acquiesce in the proceedings of one man or a few who act under a general procuration for the state than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his share in the deliberation for there the beaten party are exasperated and soured by the previous contention and mortified by the conclusive defeat this mode of decision where wills may be so nearly equal where according to circumstances the smaller number may be the stronger force and where apparent reason may be all upon one side and on the other little else than impetuous appetiteall this must be the result of a very particular and special convention confirmed afterwards by long habits of obedience by a sort of discipline in society and by a strong hand vested with stationary permanent power to enforce this sort of constructive general will what organ it is that shall declare the corporate mind is so much a matter of positive arrangement that several states for the validity of several of their acts have required a proportion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority these proportions are so entirely governed by convention that in some cases the minority decides the laws in many countries to condemn require more than a mere majority less than an equal number to acquit in our judicial trials we require unanimity either to condemn or to absolve in some incorporations one man speaks for the whole in others a few until the other day in the constitution of poland unanimity was required to give validity to any act of their great national council or diet this approaches much more nearly to rude nature than the institutions of any other country such indeed every commonwealth must be without a positive law to recognize in a certain number the will of the entire body  if men dissolve their ancient incorporation in order to regenerate their community in that state of things each man has a right if he pleases to remain an individual any number of individuals who can agree upon it have an undoubted right to form themselves into a state apart and wholly independent if any of these is forced into the fellowship of another this is conquest and not compact on every principle which supposes society to be in virtue of a free covenant this compulsive incorporation must be null and void  as a people can have no right to a corporate capacity without universal consent so neither have they a right to hold exclusively any lands in the name and title of a corporation on the scheme of the present rulers in our neighboring country regenerated as they are they have no more right to the territory called france than i have i have a right to pitch my tent in any unoccupied place i can find for it and i may apply to my own maintenance any part of their unoccupied soil i may purchase the house or vineyard of any individual proprietor who refuses his consent and most proprietors have as far as they dared refused it to the new incorporation i stand in his independent place who are these insolent men calling themselves the french nation that would monopolize this fair domain of nature is it because they speak a certain jargon is it their mode of chattering to me unintelligible that forms their title to my land who are they who claim by prescription and descent from certain gangs of banditti called franks and burgundians and visigoths of whom i may have never heard and ninetynine out of an hundred of themselves certainly never have heard whilst at the very time they tell me that prescription and long possession form no title to property who are they that presume to assert that the land which i purchased of the individual a natural person and not a fiction of state belongs to them who in the very capacity in which they make their claim can exist only as an imaginary being and in virtue of the very prescription which they reject and disown this mode of arguing might be pushed into all the detail so as to leave no sort of doubt that on their principles and on the sort of footing on which they have thought proper to place themselves the crowd of men on the other side of the channel who have the impudence to call themselves a people can never be the lawful exclusive possessors of the soil by what they call reasoning without prejudice they leave not one stone upon another in the fabric of human society they subvert all the authority which they hold as well as all that which they have destroyed  as in the abstract it is perfectly clear that out of a state of civil society majority and minority are relations which can have no existence and that in civil society its own specific conventions in each corporation determine what it is that constitutes the people so as to make their act the signification of the general willto come to particulars it is equally clear that neither in france nor in england has the original or any subsequent compact of the state expressed or implied constituted a majority of men told by the head to be the acting people of their several communities and i see as little of policy or utility as there is of right in laying down a principle that a majority of men told by the head are to be considered as the people and that as such their will is to be law what policy can there be found in arrangements made in defiance of every political principle to enable men to act with the weight and character of a people and to answer the ends for which they are incorporated into that capacity we must suppose them by means immediate or consequential to be in that state of habitual social discipline in which the wiser the more expert and the more opulent conduct and by conducting enlighten and protect the weaker the less knowing and the less provided with the goods of fortune when the multitude are not under this discipline they can scarcely be said to be in civil society give once a certain constitution of things which produces a variety of conditions and circumstances in a state and there is in nature and reason a principle which for their own benefit postpones not the interest but the judgment of those who are numero plures to those who are virtute et honore majores numbers in a state supposing which is not the case in france that a state does exist are always of considerationbut they are not the whole consideration it is in things more serious than a play that it may be truly said satis est equitem mihi plaudere  a true natural aristocracy is not a separate interest in the state or separable from it it is an essential integrant part of any large body rightly constituted it is formed out of a class of legitimate presumptions which taken as generalities must be admitted for actual truths to be bred in a place of estimation to see nothing low and sordid from ones infancy to be taught to respect ones self to be habituated to the censorial inspection of the public eye to look early to public opinion to stand upon such elevated ground as to be enabled to take a large view of the widespread and infinitely diversified combinations of men and affairs in a large society to have leisure to read to reflect to converse to be enabled to draw the court and attention of the wise and learned wherever they are to be found to be habituated in armies to command and to obey to be taught to despise danger in the pursuit of honor and duty to be formed to the greatest degree of vigilance foresight and circumspection in a state of things in which no fault is committed with impunity and the slightest mistakes draw on the most ruinous consequences to be led to a guarded and regulated conduct from a sense that you are considered as an instructor of your fellowcitizens in their highest concerns and that you act as a reconciler between god and man to be employed as an administrator of law and justice and to be thereby amongst the first benefactors to mankind to be a professor of high science or of liberal and ingenuous art to be amongst rich traders who from their success are presumed to have sharp and vigorous understandings and to possess the virtues of diligence order constancy and regularity and to have cultivated an habitual regard to commutative justice these are the circumstances of men that form what i should call a natural aristocracy without which there is no nation  the state of civil society which necessarily generates this aristocracy is a state of natureand much more truly so than a savage and incoherent mode of life for man is by nature reasonable and he is never perfectly in his natural state but when he is placed where reason may be best cultivated and most predominates art is mans nature we are as much at least in a state of nature in formed manhood as in immature and helpless infancy men qualified in the manner i have just described form in nature as she operates in the common modification of society the leading guiding and governing part it is the soul to the body without which the man does not exist to give therefore no more importance in the social order to such descriptions of men than that of so many units is a horrible usurpation  when great multitudes act together under that discipline of nature i recognize the people i acknowledge something that perhaps equals and ought always to guide the sovereignty of convention in all things the voice of this grand chorus of national harmony ought to have a mighty and decisive influence but when you disturb this harmonywhen you break up this beautiful order this array of truth and nature as well as of habit and prejudicewhen you separate the common sort of men from their proper chieftains so as to form them into an adverse armyi no longer know that venerable object called the people in such a disbanded race of deserters and vagabonds for a while they may be terrible indeedbut in such a manner as wild beasts are terrible the mind owes to them no sort of submission they are as they have always been reputed rebels they may lawfully be fought with and brought under whenever an advantage offers those who attempt by outrage and violence to deprive men of any advantage which they hold under the laws and to destroy the natural order of life proclaim war against them  we have read in history of that furious insurrection of the common people in france called the jacquerie for this is not the first time that the people have been enlightened into treason murder and rapine its object was to extirpate the gentry the captal de buch a famous soldier of those days dishonored the name of a gentleman and of a man by taking for their cruelties a cruel vengeance on these deluded wretches it was however his right and his duty to make war upon them and afterwards in moderation to bring them to punishment for their rebellion though in the sense of the french revolution and of some of our clubs they were the peopleand were truly so if you will call by that appellation any majority of men told by the head  at a time not very remote from the same period for these humors never have affected one of the nations without some influence on the other happened several risings of the lower commons in england these insurgents were certainly the majority of the inhabitants of the counties in which they resided and cade ket and straw at the head of their national guards and fomented by certain traitors of high rank did no more than exert according to the doctrines of ours and the parisian societies the sovereign power inherent in the majority  we call the time of those events a dark age indeed we are too indulgent to our own proficiency the abbé john ball understood the rights of man as well as the abbé grégoire that reverend patriarch of sedition and prototype of our modern preachers was of opinion with the national assembly that all the evils which have fallen upon men had been caused by an ignorance of their having been born and continued equal as to their rights had the populace been able to repeat that profound maxim all would have gone perfectly well with them no tyranny no vexation no oppression no care no sorrow could have existed in the world this would have cured them like a charm for the toothache but the lowest wretches in their most ignorant state were able at all times to talk such stuff and yet at all times have they suffered many evils and many oppressions both before and since the republication by the national assembly of this spell of healing potency and virtue the enlightened dr ball when he wished to rekindle the lights and fires of his audience on this point chose for the test the following couplet      when adam delved and eve span     who was then the gentleman  of this sapient maxim however i do not give him for the inventor it seems to have been handed down by tradition and had certainly become proverbial but whether then composed or only applied thus much must be admitted that in learning sense energy and comprehensiveness it is fully equal to all the modern dissertations on the equality of mankind and it has one advantage over themthat it is in rhyme23  there is no doubt but that this great teacher of the rights of man decorated his discourse on this valuable text with lemmas theorems scholia corollaries and all the apparatus of science which was furnished in as great plenty and perfection out of the dogmatic and polemic magazines the old horsearmory of the schoolmen among whom the rev dr ball was bred as they can be supplied from the new arsenal at hackney it was no doubt disposed with all the adjutancy of definition and division in which i speak it with submission the old marshals were as able as the modern martinets neither can we deny that the philosophic auditory when they had once obtained this knowledge could never return to their former ignorance or after so instructive a lecture be in the same state of mind as if they had never heard it24 but these poor people who were not to be envied for their knowledge but pitied for their delusion were not reasoned that was impossible but beaten out of their lights with their teacher they were delivered over to the lawyers who wrote in their blood the statutes of the land as harshly and in the same sort of ink as they and their teachers had written the rights of man  our doctors of the day are not so fond of quoting the opinions of this ancient sage as they are of imitating his conduct first because it might appear that they are not as great inventors as they would be thought and next because unfortunately for his fame he was not successful it is a remark liable to as few exceptions as any generality can be that they who applaud prosperous folly and adore triumphant guilt have never been known to succor or even to pity human weakness or offence when they become subject to human vicissitude and meet with punishment instead of obtaining power abating for their want of sensibility to the sufferings of their associates they are not so much in the wrong for madness and wickedness are things foul and deformed in themselves and stand in need of all the coverings and trappings of fortune to recommend them to the multitude nothing can be more loathsome in their naked nature  aberrations like these whether ancient or modern unsuccessful or prosperous are things of passage they furnish no argument for supposing a multitude told by the head to be the people such a multitude can have no sort of title to alter the seat of power in the society in which it ever ought to be the obedient and not the ruling or presiding part what power may belong to the whole mass in which mass the natural aristocracy or what by convention is appointed to represent and strengthen it acts in its proper place with its proper weight and without being subjected to violence is a deeper question but in that case and with that concurrence i should have much doubt whether any rash or desperate changes in the state such as we have seen in france could ever be effected  i have said that in all political questions the consequences of any assumed rights are of great moment in deciding upon their validity in this point of view let us a little scrutinize the effects of a right in the mere majority of the inhabitants of any country of superseding and altering their government at pleasure  the sum total of every people is composed of its units every individual must have a right to originate what afterwards is to become the act of the majority whatever he may lawfully originate he may lawfully endeavor to accomplish he has a right therefore in his own particular to break the ties and engagements which bind him to the country in which he lives and he has a right to make as many converts to his opinions and to obtain as many associates in his designs as he can procure for how can you know the dispositions of the majority to destroy their government but by tampering with some part of the body you must begin by a secret conspiracy that you may end with a national confederation the mere pleasure of the beginner must be the sole guide since the mere pleasure of others must be the sole ultimate sanction as well as the sole actuating principle in every part of the progress thus arbitrary will the last corruption of ruling power step by step poisons the heart of every citizen if the undertaker fails he has the misfortune of a rebel but not the guilt by such doctrines all love to our country all pious veneration and attachment to its laws and customs are obliterated from our minds and nothing can result from this opinion when grown into a principle and animated by discontent ambition or enthusiasm but a series of conspiracies and seditions sometimes ruinous to their authors always noxious to the state no sense of duty can prevent any man from being a leader or a follower in such enterprises nothing restrains the tempter nothing guards the tempted nor is the new state fabricated by such arts safer than the old what can prevent the mere will of any person who hopes to unite the wills of others to his own from an attempt wholly to overturn it it wants nothing but a disposition to trouble the established order to give a title to the enterprise  when you combine this principle of the right to change a fixed and tolerable constitution of things at pleasure with the theory and practice of the french assembly the political civil and moral irregularity are if possible aggravated the assembly have found another road and a far more commodious to the destruction of an old government and the legitimate formation of a new one than through the previous will of the majority of what they call the people get say they the possession of power by any means you can into your hands and then a subsequent consent what they call an address of adhesion makes your authority as much the act of the people as if they had conferred upon you originally that kind and degree of power which without their permission you had seized upon this is to give a direct sanction to fraud hypocrisy perjury and the breach of the most sacred trusts that can exist between man and man what can sound with such horrid discordance in the moral ear as this positionthat a delegate with limited powers may break his sworn engagements to his constituent assume an authority never committed to him to alter all things at his pleasure and then if he can persuade a large number of men to flatter him in the power he has usurped that he is absolved in his own conscience and ought to stand acquitted in the eyes of mankind on this scheme the maker of the experiment must begin with a determined perjury that point is certain he must take his chance for the expiatory addresses this is to make the success of villany the standard of innocence  without drawing on therefore very shocking consequences neither by previous consent nor by subsequent ratification of a mere reckoned majority can any set of men attempt to dissolve the state at their pleasure to apply this to our present subject when the several orders in their several bailliages had met in the year 1789 such of them i mean as had met peaceably and constitutionally to choose and to instruct their representatives so organized and so acting because they were organized and were acting according to the conventions which made them a people they were the people of france they had a legal and a natural capacity to be considered as that people but observe whilst they were in this state that is whilst they were a people in no one of their instructions did they charge or even hint at any of those things which have drawn upon the usurping assembly and their adherents the detestation of the rational and thinking part of mankind i will venture to affirm without the least apprehension of being contradicted by any person who knows the then state of france that if any one of the changes were proposed which form the fundamental parts of their revolution and compose its most distinguishing acts it would not have had one vote in twenty thousand in any order their instructions purported the direct contrary to all those famous proceedings which are defended as the acts of the people had such proceedings been expected the great probability is that the people would then have risen as to a man to prevent them the whole organization of the assembly was altered the whole frame of the kingdom was changed before these things could be done it is long to tell by what evil arts of the conspirators and by what extreme weakness and want of steadiness in the lawful government this equal usurpation on the rights of the prince and people having first cheated and then offered violence to both has been able to triumph and to employ with success the forged signature of an imprisoned sovereign and the spurious voice of dictated addresses to a subsequent ratification of things that had never received any previous sanction general or particular expressed or implied from the nation in whatever sense that word is taken or from any part of it  after the weighty and respectable part of the people had been murdered or driven by the menaces of murder from their houses or were dispersed in exile into every country in europeafter the soldiery had been debauched from their officersafter property had lost its weight and consideration along with its securityafter voluntary clubs and associations of factious and unprincipled men were substituted in the place of all the legal corporations of the kingdom arbitrarily dissolvedafter freedom had been banished from those popular meetings25 whose sole recommendation is freedomafter it had come to that pass that no dissent dared to appear in any of them but at the certain price of lifeafter even dissent had been anticipated and assassination became as quick as suspicionsuch pretended ratification by addresses could be no act of what any lover of the people would choose to call by their name it is that voice which every successful usurpation as well as this before us may easily procure even without making as these tyrants have made donatives from the spoil of one part of the citizens to corrupt the other  the pretended rights of man which have made this havoc cannot be the rights of the people for to be a people and to have these rights are things incompatible the one supposes the presence the other the absence of a state of civil society the very foundation of the french commonwealth is false and selfdestructive nor can its principles be adopted in any country without the certainty of bringing it to the very same condition in which france is found attempts are made to introduce them into every nation in europe this nation as possessing the greatest influence they wish most to corrupt as by that means they are assured the contagion must become general i hope therefore i shall be excused if i endeavor to show as shortly as the matter will admit the danger of giving to them either avowedly or tacitly the smallest countenance  there are times and circumstances in which not to speak out is at least to connive many think it enough for them that the principles propagated by these clubs and societies enemies to their country and its constitution are not owned by the modern whigs in parliament who are so warm in condemnation of mr burke and his book and of course of all the principles of the ancient constitutional whigs of this kingdom certainly they are not owned but are they condemned with the same zeal as mr burke and his book are condemned are they condemned at all are they rejected or discountenanced in any way whatsoever is any man who would fairly examine into the demeanor and principles of those societies and that too very moderately and in the way rather of admonition than of punishment is such a man even decently treated is he not reproached as if in condemning such principles he had belied the conduct of his whole life suggesting that his life had been governed by principles similar to those which he now reprobates the french system is in the mean time by many active agents out of doors rapturously praised the british constitution is coldly tolerated but these constitutions are different both in the foundation and in the whole superstructure and it is plain that you cannot build up the one but on the ruins of the other after all if the french be a superior system of liberty why should we not adopt it to what end are our praises is excellence held out to us only that we should not copy after it and what is there in the manners of the people or in the climate of france which renders that species of republic fitted for them and unsuitable to us a strong and marked difference between the two nations ought to be shown before we can admit a constant affected panegyric a standing annual commemoration to be without any tendency to an example  but the leaders of party will not go the length of the doctrines taught by the seditious clubs i am sure they do not mean to do so god forbid perhaps even those who are directly carrying on the work of this pernicious foreign faction do not all of them intend to produce all the mischiefs which must inevitably follow from their having any success in their proceedings as to leaders in parties nothing is more common than to see them blindly led the world is governed by gobetweens these gobetweens influence the persons with whom they carry on the intercourse by stating their own sense to each of them as the sense of the other and thus they reciprocally master both sides it is first buzzed about the ears of leaders that their friends without doors are very eager for some measure or very warm about some opinionthat you must not be too rigid with them they are useful persons and zealous in the cause they may be a little wrong but the spirit of liberty must not be damped and by the influence you obtain from some degree of concurrence with them at present you may be enabled to set them right hereafter  thus the leaders are at first drawn to a connivance with sentiments and proceedings often totally different from their serious and deliberate notions but their acquiescence answers every purpose  with no better than such powers the gobetweens assume a new representative character what at best was but an acquiescence is magnified into an authority and thence into a desire on the part of the leaders and it is carried down as such to the subordinate members of parties by this artifice they in their turn are led into measures which at first perhaps few of them wished at all or at least did not desire vehemently or systematically  there is in all parties between the principal leaders in parliament and the lowest followers out of doors a middle sort of men a sort of equestrian order who by the spirit of that middle situation are the fittest for preventing things from running to excess but indecision though a vice of a totally different character is the natural accomplice of violence the irresolution and timidity of those who compose this middle order often prevents the effect of their controlling situation the fear of differing with the authority of leaders on the one hand and of contradicting the desires of the multitude on the other induces them to give a careless and passive assent to measures in which they never were consulted and thus things proceed by a sort of activity of inertness until whole bodies leaders middlemen and followers are all hurried with every appearance and with many of the effects of unanimity into schemes of politics in the substance of which no two of them were ever fully agreed and the origin and authors of which in this circular mode of communication none of them find it possible to trace in my experience i have seen much of this in affairs which though trifling in comparison to the present were yet of some importance to parties and i have known them suffer by it the sober part give their sanction at first through inattention and levity at last they give it through necessity a violent spirit is raised which the presiding minds after a time find it impracticable to stop at their pleasure to control to regulate or even to direct  this shows in my opinion how very quick and awakened all men ought to be who are looked up to by the public and who deserve that confidence to prevent a surprise on their opinions when dogmas are spread and projects pursued by which the foundations of society may be affected before they listen even to moderate alterations in the government of their country they ought to take care that principles are not propagated for that purpose which are too big for their object doctrines limited in their present application and wide in their general principles are never meant to be confined to what they at first pretend if i were to form a prognostic of the effect of the present machinations on the people from their sense of any grievance they suffer under this constitution my mind would be at ease but there is a wide difference between the multitude when they act against their government from a sense of grievance or from zeal for some opinions when men are thoroughly possessed with that zeal it is difficult to calculate its force it is certain that its power is by no means in exact proportion to its reasonableness it must always have been discoverable by persons of reflection but it is now obvious to the world that a theory concerning government may become as much a cause of fanaticism as a dogma in religion there is a boundary to mens passions when they act from feeling none when they are under the influence of imagination remove a grievance and when men act from feeling you go a great way towards quieting a commotion but the good or bad conduct of a government the protection men have enjoyed or the oppression they have suffered under it are of no sort of moment when a faction proceeding upon speculative grounds is thoroughly heated against its form when a man is from system furious against monarchy or episcopacy the good conduct of the monarch or the bishop has no other effect than further to irritate the adversary he is provoked at it as furnishing a plea for preserving the thing which he wishes to destroy his mind will be heated as much by the sight of a sceptre a mace or a verge as if he had been daily bruised and wounded by these symbols of authority mere spectacles mere names will become sufficient causes to stimulate the people to war and tumult  some gentlemen are not terrified by the facility with which government has been overturned in france the people of france they say had nothing to lose in the destruction of a bad constitution but though not the best possible we have still a good stake in ours which will hinder us from desperate risks is this any security at all against those who seem to persuade themselves and who labor to persuade others that our constitution is an usurpation in its origin unwise in its contrivance mischievous in its effects contrary to the rights of man and in all its parts a perfect nuisance what motive has any rational man who thinks in that manner to spill his blood or even to risk a shilling of his fortune or to waste a moment of his leisure to preserve it if he has any duty relative to it his duty is to destroy it a constitution on sufferance is a constitution condemned sentence is already passed upon it the execution is only delayed on the principles of these gentlemen it neither has nor ought to have any security so far as regards them it is left naked without friends partisans assertors or protectors  let us examine into the value of this security upon the principles of those who are more soberof those who think indeed the french constitution better or at least as good as the british without going to all the lengths of the warmer politicians in reprobating their own their security amounts in reality to nothing more than thisthat the difference between their republican system and the british limited monarchy is not worth a civil war this opinion i admit will prevent people not very enterprising in their nature from an active undertaking against the british constitution but it is the poorest defensive principle that ever was infused into the mind of man against the attempts of those who will enterprise it will tend totally to remove from their minds that very terror of a civil war which is held out as our sole security they who think so well of the french constitution certainly will not be the persons to carry on a war to prevent their obtaining a great benefit or at worst a fair exchange they will not go to battle in favor of a cause in which their defeat might be more advantageous to the public than their victory they must at least tacitly abet those who endeavor to make converts to a sound opinion they must discountenance those who would oppose its propagation in proportion as by these means the enterprising party is strengthened the dread of a struggle is lessened see what an encouragement this is to the enemies of the constitution a few assassinations and a very great destruction of property we know they consider as no real obstacles in the way of a grand political change and they will hope that here if antimonarchical opinions gain ground as they have done in france they may as in france accomplish a revolution without a war  they who think so well of the french constitution cannot be seriously alarmed by any progress made by its partisans provisions for security are not to be received from those who think that there is no danger no there is no plan of security to be listened to but from those who entertain the same fears with ourselvesfrom those who think that the thing to be secured is a great blessing and the thing against which we would secure it a great mischief every person of a different opinion must be careless about security  i believe the author of the reflections whether he fears the designs of that set of people with reason or not cannot prevail on himself to despise them he cannot despise them for their numbers which though small compared with the sound part of the community are not inconsiderable he cannot look with contempt on their influence their activity or the kind of talents and tempers which they possess exactly calculated for the work they have in hand and the minds they chiefly apply to do we not see their most considerable and accredited ministers and several of their party of weight and importance active in spreading mischievous opinions in giving sanction to seditious writings in promoting seditious anniversaries and what part of their description has disowned them or their proceedings when men circumstanced as these are publicly declare such admiration of a foreign constitution and such contempt of our own it would be in the author of the reflections thinking as he does of the french constitution infamously to cheat the rest of the nation to their ruin to say there is no danger  in estimating danger we are obliged to take into our calculation the character and disposition of the enemy into whose hands we may chance to fall the genius of this faction is easily discerned by observing with what a very different eye they have viewed the late foreign revolutions two have passed before them that of france and that of poland the state of poland was such that there could scarcely exist two opinions but that a reformation of its constitution even at some expense of blood might be seen without much disapprobation no confusion could be feared in such an enterprise because the establishment to be reformed was itself a state of confusion a king without authority nobles without union or subordination a people without arts industry commerce or liberty no order within no defence without no effective public force but a foreign force which entered a naked country at will and disposed of everything at pleasure here was a state of things which seemed to invite and might perhaps justify bold enterprise and desperate experiment but in what manner was this chaos brought into order the means were as striking to the imagination as satisfactory to the reason and soothing to the moral sentiments in contemplating that change humanity has everything to rejoice and to glory innothing to be ashamed of nothing to suffer so far as it has gone it probably is the most pure and defecated public good which ever has been conferred on mankind we have seen anarchy and servitude at once removed a throne strengthened for the protection of the people without trenching on their liberties all foreign cabal banished by changing the crown from elective to hereditary and what was a matter of pleasing wonder we have seen a reigning king from an heroic love to his country exerting himself with all the toil the dexterity the management the intrigue in favor of a family of strangers with which ambitious men labor for the aggrandizement of their own ten millions of men in a way of being freed gradually and therefore safely to themselves and the state not from civil or political chains which bad as they are only fetter the mind but from substantial personal bondage inhabitants of cities before without privileges placed in the consideration which belongs to that improved and connecting situation of social life one of the most proud numerous and fierce bodies of nobility and gentry ever known in the world arranged only in the foremost rank of free and generous citizens not one man incurred loss or suffered degradation all from the king to the daylaborer were improved in their condition everything was kept in its place and order but in that place and order everything was bettered to add to this happy wonder this unheardof conjunction of wisdom and fortune not one drop of blood was spilled no treachery no outrage no system of slander more cruel than the sword no studied insults on religion morals or manners no spoil no confiscation no citizen beggared none imprisoned none exiled the whole was effected with a policy a discretion an unanimity and secrecy such as have never been before known on any occasion but such wonderful conduct was reserved for this glorious conspiracy in favor of the true and genuine rights and interests of men happy people if they know to proceed as they have begun happy prince worthy to begin with splendor or to close with glory a race of patriots and of kings and to leave      a name which every wind to heaven would bear     which men to speak and angels joy to hear  to finish allthis great good as in the instant it is contains in it the seeds of all further improvement and may be considered as in a regular progress because founded on similar principles towards the stable excellence of a british constitution  here was a matter for congratulation and for festive remembrance through ages here moralists and divines might indeed relax in their temperance to exhilarate their humanity but mark the character of our faction all their enthusiasm is kept for the french revolution they cannot pretend that france had stood so much in need of a change as poland they cannot pretend that poland has not obtained a better system of liberty or of government than it enjoyed before they cannot assert that the polish revolution cost more dearly than that of france to the interests and feelings of multitudes of men but the cold and subordinate light in which they look upon the one and the pains they take to preach up the other of these revolutions leave us no choice in fixing on their motives both revolutions profess liberty as their object but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order the other from order to anarchy the first secures its liberty by establishing its throne the other builds its freedom on the subversion of its monarchy in the one their means are unstained by crimes and their settlement favors morality in the other vice and confusion are in the very essence of their pursuit and of their enjoyment the circumstances in which these two events differ must cause the difference we make in their comparative estimation these turn the scale with the societies in favor of france ferrum est quod amant the frauds the violences the sacrileges the havoc and ruin of families the dispersion and exile of the pride and flower of a great country the disorder the confusion the anarchy the violation of property the cruel murders the inhuman confiscations and in the end the insolent domination of bloody ferocious and senseless clubsthese are the things which they love and admire what men admire and love they would surely act let us see what is done in france and then let us undervalue any the slightest danger of falling into the hands of such a merciless and savage faction  but the leaders of the factious societies are too wild to succeed in this their undertaking i hope so but supposing them wild and absurd is there no danger but from wise and reflecting men perhaps the greatest mischiefs that have happened in the world have happened from persons as wild as those we think the wildest in truth they are the fittest beginners of all great changes why encourage men in a mischievous proceeding because their absurdity may disappoint their malicebut noticing them may give them consequence certainly but they are noticed and they are noticed not with reproof but with that kind of countenance which is given by an apparent concurrence not a real one i am convinced of a great party in the praises of the object which they hold out to imitation  but i hear a language still more extraordinary and indeed of such a nature as must suppose or leave us at their mercy it is thisyou know their promptitude in writing and their diligence in caballing to write speak or act against them will only stimulate them to new efforts this way of considering the principle of their conduct pays but a poor compliment to these gentlemen they pretend that their doctrines are infinitely beneficial to mankind but it seems they would keep them to themselves if they were not greatly provoked they are benevolent from spite their oracles are like those of proteus whom some people think they resemble in many particulars who never would give his responses unless you used him as ill as possible these cats it seems would not give out their electrical light without having their backs well rubbed but this is not to do them perfect justice they are sufficiently communicative had they been quiet the propriety of any agitation of topics on the origin and primary rights of government in opposition to their private sentiments might possibly be doubted but as it is notorious that they were proceeding as fast and as far as time and circumstances would admit both in their discussions and cabalsas it is not to be denied that they had opened a correspondence with a foreign faction the most wicked the world ever saw and established anniversaries to commemorate the most monstrous cruel and perfidious of all the proceedings of that factionthe question is whether their conduct was to be regarded in silence lest our interference should render them outrageous then let them deal as they please with the constitution let the lady be passive lest the ravisher should be driven to force resistance will only increase his desires yes truly if the resistance be feigned and feeble but they who are wedded to the constitution will not act the part of wittols they will drive such seducers from the house on the first appearance of their loveletters and offered assignations but if the author of the reflections though a vigilant was not a discreet guardian of the constitution let them who have the same regard to it show themselves as vigilant and more skilful in repelling the attacks of seduction or violence their freedom from jealousy is equivocal and may arise as well from indifference to the object as from confidence in her virtue  on their principle it is the resistance and not the assault which produces the danger i admit indeed that if we estimated the danger by the value of the writings it would be little worthy of our attention contemptible these writings are in every sense but they are not the cause they are the disgusting symptoms of a frightful distemper they are not otherwise of consequence than as they show the evil habit of the bodies from whence they come in that light the meanest of them is a serious thing if however i should underrate them and if the truth is that they are not the result but the cause of the disorders i speak of surely those who circulate operative poisons and give to whatever force they have by their nature the further operation of their authority and adoption are to be censured watched and if possible repressed  at what distance the direct danger from such factions may be it is not easy to fix an adaptation of circumstances to designs and principles is necessary but these cannot be wanting for any long time in the ordinary course of sublunary affairs great discontents frequently arise in the best constituted governments from causes which no human wisdom can foresee and no human power can prevent they occur at uncertain periods but at periods which are not commonly far asunder governments of all kinds are administered only by men and great mistakes tending to inflame these discontents may concur the indecision of those who happen to rule at the critical time their supine neglect or their precipitate and illjudged attention may aggravate the public misfortunes in such a state of things the principles now only sown will shoot out and vegetate in full luxuriance in such circumstances the minds of the people become sore and ulcerated they are put out of humor with all public men and all public parties they are fatigued with their dissensions they are irritated at their coalitions they are made easily to believe what much pains are taken to make them believe that all oppositions are factious and all courtiers base and servile from their disgust at men they are soon led to quarrel with their frame of government which they presume gives nourishment to the vices real or supposed of those who administer in it mistaking malignity for sagacity they are soon led to cast off all hope from a good administration of affairs and come to think that all reformation depends not on a change of actors but upon an alteration in the machinery then will be felt the full effect of encouraging doctrines which tend to make the citizens despise their constitution then will be felt the plenitude of the mischief of teaching the people to believe that all ancient institutions are the results of ignorance and that all prescriptive government is in its nature usurpation then will be felt in all its energy the danger of encouraging a spirit of litigation in persons of that immature and imperfect state of knowledge which serves to render them susceptible of doubts but incapable of their solution then will be felt in all its aggravation the pernicious consequence of destroying all docility in the minds of those who are not formed for finding their own way in the labyrinths of political theory and are made to reject the clew and to disdain the guide then will be felt and too late will be acknowledged the ruin which follows the disjoining of religion from the state the separation of morality from policy and the giving conscience no concern and no coactive or coercive force in the most material of all the social ties the principle of our obligations to government  i know too that besides this vain contradictory and selfdestructive security which some men derive from the habitual attachment of the people to this constitution whilst they suffer it with a sort of sportive acquiescence to be brought into contempt before their faces they have other grounds for removing all apprehension from their minds they are of opinion that there are too many men of great hereditary estates and influence in the kingdom to suffer the establishment of the levelling system which has taken place in france this is very true if in order to guide the power which now attends their property these men possess the wisdom which is involved in early fear but if through a supine security to which such fortunes are peculiarly liable they neglect the use of their influence in the season of their power on the first derangement of society the nerves of their strength will be cut their estates instead of being the means of their security will become the very causes of their danger instead of bestowing influence they will excite rapacity they will be looked to as a prey  such will be the impotent condition of those men of great hereditary estates who indeed dislike the designs that are carried on but whose dislike is rather that of spectators than of parties that may be concerned in the catastrophe of the piece but riches do not in all cases secure even an inert and passive resistance there are always in that description men whose fortunes when their minds are once vitiated by passion or by evil principle are by no means a security from their actually taking their part against the public tranquillity we see to what low and despicable passions of all kinds many men in that class are ready to sacrifice the patrimonial estates which might be perpetuated in their families with splendor and with the fame of hereditary benefactors to mankind from generation to generation do we not see how lightly people treat their fortunes when under the influence of the passion of gaming the game of ambition or resentment will be played by many of the rich and great as desperately and with as much blindness to the consequences as any other game was he a man of no rank or fortune who first set on foot the disturbances which have ruined france passion blinded him to the consequences so far as they concerned himself and as to the consequences with regard to others they were no part of his considerationnor ever will be with those who bear any resemblance to that virtuous patriot and lover of the rights of man  there is also a time of insecurity when interests of all sorts become objects of speculation then it is that their very attachment to wealth and importance will induce several persons of opulence to list themselves and even to take a lead with the party which they think most likely to prevail in order to obtain to themselves consideration in some new order or disorder of things they may be led to act in this manner that they may secure some portion of their own property and perhaps to become partakers of the spoil of their own order those who speculate on change always make a great number among people of rank and fortune as well as amongst the low and the indigent  what security against all thisall human securities are liable to uncertainty but if anything bids fair for the prevention of so great a calamity it must consist in the use of the ordinary means of just influence in society whilst those means continue unimpaired the public judgment ought to receive a proper direction all weighty men may have their share in so good a work as yet notwithstanding the strutting and lying independence of a braggart philosophy nature maintains her rights and great names have great prevalence two such men as mr pitt and mr fox adding to their authority in a point in which they concur even by their disunion in everything else might frown these wicked opinions out of the kingdom but if the influence of either of them or the influence of men like them should against their serious intentions be otherwise perverted they may countenance opinions which as i have said before and could wish over and over again to press they may in vain attempt to control in their theory these doctrines admit no limit no qualification whatsoever no man can say how far he will go who joins with those who are avowedly going to the utmost extremities what security is there for stopping short at all in these wild conceits why neither more nor less than thisthat the moral sentiments of some few amongst them do put some check on their savage theories but let us take care the moral sentiments so nearly connected with early prejudice as to be almost one and the same thing will assuredly not live long under a discipline which has for its basis the destruction of all prejudices and the making the mind proof against all dread of consequences flowing from the pretended truths that are taught by their philosophy  in this school the moral sentiments must grow weaker and weaker every day the more cautious of these teachers in laying down their maxims draw as much of the conclusion as suits not with their premises but with their policy they trust the rest to the sagacity of their pupils others and these are the most vaunted for their spirit not only lay down the same premises but boldly draw the conclusions to the destruction of our whole constitution in church and state but are these conclusions truly drawn yes most certainly their principles are wild and wicked but let justice be done even to frenzy and villany these teachers are perfectly systematic no man who assumes their grounds can tolerate the british constitution in church or state these teachers profess to scorn all mediocrityto engage for perfectionto proceed by the simplest and shortest course they build their politics not on convenience but on truth and they profess to conduct men to certain happiness by the assertion of their undoubted rights with them there is no compromise all other governments are usurpations which justify and even demand resistance  their principles always go to the extreme they who go with the principles of the ancient whigs which are those contained in mr burkes book never can go too far they may indeed stop short of some hazardous and ambiguous excellence which they will be taught to postpone to any reasonable degree of good they may actually possess the opinions maintained in that book never can lead to an extreme because their foundation is laid in an opposition to extremes the foundation of government is there laid not in imaginary rights of men which at best is a confusion of judicial with civil principles but in political convenience and in human natureeither as that nature is universal or as it is modified by local habits and social aptitudes the foundation of government those who have read that book will recollect is laid in a provision for our wants and in a conformity to our duties it is to purvey for the one it is to enforce the other these doctrines do of themselves gravitate to a middle point or to some point near a middle they suppose indeed a certain portion of liberty to be essential to all good government but they infer that this liberty is to be blended into the government to harmonize with its forms and its rules and to be made subordinate to its end those who are not with that book are with its opposite for there is no medium besides the medium itself that medium is not such because it is found there but it is found there because it is conformable to truth and nature in this we do not follow the author but we and the author travel together upon the same safe and middle path  the theory contained in his book is not to furnish principles for making a new constitution but for illustrating the principles of a constitution already made it is a theory drawn from the fact of our government they who oppose it are bound to show that his theory militates with that fact otherwise their quarrel is not with his book but with the constitution of their country the whole scheme of our mixed constitution is to prevent any one of its principles from being carried as far as taken by itself and theoretically it would go allow that to be the true policy of the british system then most of the faults with which that system stands charged will appear to be not imperfections into which it has inadvertently fallen but excellencies which it has studiously sought to avoid the perfections of extreme all its several parts are so constituted as not alone to answer their own several ends but also each to limit and control the others insomuch that take which of the principles you please you will find its operation checked and stopped at a certain point the whole movement stands still rather than that any part should proceed beyond its boundary from thence it results that in the british constitution there is a perpetual treaty and compromise going on sometimes openly sometimes with less observation to him who contemplates the british constitution as to him who contemplates the subordinate material world it will always be a matter of his most curious investigation to discover the secret of this mutual limitation              finita potestas denique cuique     quanam sit ratione atque alte terminus hærens  they who have acted as in france they have done upon a scheme wholly different and who aim at the abstract and unlimited perfection of power in the popular part can be of no service to us in any of our political arrangements they who in their headlong career have overpassed the goal can furnish no example to those who aim to go no further the temerity of such speculators is no more an example than the timidity of others the one sort scorns the right the other fears it both miss it but those who by violence go beyond the barrier are without question the most mischievous because to go beyond it they overturn and destroy it to say they have spirit is to say nothing in their praise the untempered spirit of madness blindness immorality and impiety deserves no commendation he that sets his house on fire because his fingers are frostbitten can never be a fit instructor in the method of providing our habitations with a cheerful and salutary warmth we want no foreign examples to rekindle in us the flame of liberty the example of our own ancestors is abundantly sufficient to maintain the spirit of freedom in its full vigor and to qualify it in all its exertions the example of a wise moral wellnatured and welltempered spirit of freedom is that alone which can be useful to us or in the least degree reputable or safe our fabric is so constituted one part of it bears so much on the other the parts are so made for one another and for nothing else that to introduce any foreign matter into it is to destroy it  what has been said of the roman empire is at least as true of the british constitutionoctingentorum annorum fortuna disciplinaque compages hæc coaluit quæ convelli sine convellentium exitio non potest this british constitution has not been struck out at an heat by a set of presumptuous men like the assembly of pettifoggers run mad in paris      tis not the hasty product of a day     but the wellripened fruit of wise delay  it is the result of the thoughts of many minds in many ages it is no simple no superficial thing nor to be estimated by superficial understandings an ignorant man who is not fool enough to meddle with his clock is however sufficiently confident to think he can safely take to pieces and put together at his pleasure a moral machine of another guise importance and complexity composed of far other wheels and springs and balances and counteracting and coöperating powers men little think how immorally they act in rashly meddling with what they do not understand their delusive good intention is no sort of excuse for their presumption they who truly mean well must be fearful of acting ill the british constitution may have its advantages pointed out to wise and reflecting minds but it is of too high an order of excellence to be adapted to those which are common it takes in too many views it makes too many combinations to be so much as comprehended by shallow and superficial understandings profound thinkers will know it in its reason and spirit the less inquiring will recognize it in their feelings and their experience they will thank god they have a standard which in the most essential point of this great concern will put them on a par with the most wise and knowing  if we do not take to our aid the foregone studies of men reputed intelligent and learned we shall be always beginners but men must learn somewhere and the new teachers mean no more than what they effect as far as they succeedthat is to deprive men of the benefit of the collected wisdom of mankind and to make them blind disciples of their own particular presumption talk to these deluded creatures all the disciples and most of the masters who are taught to think themselves so newly fitted up and furnished and you will find nothing in their houses but the refuse of knaves acrenothing but the rotten stuff worn out in the service of delusion and sedition in all ages and which being newly furbished up patched and varnished serves well enough for those who being unacquainted with the conflict which has always been maintained between the sense and the nonsense of mankind know nothing of the former existence and the ancient refutation of the same follies it is near two thousand years since it has been observed that these devices of ambition avarice and turbulence were antiquated they are indeed the most ancient of all commonplaces commonplaces sometimes of good and necessary causes more frequently of the worst but which decide upon neither eadem semper causa libido et avaritia et mutandarum rerum amor ceterum libertas et speciosa nomina pretexuntur nec quisquam alienum servitium et dominationem sibi concupivit ut non eadem ista vocabula usurparet  rational and experienced men tolerably well know and have always known how to distinguish between true and false liberty and between the genuine adherence and the false pretence to what is true but none except those who are profoundly studied can comprehend the elaborate contrivance of a fabric fitted to unite private and public liberty with public force with order with peace with justice and above all with the institutions formed for bestowing permanence and stability through ages upon this invaluable whole  place for instance before your eyes such a man as montesquieu think of a genius not born in every country or every time a man gifted by nature with a penetrating aquiline eyewith a judgment prepared with the most extensive eruditionwith an herculean robustness of mind and nerves not to be broken with labora man who could spend twenty years in one pursuit think of a man like the universal patriarch in milton who had drawn up before him in his prophetic vision the whole series of the generations which were to issue from his loins a man capable of placing in review after having brought together from the east the west the north and the south from the coarseness of the rudest barbarism to the most refined and subtle civilization all the schemes of government which had ever prevailed amongst mankind weighing measuring collating and comparing them all joining fact with theory and calling into council upon all this infinite assemblage of things all the speculations which have fatigued the understandings of profound reasoners in all times let us then consider that all these were but so many preparatory steps to qualify a man and such a man tinctured with no national prejudice with no domestic affection to admire and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the constitution of england and shall we englishmen revoke to such a suit shall we when so much more than he has produced remains still to be understood and admired instead of keeping ourselves in the schools of real science choose for our teachers men incapable of being taughtwhose only claim to know is that they have never doubtedfrom whom we can learn nothing but their own indocilitywho would teach us to scorn what in the silence of our hearts we ought to adore  different from them are all the great critics they have taught us one essential rule i think the excellent and philosophic artist a true judge as well as a perfect follower of nature sir joshua reynolds has somewhere applied it or something like it in his own profession it is this that if ever we should find ourselves disposed not to admire those writers or artists livy and virgil for instance raphael or michael angelo whom all the learned had admired not to follow our own fancies but to study them until we know how and what we ought to admire and if we cannot arrive at this combination of admiration with knowledge rather to believe that we are dull than that the rest of the world has been imposed on it is as good a rule at least with regard to this admired constitution we ought to understand it according to our measure and to venerate where we are not able presently to comprehend  such admirers were our fathers to whom we owe this splendid inheritance let us improve it with zeal but with fear let us follow our ancestors men not without a rational though without an exclusive confidence in themselveswho by respecting the reason of others who by looking backward as well as forward by the modesty as well as by the energy of their minds went on insensibly drawing this constitution nearer and nearer to its perfection by never departing from its fundamental principles nor introducing any amendment which had not a subsisting root in the laws constitution and usages of the kingdom let those who have the trust of political or of natural authority ever keep watch against the desperate enterprises of innovation let even their benevolence be fortified and armed they have before their eyes the example of a monarch insulted degraded confined deposed his family dispersed scattered imprisoned his wife insulted to his face like the vilest of the sex by the vilest of all populace himself three times dragged by these wretches in an infamous triumph his children torn from him in violation of the first right of nature and given into the tuition of the most desperate and impious of the leaders of desperate and impious clubs his revenues dilapidated and plundered his magistrates murdered his clergy proscribed persecuted famished his nobility degraded in their rank undone in their fortunes fugitives in their persons his armies corrupted and ruined his whole people impoverished disunited dissolved whilst through the bars of his prison and amidst the bayonets of his keepers he hears the tumult of two conflicting factions equally wicked and abandoned who agree in principles in dispositions and in objects but who tear each other to pieces about the most effectual means of obtaining their common end the one contending to preserve for a while his name and his person the more easily to destroy the royal authoritythe other clamoring to cut off the name the person and the monarchy together by one sacrilegious execution all this accumulation of calamity the greatest that ever fell upon one man has fallen upon his head because he had left his virtues unguarded by cautionbecause he was not taught that where power is concerned he who will confer benefits must take security against ingratitude  i have stated the calamities which have fallen upon a great prince and nation because they were not alarmed at the approach of danger and because what commonly happens to men surprised they lost all resource when they were caught in it when i speak of danger i certainly mean to address myself to those who consider the prevalence of the new whig doctrines as an evil  the whigs of this day have before them in this appeal their constitutional ancestors they have the doctors of the modern school they will choose for themselves the author of the reflections has chosen for himself if a new order is coming on and all the political opinions must pass away as dreams which our ancestors have worshipped as revelations i say for him that he would rather be the last as certainly he is the least of that race of men than the first and greatest of those who have coined to themselves whig principles from a french die unknown to the impress of our fathers in the constitution  footnotes  6 newspaper intelligence ought always to be received with some degree of caution i do not know that the following paragraph is founded on any authority but it comes with an air of authority the paper is professedly in the interest of the modern whigs and under their direction the paragraph is not disclaimed on their part it professes to be the decision of those whom its author calls the great and firm body of the whigs of england who are the whigs of a different composition which the promulgator of the sentence considers as composed of fleeting and unsettled particles i know not nor whether there be any of that description the definitive sentence of the great and firm body of the whigs of england as this paper gives it out is as follows  the great and firm body of the whigs of england true to their principles have decided on the dispute between mr fox and mr burke and the former is declared to have maintained the pure doctrines by which they are bound together and upon which they have invariably acted the consequence is that mr burke retires from parliamentmorning chronicle may 12 1791  7 reflections c 1st ed london j dodsley 1790works vol iii p 343 in the present edition  8 to explain this it will be necessary to advert to a paragraph which appeared in a paper in the minority interest some time before this debate a very dark intrigue has lately been discovered the authors of which are well known to us but until the glorious day shall come when it will not be a libel to tell the truth we must not be so regardless of our own safety as to publish their names we will however state the fact leaving it to the ingenuity of our readers to discover what we dare not publish  since the business of the armament against russia has been under discussion a great personage has been heard to say that he was not so wedded to mr pitt as not to be very willing to give his confidence to mr fox if the latter should be able in a crisis like the present to conduct the government of the country with greater advantage to the public  this patriotic declaration immediately alarmed the swarm of courtly insects that live only in the sunshine of ministerial favor it was thought to be the forerunner of the dismission of mr pitt and every engine was set at work for the purpose of preventing such an event the principal engine employed on this occasion was calumny it was whispered in the ear of a great personage that mr fox was the last man in england to be trusted by a king because he was by principle a republican and consequently an enemy to monarchy  in the discussion of the quebec bill which stood for yesterday it was the intention of some persons to connect with this subject the french revolution in hopes that mr fox would be warmed by a collision with mr burke and induced to defend that revolution in which so much power was taken from and so little left in the crown  had mr fox fallen into the snare his speech on the occasion would have been laid before a great personage as a proof that a man who could defend such a revolution might be a very good republican but could not possibly be a friend to monarchy  but those who laid the snare were disappointed for mr fox in the short conversation which took place yesterday in the house of commons said that he confessedly had thought favorably of the french revolution but that most certainly he never had either in parliament or out of parliament professed or defended republican principlesargus april 22d 1791  mr burke cannot answer for the truth nor prove the falsehood of the story given by the friends of the party in this paper he only knows that an opinion of its being well or ill authenticated had no influence on his conduct he meant only to the best of his power to guard the public against the ill designs of factions out of doors what mr burke did in parliament could hardly have been intended to draw mr fox into any declarations unfavorable to his principles since by the account of those who are his friends he had long before effectually prevented the success of any such scandalous designs mr foxs friends have themselves done away that imputation on mr burke  9 see his speech on american taxation the 19th of april 1774  10 lord lansdowne  11 mr windham  12 july 17th 1765  13 works vol iii pp 251276

vindication of the rights of man recommended by the several societies  21 omnes omnium charitates patria una complectiturcic  22 a few lines in persius contain a good summary of all the objects of moral investigation and hint the result of our inquiry there human will has no place      quid sumus et quidnam victuri gignimur ordo     quis datus et metæ quis mollis flexus et unde     quis modus

loss to the world that the whole of this enlightened and philosophic sermon preached to two hundred thousand national guards assembled at blackheath a number probably equal to the sublime and majestic fédération of the 14th of july 1790 in the champ de mars is not preserved a short abstract is however to be found in walsingham i have added it here for the edification of the modern whigs who may possibly except this precious little fragment from their general contempt of ancient learning  ut suâ doctrinâ plures inficeret ad le blackheth ubi ducenta millia hominum communium fuere simul

sic demum et pacem sibimet parerent et securitatem in futurum si sublatis majoribus esset inter eos æqua libertas eadem nobilitas par dignitas similisque potestas  here is displayed at once the whole of the grand arcanum pretended to be found out by the national assembly for securing future happiness peace and tranquillity there seems however to be some doubt whether this venerable protomartyr of philosophy was inclined to carry his own declaration of the rights of men more rigidly into practice than the national assembly themselves he was like them only preaching licentiousness to the populace to obtain power for himself if we may believe what is subjoined by the historian  cumque hæc et plura alia deliramenta think of this old fools calling all the wise maxims of the french academy deliramenta prædicâsset commune vulgus cum tanto favore prosequitur ut exclamarent eum archiepiscopum futurum et regni cancellarium whether he would have taken these situations under these names or would have changed the whole nomenclature of the state and church to be understood in the sense of the revolution is not so certain it is probable that he would have changed the names and kept the substance of power  we find too that they had in those days their society for constitutional information of which the reverend john ball was a conspicuous member sometimes under his own name sometimes under the feigned name of john schep besides him it consisted as knyghton tells us of persons who went by the real or fictitious names of jack mylner tom baker jack straw jack trewman jack carter and probably of many more some of the choicest flowers of the publications charitably written and circulated by them gratis are upon record in walsingham and knyghton and i am inclined to prefer the pithy and sententious brevity of these bulletins of ancient rebellion before the loose and confused prolixity of the modern advertisements of constitutional information they contain more good morality and less bad politics they had much more foundation in real oppression and they have the recommendation of being much better adapted to the capacities of those for whose instruction they were intended whatever laudable pains the teachers of the present day appear to take i cannot compliment them so far as to allow that they have succeeded in writing down to the level of their pupils the members of the sovereign with half the ability of jack carter and the reverend john ball that my readers may judge for themselves i shall give them one or two specimens  the first is an address from the reverend john ball under his nom de guerre of john schep i know not against what particular guyle in borough the writer means to caution the people it may have been only a general cry against rotten boroughs which it was thought convenient then as now to make the first pretext and place at the head of the list of grievances  john schep  iohn schep sometime seint mary priest of yorke and now of colchester greeteth well iohn namelesse and iohn the miller and iohn carter and biddeth them that they beware of guyle in borough and stand together in gods name and biddeth piers ploweman goe

biddeth iohn trewman  all his fellowes  the reader has perceived from the last lines of this curious statepaper how well the national assembly has copied its union of the profession of universal peace with the practice of murder and confusion and the blast of the trumpet of sedition in all nations he will in the following constitutional paper observe how well in their enigmatical style like the assembly and their abettors the old philosophers proscribe all hereditary distinction and bestow it only on virtue and wisdom according to their estimation of both yet these people are supposed never to have heard of the rights of man  jack mylner  jakke mylner asket help to turne his mylne aright      he hath grounden smal smal      the kings sone of heven he schal pay for alle  loke thy mylne go

the  penal laws against irish catholics  previous to  the late repeal of a part thereof in the session of the irish parliament held ad 1782   charles street london feb 21 1782   my lordi am obliged to your lordship for your communication of the heads of mr gardiners bill i had received it in an earlier stage of its progress from mr braughall and i am still in that gentlemans debt as i have not made him the proper return for the favor he has done me business to which i was more immediately called and in which my sentiments had the weight of one vote occupied me every moment since i received his letter this first morning which i can call my own i give with great cheerfulness to the subject on which your lordship has done me the honor of desiring my opinion  i have read the heads of the bill with the amendments your lordship is too well acquainted with men and with affairs to imagine that any true judgment can be formed on the value of a great measure of policy from the perusal of a piece of paper at present i am much in the dark with regard to the state of the country which the intended law is to be applied to it is not easy for me to determine whether or no it was wise for the sake of expunging the black letter of laws which menacing as they were in the language were every day fading into disuse solemnly to reaffirm the principles and to reenact the provisions of a code of statutes by which you are totally excluded from the privileges of the commonwealth from the highest to the lowest from the most material of the civil professions from the army and even from education where alone education is to be had26  whether this scheme of indulgence grounded at once on contempt and jealousy has a tendency gradually to produce something better and more liberal i cannot tell for want of having the actual map of the country if this should be the case it was right in you to accept it such as it is but if this should be one of the experiments which have sometimes been made before the temper of the nation was ripe for a real reformation i think it may possibly have ill effects by disposing the penal matter in a more systematic order and thereby fixing a permanent bar against any relief that is truly substantial the whole merit or demerit of the measure depends upon the plans and dispositions of those by whom the act was made concurring with the general temper of the protestants of ireland and their aptitude to admit in time of some part of that equality without which you never can be fellowcitizens of all this i am wholly ignorant all my correspondence with men of public importance in ireland has for some time totally ceased on the first bill for the relief of the roman catholics of ireland i was without any call of mine consulted both on your side of the water and on this on the present occasion i have not heard a word from any man in office and know as little of the intentions of the british government as i know of the temper of the irish parliament i do not find that any opposition was made by the principal persons of the minority in the house of commons or that any is apprehended from them in the house of lords the whole of the difficulty seems to lie with the principal men in government under whose protection this bill is supposed to be brought in this violent opposition and cordial support coming from one and the same quarter appears to me something mysterious and hinders me from being able to make any clear judgment of the merit of the present measure as compared with the actual state of the country and the general views of government without which one can say nothing that may not be very erroneous  to look at the bill in the abstract it is neither more nor less than a renewed act of universal unmitigated indispensable exceptionless disqualification  one would imagine that a bill inflicting such a multitude of incapacities had followed on the heels of a conquest made by a very fierce enemy under the impression of recent animosity and resentment no man on reading that bill could imagine he was reading an act of amnesty and indulgence following a recital of the good behavior of those who are the objects of itwhich recital stood at the head of the bill as it was first introduced but i suppose for its incongruity with the body of the piece was afterwards omitted this i say on memory it however still recites the oath and that catholics ought to be considered as good and loyal subjects to his majesty his crown and government then follows an universal exclusion of those good and loyal subjects from every even the lowest office of trust and profitfrom any vote at an electionfrom any privilege in a town corporatefrom being even a freeman of such a corporationfrom serving on grand juriesfrom a vote at a vestryfrom having a gun in his housefrom being a barrister attorney or solicitor c c c  this has surely much more the air of a table of proscription than an act of grace what must we suppose the laws concerning those good subjects to have been of which this is a relaxation i know well that there is a cant language current about the difference between an exclusion from employments even to the most rigorous extent and an exclusion from the natural benefits arising from a mans own industry i allow that under some circumstances the difference is very material in point of justice and that there are considerations which may render it advisable for a wise government to keep the leading parts of every branch of civil and military administration in hands of the best trust but a total exclusion from the commonwealth is a very different thing when a government subsists as governments formerly did on an estate of its own with but few and inconsiderable revenues drawn from the subject then the few officers which existed in such establishments were naturally at the disposal of that government which paid the salaries out of its own coffers there an exclusive preference could hardly merit the name of proscription almost the whole produce of a mans industry at that time remained in his own purse to maintain his family but times alter and the whole estate of government is from private contribution when a very great portion of the labor of individuals goes to the state and is by the state again refunded to individuals through the medium of offices and in this circuitous progress from the private to the public and from the public again to the private fund the families from whom the revenue is taken are indemnified and an equitable balance between the government and the subject is established but if a great body of the people who contribute to this state lottery are excluded from all the prizes the stopping the circulation with regard to them may be a most cruel hardship amounting in effect to being double and treble taxed and it will be felt as such to the very quick by all the families high and low of those hundreds of thousands who are denied their chance in the returned fruits of their own industry this is the thing meant by those who look upon the public revenue only as a spoil and will naturally wish to have as few as possible concerned in the division of the booty if a state should be so unhappy as to think it cannot subsist without such a barbarous proscription the persons so proscribed ought to be indemnified by the remission of a large part of their taxes by an immunity from the offices of public burden and by an exemption from being pressed into any military or naval service  common sense and common justice dictate this at least as some sort of compensation to a people for their slavery how many families are incapable of existing if the little offices of the revenue and little military commissions are denied them to deny them at home and to make the happiness of acquiring some of them somewhere else felony or high treason is a piece of cruelty in which till very lately i did not suppose this age capable of persisting formerly a similarity of religion made a sort of country for a man in some quarter or other a refugee for religion was a protected character now the reception is cold indeed and therefore as the asylum abroad is destroyed the hardship at home is doubled this hardship is the more intolerable because the professions are shut up the church is so of course much is to be said on that subject in regard to them and to the protestant dissenters but that is a chapter by itself i am sure i wish well to that church and think its ministers among the very best citizens of your country however such as it is a great walk in life is forbidden ground to seventeen hundred thousand of the inhabitants of ireland why are they excluded from the law do not they expend money in their suits why may not they indemnify themselves by profiting in the persons of some for the losses incurred by others why may not they have persons of confidence whom they may if they please employ in the agency of their affairs the exclusion from the law from grand juries from sheriffships and undersheriffships as well as from freedom in any corporation may subject them to dreadful hardships as it may exclude them wholly from all that is beneficial and expose them to all that is mischievous in a trial by jury this was manifestly within my own observation for i was three times in ireland from the year 1760 to the year 1767 where i had sufficient means of information concerning the inhuman proceedings among which were many cruel murders besides an infinity of outrages and oppressions unknown before in a civilized age which prevailed during that period in consequence of a pretended conspiracy among roman catholics against the kings government i could dilate upon the mischiefs that may happen from those which have happened upon this head of disqualification if it were at all necessary  the head of exclusion from votes for members of parliament is closely connected with the former when you cast your eye on the statutebook you will see that no catholic even in the ferocious acts of queen anne was disabled from voting on account of his religion the only conditions required for that privilege were the oaths of allegiance and abjurationboth oaths relative to a civil concern parliament has since added another oath of the same kind and yet a house of commons adding to the securities of government in proportion as its danger is confessedly lessened and professing both confidence and indulgence in effect takes away the privilege left by an act full of jealousy and professing persecution  the taking away of a vote is the taking away the shield which the subject has not only against the oppression of power but that worst of all oppressions the persecution of private society and private manners no candidate for parliamentary influence is obliged to the least attention towards them either in cities or counties on the contrary if they should become obnoxious to any bigoted or malignant people amongst whom they live it will become the interest of those who court popular favor to use the numberless means which always reside in magistracy and influence to oppress them the proceedings in a certain county in munster during the unfortunate period i have mentioned read a strong lecture on the cruelty of depriving men of that shield on account of their speculative opinions the protestants of ireland feel well and naturally on the hardship of being bound by laws in the enacting of which they do not directly or indirectly vote the bounds of these matters are nice and hard to be settled in theory and perhaps they have been pushed too far but how they can avoid the necessary application of the principles they use in their disputes with others to their disputes with their fellowcitizens i know not  it is true the words of this act do not create a disability but they clearly and evidently suppose it there are few catholic freeholders to take the benefit of the privilege if they were permitted to partake it but the manner in which this very right in freeholders at large is defended is not on the idea that the freeholders do really and truly represent the people but that all people being capable of obtaining freeholds all those who by their industry and sobriety merit this privilege have the means of arriving at votes it is the same with the corporations  the laws against foreign education are clearly the very worst part of the old code besides your laity you have the succession of about four thousand clergymen to provide for these having no lucrative objects in prospect are taken very much out of the lower orders of the people at home they have no means whatsoever provided for their attaining a clerical education or indeed any education at all when i was in paris about seven years ago i looked at everything and lived with every kind of people as well as my time admitted i saw there the irish college of the lombard which seemed to me a very good place of education under excellent orders and regulations and under the government of a very prudent and learned man the late dr kelly this college was possessed of an annual fixed revenue of more than a thousand pound a year the greatest part of which had arisen from the legacies and benefactions of persons educated in that college and who had obtained promotions in france from the emolument of which promotions they made this grateful return one in particular i remember to the amount of ten thousand livres annually as it is recorded on the donors monument in their chapel  it has been the custom of poor persons in ireland to pick up such knowledge of the latin tongue as under the general discouragements and occasional pursuits of magistracy they were able to acquire and receiving orders at home were sent abroad to obtain a clerical education by officiating in petty chaplainships and performing now and then certain offices of religion for small gratuities they received the means of maintaining themselves until they were able to complete their education through such difficulties and discouragements many of them have arrived at a very considerable proficiency so as to be marked and distinguished abroad these persons afterwards by being sunk in the most abject poverty despised and illtreated by the higher orders among protestants and not much better esteemed or treated even by the few persons of fortune of their own persuasion and contracting the habits and ways of thinking of the poor and uneducated among whom they were obliged to live in a few years retained little or no traces of the talents and acquirements which distinguished them in the early periods of their lives can we with justice cut them off from the use of places of education founded for the greater part from the economy of poverty and exile without providing something that is equivalent at home  whilst this restraint of foreign and domestic education was part of an horrible and impious system of servitude the members were well fitted to the body to render men patient under a deprivation of all the rights of human nature everything which could give them a knowledge or feeling of those rights was rationally forbidden to render humanity fit to be insulted it was fit that it should be degraded but when we profess to restore men to the capacity for property it is equally irrational and unjust to deny them the power of improving their minds as well as their fortunes indeed i have ever thought the prohibition of the means of improving our rational nature to be the worst species of tyranny that the insolence and perverseness of mankind ever dared to exercise this goes to all men in all situations to whom education can be denied  your lordship mentions a proposal which came from my friend the provost whose benevolence and enlarged spirit i am perfectly convinced ofwhich is the proposal of erecting a few sizarships in the college for the education i suppose of roman catholic clergymen27 he certainly meant it well but coming from such a man as he is it is a strong instance of the danger of suffering any description of men to fall into entire contempt the charities intended for them are not perceived to be fresh insults and the true nature of their wants and necessities being unknown remedies wholly unsuitable to the nature of their complaint are provided for them it is to feed a sick gentoo with beef broth and to foment his wounds with brandy if the other parts of the university were open to them as well on the foundation as otherwise the offering of sizarships would be a proportioned part of a general kindness but when everything liberal is withheld and only that which is servile is permitted it is easy to conceive upon what footing they must be in such a place  mr hutchinson must well know the regard and honor i have for him and he cannot think my dissenting from him in this particular arises from a disregard of his opinion it only shows that i think he has lived in ireland to have any respect for the character and person of a popish priest thereoh tis an uphill work indeed but until we come to respect what stands in a respectable light with others we are very deficient in the temper which qualifies us to make any laws and regulations about them it even disqualifies us from being charitable to them with any effect or judgment  when we are to provide for the education of any body of men we ought seriously to consider the particular functions they are to perform in life a roman catholic clergyman is the minister of a very ritual religion and by his profession subject to many restraints his life is a life full of strict observances and his duties are of a laborious nature towards himself and of the highest possible trust towards others the duty of confession alone is sufficient to set in the strongest light the necessity of his having an appropriated mode of education the theological opinions and peculiar rites of one religion never can be properly taught in universities founded for the purposes and on the principles of another which in many points are directly opposite if a roman catholic clergyman intended for celibacy and the function of confession is not strictly bred in a seminary where these things are respected inculcated and enforced as sacred and not made the subject of derision and obloquy he will be ill fitted for the former and the latter will be indeed in his hands a terrible instrument  there is a great resemblance between the whole frame and constitution of the greek and latin churches the secular clergy in the former by being married living under little restraint and having no particular education suited to their function are universally fallen into such contempt that they are never permitted to aspire to the dignities of their own church it is not held respectful to call them papas their true and ancient appellation but those who wish to address them with civility always call them hieromonachi in consequence of this disrespect which i venture to say in such a church must be the consequence of a secular life a very great degeneracy from reputable christian manners has taken place throughout almost the whole of that great member of the christian church  it was so with the latin church before the restraint on marriage even that restraint gave rise to the greatest disorders before the council of trent which together with the emulation raised and the good examples given by the reformed churches wherever they were in view of each other has brought on that happy amendment which we see in the latin communion both at home and abroad  the council of trent has wisely introduced the discipline of seminaries by which priests are not trusted for a clerical institution even to the severe discipline of their colleges but after they pass through them are frequently if not for the greater part obliged to pass through peculiar methods having their particular ritual function in view it is in a great measure to this and to similar methods used in foreign education that the roman catholic clergy of ireland miserably provided for living among low and illregulated people without any discipline of sufficient force to secure good manners have been prevented from becoming an intolerable nuisance to the country instead of being as i conceive they generally are a very great service to it  the ministers of protestant churches require a different mode of education more liberal and more fit for the ordinary intercourse of life that religion having little hold on the minds of people by external ceremonies and extraordinary observances or separate habits of living the clergy make up the deficiency by cultivating their minds with all kinds of ornamental learning which the liberal provision made in england and ireland for the parochial clergy to say nothing of the ample church preferments with little or no duties annexed and the comparative lightness of parochial duties enables the greater part of them in some considerable degree to accomplish  this learning which i believe to be pretty general together with an higher situation and more chastened by the opinion of mankind forms a sufficient security for the morals of the established clergy and for their sustaining their clerical character with dignity it is not necessary to observe that all these things are however collateral to their function and that except in preaching which may be and is supplied and often best supplied out of printed books little else is necessary for a protestant minister than to be able to read the english languagei mean for the exercise of his function not to the qualification of his admission to it but a popish parson in ireland may do very well without any considerable classical erudition or any proficiency in pure or mixed mathematics or any knowledge of civil history even if the catholic clergy should possess those acquisitions as at first many of them do they soon lose them in the painful course of professional and parochial duties but they must have all the knowledge and what is to them more important than the knowledge the discipline necessary to those duties all modes of education conducted by those whose minds are cast in another mould as i may say and whose original ways of thinking are formed upon the reverse pattern must be to them not only useless but mischievous just as i should suppose the education in a popish ecclesiastical seminary would be ill fitted for a protestant clergyman to educate a catholic priest in a protestant seminary would be much worse the protestant educated amongst catholics has only something to reject what he keeps may be useful but a catholic parish priest learns little for his peculiar purpose and duty in a protestant college  all this my lord i know very well will pass for nothing with those who wish that the popish clergy should be illiterate and in a situation to produce contempt and detestation their minds are wholly taken up with party squabbles and i have neither leisure nor inclination to apply any part of what i have to say to those who never think of religion or of the commonwealth in any other light than as they tend to the prevalence of some faction in either i speak on a supposition that there is a disposition to take the state in the condition in which it is found and to improve it in that state to the best advantage hitherto the plan for the government of ireland has been to sacrifice the civil prosperity of the nation to its religious improvement but if people in power there are at length come to entertain other ideas they will consider the good order decorum virtue and morality of every description of men among them as of infinitely greater importance than the struggle for it is nothing better to change those descriptions by means which put to hazard objects which in my poor opinion are of more importance to religion and to the state than all the polemical matter which has been agitated among men from the beginning of the world to this hour  on this idea an education fitted to each order and division of men such as they are found will be thought an affair rather to be encouraged than discountenanced and until institutions at home suitable to the occasions and necessities of the people are established and which are armed as they are abroad with authority to coerce the young men to be formed in them by a strict and severe discipline the means they have at present of a cheap and effectual education in other countries should not continue to be prohibited by penalties and modes of inquisition not fit to be mentioned to ears that are organized to the chaste sounds of equity and justice  before i had written thus far i heard of a scheme of giving to the castle the patronage of the presiding members of the catholic clergy at first i could scarcely credit it for i believe it is the first time that the presentation to other peoples alms has been desired in any country if the state provides a suitable maintenance and temporality for the governing members of the irish roman catholic church and for the clergy under them i should think the project however improper in other respects to be by no means unjust but to deprive a poor people who maintain a second set of clergy out of the miserable remains of what is left after taxing and tithing to deprive them of the disposition of their own charities among their own communion would in my opinion be an intolerable hardship never were the members of one religious sect fit to appoint the pastors to another those who have no regard for their welfare reputation or internal quiet will not appoint such as are proper the seraglio of constantinople is as equitable as we are whether catholics or protestantsand where their own sect is concerned full as religious but the sport which they make of the miserable dignities of the greek church the little factions of the harem to which they make them subservient the continual sale to which they expose and reëxpose the same dignity and by which they squeeze all the inferior orders of the clergy is for i have had particular means of being acquainted with it nearly equal to all the other oppressions together exercised by mussulmen over the unhappy members of the oriental church it is a great deal to suppose that even the present castle would nominate bishops for the roman church of ireland with a religious regard for its welfare perhaps they cannot perhaps they dare not do it  but suppose them to be as well inclined as i know that i am to do the catholics all kind of justice i declare i would not if it were in my power take that patronage on myself i know i ought not to do it i belong to another community and it would be intolerable usurpation for me to affect such authority where i conferred no benefit or even if i did confer as in some degree the seraglio does temporal advantages but allowing that the present castle finds itself fit to administer the government of a church which they solemnly forswear and forswear with very hard words and many evil epithets and that as often as they qualify themselves for the power which is to give this very patronage or to give anything else that they desireyet they cannot insure themselves that a man like the late lord chesterfield will not succeed to them this man while he was duping the credulity of papists with fine words in private and commending their good behavior during a rebellion in great britain as it well deserved to be commended and rewarded was capable of urging penal laws against them in a speech from the throne and of stimulating with provocatives the wearied and halfexhausted bigotry of the then parliament of ireland they set to work but they were at a loss what to do for they had already almost gone through every contrivance which could waste the vigor of their country but after much struggle they produced a child of their old age the shocking and unnatural act about marriages which tended to finish the scheme for making the people not only two distinct parties forever but keeping them as two distinct species in the same land mr gardiners humanity was shocked at it as one of the worst parts of that truly barbarous system if one could well settle the preference where almost all the parts were outrages on the rights of humanity and the laws of nature  suppose an atheist playing the part of a bigot should be in power again in that country do you believe that he would faithfully and religiously administer the trust of appointing pastors to a church which wanting every other support stands in tenfold need of ministers who will be dear to the people committed to their charge and who will exercise a really paternal authority amongst them but if the superior power was always in a disposition to dispense conscientiously and like an upright trustee and guardian of these rights which he holds for those with whom he is at variance has he the capacity and means of doing it how can the lordlieutenant form the least judgment of their merits so as to discern which of the popish priests is fit to be made a bishop it cannot be the idea is ridiculous he will hand them over to lordslieutenant of counties justices of the peace and other persons who for the purpose of vexing and turning to derision this miserable people will pick out the worst and most obnoxious they can find amongst the clergy to set over the rest whoever is complained against by his brother will be considered as persecuted whoever is censured by his superior will be looked upon as oppressed whoever is careless in his opinions and loose in his morals will be called a liberal man and will be supposed to have incurred hatred because he was not a bigot informers talebearers perverse and obstinate men flatterers who turn their back upon their flock and court the protestant gentlemen of the country will be the objects of preferment and then i run no risk in foretelling that whatever order quiet and morality you have in the country will be lost a popish clergy who are not restrained by the most austere subordination will become a nuisance a real public grievance of the heaviest kind in any country that entertains them and instead of the great benefit which ireland does and has long derived from them if they are educated without any idea of discipline and obedience and then put under bishops who do not owe their station to their good opinion and whom they cannot respect that nation will see disorders of which bad as things are it has yet no idea i do not say this as thinking the leading men in ireland would exercise this trust worse than others not at all no man no set of men living are fit to administer the affairs or regulate the interior economy of a church to which they are enemies  as to government if i might recommend a prudent caution to them it would be to innovate as little as possible upon speculation in establishments from which as they stand they experience no material inconvenience to the repose of the countryquieta non movere  i could say a great deal more but i am tired and am afraid your lordship is tired too i have not sat to this letter a single quarter of an hour without interruption it has grown long and probably contains many repetitions from my total want of leisure to digest and consolidate my thoughts and as to my expressions i could wish to be able perhaps to measure them more exactly but my intentions are fair and i certainly mean to offend nobody                                       thinking over this matter more maturely i see no reason for altering my opinion in any part the act as far as it goes is good undoubtedly it amounts i think very nearly to a toleration with respect to religious ceremonies but it puts a new bolt on civil rights and rivets it to the old one in such a manner that neither i fear will be easily loosened what i could have wished would be to see the civil advantages take the lead the other of a religious toleration i conceive would follow in a manner of course from what i have observed it is pride arrogance and a spirit of domination and not a bigoted spirit of religion that has caused and kept up those oppressive statutes i am sure i have known those who have oppressed papists in their civil rights exceedingly indulgent to them in their religious ceremonies and who really wished them to continue catholics in order to furnish pretences for oppression these persons never saw a man by converting escape out of their power but with grudging and regret i have known men to whom i am not uncharitable in saying though they are dead that they would have become papists in order to oppress protestants if being protestants it was not in their power to oppress papists it is injustice and not a mistaken conscience that has been the principle of persecutionat least as far as it has fallen under my observationhowever as i began so i end i do not know the map of the country mr gardiner who conducts this great and difficult work and those who support him are better judges of the business than i can pretend to be who have not set my foot in ireland these sixteen years i have been given to understand that i am not considered as a friend to that country and i know that pains have been taken to lessen the credit that i might have had there                                       i am so convinced of the weakness of interfering in any business without the opinion of the people in whose business i interfere that i do not know how to acquit myself of what i have now done  i have the honor to be with high regard and esteem my lord  your lordships most obedient  and humble servant c  edmund burke  footnotes  26 the sketch of the bill sent to mr burke along with the repeal of some acts reaffirmed many others in the penal code it was altered afterwards and the clauses reaffirming the incapacities left out but they all still exist and are in full force  27 it appears that mr hutchinson meant this only as one of the means for their relief in point of education     a  letter  to  sir hercules langrishe bart mp  on the subject of  the roman catholics of ireland  the propriety of admitting them to the elective franchise consistently with the principles of the constitution as established at the revolution  1792   my dear siryour remembrance of me with sentiments of so much kindness has given me the most sincere satisfaction it perfectly agrees with the friendly and hospitable reception which my son and i received from you some time since when after an absence of twentytwo years i had the happiness of embracing you among my few surviving friends  i really imagined that i should not again interest myself in any public business i had to the best of my moderate faculties paid my club to the society which i was born in some way or other to serve and i thought i had a right to put on my nightgown and slippers and wish a cheerful evening to the good company i must leave behind but if our resolutions of vigor and exertion are so often broken or procrastinated in the execution i think we may be excused if we are not very punctual in fulfilling our engagements to indolence and inactivity i have indeed no power of action and am almost a cripple even with regard to thinking but you descend with force into the stagnant pool and you cause such a fermentation as to cure at least one impotent creature of his lameness though it cannot enable him either to run or to wrestle  you see by the paper28 i take that i am likely to be long with malice prepense you have brought under my view a subject always difficult at present critical it has filled my thoughts which i wish to lay open to you with the clearness and simplicity which your friendship demands from me i thank you for the communication of your ideas i should be still more pleased if they had been more your own what you hint i believe to be the case that if you had not deferred to the judgment of others our opinions would not differ more materially at this day than they did when we used to confer on the same subject so many years ago if i still persevere in my old opinions it is no small comfort to me that it is not with regard to doctrines properly yours that i discover my indocility  the case upon which your letter of the 10th of december turns is hardly before me with precision enough to enable me to form any very certain judgment upon it it seems to be some plan of further indulgence proposed for the catholics of ireland you observe that your general principles are not changed but that times and circumstances are altered i perfectly agree with you that times and circumstances considered with reference to the public ought very much to govern our conductthough i am far from slighting when applied with discretion to those circumstances general principles and maxims of policy i cannot help observing however that you have said rather less upon the inapplicability of your own old principles to the circumstances that are likely to influence your conduct against these principles than of the general maxims of state which i can very readily believe not to have great weight with you personally  in my present state of imperfect information you will pardon the errors into which i may easily fall the principles you lay down are that the roman catholics should enjoy everything under the state but should not be the state itself and you add that when you exclude them from being a part of the state you rather conform to the spirit of the age than to any abstract doctrine but you consider the constitution as already establishedthat our state is protestant it was declared so at the revolution it was so provided in the acts for settling the succession of the crownthe kings coronation oath was enjoined in order to keep it so the king as first magistrate of the state is obliged to take the oath of abjuration29 and to subscribe the declaration and by laws subsequent every other magistrate and member of the state legislative and executive are bound under the same obligation  as to the plan to which these maxims are applied i cannot speak as i told you positively about it because neither from your letter nor from any in formation i have been able to collect do i find anything settled either on the part of the roman catholics themselves or on that of any persons who may wish to conduct their affairs in parliament but if i have leave to conjecture something is in agitation towards admitting them under certain qualifications to have some share in the election of members of parliament this i understand is the scheme of those who are entitled to come within your description of persons of consideration property and characterand firmly attached to the king and constitution as by law established with a grateful sense of your former concessions and a patient reliance on the benignity of parliament for the further mitigation of the laws that still affect themas to the low thoughtless wild and profligate who have joined themselves with those of other professions but of the same character you are not to imagine that for a moment i can suppose them to be met with anything else than the manly and enlightened energy of a firm government supported by the united efforts of all virtuous men if ever their proceedings should become so considerable as to demand its notice i really think that such associations should be crushed in their very commencement  setting therefore this case out of the question it becomes an object of very serious consideration whether because wicked men of various descriptions are engaged in seditious courses the rational sober and valuable part of one description should not be indulged in their sober and rational expectations you who have looked deeply into the spirit of the popery laws must be perfectly sensible that a great part of the present mischief which we abhor in common if it at all exists has arisen from them their declared object was to reduce the catholics of ireland to a miserable populace without property without estimation without education the professed object was to deprive the few men who in spite of those laws might hold or obtain any property amongst them of all sort of influence or authority over the rest they divided the nation into two distinct bodies without common interest sympathy or connection one of these bodies was to possess all the franchises all the property all the education the other was to be composed of drawers of water and cutters of turf for them are we to be astonished when by the efforts of so much violence in conquest and so much policy in regulation continued without intermission for near an hundred years we had reduced them to a mob that whenever they came to act at all many of them would act exactly like a mob without temper measure or foresight surely it might be just now a matter of temperate discussion whether you ought not to apply a remedy to the real cause of the evil if the disorder you speak of be real and considerable you ought to raise an aristocratic interest that is an interest of property and education amongst themand to strengthen by every prudent means the authority and influence of men of that description it will deserve your best thoughts to examine whether this can be done without giving such persons the means of demonstrating to the rest that something more is to be got by their temperate conduct than can be expected from the wild and senseless projects of those who do not belong to their body who have no interest in their wellbeing and only wish to make them the dupes of their turbulent ambition  if the absurd persons you mention find no way of providing for liberty but by overturning this happy constitution and introducing a frantic democracy let us take care how we prevent better people from any rational expectations of partaking in the benefits of that constitution as it stands the maxims you establish cut the matter short they have no sort of connection with the good or the ill behavior of the persons who seek relief or with the proper or improper means by which they seek it they form a perpetual bar to all pleas and to all expectations  you begin by asserting that the catholics ought to enjoy all things under the state but that they ought not to be the state a position which i believe in the latter part of it and in the latitude there expressed no man of common sense has ever thought proper to dispute because the contrary implies that the state ought to be in them exclusively but before you have finished the line you express yourself as if the other member of your proposition namely that they ought not to be a part of the state were necessarily included in the firstwhereas i conceive it to be as different as a part is from the whole that is just as different as possible i know indeed that it is common with those who talk very differently from you that is with heat and animosity to confound those things and to argue the admission of the catholics into any however minute and subordinate parts of the state as a surrender into their hands of the whole government of the kingdom to them i have nothing at all to say  wishing to proceed with a deliberative spirit and temper in so very serious a question i shall attempt to analyze as well as i can the principles you lay down in order to fit them for the grasp of an understanding so little comprehensive as minestateprotestantrevolution these are terms which if not well explained may lead us into many errors in the word state i conceive there is much ambiguity the state is sometimes used to signify the whole commonwealth comprehending all its orders with the several privileges belonging to each sometimes it signifies only the higher and ruling part of the commonwealth which we commonly call the government in the first sense to be under the state but not the state itself nor any part of it that is to be nothing at all in the commonwealth is a situation perfectly intelligiblebut to those who fill that situation not very pleasant when it is understood it is a state of civil servitude by the very force of the definition servorum non est respublica is a very old and a very true maxim this servitude which makes men subject to a state without being citizens may be more or less tolerable from many circumstances but these circumstances more or less favorable do not alter the nature of the thing the mildness by which absolute masters exercise their dominion leaves them masters still we may talk a little presently of the manner in which the majority of the people of ireland the catholics are affected by this situation which at present undoubtedly is theirs and which you are of opinion ought so to continue forever  in the other sense of the word state by which is understood the supreme government only i must observe this upon the question that to exclude whole classes of men entirely from this part of government cannot be considered as absolute slavery it only implies a lower and degraded state of citizenship such is with more or less strictness the condition of all countries in which an hereditary nobility possess the exclusive rule this may be no bad mode of governmentprovided that the personal authority of individual nobles be kept in due bounds that their cabals and factions are guarded against with a severe vigilance and that the people who have no share in granting their own money are subjected to but light impositions and are otherwise treated with attention and with indulgence to their humors and prejudices  the republic of venice is one of those which strictly confines all the great functions and offices such as are truly stale functions and state offices to those who by hereditary right or admission are noble venetians but there are many offices and some of them not mean nor unprofitable that of chancellor is one which are reserved for the cittadini of these all citizens of venice are capable the inhabitants of the terra firma who are mere subjects of conquest that is as you express it under the state but not a part of it are not however subjects in so very rigorous a sense as not to be capable of numberless subordinate employments it is indeed one of the advantages attending the narrow bottom of their aristocracy narrow as compared with their acquired dominions otherwise broad enough that an exclusion from such employments cannot possibly be made amongst their subjects there are besides advantages in states so constituted by which those who are considered as of an inferior race are indemnified for their exclusion from the government and from nobler employments in all these countries either by express law or by usage more operative the noble castes are almost universally in their turn excluded from commerce manufacture farming of land and in general from all lucrative civil professions the nobles have the monopoly of honor the plebeians a monopoly of all the means of acquiring wealth thus some sort of a balance is formed among conditions a sort of compensation is furnished to those who in a limited sense are excluded from the government of the state  between the extreme of a total exclusion to which your maxim goes and an universal unmodified capacity to which the fanatics pretend there are many different degrees and stages and a great variety of temperaments upon which prudence may give full scope to its exertions for you know that the decisions of prudence contrary to the system of the insane reasoners differ from those of judicature and that almost all the former are determined on the more or the less the earlier or the later and on a balance of advantage and inconvenience of good and evil  in all considerations which turn upon the question of vesting or continuing the state solely and exclusively in some one description of citizens prudent legislators will consider how far the general form and principles of their commonwealth render it fit to be cast into an oligarchical shape or to remain always in it we know that the government of ireland the same as the british is not in its constitution wholly aristocratical and as it is not such in its form so neither is it in its spirit if it had been inveterately aristocratical exclusions might be more patiently submitted to the lot of one plebeian would be the lot of all and an habitual reverence and admiration of certain families might make the people content to see government wholly in hands to whom it seemed naturally to belong but our constitution has a plebeian member which forms an essential integrant part of it a plebeian oligarchy is a monster and no people not absolutely domestic or predial slaves will long endure it the protestants of ireland are not alone sufficiently the people to form a democracy and they are too numerous to answer the ends and purposes of an aristocracy admiration that first source of obedience can be only the claim or the imposture of the few i hold it to be absolutely impossible for two millions of plebeians composing certainly a very clear and decided majority in that class to become so far in love with six or seven hundred thousand of their fellowcitizens to all outward appearance plebeians like themselves and many of them tradesmen servants and otherwise inferior to some of them as to see with satisfaction or even with patience an exclusive power vested in them by which constitutionally they become the absolute masters and by the manners derived from their circumstances must be capable of exercising upon them daily and hourly an insulting and vexatious superiority neither are the majority of the irish indemnified as in some aristocracies for this state of humiliating vassalage often inverting the nature of things and relations by having the lower walks of industry wholly abandoned to them they are rivalled to say the least of the matter in every laborious and lucrative course of life while every franchise every honor every trust every place down to the very lowest and least confidential besides whole professions is reserved for the master caste  our constitution is not made for great general and proscriptive exclusions sooner or later it will destroy them or they will destroy the constitution in our constitution there has always been a difference between a franchise and an office and between the capacity for the one and for the other franchises were supposed to belong to the subject as a subject and not as a member of the governing part of the state the policy of government has considered them as things very different for whilst parliament excluded by the test acts and for a while these test acts were not a dead letter as now they are in england protestant dissenters from all civil and military employments they never touched their right of voting for members of parliament or sitting in either house a point i state not as approving or condemning with regard to them the measure of exclusion from employments but to prove that the distinction has been admitted in legislature as in truth it is founded in reason  i will not here examine whether the principles of the british the irish constitution be wise or not i must assume that they are and that those who partake the franchises which make it partake of a benefit they who are excluded from votes under proper qualifications inherent in the constitution that gives them are excluded not from the state but from the british constitution they cannot by any possibility whilst they hear its praises continually rung in their ears and are present at the declaration which is so generally and so bravely made by those who possess the privilege that the best blood in their veins ought to be shed to preserve their share in itthey the disfranchised part cannot i say think themselves in an happy state to be utterly excluded from all its direct and all its consequential advantages the popular part of the constitution must be to them by far the most odious part of it to them it is not an actual and if possible still less a virtual representation it is indeed the direct contrary it is power unlimited placed in the hands of an adverse description because it is an adverse description and if they who compose the privileged body have not an interest they must but too frequently have motives of pride passion petulance peevish jealousy or tyrannic suspicion to urge them to treat the excluded people with contempt and rigor  this is not a mere theory though whilst men are men it is a theory that cannot be false i do not desire to revive all the particulars in my memory i wish them to sleep forever but it is impossible i should wholly forget what happened in some parts of ireland with very few and short intermissions from the year 1761 to the year 1766 both inclusive in a country of miserable police passing from the extremes of laxity to the extremes of rigor among a neglected and therefore disorderly populace if any disturbance or sedition from any grievance real or imaginary happened to arise it was presently perverted from its true nature often criminal enough in itself to draw upon it a severe appropriate punishment it was metamorphosed into a conspiracy against the state and prosecuted as such amongst the catholics as being by far the most numerous and the most wretched all sorts of offenders against the laws must commonly be found the punishment of low people for the offences usual among low people would warrant no inference against any descriptions of religion or of politics men of consideration from their age their profession or their character men of proprietary landed estates substantial renters opulent merchants physicians and titular bishops could not easily be suspected of riot in open day or of nocturnal assemblies for the purpose of pulling down hedges making breaches in parkwalls firing barns maiming cattle and outrages of a similar nature which characterize the disorders of an oppressed or a licentious populace but when the evidence given on the trial for such misdemeanors qualified them as overt acts of high treason and when witnesses were found such witnesses as they were to depose to the taking of oaths of allegiance by the rioters to the king of france to their being paid by his money and embodied and exercised under his officers to overturn the state for the purposes of that potentatein that case the rioters might if the witness was believed be supposed only the troops and persons more reputable the leaders and commanders in such a rebellion all classes in the obnoxious description who could not be suspected of the lower crime of riot might be involved in the odium in the suspicion and sometimes in the punishment of a higher and far more criminal species of offence these proceedings did not arise from any one of the popery laws since repealed but from this circumstance that when it answered the purposes of an election party or a malevolent person of influence to forge such plots the people had no protection the people of that description have no hold on the gentlemen who aspire to be popular representatives the candidates neither love nor respect nor fear them individually or collectively i do not think this evil an evil amongst a thousand others at this day entirely over for i conceive i have lately seen some indication of a disposition perfectly similar to the old onethat is a disposition to carry the imputation of crimes from persons to descriptions and wholly to alter the character and quality of the offences themselves  this universal exclusion seems to me a serious evilbecause many collateral oppressions besides what i have just now stated have arisen from it in things of this nature it would not be either easy or proper to quote chapter and verse but i have great reason to believe particularly since the octennial act that several have refused at all to let their lands to roman catholics because it would so far disable them from promoting such interests in counties as they were inclined to favor they who consider also the state of all sorts of tradesmen shopkeepers and particularly publicans in towns must soon discern the disadvantages under which those labor who have no votes it cannot be otherwise whilst the spirit of elections and the tendencies of human nature continue as they are if property be artificially separated from franchise the franchise must in some way or other and in some proportion naturally attract property to it many are the collateral disadvantages amongst a privileged people which must attend on those who have no privileges  among the rich each individual with or without a franchise is of importance the poor and the middling are no otherwise so than as they obtain some collective capacity and can be aggregated to some corps if legal ways are not found illegal will be resorted to and seditious clubs and confederacies such as no man living holds in greater horror than i do will grow and flourish in spite i am afraid of anything which can be done to prevent the evil lawful enjoyment is the surest method to prevent unlawful gratification where there is property there will be less theft where there is marriage there will always be less fornication  i have said enough of the question of state as it affects the people merely as such but it is complicated with a political question relative to religion to which it is very necessary i should say somethingbecause the term protestant which you apply is too general for the conclusions which one of your accurate understanding would wish to draw from it and because a great deal of argument will depend on the use that is made of that term  it is not a fundamental part of the settlement at the revolution that the state should be protestant without any qualification of the term with a qualification it is unquestionably true not in all its latitude with the qualification it was true before the revolution our predecessors in legislation were not so irrational not to say impious as to form an operose ecclesiastical establishment and even to render the state itself in some degree subservient to it when their religion if such it might be called was nothing but a mere negation of some otherwithout any positive idea either of doctrine discipline worship or morals in the scheme which they professed themselves and which they imposed upon others even under penalties and incapacities no no this never could have been done even by reasonable atheists they who think religion of no importance to the state have abandoned it to the conscience or caprice of the individual they make no provision for it whatsoever but leave every club to make or not a voluntary contribution towards its support according to their fancies this would be consistent the other always appeared to me to be a monster of contradiction and absurdity it was for that reason that some years ago i strenuously opposed the clergy who petitioned to the number of about three hundred to be freed from the subscription to the thirtynine articles without proposing to substitute any other in their place there never has been a religion of the state the few years of the parliament only excepted but that of the episcopal church of england the episcopal church of england before the reformation connected with the see of rome since then disconnected and protesting against some of her doctrines and against the whole of her authority as binding in our national church nor did the fundamental laws of this kingdom in ireland it has been the same ever know at any period any other church as an object of establishmentor in that light any other protestant religion nay our protestant toleration itself at the revolution and until within a few years required a signature of thirtysix and a part of the thirtyseventh out of the thirtynine articles so little idea had they at the revolution of establishing protestantism indefinitely that they did not indefinitely tolerate it under that name i do not mean to praise that strictness where nothing more than merely religious toleration is concerned toleration being a part of moral and political prudence ought to be tender and large a tolerant government ought not to be too scrupulous in its investigations but may bear without blame not only very illgrounded doctrines but even many things that are positively vices where they are adulta et prævalida the good of the commonwealth is the rule which rides over the rest and to this every other must completely submit  the church of scotland knows as little of protestantism undefined as the church of england and ireland do she has by the articles of union secured to herself the perpetual establishment of the confession of faith and the presbyterian church government in england even during the troubled interregnum it was not thought fit to establish a negative religion but the parliament settled the presbyterian as the church discipline the directory as the rule of public worship and the westminster catechism as the institute of faith this is to show that at no time was the protestant religion undefined established here or anywhere else as i believe i am sure that when the three religions were established in germany they were expressly characterized and declared to be the evangelic the reformed and the catholic each of which has its confession of faith and its settled discipline so that you always may know the best and the worst of them to enable you to make the most of what is good and to correct or to qualify or to guard against whatever may seem evil or dangerous  as to the coronation oath to which you allude as opposite to admitting a roman catholic to the use of any franchise whatsoever i cannot think that the king would be perjured if he gave his assent to any regulation which parliament might think fit to make with regard to that affair the king is bound by law as clearly specified in several acts of parliament to be in communion with the church of england it is a part of the tenure by which he holds his crown and though no provision was made till the revolution which could be called positive and valid in law to ascertain this great principle i have always considered it as in fact fundamental that the king of england should be of the christian religion according to the national legal church for the time being i conceive it was so before the reformation since the reformation it became doubly necessary because the king is the head of that church in some sort an ecclesiastical personand it would be incongruous and absurd to have the head of the church of one faith and the members of another the king may inherit the crown as a protestant but he cannot hold it according to law without being a protestant of the church of england  before we take it for granted that the king is bound by his coronation oath not to admit any of his catholic subjects to the rights and liberties which ought to belong to them as englishmen not as religionists or to settle the conditions or proportions of such admission by an act of parliament i wish you to place before your eyes that oath itself as it is settled in the act of william and mary  will you to the utmost of your power maintain       1                2                 3 the laws of god the true profession of the gospel            4 and the protestant reformed religion established by                             5 law and will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of themall this i promise to do  here are the coronation engagements of the king in them i do not find one word to preclude his majesty from consenting to any arrangement which parliament may make with regard to the civil privileges of any part of his subjects  it may not be amiss on account of the light which it will throw on this discussion to look a little more narrowly into the matter of that oathin order to discover how far it has hitherto operated or how far in future it ought to operate as a bar to any proceedings of the crown and parliament in favor of those against whom it may be supposed that the king has engaged to support the protestant church of england in the two kingdoms in which it is established by law first the king swears he will maintain to the utmost of his power the laws of god i suppose it means the natural moral lawssecondly he swears to maintain the true profession of the gospel by which i suppose is understood affirmatively the christian religionthirdly that he will maintain the protestant reformed religion this leaves me no power of supposition or conjecture for that protestant reformed religion is defined and described by the subsequent words established by law and in this instance to define it beyond all possibility of doubt he swears to maintain the bishops and clergy and the churches committed to their charge in their rights present and future  the oath as effectually prevents the king from doing anything to the prejudice of the church in favor of sectaries jews mahometans or plain avowed infidels as if he should do the same thing in favor of the catholics you will see that it is the same protestant church so described that the king is to maintain and communicate with according to the act of settlement of the 12th and 13th of william the third the act of the 5th of anne made in prospect of the union is entitled an act for securing the church of england as by law established it meant to guard the church implicitly against any other mode of protestant religion which might creep in by means of the union it proves beyond all doubt that the legislature did not mean to guard the church on one part only and to leave it defenceless and exposed upon every other this church in that act is declared to be fundamental and essential forever in the constitution of the united kingdom so far as england is concerned and i suppose as the law stands even since the independence it is so in ireland  all this shows that the religion which the king is bound to maintain has a positive part in it as well as a negativeand that the positive part of it in which we are in perfect agreement with the catholics and with the church of scotland is infinitely the most valuable and essential such an agreement we had with protestant dissenters in england of those descriptions who came under the toleration act of king william and queen mary an act coeval with the revolution and which ought on the principles of the gentlemen who oppose the relief to the catholics to have been held sacred and unalterable whether we agree with the present protestant dissenters in the points at the revolution held essential and fundamental among christians or in any other fundamental at present it is impossible for us to know because at their own very earnest desire we have repealed the toleration act of william and mary and discharged them from the signature required by that act and because for the far greater part they publicly declare against all manner of confessions of faith even the consensus  for reasons forcible enough at all times but at this time particularly forcible with me i dwell a little the longer upon this matter and take the more pains to put us both in mind that it was not settled at the revolution that the state should be protestant in the latitude of the term but in a defined and limited sense only and that in that sense only the king is sworn to maintain it to suppose that the king has sworn with his utmost power to maintain what it is wholly out of his power to discover or which if he could discover he might discover to consist of things directly contradictory to each other some of them perhaps impious blasphemous and seditious upon principle would be not only a gross but a most mischievous absurdity if mere dissent from the church of rome be a merit he that dissents the most perfectly is the most meritorious in many points we hold strongly with that church he that dissents throughout with that church will dissent with the church of england and then it will be a part of his merit that he dissents with ourselves a whimsical species of merit for any set of men to establish we quarrel to extremity with those who we know agree with us in many things but we are to be so malicious even in the principle of our friendships that we are to cherish in our bosom those who accord with us in nothing because whilst they despise ourselves they abhor even more than we do those with whom we have some disagreement a man is certainly the most perfect protestant who protests against the whole christian religion whether a persons having no christian religion be a title to favor in exclusion to the largest description of christians who hold all the doctrines of christianity though holding along with them some errors and some superfluities is rather more than any man who has not become recreant and apostate from his baptism will i believe choose to affirm the countenance given from a spirit of controversy to that negative religion may by degrees encourage light and unthinking people to a total indifference to everything positive in matters of doctrine and in the end of practice too if continued it would play the game of that sort of active proselytizing and persecuting atheism which is the disgrace and calamity of our time and which we see to be as capable of subverting a government as any mode can be of misguided zeal for better things  now let us fairly see what course has been taken relative to those against whom in part at least the king has sworn to maintain a church positive in its doctrine and its discipline the first thing done even when the oath was fresh in the mouth of the sovereigns was to give a toleration to protestant dissenters whose doctrines they ascertained as to the mere civil privileges which the dissenters held as subjects before the revolution these were not touched at all the laws have fully permitted in a qualification for all offices to such dissenters an occasional conformity a thing i believe singular where tests are admitted the act called the test act itself is with regard to them grown to be hardly anything more than a dead letter whenever the dissenters cease by their conduct to give any alarm to the government in church and state i think it very probable that even this matter rather disgustful than inconvenient to them may be removed or at least so modified as to distinguish the qualification to those offices which really guide the state from those which are merely instrumental or that some other and better tests may be put in their place  so far as to england in ireland you have outran us without waiting for an english example you have totally and without any modification whatsoever repealed the test as to protestant dissenters not having the repealing act by me i ought not to say positively that there is no exception in it but if it be what i suppose it is you know very well that a jew in religion or a mahometan or even a public declared atheist and blasphemer is perfectly qualified to be lordlieutenant a lordjustice or even keeper of the kings conscience and by virtue of his office if with you it be as it is with us administrator to a great part of the ecclesiastical patronage of the crown  now let us deal a little fairly we must admit that protestant dissent was one of the quarters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution and against which a part of the coronation oath was peculiarly directed by this unqualified repeal you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to preserve the church against protestant dissenters or taking this to be the true sense of the two revolution acts of king william and of the previous and subsequent union acts of queen anne you did not declare by this most unqualified repeal by which you broke down all the barriers not invented indeed but carefully preserved at the revolutionyou did not then and by that proceeding declare that you had advised the king to perjury towards god and perfidy towards the church no far very far from it you never would have done it if you did not think it could be done with perfect repose to the royal conscience and perfect safety to the national established religion you did this upon a full consideration of the circumstances of your country now if circumstances required it why should it be contrary to the kings oath his parliament judging on those circumstances to restore to his catholic people in such measure and with such modifications as the public wisdom shall think proper to add some part in these franchises which they formerly had held without any limitation at all and which upon no sort of urgent reason at the time they were deprived of if such means can with any probability be shown from circumstances rather to add strength to our mixed ecclesiastical and secular constitution than to weaken it surely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties incapacities and proscriptions continued from generation to generation they are perfectly consistent with the other parts of the coronation oath in which the king swears to maintain the laws of god and the true profession of the gospel and to govern the people according to the statutes in parliament agreed upon and the laws and customs of the realm in consenting to such a statute the crown would act at least as agreeable to the laws of god and to the true profession of the gospel and to the laws and customs of the kingdom as george the first did when he passed the statute which took from the body of the people everything which to that hour and even after the monstrous acts of the 2nd and 8th of anne the objects of our common hatred they still enjoyed inviolate  it is hard to distinguish with the last degree of accuracy what laws are fundamental and what not however there is a distinction between them authorized by the writers on jurisprudence and recognized in some of our statutes i admit the acts of king william and queen anne to be fundamental but they are not the only fundamental laws the law called magna charta by which it is provided that no man shall be disseised of his liberties and free customs but by the judgment of his peers or the laws of the land meaning clearly for some proved crime tried and adjudged i take to be a fundamental law now although this magna charta or some of the statutes establishing it provide that that law shall be perpetual and all statutes contrary to it shall be void yet i cannot go so far as to deny the authority of statutes made in defiance of magna charta and all its principles this however i will saythat it is a very venerable law made by very wise and learned men and that the legislature in their attempt to perpetuate it even against the authority of future parliaments have shown their judgment that it is fundamental on the same grounds and in the same manner that the act of the fifth of anne has considered and declared the establishment of the church of england to be fundamental magna charta which secured these franchises to the subjects regarded the rights of freeholders in counties to be as much a fundamental part of the constitution as the establishment of the church of england was thought either at that time or in the act of king william or in the act of queen anne  the churchmen who led in that transaction certainly took care of the material interest of which they were the natural guardians it is the first article of magna charta that the church of england shall be free c c but at that period churchmen and barons and knights took care of the franchises and free customs of the people too those franchises are part of the constitution itself and inseparable from it it would be a very strange thing if there should not only exist anomalies in our laws a thing not easy to prevent but that the fundamental parts of the constitution should be perpetually and irreconcilably at variance with each other i cannot persuade myself that the lovers of our church are not as able to find effectual ways of reconciling its safety with the franchises of the people as the ecclesiastics of the thirteenth century were able to do i cannot conceive how anything worse can be said of the protestant religion of the church of england than thisthat wherever it is judged proper to give it a legal establishment it becomes necessary to deprive the body of the people if they adhere to their old opinions of their liberties and of all their free customs and to reduce them to a state of civil servitude  there is no man on earth i believe more willing than i am to lay it down as a fundamental of the constitution that the church of england should be united and even identified with it but allowing this i cannot allow that all laws of regulation made from time to time in support of that fundamental law are of course equally fundamental and equally unchangeable this would be to confound all the branches of legislation and of jurisprudence the crown and the personal safety of the monarch are fundamentals in our constitution yet i hope that no man regrets that the rabble of statutes got together during the reign of henry the eighth by which treasons are multiplied with so prolific an energy have been all repealed in a body although they were all or most of them made in support of things truly fundamental in our constitution so were several of the acts by which the crown exercised its supremacy such as the act of elizabeth for making the high commission courts and the like as well as things made treason in the time of charles the second none of this species of secondary and subsidiary laws have been held fundamental they have yielded to circumstances particularly where they were thought even in their consequences or obliquely to affect other fundamentals how much more certainly ought they to give way when as in our case they affect not here and there in some particular point or in their consequence but universally collectively and directly the fundamental franchises of a people equal to the whole inhabitants of several respectable kingdoms and states equal to the subjects of the kings of sardinia or of denmark equal to those of the united netherlands and more than are to be found in all the states of switzerland this way of proscribing men by whole nations as it were from all the benefits of the constitution to which they were born i never can believe to be politic or expedient much less necessary for the existence of any state or church in the world whenever i shall be convinced which will be late and reluctantly that the safety of the church is utterly inconsistent with all the civil rights whatsoever of the far larger part of the inhabitants of our country i shall be extremely sorry for it because i shall think the church to be truly in danger it is putting things into the position of an ugly alternative into which i hope in god they never will be put  i have said most of what occurs to me on the topics you touch upon relative to the religion of the king and his coronation oath i shall conclude the observations which i wished to submit to you on this point by assuring you that i think you the most remote that can be conceived from the metaphysicians of our times who are the most foolish of men and who dealing in universals and essences see no difference between more and lessand who of course would think that the reason of the law which obliged the king to be a communicant of the church of england would be as valid to exclude a catholic from being an exciseman or to deprive a man who has five hundred a year under that description from voting on a par with a factitious protestant dissenting freeholder of forty shillings  recollect my dear friend that it was a fundamental principle in the french monarchy whilst it stood that the state should be catholic yet the edict of nantes gave not a full ecclesiastical but a complete civil establishment with places of which only they were capable to the calvinists of franceand there were very few employments indeed of which they were not capable the world praised the cardinal de richelieu who took the first opportunity to strip them of their fortified places and cautionary towns the same world held and does hold in execration so far as that business is concerned the memory of louis the fourteenth for the total repeal of that favorable edict though the talk of fundamental laws established religion religion of the prince safety to the state c c was then as largely held and with as bitter a revival of the animosities of the civil confusions during the struggles between the parties as now they can be in ireland  perhaps there are persons who think that the same reason does not hold when the religious relation of the sovereign and subject is changed but they who have their shop full of false weights and measures and who imagine that the adding or taking away the name of protestant or papist guelph or ghibelline alters all the principles of equity policy and prudence leave us no common data upon which we can reason i therefore pass by all this which on you will make no impression to come to what seems to be a serious consideration in your mind i mean the dread you express of reviewing for the purpose of altering the principles of the revolution this is an interesting topic on which i will as fully as your leisure and mine permits lay before you the ideas i have formed  first i cannot possibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the revolution with the principles of the revolution as in most great changes many things were done from the necessities of the time well or ill understood from passion or from vengeance which were not only not perfectly agreeable to its principles but in the most direct contradiction to them i shall not think that the deprivation of some millions of people of all the rights of citizens and all interest in the constitution in and to which they were born was a thing conformable to the declared principles of the revolution this i am sure is true relatively to england where the operation of these antiprinciples comparatively were of little extent and some of our late laws in repealing acts made immediately after the revolution admit that some things then done were not done in the true spirit of the revolution but the revolution operated differently in england and ireland in many and these essential particulars supposing the principles to have been altogether the same in both kingdoms by the application of those principles to very different objects the whole spirit of the system was changed not to say reversed in england it was the struggle of the great body of the people for the establishment of their liberties against the efforts of a very small faction who would have oppressed them in ireland it was the establishment of the power of the smaller number at the expense of the civil liberties and properties of the far greater part and at the expense of the political liberties of the whole it was to say the truth not a revolution but a conquest which is not to say a great deal in its favor to insist on everything done in ireland at the revolution would be to insist on the severe and jealous policy of a conqueror in the crude settlement of his new acquisition as a permanent rule for its future government this no power in no country that ever i heard of has done or professed to doexcept in ireland where it is done and possibly by some people will be professed time has by degrees in all other places and periods blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors so after some time and after one of the most rigid conquests that we read of in history the normans softened into the english i wish you to turn your recollection to the fine speech of cerealis to the gauls made to dissuade them from revolt speaking of the romansnos quamvis toties lacessiti jure victoriæ id solum vobis addidimus quo pacem tueremur nam neque quies gentium sine armis neque arma sine stipendiis neque stipendia sine tributis haberi queant caetera in communi sita sunt ipsi plerumque nostris exercitibus praesidetis ipsi has aliasque provincias regitis nil separatum clausumve proinde pacem et urbem quam victores victique eodem jure obtinemus amate colite you will consider whether the arguments used by that roman to these gauls would apply to the case in irelandand whether you could use so plausible a preamble to any severe warning you might think it proper to hold out to those who should resort to sedition instead of supplication to obtain any object that they may pursue with the governing power  for a much longer period than that which had sufficed to blend the romans with the nation to which of all others they were the most adverse the protestants settled in ireland considered themselves in no other light than that of a sort of a colonial garrison to keep the natives in subjection to the other state of great britain the whole spirit of the revolution in ireland was that of not the mildest conqueror in truth the spirit of those proceedings did not commence at that era nor was religion of any kind their primary object what was done was not in the spirit of a contest between two religious factions but between two adverse nations the statutes of kilkenny show that the spirit of the popery laws and some even of their actual provisions as applied between englishry and irishry had existed in that harassed country before the words protestant and papist were heard of in the world if we read baron finglas spenser and sir john davies we cannot miss the true genius and policy of the english government there before the revolution as well as during the whole reign of queen elizabeth sir john davies boasts of the benefits received by the natives by extending to them the english law and turning the whole kingdom into shire ground but the appearance of things alone was changed the original scheme was never deviated from for a single hour unheardof confiscations were made in the northern parts upon grounds of plots and conspiracies never proved upon their supposed authors the war of chicane succeeded to the war of arms and of hostile statutes and a regular series of operations was carried on particularly from chichesters time in the ordinary courts of justice and by special commissions and inquisitionsfirst under pretence of tenures and then of titles in the crown for the purpose of the total extirpation of the interest of the natives in their own soiluntil this species of subtle ravage being carried to the last excess of oppression and insolence under lord strafford it kindled the flames of that rebellion which broke out in 1641 by the issue of that war by the turn which the earl of clarendon gave to things at the restoration and by the total reduction of the kingdom of ireland in 1691 the ruin of the native irish and in a great measure too of the first races of the english was completely accomplished the new english interest was settled with as solid a stability as anything in human affairs can look for all the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppression which were made after the last event were manifestly the effects of national hatred and scorn towards a conquered people whom the victors delighted to trample upon and were not at all afraid to provoke they were not the effect of their fears but of their security they who carried on this system looked to the irresistible force of great britain for their support in their acts of power they were quite certain that no complaints of the natives would be heard on this side of the water with any other sentiments than those of contempt and indignation their cries served only to augment their torture machines which could answer their purposes so well must be of an excellent contrivance indeed in england the double name of the complainants irish and papists it would be hard to say which singly was the most odious shut up the hearts of every one against them whilst that temper prevailed and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory every measure was pleasing and popular just in proportion as it tended to harass and ruin a set of people who were looked upon as enemies to god and man and indeed as a race of bigoted savages who were a disgrace to human nature itself  however as the english in ireland began to be domiciliated they began also to recollect that they had a country the english interest at first by faint and almost insensible degrees but at length openly and avowedly became an independent irish interestfull as independent as it could ever have been if it had continued in the persons of the native irish and it was maintained with more skill and more consistency than probably it would have been in theirs with their views the angloirish changed their maxims it was necessary to demonstrate to the whole people that there was something at least of a common interest combined with the independency which was to become the object of common exertions the mildness of government produced the first relaxation towards the irish the necessities and in part too the temper that predominated at this great change produced the second and the most important of these relaxations english government and irish legislature felt jointly the propriety of this measure the irish parliament and nation became independent  the true revolution to you that which most intrinsically and substantially resembled the english revolution of 1688 was the irish revolution of 1782 the irish parliament of 1782 bore little resemblance to that which sat in that kingdom after the period of the first of these revolutions it bore a much nearer resemblance to that which sat under king james the change of the parliament in 1782 from the character of the parliament which as a token of its indignation had burned all the journals indiscriminately of the former parliament in the councilchamber was very visible the address of king williams parliament the parliament which assembled after the revolution amongst other causes of complaint many of them sufficiently just complains of the repeal by their predecessors of poyningss lawno absolute idol with the parliament of 1782  great britain finding the angloirish highly animated with a spirit which had indeed shown itself before though with little energy and many interruptions and therefore suffered a multitude of uniform precedents to be established against it acted in my opinion with the greatest temperance and wisdom she saw that the disposition of the leading part of the nation would not permit them to act any longer the part of a garrison she saw that true policy did not require that they ever should have appeared in that character or if it had done so formerly the reasons had now ceased to operate she saw that the irish of her race were resolved to build their constitution and their politics upon another bottom with those things under her view she instantly complied with the whole of your demands without any reservation whatsoever she surrendered that boundless superiority for the preservation of which and the acquisition she had supported the english colonies in ireland for so long a time and at so vast an expense according to the standard of those ages of her blood and treasure  when we bring before us the matter which history affords for our selection it is not improper to examine the spirit of the several precedents which are candidates for our choice might it not be as well for your statesmen on the other side of the water to take an example from this latter and surely more conciliatory revolution as a pattern for your conduct towards your own fellowcitizens than from that of 1688 when a paramount sovereignty over both you and them was more loftily claimed and more sternly exerted than at any former or at any subsequent period great britain in 1782 rose above the vulgar ideas of policy the ordinary jealousies of state and all the sentiments of national pride and national ambition if she had been more disposed than i thank god for it she was to listen to the suggestions of passion than to the dictates of prudence she might have urged the principles the maxims the policy the practice of the revolution against the demands of the leading description in ireland with full as much plausibility and full as good a grace as any amongst them can possibly do against the supplications of so vast and extensive a description of their own people  a good deal too if the spirit of domination and exclusion had prevailed in england might have been excepted against some of the means then employed in ireland whilst her claims were in agitation they were at least as much out of ordinary course as those which are now objected against admitting your people to any of the benefits of an english constitution most certainly neither with you nor here was any one ignorant of what was at that time said written and done but on all sides we separated the means from the end and we separated the cause of the moderate and rational from the illintentioned and seditious which on such occasions are so frequently apt to march together at that time on your part you were not afraid to review what was done at the revolution of 1688 and what had been continued during the subsequent flourishing period of the british empire the change then made was a great and fundamental alteration in the execution it was an operose business on both sides of the water it required the repeal of several laws the modification of many and a new course to be given to an infinite number of legislative judicial and official practices and usages in both kingdoms this did not frighten any of us you are now asked to give in some moderate measure to your fellowcitizens what great britain gave to you without any measure at all yet notwithstanding all the difficulties at the time and the apprehensions which some very wellmeaning people entertained through the admirable temper in which this revolution or restoration in the nature of a revolution was conducted in both kingdoms it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either and i trust with the continuance of the same temper that it never will i think that this small inconsiderable change relative to an exclusive statute not made at the revolution for restoring the people to the benefits from which the green soreness of a civil war had not excluded them will be productive of no sort of mischief whatsoever compare what was done in 1782 with what is wished in 1792 consider the spirit of what has been done at the several periods of reformation and weigh maturely whether it be exactly true that conciliatory concessions are of good policy only in discussions between nations but that among descriptions in the same nation they must always be irrational and dangerous what have you suffered in your peace your prosperity or in what ought ever to be dear to a nation your glory by the last act by which you took the property of that people under the protection of the laws what reasons have you to dread the consequences of admitting the people possessing that property to some share in the protection of the constitution  i do not mean to trouble you with anything to remove the objections i will not call them arguments against this measure taken from a ferocious hatred to all that numerous description of christians it would be to pay a poor compliment to your understanding or your heart neither your religion nor your politics consist in odd perverse antipathies you are not resolved to persevere in proscribing from the constitution so many millions of your countrymen because in contradiction to experience and to common sense you think proper to imagine that their principles are subversive of common human society to that i shall only say that whoever has a temper which can be gratified by indulging himself in these goodnatured fancies ought to do a great deal more for an exclusion from the privileges of british subjects is not a cure for so terrible a distemper of the human mind as they are pleased to suppose in their countrymen i rather conceive a participation in those privileges to be itself a remedy for some mental disorders  as little shall i detain you with matters that can as little obtain admission into a mind like yours such as the fear or pretence of fear that in spite of your own power and the trifling power of great britain you may be conquered by the pope or that this commodious bugbear who is of infinitely more use to those who pretend to fear than to those who love him will absolve his majestys subjects from their allegiance and send over the cardinal of york to rule you as his viceroy or that by the plenitude of his power he will take that fierce tyrant the king of the french out of his jail and arm that nation which on all occasions treats his holiness so very politely with his bulls and pardons to invade poor old ireland to reduce you to popery and slavery and to force the freeborn naked feet of your people into the wooden shoes of that arbitrary monarch i do not believe that discourses of this kind are held or that anything like them will be held by any who walk about without a keeper yet i confess that on occasions of this nature i am the most afraid of the weakest reasonings because they discover the strongest passions these things will never be brought out in definite propositions they would not prevent pity towards any persons they would only cause it for those who were capable of talking in such a strain but i know and am sure that such ideas as no man will distinctly produce to another or hardly venture to bring in any plain shape to his own mind he will utter in obscure illexplained doubts jealousies surmises fears and apprehensions and that in such a fog they will appear to have a good deal of size and will make an impression when if they were clearly brought forth and defined they would meet with nothing but scorn and derision  there is another way of taking an objection to this concession which i admit to be something more plausible and worthy of a more attentive examination it is that this numerous class of people is mutinous disorderly prone to sedition and easy to be wrought upon by the insidious arts of wicked and designing men that conscious of this the sober rational and wealthy part of that body who are totally of another character do by no means desire any participation for themselves or for any one else of their description in the franchises of the british constitution  i have great doubt of the exactness of any part of this observation but let us admit that the body of the catholics are prone to sedition of which as i have said i entertain much doubt is it possible that any fair observer or fair reasoner can think of confining this description to them only i believe it to be possible for men to be mutinous and seditious who feel no grievance but i believe no man will assert seriously that when people are of a turbulent spirit the best way to keep them in order is to furnish them with something substantial to complain of  you separate very properly the sober rational and substantial part of their description from the rest you give as you ought to do weight only to the former what i have always thought of the matter is thisthat the most poor illiterate and uninformed creatures upon earth are judges of a practical oppression it is a matter of feeling and as such persons generally have felt most of it and are not of an overlively sensibility they are the best judges of it but for the real cause or the appropriate remedy they ought never to be called into council about the one or the other they ought to be totally shut out because their reason is weak because when once roused their passions are ungoverned because they want information because the smallness of the property which individually they possess renders them less attentive to the consequence of the measures they adopt in affairs of moment when i find a great cry amongst the people who speculate little i think myself called seriously to examine into it and to separate the real cause from the ill effects of the passion it may excite and the bad use which artful men may make of an irritation of the popular mind here we must be aided by persons of a contrary character we must not listen to the desperate or the furious but it is therefore necessary for us to distinguish who are the really indigent and the really intemperate as to the persons who desire this part in the constitution i have no reason to imagine that they are men who have nothing to lose and much to look for in public confusion the popular meeting from which apprehensions have been entertained has assembled i have accidentally had conversation with two friends of mine who know something of the gentleman who was put into the chair upon that occasion one of them has had money transactions with him the other from curiosity has been to see his concerns they both tell me he is a man of some property but you must be the best judge of this who by your office are likely to know his transactions many of the others are certainly persons of fortune and all or most fathers of families men in respectable ways of life and some of them far from contemptible either for their information or for the abilities which they have shown in the discussion of their interests what such men think it for their advantage to acquire ought not prima facie to be considered as rash or heady or incompatible with the public safety or welfare  i admit that men of the best fortunes and reputations and of the best talents and education too may by accident show themselves furious and intemperate in their desires this is a great misfortune when it happens for the first presumptions are undoubtedly in their favor we have two standards of judging in this case of the sanity and sobriety of any proceedingsof unequal certainty indeed but neither of them to be neglected the first is by the value of the object sought the next is by the means through which it is pursued  the object pursued by the catholics is i understand and have all along reasoned as if it were so in some degree or measure to be again admitted to the franchises of the constitution men are considered as under some derangement of their intellects when they see good and evil in a different light from other menwhen they choose nauseous and unwholesome food and reject such as to the rest of the world seems pleasant and is known to be nutritive i have always considered the british constitution not to be a thing in itself so vicious as that none but men of deranged understanding and turbulent tempers could desire a share in it on the contrary i should think very indifferently of the understanding and temper of any body of men who did not wish to partake of this great and acknowledged benefit i cannot think quite so favorably either of the sense or temper of those if any such there are who would voluntarily persuade their brethren that the object is not fit for them or they for the object whatever may be my thoughts concerning them i am quite sure that they who hold such language must forfeit all credit with the rest this is infallibleif they conceive any opinion of their judgment they cannot possibly think them their friends there is indeed one supposition which would reconcile the conduct of such gentlemen to sound reason and to the purest affection towards their fellowsufferers it is that they act under the impression of a wellgrounded fear for the general interest if they should be told and should believe the story that if they dare attempt to make their condition better they will infallibly make it worsethat if they aim at obtaining liberty they will have their slavery doubledthat their endeavor to put themselves upon anything which approaches towards an equitable footing with their fellowsubjects will be considered as an indication of a seditious and rebellious dispositionsuch a view of things ought perfectly to restore the gentlemen who so anxiously dissuade their countrymen from wishing a participation with the privileged part of the people to the good opinion of their fellows but what is to them a very full justification is not quite so honorable to that power from whose maxims and temper so good a ground of rational terror is furnished i think arguments of this kind will never be used by the friends of a government which i greatly respect or by any of the leaders of an opposition whom i have the honor to know and the sense to admire i remember polybius tells us that during his captivity in italy as a peloponnesian hostage he solicited old cato to intercede with the senate for his release and that of his countrymen this old politician told him that he had better continue in his present condition however irksome than apply again to that formidable authority for their relief that he ought to imitate the wisdom of his countryman ulysses who when he was once out of the den of the cyclops had too much sense to venture again into the same cavern but i conceive too high an opinion of the irish legislature to think that they are to their fellowcitizens what the grand oppressors of mankind were to a people whom the fortune of war had subjected to their power for though cato could use such a parallel with regard to his senate i should really think it nothing short of impious to compare an irish parliament to a den of cyclops i hope the people both here and with you will always apply to the house of commons with becoming modesty but at the same time with minds unembarrassed with any sort of terror  as to the means which the catholics employ to obtain this object so worthy of sober and rational minds i do admit that such means may be used in the pursuit of it as may make it proper for the legislature in this case to defer their compliance until the demandants are brought to a proper sense of their duty a concession in which the governing power of our country loses its dignity is dearly bought even by him who obtains his object all the people have a deep interest in the dignity of parliament but as the refusal of franchises which are drawn out of the first vital stamina of the british constitution is a very serious thing we ought to be very sure that the manner and spirit of the application is offensive and dangerous indeed before we ultimately reject all applications of this nature the mode of application i hear is by petition it is the manner in which all the sovereign powers of the world are approached and i never heard except in the case of james the second that any prince considered this manner of supplication to be contrary to the humility of a subject or to the respect due to the person or authority of the sovereign this rule and a correspondent practice are observed from the grand seignior down to the most petty prince or republic in europe  you have sent me several papers some in print some in manuscript i think i had seen all of them except the formula of association i confess they appear to me to contain matter mischievous and capable of giving alarm if the spirit in which they are written should be found to make any considerable progress but i am at a loss to know how to apply them as objections to the case now before us when i find that the general committee which acts for the roman catholics in dublin prefers the association proposed in the written draught you have sent me to a respectful application in parliament i shall think the persons who sign such a paper to be unworthy of any privilege which may be thought fit to be granted and that such men ought by name to be excepted from any benefit under the constitution to which they offer this violence but i do not find that this form of a seditious league has been signed by any person whatsoever either on the part of the supposed projectors or on the part of those whom it is calculated to seduce i do not find on inquiry that such a thing was mentioned or even remotely alluded to in the general meeting of the catholics from which so much violence was apprehended i have considered the other publications signed by individuals on the part of certain societiesi may mistake for i have not the honor of knowing them personally but i take mr butler and mr tandy not to be catholics but members of the established church not one that i recollect of these publications which you and i equally dislike appears to be written by persons of that persuasion now if whilst a man is dutifully soliciting a favor from parliament any person should choose in an improper manner to show his inclination towards the cause depending and if that must destroy the cause of the petitioner then not only the petitioner but the legislature itself is in the power of any weak friend or artful enemy that the supplicant or that the parliament may have a man must be judged by his own actions only certain protestant dissenters make seditious propositions to the catholics which it does not appear that they have yet accepted it would be strange that the tempter should escape all punishment and that he who under circumstances full of seduction and full of provocation has resisted the temptation should incur the penalty you know that with regard to the dissenters who are stated to be the chief movers in this vile scheme of altering the principles of election to a right of voting by the head you are not able if you ought even to wish such a thing to deprive them of any part of the franchises and privileges which they hold on a footing of perfect equality with yourselves they may do what they please with constitutional impunity but the others cannot even listen with civility to an invitation from them to an illjudged scheme of liberty without forfeiting forever all hopes of any of those liberties which we admit to be sober and rational  it is known i believe that the greater as well as the sounder part of our excluded countrymen have not adopted the wild ideas and wilder engagements which have been held out to them but have rather chosen to hope small and safe concessions from the legal power than boundless objects from trouble and confusion this mode of action seems to me to mark men of sobriety and to distinguish them from those who are intemperate from circumstance or from nature but why do they not instantly disclaim and disavow those who make such advances to them in this too in my opinion they show themselves no less sober and circumspect in the present moment nothing short of insanity could induce them to take such a step pray consider the circumstances disclaim says somebody all union with the dissentersrightbut when this your injunction is obeyed shall i obtain the object which i solicit from youoh no nothing at all like itbut in punishing us by an exclusion from the constitution through the great gate for having been invited to enter into it by a postern will you punish by deprivation of their privileges or mulet in any other way those who have tempted usfar from itwe mean to preserve all their liberties and immunities as our lifeblood we mean to cultivate them as brethren whom we love and respectwith you we have no fellowship we can bear with patience their enmity to ourselves but their friendship with you we will not endure but mark it well all our quarrels with them are always to be revenged upon you formerly it is notorious that we should have resented with the highest indignation your presuming to show any illwill to them you must not suffer them now to show any goodwill to you knowand take it once for allthat it is and ever has been and ever will be a fundamental maxim in our politics that you are not to have any part or shadow or name of interest whatever in our state that we look upon you as under an irreversible outlawry from our constitutionas perpetual and unalliable aliens  such my dear sir is the plain nature of the argument drawn from the revolution maxims enforced by a supposed disposition in the catholics to unite with the dissenters such it is though it were clothed in never such bland and civil forms and wrapped up as a poet says in a thousand artful folds of sacred lawn for my own part i do not know in what manner to shape such arguments so as to obtain admission for them into a rational understanding everything of this kind is to be reduced at last to threats of power i cannot say væ victis and then throw the sword into the scale i have no sword and if i had in this case most certainly i would not use it as a makeweight in political reasoning  observe on these principles the difference between the procedure of the parliament and the dissenters towards the people in question one employs courtship the other force the dissenters offer bribes the parliament nothing but the front négatif of a stern and forbidding authority a man may be very wrong in his ideas of what is good for him but no man affronts me nor can therefore justify my affronting him by offering to make me as happy as himself according to his own ideas of happiness this the dissenters do to the catholics you are on the different extremes the dissenters offer with regard to constitutional rights and civil advantages of all sorts everything you refuse everything with them there is boundless though not very assured hope with you a very sure and very unqualified despair the terms of alliance from the dissenters offer a representation of the commons chosen out of the people by the head this is absurdly and dangerously large in my opinion and that scheme of election is known to have been at all times perfectly odious to me but i cannot think it right of course to punish the irish roman catholics by an universal exclusion because others whom you would not punish at all propose an universal admission i cannot dissemble to myself that in this very kingdom many persons who are not in the situation of the irish catholics but who on the contrary enjoy the full benefit of the constitution as it stands and some of whom from the effect of their fortunes enjoy it in a large measure had some years ago associated to procure great and undefined changes they considered them as reforms in the popular part of the constitution our friend the late mr flood no slight man proposed in his place and in my hearing a representation not much less extensive than this for englandin which every house was to be inhabited by a voter in addition to all the actual votes by other titles some of the corporate which we know do not require a house or a shed can i forget that a person of the very highest rank of very large fortune and of the first class of ability brought a bill into the house of lords in the headquarters of aristocracy containing identically the same project for the supposed adoption of which by a club or two it is thought right to extinguish all hopes in the roman catholics of ireland i cannot say it was very eagerly embraced or very warmly pursued but the lords neither did disavow the bill nor treat it with any disregard nor express any sort of disapprobation of its noble author who has never lost with king or people the least degree of the respect and consideration which so justly belongs to him  i am not at all enamored as i have told you with this plan of representation as little do i relish any bandings or associations for procuring it but if the question was to be put to you and meuniversal popular representation or none at all for us and ourswe should find ourselves in a very awkward position i do not like this kind of dilemmas especially when they are practical  then since our oldest fundamental laws follow or rather couple freehold with franchisesince no principle of the revolution shakes these libertiessince the oldest and one of the best monuments of the constitution demands for the irish the privilege which they supplicatesince the principles of the revolution coincide with the declarations of the great chartersince the practice of the revolution in this point did not contradict its principlessince from that event twentyfive years had elapsed before a domineering party on a party principle had ventured to disfranchise without any proof whatsoever of abuse the greater part of the communitysince the kings coronation oath does not stand in his way to the performance of his duty to all his subjectssince you have given to all other dissenters these privileges without limit which are hitherto withheld without any limitation whatsoever from the catholicssince no nation in the world has ever been known to exclude so great a body of men not born slaves from the civil state and all the benefits of its constitutionthe whole question comes before parliament as a matter for its prudence i do not put the thing on a question of right that discretion which in judicature is well said by lord coke to be a crooked cord in legislature is a golden rule supplicants ought not to appear too much in the character of litigants if the subject thinks so highly and reverently of the sovereign authority as not to claim anything of right so that it may seem to be independent of the power and free choice of its governmentand if the sovereign on his part considers the advantages of the subjects as their right and all their reasonable wishes as so many claimsin the fortunate conjunction of these mutual dispositions are laid the foundations of a happy and prosperous commonwealth for my own part desiring of all things that the authority of the legislature under which i was born and which i cherish not only with a dutiful awe but with a partial and cordial affection to be maintained in the utmost possible respect i never will suffer myself to suppose that at bottom their discretion will be found to be at variance with their justice  the whole being at discretion i beg leave just to suggest some matters for your considerationwhether the government in church or state is likely to be more secure by continuing causes of grounded discontent to a very great number say two millions of the subjects or whether the constitution combined and balanced as it is will be rendered more solid by depriving so large a part of the people of all concern or interest or share in its representation actual or virtual i here mean to lay an emphasis on the word virtual virtual representation is that in which there is a communion of interests and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act though the trustees are not actually chosen by them this is virtual representation such a representation i think to be in many cases even better than the actual it possesses most of its advantages and is free from many of its inconveniences it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first line of direction the people may err in their choice but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken but this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence if it has not a substratum in the actual the member must have some relation to the constituent as things stand the catholic as a catholic and belonging to a description has no virtual relation to the representativebut the contrary there is a relation in mutual obligation gratitude may not always have a very lasting power but the frequent recurrence of an application for favors will revive and refresh it and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention it will produce at least acquaintance the several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as they now are as if they were not only separate nations but separate species the stigma and reproach the hideous mask will be taken off and men will see each other as they are sure i am that there have been thousands in ireland who have never conversed with a roman catholic in their whole lives unless they happened to talk to their gardeners workmen or to ask their way when they had lost it in their sportsor at best who had known them only as footmen or other domestics of the second and third order and so averse were they some time ago to have them near their persons that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable i well remember a great and in many respects a good man who advertised for a blacksmith but at the same time added he must be a protestant it is impossible that such a state of things though natural goodness in many persons will undoubtedly make exceptions must not produce alienation on the one side and pride and insolence on the other  reduced to a question of discretion and that discretion exercised solely upon what will appear best for the conservation of the state on its present basis i should recommend it to your serious thoughts whether the narrowing of the foundation is always the best way to secure the building the body of disfranchised men will not be perfectly satisfied to remain always in that state if they are not satisfied you have two millions of subjects in your bosom full of uneasiness not that they cannot overturn the act of settlement and put themselves and you under an arbitrary master or that they are not permitted to spawn a hydra of wild republics on principles of a pretended natural equality in man but because you will not suffer them to enjoy the ancient fundamental tried advantages of a british constitutionthat you will not permit them to profit of the protection of a common father or the freedom of common citizens and that the only reason which can be assigned for this disfranchisement has a tendency more deeply to ulcerate their minds than the act of exclusion itself what the consequence of such feelings must be it is for you to look to to warn is not to menace  i am far from asserting that men will not excite disturbances without just cause i know that such an assertion is not true but neither is it true that disturbances have never just complaints for their origin i am sure that it is hardly prudent to furnish them with such causes of complaint as every man who thinks the british constitution a benefit may think at least colorable and plausible  several are in dread of the manœuvres of certain persons among the dissenters who turn this ill humor to their own ill purposes you know better than i can how much these proceedings of certain among the dissenters are to be feared you are to weigh with the temper which is natural to you whether it may be for the safety of our establishment that the catholics should be ultimately persuaded that they have no hope to enter into the constitution but through the dissenters  think whether this be the way to prevent or dissolve factious combinations against the church or the state reflect seriously on the possible consequences of keeping in the heart of your country a bank of discontent every hour accumulating upon which every description of seditious men may draw at pleasure they whose principles of faction will dispose them to the establishment of an arbitrary monarchy will find a nation of men who have no sort of interest in freedom but who will have an interest in that equality of justice or favor with which a wise despot must view all his subjects who do not attack the foundations of his power love of liberty itself may in such men become the means of establishing an arbitrary domination on the other hand they who wish for a democratic republic will find a set of men who have no choice between civil servitude and the entire ruin of a mixed constitution  suppose the people of ireland divided into three parts of these i speak within compass two are catholic of the remaining third one half is composed of dissenters there is no natural union between those descriptions it may be produced if the two parts catholic be driven into a close confederacy with half the third part of protestants with a view to a change in the constitution in church or state or both and you rest the whole of their security on a handful of gentlemen clergy and their dependentscompute the strength you have in ireland to oppose to grounded discontent to capricious innovation to blind popular fury and to ambitious turbulent intrigue  you mention that the minds of some gentlemen are a good deal heated and that it is often said that rather than submit to such persons having a share in their franchises they would throw up their independence and precipitate an union with great britain i have heard a discussion concerning such an union amongst all sorts of men ever since i remember anything for my own part i have never been able to bring my mind to anything clear and decisive upon the subject there cannot be a more arduous question as far as i can form an opinion it would not be for the mutual advantage of the two kingdoms persons however more able than i am think otherwise but whatever the merits of this union may be to make it a menace it must be shown to be an evil and an evil more particularly to those who are threatened with it than to those who hold it out as a terror i really do not see how this threat of an union can operate or that the catholics are more likely to be losers by that measure than the churchmen  the humors of the people and of politicians too are so variable in themselves and are so much under the occasional influence of some leading men that it is impossible to know what turn the public mind here would take on such an event there is but one thing certain concerning it great divisions and vehement passions would precede this union both on the measure itself and on its terms and particularly this very question of a share in the representation for the catholics from whence the project of an union originated would form a principal part in the discussion and in the temper in which some gentlemen seem inclined to throw themselves by a sort of high indignant passion into the scheme those points would not be deliberated with all possible calmness  from my best observation i should greatly doubt whether in the end these gentlemen would obtain their object so as to make the exclusion of two millions of their countrymen a fundamental article in the union the demand would be of a nature quite unprecedented you might obtain the union and yet a gentleman who under the new union establishment would aspire to the honor of representing his county might possibly be as much obliged as he may fear to be under the old separate establishment to the unsupportable mortification of asking his neighbors who have a different opinion concerning the elements in the sacrament for their votes  i believe nay i am sure that the people of great britain with or without an union might be depended upon in oases of any real danger to aid the government of ireland with the same cordiality as they would support their own against any wicked attempts to shake the security of the happy constitution in church and state but before great britain engages in any quarrel the cause of the dispute would certainly be a part of her consideration if confusions should arise in that kingdom from too steady an attachment to a proscriptive monopolizing system and from the resolution of regarding the franchise and in it the security of the subject as belonging rather to religious opinions than to civil qualification and civil conduct i doubt whether you might quite certainly reckon on obtaining an aid of force from hence for the support of that system we might extend your distractions to this country by taking part in them england will be indisposed i suspect to send an army for the conquest of ireland what was done in 1782 is a decisive proof of her sentiments of justice and moderation she will not be fond of making another american war in ireland the principles of such a war would but too much resemble the former one the welldisposed and the illdisposed in england would for different reasons perhaps be equally averse to such an enterprise the confiscations the public auctions the private grants the plantations the transplantations which formerly animated so many adventurers even among sober citizens to such irish expeditions and which possibly might have animated some of them to the american can have no existence in the case that we suppose  let us form a supposition no foolish or ungrounded supposition that in an age when men are infinitely more disposed to heat themselves with political than religious controversies the former should entirely prevail as we see that in some places they have prevailed over the latterand that the catholics of ireland from the courtship paid them on the one hand and the high tone of refusal on the other should in order to enter into all the rights of subjects all become protestant dissenters and as the others do take all your oaths they would all obtain their civil objects and the change for anything i know to the contrary in the dark as i am about the protestant dissenting tenets might be of use to the health of their souls but what security our constitution in church or state could derive from that event i cannot possibly discern depend upon it it is as true as nature is true that if you force them out of the religion of habit education or opinion it is not to yours they will ever go shaken in their minds they will go to that where the dogmas are fewestwhere they are the most uncertainwhere they lead them the least to a consideration of what they have abandoned they will go to that uniformly democratic system to whose first movements they owed their emancipation i recommend you seriously to turn this in your mind believe that it requires your best and maturest thoughts take what course you pleaseunion or no union whether the people remain catholics or become protestant dissenters sure it is that the present state of monopoly cannot continue  if england were animated as i think she is not with her former spirit of domination and with the strong theological hatred which she once cherished for that description of her fellowchristians and fellowsubjects i am yet convinced that after the fullest success in a ruinous struggle you would be obliged to abandon that monopoly we were obliged to do this even when everything promised success in the american business if you should make this experiment at last under the pressure of any necessity you never can do it well but if instead of falling into a passion the leading gentlemen of the country themselves should undertake the business cheerfully and with hearty affection towards it great advantages would follow what is forced cannot be modified but here you may measure your concessions  it is a consideration of great moment that you make the desired admission without altering the system of your representation in the smallest degree or in any part you may leave that deliberation of a parliamentary change or reform if ever you should think fit to engage in it uncomplicated and unembarrassed with the other question whereas if they are mixed and confounded as some people attempt to mix and confound them no one can answer for the effects on the constitution itself  there is another advantage in taking up this business singly and by an arrangement for the single object it is that you may proceed by degrees we must all obey the great law of change it is the most powerful law of nature and the means perhaps of its conservation all we can do and that human wisdom can do is to provide that the change shall proceed by insensible degrees this has all the benefits which may be in change without any of the inconveniences of mutation everything is provided for as it arrives this mode will on the one hand prevent the unfixing old interests at once a thing which is apt to breed a black and sullen discontent in those who are at once dispossessed of all their influence and consideration this gradual course on the other side will prevent men long under depression from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power which they always abuse with a licentious insolence but wishing as i do the change to be gradual and cautious i would in my first steps lean rather to the side of enlargement than restriction  it is one excellence of our constitution that all our rights of provincial election regard rather property than person it is another that the rights which approach more nearly to the personal are most of them corporate and suppose a restrained and strict education of seven years in some useful occupation in both cases the practice may have slid from the principle the standard of qualification in both cases may be so low or not so judiciously chosen as in some degree to frustrate the end but all this is for your prudence in the case before you you may rise a step or two the qualification of the catholic voters but if you were tomorrow to put the catholic freeholder on the footing of the most favored fortyshilling protestant dissenter you know that such is the actual state of ireland this would not make a sensible alteration in almost any one election in the kingdom the effect in their favor even defensively would be infinitely slow but it would be healing it would be satisfactory and protecting the stigma would be removed by admitting settled permanent substance in lieu of the numbers you would avoid the great danger of our time that of setting up number against property the numbers ought never to be neglected because besides what is due to them as men collectively though not individually they have great property they ought to have therefore protection they ought to have security they ought to have even consideration but they ought not to predominate  my dear sir i have nearly done i meant to write you a long letter i have written a long dissertation i might have done it earlier and better i might have been more forcible and more clear if i had not been interrupted as i have been and this obliges me not to write to you in my own hand though my hand but signs it my heart goes with what i have written since i could think at all those have been my thoughts you know that thirtytwo years ago they were as fully matured in my mind as they are now a letter of mine to lord kenmare though not by my desire and full of lesser mistakes has been printed in dublin it was written ten or twelve years ago at the time when i began the employment which i have not yet finished in favor of another distressed people injured by those who have vanquished them or stolen a dominion over them it contained my sentiments then you will see how far they accord with my sentiments now time has more and more confirmed me in them all the present circumstances fix them deeper in my mind  i voted last session if a particular vote could be distinguished in unanimity for an establishment of the church of england conjointly with the establishment which was made some years before by act of parliament of the roman catholic in the french conquered country of canada at the time of making this english ecclesiastical establishment we did not think it necessary for its safety to destroy the former gallican church settlement in our first act we settled a government altogether monarchical or nearly so in that system the canadian catholics were far from being deprived of the advantages or distinctions of any kind which they enjoyed under their former monarchy it is true that some people and amongst them one eminent divine predicted at that time that by this step we should lose our dominions in america he foretold that the pope would send his indulgences hither that the canadians would fall in with france would declare independence and draw or force our colonies into the same design the independence happened according to his prediction but in directly the reverse order all our english protestant colonies revolted they joined themselves to france and it so happened that popish canada was the only place which preserved its fidelity the only place in which france got no footing the only peopled colony which now remains to great britain vain are all the prognostics taken from ideas and passions which survive the state of things which gave rise to them when last year we gave a popular representation to the same canada by the choice of the landholders and an aristocratic representation at the choice of the crown neither was the choice of the crown nor the election of the landholders limited by a consideration of religion we had no dread for the protestant church which we settled there because we permitted the french catholics in the utmost latitude of the description to be free subjects they are good subjects i have no doubt but i will not allow that any french canadian catholics are better men or better citizens than the irish of the same communion passing from the extremity of the west to the extremity almost of the east i have been many years now entering into the twelfth employed in supporting the rights privileges laws and immunities of a very remote people i have not as yet been able to finish my task i have struggled through much discouragement and much opposition much obloquy much calumny for a people with whom i have no tie but the common bond of mankind in this i have not been left alone we did not fly from our undertaking because the people are mahometans or pagans and that a great majority of the christians amongst them are papists some gentlemen in ireland i dare say have good reasons for what they may do which do not occur to me i do not presume to condemn them but thinking and acting as i have done towards those remote nations i should not know how to show my face here or in ireland if i should say that all the pagans all the mussulmen and even all the papists since they must form the highest stage in the climax of evil are worthy of a liberal and honorable condition except those of one of the descriptions which forms the majority of the inhabitants of the country in which you and i were born if such are the catholics of ireland illnatured and unjust people from our own data may be inclined not to think better of the protestants of a soil which is supposed to infuse into its sects a kind of venom unknown in other places  you hated the old system as early as i did your first juvenile lance was broken against that giant i think you were even the first who attacked the grim phantom you have an exceedingly good understanding very good humor and the best heart in the world the dictates of that temper and that heart as well as the policy pointed out by that understanding led you to abhor the old code you abhorred it as i did for its vicious perfection for i must do it justice it was a complete system full of coherence and consistency well digested and well composed in all its parts it was a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance and as well fitted for the oppression impoverishment and degradation of a people and the debasement in them of human nature itself as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man it is a thing humiliating enough that we are doubtful of the effect of the medicines we compoundwe are sure of our poisons my opinion ever was in which i heartily agree with those that admired the old code that it was so constructed that if there was once a breach in any essential part of it the ruin of the whole or nearly of the whole was at some time or other a certainty for that reason i honor and shall forever honor and love you and those who first caused it to stagger crack and gape others may finish the beginners have the glory and take what part you please at this hour i think you will take the best your first services will never be forgotten by a grateful country adieu present my best regards to those i knowand as many as i know in our country i honor there never was so much ability nor i believe virtue in it they have a task worthy of both i doubt not they will perform it for the stability of the church and state and for the union and the separation of the people for the union of the honest and peaceable of all sects for their separation from all that is illintentioned and seditious in any of them  beaconsfield january 3 1792  footnotes  28 the letter is written on folio sheets  29 a small error of fact as to the abjuration oath but of no importance in the argument     hints for a memorial  to be delivered to  monsieur de mm  written in the early part of 1791   the king my master from his sincere desire of keeping up a good correspondence with his most christian majesty and the french nation has for some time beheld with concern the condition into which that sovereign and nation have fallen  notwithstanding the reality and the warmth of those sentiments his britannic majesty has hitherto forborne in any manner to take part in their affairs in hopes that the common interest of king and subjects would render all parties sensible of the necessity of settling their government and their freedom upon principles of moderation as the only means of securing permanence to both those blessings as well as internal and external tranquillity to the kingdom of france and to all europe  his britannic majesty finds to his great regret that his hopes have not been realized he finds that confusions and disorders have rather increased than diminished and that they now threaten to proceed to dangerous extremities  in this situation of things the same regard to a neighboring sovereign living in friendship with great britain the same spirit of goodwill to the kingdom of france the same regard to the general tranquillity which have caused him to view with concern the growth and continuance of the present disorders have induced the king of great britain to interpose his good offices towards a reconcilement of those unhappy differences this his majesty does with the most cordial regard to the good of all descriptions concerned and with the most perfect sincerity wholly removing from his royal mind all memory of every circumstance which might impede him in the execution of a plan of benevolence which he has so much at heart  his majesty having always thought it his greatest glory that he rules over a people perfectly and solidly because soberly rationally and legally free can never be supposed to proceed in offering thus his royal mediation but with an unaffected desire and full resolution to consider the settlement of a free constitution in france as the very basis of any agreement between the sovereign and those of his subjects who are unhappily at variance with himto guaranty it to them if it should be desired in the most solemn and authentic manner and to do all that in him lies to procure the like guaranty from other powers  his britannic majesty in the same manner assures the most christian king that he knows too well and values too highly what is due to the dignity and rights of crowned heads and to the implied faith of treaties which have always been made with the crown of france ever to listen to any proposition by which that monarchy shall be despoiled of all its rights so essential for the support of the consideration of the prince and the concord and welfare of the people  if unfortunately a due attention should not be paid to these his majestys benevolent and neighborly offers or if any circumstances should prevent the most christian king from acceding as his majesty has no doubt he is well disposed to do to this healing mediation in favor of himself and all his subjects his majesty has commanded me to take leave of this court as not conceiving it to be suitable to the dignity of his crown and to what he owes to his faithful people any longer to keep a public minister at the court of a sovereign who is not in possession of his own liberty     thoughts  on  french affairs  etc etc  written in december 1791     thoughts on french affairs   in all our transactions with france and at all periods we have treated with that state on the footing of a monarchy monarchy was considered in all the external relations of that kingdom with every power in europe as its legal and constitutional government and that in which alone its federal capacity was vested  sidenote montmorins letter  it is not yet a year since monsieur de montmorin formally and with as little respect as can be imagined to the king and to all crowned heads announced a total revolution in that country he has informed the british ministry that its frame of government is wholly alteredthat he is one of the ministers of the new systemand in effect that the king is no longer his master nor does he even call him such but the first of the ministers in the new system  sidenote acceptance of the constitution ratified  the second notification was that of the kings acceptance of the new constitution accompanied with fanfaronades in the modern style of the french bureaus things which have much more the air and character of the saucy declamations of their clubs than the tone of regular office  it has not been very usual to notify to foreign courts anything concerning the internal arrangements of any state in the present case the circumstance of these two notifications with the observations with which they are attended does not leave it in the choice of the sovereigns of christendom to appear ignorant either of this french revolution or what is more important of its principles  we know that very soon after this manifesto of monsieur de montmorin the king of france in whose name it was made found himself obliged to fly with his whole familyleaving behind him a declaration in which he disavows and annuls that constitution as having been the effect of force on his person and usurpation on his authority it is equally notorious that this unfortunate prince was with many circumstances of insult and outrage brought back prisoner by a deputation of the pretended national assembly and afterwards suspended by their authority from his government under equally notorious constraint and under menaces of total deposition he has been compelled to accept what they call a constitution and to agree to whatever else the usurped power which holds him in confinement thinks proper to impose  his nest brother who had fled with him and his third brother who had fled before him all the princes of his blood who remained faithful to him and the flower of his magistracy his clergy and his nobility continue in foreign countries protesting against all acts done by him in his present situation on the grounds upon which he had himself protested against them at the time of his flightwith this addition that they deny his very competence as on good grounds they may to abrogate the royalty or the ancient constitutional orders of the kingdom in this protest they are joined by three hundred of the late assembly itself and in effect by a great part of the french nation the new government so far as the people dare to disclose their sentiments is disdained i am persuaded by the greater numberwho as m de la fayette complains and as the truth is have declined to take any share in the new elections to the national assembly either as candidates or electors  in this state of things that is in the case of a divided kingdom by the law of nations30 great britain like every other power is free to take any part she pleases she may decline with more or less formality according to her discretion to acknowledge this new system or she may recognize it as a government de facto setting aside all discussion of its original legality and considering the ancient monarchy as at an end the law of nations leaves our court open to its choice we have no direction but what is found in the wellunderstood policy of the king and kingdom  this declaration of a new species of government on new principles such it professes itself to be is a real crisis in the politics of europe the conduct which prudence ought to dictate to great britain will not depend as hitherto our connection or quarrel with other states has for some time depended upon merely external relations but in a great measure also upon the system which we may think it right to adopt for the internal government of our own country  if it be our policy to assimilate our government to that of france we ought to prepare for this change by encouraging the schemes of authority established there we ought to wink at the captivity and deposition of a prince with whom if not in close alliance we were in friendship we ought to fall in with the ideas of monsieur montmorins circular manifesto and to do business of course with the functionaries who act under the new power by which that king to whom his majestys minister has been sent to reside has been deposed and imprisoned on that idea we ought also to withhold all sorts of direct or indirect countenance from those who are treating in germany for the reëstablishment of the french monarchy and the ancient orders of that state this conduct is suitable to this policy  the question is whether this policy be suitable to the interests of the crown and subjects of great britain let us therefore a little consider the true nature and probable effects of the revolution which in such a very unusual manner has been twice diplomatically announced to his majesty  sidenote difference between this revolution and others  there have been many internal revolutions in the government of countries both as to persons and forms in which the neighboring states have had little or no concern whatever the government might be with respect to those persons and those forms the stationary interests of the nation concerned have most commonly influenced the new governments in the same manner in which they influenced the old and the revolution turning on matter of local grievance or of local accommodation did not extend beyond its territory  sidenote nature of the french revolution  the present revolution in france seems to me to be quite of another character and description and to bear little resemblance or analogy to any of those which have been brought about in europe upon principles merely political it is a revolution of doctrine and theoretic dogma it has a much greater resemblance to those changes which have been made upon religious grounds in which a spirit of proselytism makes an essential part  the last revolution of doctrine and theory which has happened in europe is the reformation it is not for my purpose to take any notice here of the merits of that revolution but to state one only of its effects  sidenote its effects  that effect was to introduce other interests into all countries than those which arose from their locality and natural circumstances the principle of the reformation was such as by its essence could not be local or confined to the country in which it had its origin for instance the doctrine of justification by faith or by works which was the original basis of the reformation could not have one of its alternatives true as to germany and false as to every other country neither are questions of theoretic truth and falsehood governed by circumstances any more than by places on that occasion therefore the spirit of proselytism expanded itself with great elasticity upon all sides and great divisions were everywhere the result  these divisions however in appearance merely dogmatic soon became mixed with the political and their effects were rendered much more intense from this combination europe was for a long time divided into two great factions under the name of catholic and protestant which not only often alienated state from state but also divided almost every state within itself the warm parties in each state were more affectionately attached to those of their own doctrinal interest in some other country than to their fellowcitizens or to their natural government when they or either of them happened to be of a different persuasion these factions wherever they prevailed if they did not absolutely destroy at least weakened and distracted the locality of patriotism the public affections came to have other motives and other ties  it would be to repeat the history of the two last centuries to exemplify the effects of this revolution  although the principles to which it gave rise did not operate with a perfect regularity and constancy they never wholly ceased to operate few wars were made and few treaties were entered into in which they did not come in for some part they gave a color a character and direction to all the politics of europe  sidenote new system of politics  these principles of internal as well as external division and coalition are but just now extinguished but they who will examine into the true character and genius of some late events must be satisfied that other sources of faction combining parties among the inhabitants of different countries into one connection are opened and that from these sources are likely to arise effects full as important as those which had formerly arisen from the jarring interests of the religious sects the intention of the several actors in the change in france is not a matter of doubt it is very openly professed  in the modern world before this time there has been no instance of this spirit of general political faction separated from religion pervading several countries and forming a principle of union between the partisans in each but the thing is not less in human nature the ancient world has furnished a strong and striking instance of such a ground for faction full as powerful and full as mischievous as our spirit of religions system had ever been exciting in all the states of greece european and asiatic the most violent animosities and the most cruel and bloody persecutions and proscriptions these ancient factions in each commonwealth of greece connected themselves with those of the same description in some other states and secret cabals and public alliances were carried on and made not upon a conformity of general political interests but for the support and aggrandizement of the two leading states which headed the aristocratic and democratic factions for as in later times the king of spain was at the head of a catholic and the king of sweden of a protestant interest france though catholic acting subordinately to the latter in the like manner the lacedemonians were everywhere at the head of the aristocratic interests and the athenians of the democratic the two leading powers kept alive a constant cabal and conspiracy in every state and the political dogmas concerning the constitution of a republic were the great instruments by which these leading states chose to aggrandize themselves their choice was not unwise because the interest in opinions merely as opinions and without any experimental reference to their effects when once they take strong hold of the mind become the most operative of all interests and indeed very often supersede every other  i might further exemplify the possibility of a political sentiment running through various states and combining factions in them from the history of the middle ages in the guelfs and ghibellines these were political factions originally in favor of the emperor and the pope with no mixture of religious dogmas or if anything religiously doctrinal they had in them originally it very soon disappeared as their first political objects disappeared also though the spirit remained they became no more than names to distinguish factions but they were not the less powerful in their operation when they had no direct point of doctrine either religious or civil to assert for a long time however those factions gave no small degree of influence to the foreign chiefs in every commonwealth in which they existed i do not mean to pursue further the track of these parties i allude to this part of history only as it furnishes an instance of that species of faction which broke the locality of public affections and united descriptions of citizens more with strangers than with their countrymen of different opinions  sidenote french fundamental principle  the political dogma which upon the new french system is to unite the factions of different nations is this that the majority told by the head of the taxable people in every country is the perpetual natural unceasing indefeasible sovereign that this majority is perfectly master of the form as well as the administration of the state and that the magistrates under whatever names they are called are only functionaries to obey the orders general as laws or particular as decrees which that majority may make that this is the only natural government that all others are tyranny and usurpation  sidenote practical project  in order to reduce this dogma into practice the republicans in france and their associates in other countries make it always their business and often their public profession to destroy all traces of ancient establishments and to form a new commonwealth in each country upon the basis of the french rights of man on the principle of these rights they mean to institute in every country and as it were the germ of the whole parochial governments for the purpose of what they call equal representation from them is to grow by some media a general council and representative of all the parochial governments in that representative is to be vested the whole national powertotally abolishing hereditary name and office levelling all conditions of men except where money must make a difference breaking all connection between territory and dignity and abolishing every species of nobility gentry and church establishments all their priests and all their magistrates being only creatures of election and pensioners at will  knowing how opposite a permanent landed interest is to that scheme they have resolved and it is the great drift of all their regulations to reduce that description of men to a mere peasantry for the sustenance of the towns and to place the true effective government in cities among the tradesmen bankers and voluntary clubs of bold presuming young personsadvocates attorneys notaries managers of newspapers and those cabals of literary men called academies their republic is to have a first functionary as they call him under the name of king or not as they think fit this officer when such an officer is permitted is however neither in fact nor name to be considered as sovereign nor the people as his subjects the very use of these appellations is offensive to their ears  sidenote partisans of the french system  this system as it has first been realized dogmatically as well as practically in france makes france the natural head of all factions formed on a similar principle wherever they may prevail as much as athens was the head and settled ally of all democratic factions wherever they existed the other system has no head  this system has very many partisans in every country in europe but particularly in england where they are already formed into a body comprehending most of the dissenters of the three leading denominations to these are readily aggregated all who are dissenters in character temper and disposition though not belonging to any of their congregations that is all the restless people who resemble them of all ranks and all partieswhigs and even tories the whole race of halfbred speculators all the atheists deists and socinians all those who hate the clergy and envy the nobility a good many among the moneyed people the east indians almost to a man who cannot bear to find that their present importance does not bear a proportion to their wealth these latter have united themselves into one great and in my opinion formidable club31 which though now quiet may be brought into action with considerable unanimity and force  formerly few except the ambitious great or the desperate and indigent were to be feared as instruments in revolutions what has happened in france teaches us with many other things that there are more causes than have commonly been taken into our consideration by which government may be subverted the moneyed men merchants principal tradesmen and men of letters hitherto generally thought the peaceable and even timid part of society are the chief actors in the french revolution but the fact is that as money increases and circulates and as the circulation of news in politics and letters becomes more and more diffused the persons who diffuse this money and this intelligence become more and more important this was not long undiscovered views of ambition were in france for the first time presented to these classes of men objects in the state in the army in the system of civil offices of every kind their eyes were dazzled with this new prospect they were as it were electrified and made to lose the natural spirit of their situation a bribe great without example in the history of the world was held out to themthe whole government of a very large kingdom  sidenote grounds of security supposed for england  sidenote literary interest  sidenote moneyed interest  there are several who are persuaded that the same thing cannot happen in england because here they say the occupations of merchants tradesmen and manufacturers are not held as degrading situations i once thought that the low estimation in which commerce was held in france might be reckoned among the causes of the late revolution and i am still of opinion that the exclusive spirit of the french nobility did irritate the wealthy of other classes but i found long since that persons in trade and business were by no means despised in france in the manner i had been taught to believe as to men of letters they were so far from being despised or neglected that there was no country perhaps in the universe in which they were so highly esteemed courted caressed and even feared tradesmen naturally were not so much sought in society as not furnishing so largely to the fund of conversation as they do to the revenues of the state but the latter description got forward every day m bailly who made himself the popular mayor on the rebellion of the bastile and is a principal actor in the revolt before the change possessed a pension or office under the crown of six hundred pound english a yearfor that country no contemptible provision and this he obtained solely as a man of letters and on no other title as to the moneyed men whilst the monarchy continued there is no doubt that merely as such they did not enjoy the privileges of nobility but nobility was of so easy an acquisition that it was the fault or neglect of all of that description who did not obtain its privileges for their lives at least in virtue of office it attached under the royal government to an innumerable multitude of places real and nominal that were vendible and such nobility were as capable of everything as their degree of influence or interest could make themthat is as nobility of no considerable rank or consequence m necker so far from being a french gentleman was not so much as a frenchman born and yet we all know the rank in which he stood on the day of the meeting of the states  sidenote mercantile interest  as to the mere matter of estimation of the mercantile or any other class this is regulated by opinion and prejudice in england a security against the envy of men in these classes is not so very complete as we may imagine we must not impose upon ourselves what institutions and manners together had done in france manners alone do here it is the natural operation of things where there exists a crown a court splendid orders of knighthood and an hereditary nobilitywhere there exists a fixed permanent landed gentry continued in greatness and opulence by the law of primogeniture and by a protection given to family settlementswhere there exists a standing army and navywhere there exists a church establishment which bestows on learning and parts an interest combined with that of religion and the statein a country where such things exist wealth new in its acquisition and precarious in its duration can never rank first or even near the first though wealth has its natural weight further than as it is balanced and even preponderated amongst us as amongst other nations by artificial institutions and opinions growing out of them at no period in the history of england have so few peers been taken out of trade or from families newly created by commerce in no period has so small a number of noble families entered into the countinghouse i can call to mind but one in all england and his is of near fifty years standing be that as it may it appears plain to me from my best observation that envy and ambition may by art management and disposition be as much excited amongst these descriptions of men in england as in any other country and that they are just as capable of acting a part in any great change  sidenote progress of the french spiritits course  what direction the french spirit of proselytism is likely to take and in what order it is likely to prevail in the several parts of europe it is not easy to determine the seeds are sown almost everywhere chiefly by newspaper circulations infinitely more efficacious and extensive than ever they were and they are a more important instrument than generally is imagined they are a part of the reading of all they are the whole of the reading of the far greater number there are thirty of them in paris alone the language diffuses them more widely than the englishthough the english too are much read the writers of these papers indeed for the greater part are either unknown or in contempt but they are like a battery in which the stroke of any one ball produces no great effect but the amount of continual repetition is decisive let us only suffer any person to tell us his story morning and evening but for one twelvemonth and he will become our master  all those countries in which several states are comprehended under some general geographical description and loosely united by some federal constitutioncountries of which the members are small and greatly diversified in their forms of government and in the titles by which they are heldthese countries as it might be well expected are the principal objects of their hopes and machinations of these the chief are germany and switzerland after them italy has its place as in circumstances somewhat similar  sidenote germany  as to germany in which from their relation to the emperor i comprehend the belgic provinces it appears to me to be from several circumstances internal and external in a very critical situation and the laws and liberties of the empire are by no means secure from the contagion of the french doctrines and the effect of french intrigues or from the use which two of the greater german powers may make of a general derangement to the general detriment i do not say that the french do not mean to bestow on these german states liberties and laws too after their mode but those are not what have hitherto been understood as the laws and liberties of the empire these exist and have always existed under the principles of feodal tenure and succession under imperial constitutions grants and concessions of sovereigns family compacts and public treaties made under the sanction and some of them guarantied by the sovereign powers of other nations and particularly the old government of france the author and natural support of the treaty of westphalia  sidenote ecclesiastical state  in short the germanic body is a vast mass of heterogeneous states held together by that heterogeneous body of old principles which formed the public law positive and doctrinal the modern laws and liberties which the new power in france proposes to introduce into germany and to support with all its force of intrigue and of arms is of a very different nature utterly irreconcilable with the first and indeed fundamentally the reverse of it i mean the rights and liberties of the man the droit de lhomme that this doctrine has made an amazing progress in germany there cannot be a shadow of doubt they are infected by it along the whole course of the rhine the maese the moselle and in the greater part of suabia and franconia it is particularly prevalent amongst all the lower people churchmen and laity in the dominions of the ecclesiastical electors it is not easy to find or to conceive governments more mild and indulgent than these church sovereignties but good government is as nothing when the rights of man take possession of the mind indeed the loose rein held over the people in these provinces must be considered as one cause of the facility with which they lend themselves to any schemes of innovation by inducing them to think lightly of their governments and to judge of grievances not by feeling but by imagination  sidenote balance of germany  it is in these electorates that the first impressions of france are likely to be made and if they succeed it is over with the germanic body as it stands at present a great revolution is preparing in germany and a revolution in my opinion likely to be more decisive upon the general fate of nations than that of france itselfother than as in france is to be found the first source of all the principles which are in any way likely to distinguish the troubles and convulsions of our age if europe does not conceive the independence and the equilibrium of the empire to be in the very essence of the system of balanced power in europe and if the scheme of public law or mass of laws upon which that independence and equilibrium are founded be of no leading consequence as they are preserved or destroyed all the politics of europe for more than two centuries have been miserably erroneous  sidenote prussia and emperor  if the two great leading powers of germany do not regard this danger as apparently they do not in the light in which it presents itself so naturally it is because they are powers too great to have a social interest that sort of interest belongs only to those whose state of weakness or mediocrity is such as to give them greater cause of apprehension from what may destroy them than of hope from anything by which they may be aggrandized  as long as those two princes are at variance so long the liberties of germany are safe but if ever they should so far understand one another as to be persuaded that they have a more direct and more certainly defined interest in a proportioned mutual aggrandizement than in a reciprocal reduction that is if they come to think that they are more likely to be enriched by a division of spoil than to be rendered secure by keeping to the old policy of preventing others from being spoiled by either of them from that moment the liberties of germany are no more  that a junction of two in such a scheme is neither impossible nor improbable is evident from the partition of poland in 1773 which was effected by such a junction as made the interposition of other nations to prevent it not easy their circumstances at that time hindered any other three states or indeed any two from taking measures in common to prevent it though france was at that time an existing power and had not yet learned to act upon a system of politics of her own invention the geographical position of poland was a great obstacle to any movements of france in opposition to this at that time unparalleled league to my certain knowledge if great britain had at that time been willing to concur in preventing the execution of a project so dangerous in the example even exhausted as france then was by the preceding war and under a lazy and unenterprising prince she would have at every risk taken an active part in this business but a languor with regard to so remote an interest and the principles and passions which were then strongly at work at home were the causes why great britain would not give france any encouragement in such an enterprise at that time however and with regard to that object in my opinion great britain and france had a common interest  sidenote possible project of the emperor and king of prussia  but the position of germany is not like that of poland with regard to france either for good or for evil if a conjunction between prussia and the emperor should be formed for the purpose of secularizing and rendering hereditary the ecclesiastical electorates and the bishopric of münster for settling two of them on the children of the emperor and uniting cologne and münster to the dominions of the king of prussia on the rhine or if any other project of mutual aggrandizement should be in prospect and that to facilitate such a scheme the modern french should be permitted and encouraged to shake the internal and external security of these ecclesiastical electorates great britain is so situated that she could not with any effect set herself in opposition to such a design her principal arm her marine could here be of no sort of use  sidenote to be resisted only by france  france the author of the treaty of westphalia is the natural guardian of the independence and balance of germany great britain to say nothing of the kings concern as one of that august body has a serious interest in preserving it but except through the power of france acting upon the common old principles of state policy in the case we have supposed she has no sort of means of supporting that interest it is always the interest of great britain that the power of france should be kept within the bounds of moderation it is not her interest that that power should be wholly annihilated in the system of europe though at one time through france the independence of europe was endangered it is and ever was through her alone that the common liberty of germany can be secured against the single or the combined ambition of any other power in truth within this century the aggrandizement of other sovereign houses has been such that there has been a great change in the whole state of europe and other nations as well as france may become objects of jealousy and apprehension  sidenote new principles of alliance  in this state of things a new principle of alliances and wars is opened the treaty of westphalia is with france an antiquated fable the rights and liberties she was bound to maintain are now a system of wrong and tyranny which she is bound to destroy her good and ill dispositions are shown by the same means to communicate peaceably the rights of men is the true mode of her showing her friendship to force sovereigns to submit to those rights is her mode of hostility so that either as friend or foe her whole scheme has been and is to throw the empire into confusion and those statesmen who follow the old routine of politics may see in this general confusion and in the danger of the lesser princes an occasion as protectors or enemies of connecting their territories to one or the other of the two great german powers they do not take into consideration that the means which they encourage as leading to the event they desire will with certainty not only ravage and destroy the empire but if they should for a moment seem to aggrandize the two great houses will also establish principles and confirm tempers amongst the people which will preclude the two sovereigns from the possibility of holding what they acquire or even the dominions which they have inherited it is on the side of the ecclesiastical electorates that the dikes raised to support the german liberty first will give way  sidenote geneva  sidenote savoy  the french have begun their general operations by seizing upon those territories of the pope the situation of which was the most inviting to the enterprise their method of doing it was by exciting sedition and spreading massacre and desolation through these unfortunate places and then under an idea of kindness and protection bringing forward an antiquated title of the crown of france and annexing avignon and the two cities of the comtat with their territory to the french republic they have made an attempt on geneva in which they very narrowly failed of success it is known that they hold out from time to time the idea of uniting all the other provinces of which gaul was anciently composed including savoy on the other side and on this side bounding themselves by the rhine  sidenote switzerland  sidenote old french maxims the security of its independence  as to switzerland it is a country whose long union rather than its possible division is the matter of wonder here i know they entertain very sanguine hopes the aggregation to france of the democratic swiss republics appears to them to be a work half done by their very form and it might seem to them rather an increase of importance to these little commonwealths than a derogation from their independency or a change in the manner of their government upon any quarrel amongst the cantons nothing is more likely than such an event as to the aristocratic republics the general clamor and hatred which the french excite against the very name and with more facility and success than against monarchs and the utter impossibility of their government making any sort of resistance against an insurrection where they have no troops and the people are all armed and trained render their hopes in that quarter far indeed from unfounded it is certain that the republic of bern thinks itself obliged to a vigilance next to hostile and to imprison or expel all the french whom it finds in its territories but indeed those aristocracies which comprehend whatever is considerable wealthy and valuable in switzerland do now so wholly depend upon opinion and the humor of their multitude that the lightest puff of wind is sufficient to blow them down if france under its ancient regimen and upon the ancient principles of policy was the support of the germanic constitution it was much more so of that of switzerland which almost from the very origin of that confederacy rested upon the closeness of its connection with france on which the swiss cantons wholly reposed themselves for the preservation of the parts of their body in their respective rights and permanent forms as well as for the maintenance of all in their general independency  switzerland and germany are the first objects of the new french politicians when i contemplate what they have done at home which is in effect little less than an amazing conquest wrought by a change of opinion in a great part to be sure far from altogether very sudden i cannot help letting my thoughts run along with their designs and without attending to geographical order to consider the other states of europe so far as they may be any way affected by this astonishing revolution if early steps are not taken in some way or other to prevent the spreading of this influence i scarcely think any of them perfectly secure  sidenote italy  sidenote lombardy  italy is divided as germany and switzerland are into many smaller states and with some considerable diversity as to forms of government but as these divisions and varieties in italy are not so considerable so neither do i think the danger altogether so imminent there as in germany and switzerland savoy i know that the french consider as in a very hopeful way and i believe not at all without reason they view it as an old member of the kingdom of france which may be easily reunited in the manner and on the principles of the reunion of avignon this country communicates with piedmont and as the king of sardinias dominions were long the key of italy and as such long regarded by france whilst france acted on her old maxims and with views on italyso in this new french empire of sedition if once she gets that key into her hands she can easily lay open the barrier which hinders the entrance of her present politics into that inviting region milan i am sure nourishes great disquiets and if milan should stir no part of lombardy is secure to the present possessorswhether the venetian or the austrian genoa is closely connected with france  sidenote bourbon princes in italy  the first prince of the house of bourbon has been obliged to give himself up entirely to the new system and to pretend even to propagate it with all zeal at least that club of intriguers who assemble at the feuillants and whose cabinet meets at madame de staëls and makes and directs all the ministers is the real executive government of france the emperor is perfectly in concert and they will not long suffer any prince of the house of bourbon to keep by force the french emissaries out of their dominions nor whilst france has a commerce with them especially through marseilles the hottest focus of sedition in france will it be long possible to prevent the intercourse or the effects  naples has an old inveterate disposition to republicanism and however for some time past quiet is as liable to explosion as its own vesuvius sicily i think has these dispositions in full as strong a degree in neither of these countries exists anything which very well deserves the name of government or exact police  sidenote ecclesiastical state  in the states of the church notwithstanding their strictness in banishing the french out of that country there are not wanting the seeds of a revolution the spirit of nepotism prevails there nearly as strong as ever every pope of course is to give origin or restoration to a great family by the means of large donations the foreign revenues have long been gradually on the decline and seem now in a manner dried up to supply this defect the resource of vexatious and impolitic jobbing at home if anything is rather increased than lessened various wellintended but illunderstood practices some of them existing in their spirit at least from the time of the old roman empire still prevail and that government is as blindly attached to old abusive customs as others are wildly disposed to all sorts of innovations and experiments these abuses were less felt whilst the pontificate drew riches from abroad which in some measure counterbalanced the evils of their remiss and jobbish government at home but now it can subsist only on the resources of domestic management and abuses in that management of course will be more intimately and more severely felt  in the midst of the apparently torpid languor of the ecclesiastical state those who have had opportunity of a near observation have seen a little rippling in that smooth water which indicates something alive under it there is in the ecclesiastical state a personage who seems capable of acting but with more force and steadiness the part of the tribune rienzi the people once inflamed will not be destitute of a leader they have such an one already in the cardinal or archbishop boncompagni he is of all men if i am not illinformed the most turbulent seditious intriguing bold and desperate he is not at all made for a roman of the present day i think he lately held the first office of their state that of great chamberlain which is equivalent to high treasurer at present he is out of employment and in disgrace if he should be elected pope or even come to have any weight with a new pope he will infallibly conjure up a democratic spirit in that country he may indeed be able to effect it without these advantages the nest interregnum will probably show more of him there may be others of the same character who have not come to my knowledge this much is certainthat the roman people if once the blind reverence they bear to the sanctity of the pope which is their only bridle should relax are naturally turbulent ferocious and headlong whilst the police is defective and the government feeble and resourceless beyond all imagination  sidenote spain  as to spain it is a nerveless country it does not possess the use it only suffers the abuse of a nobility for some time and even before the settlement of the bourbon dynasty that body has been systematically lowered and rendered incapable by exclusion and for incapacity excluded from affairs in this circle the body is in a manner annihilated and so little means have they of any weighty exertion either to control or to support the crown that if they at all interfere it is only by abetting desperate and mobbish insurrections like that at madrid which drove squillace from his place florida blanca is a creature of office and has little connection and no sympathy with that body  as to the clergy they are the only thing in spain that looks like an independent order and they are kept in some respect by the inquisition the sole but unhappy resource of public tranquillity and order now remaining in spain as in venice it is become mostly an engine of statewhich indeed to a degree it has always been in spain it wars no longer with jews and heretics it has no such war to carry on its great object is to keep atheistic and republican doctrines from making their way in that kingdom no french book upon any subject can enter there which does not contain such matter in spain the clergy are of moment from their influence but at the same time with the envy and jealousy that attend great riches and power though the crown has by management with the pope got a very great share of the ecclesiastical revenues into its own hands much still remains to them there will always be about that court those who look out to a farther division of the church property as a resource and to be obtained by shorter methods than those of negotiations with the clergy and their chief but at present i think it likely that they will stop lest the business should be taken out of their handsand lest that body in which remains the only life that exists in spain and is not a fever may with their property lose all the influence necessary to preserve the monarchy or being poor and desperate may employ whatever influence remains to them as active agents in its destruction  sidenote castile different from catalonia and aragon  the castilians have still remaining a good deal of their old character their gravedad lealtad and el temor de dios but that character neither is nor ever was exactly true except of the castilians only the several kingdoms which compose spain have perhaps some features which run through the whole but they are in many particulars as different as nations who go by different names the catalans for instance and the aragonians too in a great measure have the spirit of the miquelets and much more of republicanism than of an attachment to royalty they are more in the way of trade and intercourse with france and upon the least internal movement will disclose and probably let loose a spirit that may throw the whole spanish monarchy into convulsions  it is a melancholy reflection that the spirit of melioration which has been going on in that part of europe more or less during this century and the various schemes very lately on foot for further advancement are all put a stop to at once reformation certainly is nearly connected with innovation and where that latter comes in for too large a share those who undertake to improve their country may risk their own safety in times where the correction which includes the confession of an abuse is turned to criminate the authority which has long suffered it rather than to honor those who would amend it which is the spirit of this malignant french distemper every step out of the common course becomes critical and renders it a task full of peril for princes of moderate talents to engage in great undertakings at present the only safety of spain is the old national hatred to the french how far that can be depended upon if any great ferments should be excited it is impossible to say  as to portugal she is out of the highroad of these politics i shall therefore not divert my thoughts that way but return again to the north of europe which at present seems the part most interested and there it appears to me that the french speculation on the northern countries may be valued in the following or some such manner  sidenote denmark  sidenote sweden  denmark and norway do not appear to furnish any of the materials of a democratic revolution or the dispositions to it denmark can only be consequentially affected by anything done in prance but of sweden i think quite otherwise the present power in sweden is too new a system and too green and too sore from its late revolution to be considered as perfectly assured the king by his astonishing activity his boldness his decision his ready versatility and by rousing and employing the old military spirit of sweden keeps up the top with continual agitation and lashing the moment it ceases to spin the royalty is a dead bit of box whenever sweden is quiet externally for some time there is great danger that all the republican elements she contains will be animated by the new french spirit and of this i believe the king is very sensible  sidenote russia  the russian government is of all others the most liable to be subverted by military seditions by court conspiracies and sometimes by headlong rebellions of the people such as the turbinating movement of pugatchef it is not quite so probable that in any of these changes the spirit of system may mingle in the manner it has done in france the muscovites are no great speculators but i should not much rely on their uninquisitive disposition if any of their ordinary motives to sedition should arise the little catechism of the rights of men is soon learned and the inferences are in the passions  sidenote poland  sidenote saxony  poland from one cause or other is always unquiet the new constitution only serves to supply that restless people with new means at least new modes of cherishing their turbulent disposition the bottom of the character is the same it is a great question whether the joining that crown with the electorate of saxony will contribute most to strengthen the royal authority of poland or to shake the ducal in saxony the elector is a catholic the people of saxony are six sevenths at the very least protestants he must continue a catholic according to the polish law if he accepts that crown the pride of the saxons formerly flattered by having a crown in the house of their prince though an honor which cost them dearthe german probity fidelity and loyaltythe weight of the constitution of the empire under the treaty of westphaliathe good temper and goodnature of the princes of the house of saxony had formerly removed from the people all apprehension with regard to their religion and kept them perfectly quiet obedient and even affectionate the seven years war made some change in the minds of the saxons they did not i believe regret the loss of what might be considered almost as the succession to the crown of poland the possession of which by annexing them to a foreign interest had often obliged them to act an arduous part towards the support of which that foreign interest afforded no proportionable strength in this very delicate situation of their political interests the speculations of the french and german economists and the cabals and the secret as well as public doctrines of the illuminatenorden and freemasons have made a considerable progress in that country and a turbulent spirit under color of religion but in reality arising from the french rights of man has already shown itself and is ready on every occasion to blaze out  the present elector is a prince of a safe and quiet temper of great prudence and goodness he knows that in the actual state of things not the power and respect belonging to sovereigns but their very existence depends on a reasonable frugality it is very certain that not one sovereign in europe can either promise for the continuance of his authority in a state of indigence and insolvency or dares to venture on a new imposition to relieve himself without abandoning wholly the ancient magnificence of his court the elector has conducted his affairs with infinitely more economy than any of his predecessors so as to restore his finances beyond what was thought possible from the state in which the seven years war had left saxony saxony during the whole of that dreadful period having been in the hands of an exasperated enemy rigorous by resentment by nature and by necessity was obliged to bear in a manner the whole burden of the war in the intervals when their allies prevailed the inhabitants of that country were not better treated  the moderation and prudence of the present elector in my opinion rather perhaps respites the troubles than secures the peace of the electorate the offer of the succession to the crown of poland is truly critical whether he accepts or whether he declines it if the states will consent to his acceptance it will add to the difficulties already great of his situation between the king of prussia and the emperorbut these thoughts lead me too far when i mean to speak only of the interior condition of these princes it has always however some necessary connection with their foreign politics  sidenote holland  with regard to holland and the ruling party there i do not think it at all tainted or likely to be so except by fearor that it is likely to be misled unless indirectly and circuitously but the predominant party in holland is not holland the suppressed faction though suppressed exists under the ashes the embers of the late commotions are still warm the antiorange party has from the day of its origin been french though alienated in some degree for some time through the pride and folly of louis the fourteenth it will ever hanker after a french connection and now that the internal government in france has been assimilated in so considerable a degree to that which the immoderate republicans began so very lately to introduce into holland their connection as still more natural will be more desired i do not well understand the present exterior politics of the stadtholder nor the treaty into which the newspapers say he has entered for the states with the emperor but the emperors own politics with regard to the netherlands seem to me to be exactly calculated to answer the purpose of the french revolutionists he endeavors to crush the aristocratic party and to nourish one in avowed connection with the most furious democratists in france  these provinces in which the french game is so well played they consider as part of the old french empire certainly they were amongst the oldest parts of it these they think very well situated as their party is well disposed to a reunion as to the greater nations they do not aim at making a direct conquest of them but by disturbing them through a propagation of their principles they hope to weaken as they will weaken them and to keep them in perpetual alarm and agitation and thus render all their efforts against them utterly impracticable whilst they extend the dominion of their sovereign anarchy on all sides  sidenote england  as to england there may be some apprehension from vicinity from constant communication and from the very name of liberty which as it ought to be very dear to us in its worst abuses carries something seductive it is the abuse of the first and best of the objects which we cherish i know that many who sufficiently dislike the system of france have yet no apprehensions of its prevalence here i say nothing to the ground of this security in the attachment of the people to their constitution and their satisfaction in the discreet portion of liberty which it measures out to them upon this i have said all i have to say in the appeal i have published that security is something and not inconsiderable but if a storm arises i should not much rely upon it  sidenote objection to the stability of the french system  there are other views of things which may be used to give us a perfect though in my opinion a delusive assurance of our own security the first of these is from the weakness and rickety nature of the new system in the place of its first formation it is thought that the monster of a commonwealth cannot possibly livethat at any rate the ill contrivance of their fabric will make it fall in pieces of itselfthat the assembly must be bankruptand that this bankruptcy will totally destroy that system from the contagion of which apprehensions are entertained  for my part i have long thought that one great cause of the stability of this wretched scheme of things in france was an opinion that it could not stand and therefore that all external measures to destroy it were wholly useless  sidenote bankruptcy  as to the bankruptcy that event has happened long ago as much as it is ever likely to happen as soon as a nation compels a creditor to take paper currency in discharge of his debt there is a bankruptcy the compulsory paper has in some degree answerednot because there was a surplus from church lands but because faith has not been kept with the clergy as to the holders of the old funds to them the payments will be dilatory but they will be made and whatever may be the discount on paper whilst paper is taken paper will be issued  sidenote resources  as to the rest they have shot out three branches of revenue to supply all those which they have destroyed that is the universal register of all transactions the heavy and universal stamp duty and the new territorial impost levied chiefly on the reduced estates of the gentlemen these branches of the revenue especially as they take assignats in payment answer their purpose in a considerable degree and keep up the credit of their paper for as they receive it in their treasury it is in reality funded upon all their taxes and future resources of all kinds as well as upon the church estates as this paper is become in a manner the only visible maintenance of the whole people the dread of a bankruptcy is more apparently connected with the delay of a counterrevolution than with the duration of this republic because the interest of the new republic manifestly leans upon it and in my opinion the counterrevolution cannot exist along with it the above three projects ruined some ministers under the old government merely for having conceived them they are the salvation of the present rulers  as the assembly has laid a most unsparing and cruel hand on all men who have lived by the bounty the justice or the abuses of the old government they have lessened many expenses the royal establishment though excessively and ridiculously great for their scheme of things is reduced at least one half the estates of the kings brothers which under the ancient government had been in truth royal revenues go to the general stock of the confiscation and as to the crown lands though under the monarchy they never yielded two hundred and fifty thousand a year by many they are thought at least worth three times as much  as to the ecclesiastical charge whether as a compensation for losses or a provision for religion of which they made at first a great parade and entered into a solemn engagement in favor of it it was estimated at a much larger sum than they could expect from the church property movable or immovable they are completely bankrupt as to that article it is just what they wish and it is not productive of any serious inconvenience the nonpayment produces discontent and occasional sedition but is only by fits and spasms and amongst the country people who are of no consequence these seditions furnish new pretexts for nonpayment to the church establishment and help the assembly wholly to get rid of the clergy and indeed of any form of religion which is not only their real but avowed object  sidenote want of money how supplied  they are embarrassed indeed in the highest degree but not wholly resourceless they are without the species of money circulation of money is a great convenience but a substitute for it may be found whilst the great objects of production and consumption corn cattle wine and the like exist in a country the means of giving them circulation with more or less convenience cannot be wholly wanting the great confiscation of the church and of the crown lands and of the appanages of the princes for the purchase of all which their paper is always received at par gives means of continually destroying and continually creating and this perpetual destruction and renovation feeds the speculative market and prevents and will prevent till that fund of confiscation begins to fail a total depreciation  sidenote moneyed interest not necessary to them  but all consideration of public credit in france is of little avail at present the action indeed of the moneyed interest was of absolute necessity at the beginning of this revolution but the french republic can stand without any assistance from that description of men which as things are now circumstanced rather stands in need of assistance itself from the power which alone substantially exists in france i mean the several districts and municipal republics and the several clubs which direct all their affairs and appoint all their magistrates this is the power now paramount to everything even to the assembly itself called national and that to which tribunals priesthood laws finances and both descriptions of military power are wholly subservient so far as the military power of either description yields obedience to any name of authority  the world of contingency and political combination is much larger than we are apt to imagine we never can say what may or may not happen without a view to all the actual circumstances experience upon other data than those is of all things the most delusive prudence in new cases can do nothing on grounds of retrospect a constant vigilance and attention to the train of things as they successively emerge and to act on what they direct are the only sure courses the physician that let blood and by bloodletting cured one kind of plague in the next added to its ravages that power goes with property is not universally true and the idea that the operation of it is certain and invariable may mislead us very fatally  sidenote power separated from property  whoever will take an accurate view of the state of those republics and of the composition of the present assembly deputed by them in which assembly there are not quite fifty persons possessed of an income amounting to 100l sterling yearly must discern clearly that the political and civil power of france is wholly separated from its property of every description and of course that neither the landed nor the moneyed interest possesses the smallest weight or consideration in the direction of any public concern the whole kingdom is directed by the refuse of its chicane with the aid of the bustling presumptuous young clerks of countinghouses and shops and some intermixture of young gentlemen of the same character in the several towns the rich peasants are bribed with church lands and the poorer of that description are and can be counted for nothing they may rise in ferocious illdirected tumultsbut they can only disgrace themselves and signalize the triumph of their adversaries  sidenote effects of the rota  the truly active citizens that is the above descriptions are all concerned in intrigue respecting the various objects in their local or their general government the rota which the french have established for their national assembly holds out the highest objects of ambition to such vast multitudes as in an unexampled measure to widen the bottom of a new species of interest merely political and wholly unconnected with birth or property this scheme of a rota though it enfeebles the state considered as one solid body and indeed wholly disables it from acting as such gives a great an equal and a diffusive strength to the democratic scheme seven hundred and fifty people every two years raised to the supreme power has already produced at least fifteen hundred bold acting politicians a great number for even so great a country as france these men never will quietly settle in ordinary occupations nor submit to any scheme which must reduce them to an entirely private condition or to the exercise of a steady peaceful but obscure and unimportant industry whilst they sit in the assembly they are denied offices of trust and profitbut their short duration makes this no restraint during their probation and apprenticeship they are all salaried with an income to the greatest part of them immense and after they have passed the novitiate those who take any sort of lead are placed in very lucrative offices according to their influence and credit or appoint those who divide their profits with them  this supply of recruits to the corps of the highest civil ambition goes on with a regular progression in very few years it must amount to many thousands these however will be as nothing in comparison to the multitude of municipal officers and officers of district and department of all sorts who have tasted of power and profit and who hunger for the periodical return of the meal to these needy agitators the glory of the state the general wealth and prosperity of the nation and the rise or fall of public credit are as dreams nor have arguments deduced from these topics any sort of weight with them the indifference with which the assembly regards the state of their colonies the only valuable part of the french commerce is a full proof how little they are likely to be affected by anything but the selfish game of their own ambition now universally diffused  sidenote impracticability of resistance  it is true amidst all these turbulent means of security to their system very great discontents everywhere prevail but they only produce misery to those who nurse them at home or exile beggary and in the end confiscation to those who are so impatient as to remove from them each municipal republic has a committee or something in the nature of a committee of research in these petty republics the tyranny is so near its object that it becomes instantly acquainted with every act of every man it stifles conspiracy in its very first movements their power is absolute and uncontrollable no stand can be made against it these republics are besides so disconnected that very little intelligence of what happens in them is to be obtained beyond their own bounds except by the means of their clubs who keep up a constant correspondence and who give what color they please to such facts as they choose to communicate out of the track of their correspondence they all have some sort of communication just as much or as little as they please with the centre by this confinement of all communication to the ruling faction any combination grounded on the abuses and discontents in one scarcely can reach the other there is not one man in any one place to head them the old government had so much abstracted the nobility from the cultivation of provincial interest that no man in france exists whose power credit or consequence extends to two districts or who is capable of uniting them in any design even if any man could assemble ten men together without being sure of a speedy lodging in a prison one must not judge of the state of france by what has been observed elsewhere it does not in the least resemble any other country analogical reasoning from history or from recent experience in other places is wholly delusive  in my opinion there never was seen so strong a government internally as that of the french municipalities if ever any rebellion can arise against the present system it must begin where the revolution which gave birth to it did at the capital paris is the only place in which there is the least freedom of intercourse but even there so many servants as any man has so many spies and irreconcilable domestic enemies  sidenote gentlemen are fugitives  but that place being the chief seat of the power and intelligence of the ruling faction and the place of occasional resort for their fiercest spirits even there a revolution is not likely to have anything to feed it the leaders of the aristocratic party have been drawn out of the kingdom by order of the princes on the hopes held out by the emperor and the king of prussia at pilnitz and as to the democratic factions in paris amongst them there are no leaders possessed of an influence for any other purpose but that of maintaining the present state of things the moment they are seen to warp they are reduced to nothing they have no attached armyno party that is at all personal  it is not to be imagined because a political system is under certain aspects very unwise in its contrivance and very mischievous in its effects that it therefore can have no long duration its very defects may tend to its stability because they are agreeable to its nature the very faults in the constitution of poland made it last the veto which destroyed all its energy preserved its life what can be conceived so monstrous as the republic of algiers and that no less strange republic of the mamelukes in egypt they are of the worst form imaginable and exercised in the worst manner yet they have existed as a nuisance on the earth for several hundred years  sidenote conclusions  from all these considerations and many more that crowd upon me three conclusions have long since arisen in my mind  first that no counter revolution is to be expected in france from internal causes solely  secondly that the longer the present system exists the greater will be its strength the greater its power to destroy discontents at home and to resist all foreign attempts in favor of these discontents  thirdly that as long as it exists in france it will be the interest of the managers there and it is in the very essence of their plan to disturb and distract all other governments and their endless succession of restless politicians will continually stimulate them to new attempts  sidenote proceedings of princes defensive plans  princes are generally sensible that this is their common cause and two of them have made a public declaration of their opinion to this effect against this common danger some of them such as the king of spain the king of sardinia and the republic of bern are very diligent in using defensive measures  if they were to guard against an invasion from france the merits of this plan of a merely defensive resistance might be supported by plausible topics but as the attack does not operate against these countries externally but by an internal corruption a sort of dry rot they who pursue this merely defensive plan against a danger which the plan itself supposes to be serious cannot possibly escape it for it is in the nature of all defensive measures to be sharp and vigorous under the impressions of the first alarm and to relax by degrees until at length the danger by not operating instantly comes to appear as a false alarmso much so that the next menacing appearance will look less formidable and will be less provided against but to those who are on the offensive it is not necessary to be always alert possibly it is more their interest not to be so for their unforeseen attacks contribute to their success  sidenote the french party how composed  in the mean time a system of french conspiracy is gaining ground in every country this system happening to be founded on principles the most delusive indeed but the most flattering to the natural propensities of the unthinking multitude and to the speculations of all those who think without thinking very profoundly must daily extend its influence a predominant inclination towards it appears in all those who have no religion when otherwise their disposition leads them to be advocates even for despotism hence hume though i cannot say that he does not throw out some expressions of disapprobation on the proceedings of the levellers in the reign of richard the second yet affirms that the doctrines of john ball were conformable to the ideas of primitive equality which are engraven in the hearts of all men  boldness formerly was not the character of atheists as such they were even of a character nearly the reverse they were formerly like the old epicureans rather an unenterprising race but of late they are grown active designing turbulent and seditious they are sworn enemies to kings nobility and priesthood we have seen all the academicians at paris with condorcet the friend and correspondent of priestley at their head the most furious of the extravagant republicans  sidenote condorcet  the late assembly after the last captivity of the king had actually chosen this condorcet by a majority on the ballot for preceptor to the dauphin who was to be taken out of the hands and direction of his parents and to be delivered over to this fanatic atheist and furious democratic republican his untractability to these leaders and his figure in the club of jacobins which at that time they wished to bring under alone prevented that part of the arrangement and others in the same style from being carried into execution whilst he was candidate for this office he produced his title to it by promulgating the following ideas of the title of his royal pupil to the crown in a paper written by him and published with his name against the reëstablishment even of the appearance of monarchy under any qualifications he says  sidenote doctrine of the french  jusquà ce moment ils lassemblée nationale nont rien préjugé encore en se réservant de nommer un gouverneur au dauphin ils nont pas prononcé que cet enfant dût régner mais seulement quil était possible que la constitution ly destinât

officer and the most important by far he leads them to peace or war he is the great theme of the republican faction in england these ideas of m condorcet are the principles of those to whom kings are to intrust their successors and the interests of their succession this man would be ready to plunge the poniard in the heart of his pupil or to whet the axe for his neck of all men the most dangerous is a warm hotheaded zealous atheist this sort of man aims at dominion and his means are the words he always has in his mouthlégalité naturelle des hommes et la souveraineté du peuple  all former attempts grounded on these rights of men had proved unfortunate the success of this last makes a mighty difference in the effect of the doctrine here is a principle of a nature to the multitude the most seductive always existing before their eyes as a thing feasible in practice after so many failures such an enterprise previous to the french experiment carried ruin to the contrivers on the face of it and if any enthusiast was so wild as to wish to engage in a scheme of that nature it was not easy for him to find followers now there is a party almost in all countries readymade animated with success with a sure ally in the very centre of europe there is no cabal so obscure in any place that they do not protect cherish foster and endeavor to raise it into importance at home and abroad from the lowest this intrigue will creep up to the highest ambition as well as enthusiasm may find its account in the party and in the principle  sidenote character of ministers  the ministers of other kings like those of the king of france not one of whom was perfectly free from this guilt and some of whom were very deep in it may themselves be the persons to foment such a disposition and such a faction hertzberg the king of prussias late minister is so much of what is called a philosopher that he was of a faction with that sort of politicians in everything and in every place even when he defends himself from the imputation of giving extravagantly into these principles he still considers the revolution of france as a great public good by giving credit to their fraudulent declaration of their universal benevolence and love of peace nor are his prussian majestys present ministers at all disinclined to the same system their ostentatious preamble to certain late edicts demonstrates if their actions had not been sufficiently explanatory of their cast of mind that they are deeply infected with the same distemper of dangerous because plausible though trivial and shallow speculation  ministers turning their backs on the reputation which properly belongs to them aspire at the glory of being speculative writers the duties of these two situations are in general directly opposite to each other speculators ought to be neutral a minister cannot be so he is to support the interest of the public as connected with that of his master he is his masters trustee advocate attorney and stewardand he is not to indulge in any speculation which contradicts that character or even detracts from its efficacy necker had an extreme thirst for this sort of glory so had others and this pursuit of a misplaced and misunderstood reputation was one of the causes of the ruin of these ministers and of their unhappy master the prussian ministers in foreign courts have at least not long since talked the most democratic language with regard to prance and in the most unmanaged terms  sidenote corps diplomatique  the whole corps diplomatique with very few exceptions leans that way what cause produces in them a turn of mind which at first one would think unnatural to their situation it is not impossible to explain the discussion would however be somewhat long and somewhat invidious the fact itself is indisputable however they may disguise it to their several courts this disposition is gone to so very great a length in that corps in itself so important and so important as furnishing the intelligence which sways all cabinets that if princes and states do not very speedily attend with a vigorous control to that source of direction and information very serious evils are likely to befall them  sidenote sovereignstheir dispositions  but indeed kings are to guard against the same sort of dispositions in themselves they are very easily alienated from all the higher orders of their subjects whether civil or military laic or ecclesiastical it is with persons of condition that sovereigns chiefly come into contact it is from them that they generally experience opposition to their will it is with their pride and impracticability that princes are most hurt it is with their servility and baseness that they are most commonly disgusted it is from their humors and cabals that they find their affairs most frequently troubled and distracted but of the common people in pure monarchical governments kings know little or nothing and therefore being unacquainted with their faults which are as many as those of the great and much more decisive in their effects when accompanied with power kings generally regard them with tenderness and favor and turn their eyes towards that description of their subjects particularly when hurt by opposition from the higher orders it was thus that the king of france a perpetual example to all sovereigns was ruined i have it from very sure information and it was indeed obvious enough from the measures which were taken previous to the assembly of the states and afterwards that the kings counsellors had filled him with a strong dislike to his nobility his clergy and the corps of his magistracy they represented to him that he had tried them all severally in several ways and found them all untractable that he had twice called an assembly the notables composed of the first men of the clergy the nobility and the magistrates that he had himself named every one member in those assemblies and that though so picked out he had not in this their collective state found them more disposed to a compliance with his will than they had been separately that there remained for him with the least prospect of advantage to his authority in the statesgeneral which were to be composed of the same sorts of men but not chosen by him only the tiers État in this alone he could repose any hope of extricating himself from his difficulties and of settling him in a clear and permanent authority they represented these are the words of one of my informants that the royal authority compressed with the weight of these aristocratic bodies full of ambition and of faction when once unloaded would rise of itself and occupy its natural place without disturbance or control that the common people would protect cherish and support instead of crushing it the people it was said could entertain no objects of ambition they were out of the road of intrigue and cabal and could possibly have no other view than the support of the mild and parental authority by which they were invested for the first time collectively with real importance in the state and protected in their peaceable and useful employments  sidenote king of france  this unfortunate king not without a large share of blame to himself was deluded to his ruin by a desire to humble and reduce his nobility clergy and big corporate magistracy not that i suppose he meant wholly to eradicate these bodies in the manner since effected by the democratic power i rather believe that even neckers designs did not go to that extent with his own hand however louis the sixteenth pulled down the pillars which upheld his throne and this he did because he could not bear the inconveniences which are attached to everything humanbecause he found himself cooped up and in durance by those limits which nature prescribes to desire and imagination and was taught to consider as low and degrading that mutual dependence which providence has ordained that all men should have on one another he is not at this minute perhaps cured of the dread of the power and credit like to be acquired by those who would save and rescue him he leaves those who suffer in his cause to their fateand hopes by various mean delusive intrigues in which i am afraid he is encouraged from abroad to regain among traitors and regicides the power he has joined to take from his own family whom he quietly sees proscribed before his eyes and called to answer to the lowest of his rebels as the vilest of all criminals  sidenote emperor  it is to be hoped that the emperor may be taught better things by this fatal example but it is sure that he has advisers who endeavor to fill him with the ideas which have brought his brotherinlaw to his present situation joseph the second was far gone in this philosophy and some if not most who serve the emperor would kindly initiate him into all the mysteries of this freemasonry they would persuade him to look on the national assembly not with the hatred of an enemy but the jealousy of a rival they would make him desirous of doing in his own dominions by a royal despotism what has been done in france by a democratic rather than abandon such enterprises they would persuade him to a strange alliance between those extremes their grand object being now as in his brothers time at any rate to destroy the higher orders they think he cannot compass this end as certainly he cannot without elevating the lower by depressing the one and by raising the other they hope in the first place to increase his treasures and his army and with these common instruments of royal power they flatter him that the democracy which they help in his name to create will give him but little trouble in defiance of the freshest experience which might show him that old impossibilities are become modern probabilities and that the extent to which evil principles may go when left to their own operation is beyond the power of calculation they will endeavor to persuade him that such a democracy is a thing which cannot subsist by itself that in whose ever hands the military command is placed he must be in the necessary course of affairs sooner or later the master and that being the master of various unconnected countries he may keep them all in order by employing a military force which to each of them is foreign this maxim too however formerly plausible will not now hold water this scheme is full of intricacy and may cause him everywhere to lose the hearts of his people these counsellors forget that a corrupted army was the very cause of the ruin of his brotherinlaw and that he is himself far from secure from a similar corruption  sidenote brabant  instead of reconciling himself heartily and bonâ fide according to the most obvious rules of policy to the states of brabant as they are constituted and who in the present state of things stand on the same foundation with the monarchy itself and who might have been gained with the greatest facility they have advised him to the most unkingly proceeding which either in a good or in a bad light has ever been attempted under a pretext taken from the spirit of the lowest chicane they have counselled him wholly to break the public faith to annul the amnesty as well as the other conditions through which he obtained an entrance into the provinces of the netherlands under the guaranty of great britain and prussia he is made to declare his adherence to the indemnity in a criminal sense but he is to keep alive in his own name and to encourage in others a civil process in the nature of an action of damages for what has been suffered during the troubles whilst he keeps up this hopeful lawsuit in view of the damages he may recover against individuals he loses the hearts of a whole people and the vast subsidies which his ancestors had been used to receive from them  sidenote emperors conduct with regard to france  this design once admitted unriddles the mystery of the whole conduct of the emperors ministers with regard to france as soon as they saw the life of the king and queen of france no longer as they thought in danger they entirely changed their plan with regard to the french nation i believe that the chiefs of the revolution those who led the constituting assembly have contrived as far as they can do it to give the emperor satisfaction on this head he keeps a continual tone and posture of menace to secure this his only point but it must be observed that he all along grounds his departure from the engagement at pilnitz to the princes on the will and actions of the king and the majority of the people without any regard to the natural and constitutional orders of the state or to the opinions of the whole house of bourbon though it is manifestly under the constraint of imprisonment and the fear of death that this unhappy man has been guilty of all those humilities which have astonished mankind the advisers of the emperor will consider nothing but the physical person of louis which even in his present degraded and infamous state they regard as of sufficient authority to give a complete sanction to the persecution and utter ruin of all his family and of every person who has shown any degree of attachment or fidelity to him or to his cause as well as competent to destroy the whole ancient constitution and frame of the french monarchy  the present policy therefore of the austrian politicians is to recover despotism through democracyor at least at any expense everywhere to ruin the description of men who are everywhere the objects of their settled and systematic aversion but more especially in the netherlands compare this with the emperors refusing at first all intercourse with the present powers in france with his endeavoring to excite all europe against them and then his not only withdrawing all assistance and all countenance from the fugitives who had been drawn by his declarations from their houses situations and military commissions many even from the means of their very existence but treating them with every species of insult and outrage  combining this unexampled conduct in the emperors advisers with the timidity operating as perfidy of the king of france a fatal example is held out to all subjects tending to show what little support or even countenance they are to expect from those for whom their principle of fidelity may induce them to risk life and fortune the emperors advisers would not for the world rescind one of the acts of this or of the late french assembly nor do they wish anything better at present for their masters brother of france than that he should really be as he is nominally at the head of the system of persecution of religion and good order and of all descriptions of dignity natural and instituted they only wish all this done with a little more respect to the kings person and with more appearance of consideration for his new subordinate officein hopes that yielding himself for the present to the persons who have effected these changes he may be able to game for the rest hereafter on no other principles than these can the conduct of the court of vienna be accounted for the subordinate court of brussels talks the language of a club of feuillants and jacobins  sidenote moderate party  in this state of general rottenness among subjects and of delusion and false politics in princes comes a new experiment the king of france is in the hands of the chiefs of the regicide factionthe barnaves lameths fayettes périgords duports robespierres camuses c c c they who had imprisoned suspended and conditionally deposed him are his confidential counsellors the next desperate of the desperate rebels call themselves the moderate party they are the chiefs of the first assembly who are confederated to support their power during their suspension from the present and to govern the existent body with as sovereign a sway as they had done the last they have for the greater part succeeded and they have many advantages towards procuring their success in future just before the close of their regular power they bestowed some appearance of prerogatives on the king which in their first plans they had refused to himparticularly the mischievous and in his situation dreadful prerogative of a veto this prerogative which they hold as their bit in the mouth of the national assembly for the time being without the direct assistance of their club it was impossible for the king to show even the desire of exerting with the smallest effect or even with safety to his person however by playing through this veto the assembly against the king and the king against the assembly they have made themselves masters of both in this situation having destroyed the old government by their sedition they would preserve as much of order as is necessary for the support of their own usurpation  sidenote french ambassador  it is believed that this by far the worst party of the miscreants of france has received direct encouragement from the counsellors who betray the emperor thus strengthened by the possession of the captive king now captive in his mind as well as in body and by a good hope of the emperor they intend to send their ministers to every court in europehaving sent before them such a denunciation of terror and superiority to every nation without exception as has no example in the diplomatic world hitherto the ministers to foreign courts had been of the appointment of the sovereign of france previous to the revolution and either from inclination duty or decorum most of them were contented with a merely passive obedience to the new power at present the king being entirely in the hands of his jailors and his mind broken to his situation can send none but the enthusiasts of the systemmen framed by the secret committee of the feuillants who meet in the house of madame de staël m neckers daughter such is every man whom they have talked of sending hither these ministers will be so many spies and incendiaries so many active emissaries of democracy their houses will become places of rendezvous here as everywhere else and centres of cabal for whatever is mischievous and malignant in this country particularly among those of rank and fashion as the minister of the national assembly will be admitted at this court at least with his usual rank and as entertainments will be naturally given and received by the kings own ministers any attempt to discountenance the resort of other people to that minister would be ineffectual and indeed absurd and full of contradiction the women who come with these ambassadors will assist in fomenting factions amongst ours which cannot fail of extending the evil some of them i hear are already arrived there is no doubt they will do as much mischief as they can  sidenote connection of clubs  whilst the public ministers are received under the general law of the communication between nations the correspondences between the factious clubs in france and ours will be as they now are kept up but this pretended embassy will be a closer more steady and more effectual link between the partisans of the new system on both sides of the water i do not mean that these anglogallic clubs in london manchester c are not dangerous in a high degree the appointment of festive anniversaries has ever in the sense of mankind been held the best method of keeping alive the spirit of any institution we have one settled in london and at the last of them that of the 14th of july the strong discountenance of government the unfavorable time of the year and the then uncertainty of the disposition of foreign powers did not hinder the meeting of at least nine hundred people with good coats on their backs who could afford to pay half a guinea a head to show their zeal for the new principles they were with great difficulty and all possible address hindered from inviting the french ambassador his real indisposition besides the fear of offending any party sent him out of town but when our court shall have recognized a government in france founded on the principles announced in montmorins letter how can the french ambassador be frowned upon for an attendance on those meetings wherein the establishment of the government he represents is celebrated an event happened a few days ago which in many particulars was very ridiculous yet even from the ridicule and absurdity of the proceedings it marks the more strongly the spirit of the french assembly i mean the reception they have given to the frith street alliance this though the delirium of a low drunken alehouse club they have publicly announced as a formal alliance with the people of england as such ordered it to be presented to their king and to be published in every province in france this leads more directly and with much greater force than any proceeding with a regular and rational appearance to two very material considerations first it shows that they are of opinion that the current opinions of the english have the greatest influence on the minds of the people in france and indeed of all the people in europe since they catch with such astonishing eagerness at every the most trifling show of such opinions in their favor next and what appears to me to be full as important it shows that they are willing publicly to countenance and even to adopt every factious conspiracy that can be formed in this nation however low and base in itself in order to excite in the most miserable wretches here an idea of their own sovereign importance and to encourage them to look up to france whenever they may be matured into something of more force for assistance in the subversion of their domestic government this address of the alehouse club was actually proposed and accepted by the assembly as an alliance the procedure was in my opinion a high misdemeanor in those who acted thus in england if they were not so very low and so very base that no acts of theirs can be called high even as a description of criminality and the assembly in accepting proclaiming and publishing this forged alliance has been guilty of a plain aggression which would justify our court in demanding a direct disavowal if our policy should not lead us to wink at it  whilst i look over this paper to have it copied i see a manifesto of the assembly as a preliminary to a declaration of war against the german princes on the rhine this manifesto contains the whole substance of the french politics with regard to foreign states they have ordered it to be circulated amongst the people in every country of europeeven previously to its acceptance by the king and his new privy council the club of the feuillants therefore as a summary of their policy avowed by themselves let us consider some of the circumstances attending that piece as well as the spirit and temper of the piece itself  sidenote declaration against the emperor  it was preceded by a speech from brissot full of unexampled insolence towards all the sovereign states of germany if not of europe the assembly to express their satisfaction in the sentiments which it contained ordered it to be printed this brissot had been in the lowest and basest employ under the deposed monarchya sort of thieftaker or spy of policein which character he acted after the manner of persons in that description he had been employed by his master the lieutenant de police for a considerable time in london in the same or some such honorable occupation the revolution which has brought forward all merit of that kind raised him with others of a similar class and disposition to fame and eminence on the revolution he became a publisher of an infamous newspaper which he still continues he is charged and i believe justly as the first mover of the troubles in hispaniola there is no wickedness if i am rightly informed in which he is not versed and of which he is not perfectly capable his quality of newswriter now an employment of the first dignity in france and his practices and principles procured his election into the assembly where he is one of the leading members m condorcet produced on the same day a draught of a declaration to the king which the assembly published before it was presented  condorcet though no marquis as he styled himself before the revolution is a man of another sort of birth fashion and occupation from brissotbut in every principle and every disposition to the lowest as well as the highest and most determined villanies fully his equal he seconds brissot in the assembly and is at once his coadjutor and his rival in a newspaper which in his own name and as successor to m garat a member also of the assembly he has just set up in that empire of gazettes condorcet was chosen to draw the first declaration presented by the assembly to the king as a threat to the elector of treves and the other princes on the rhine in that piece in which both feuillants and jacobins concurred they declared publicly and most proudly and insolently the principle on which they mean to proceed in their future disputes with any of the sovereigns of europe for they say that it is not with fire and sword they mean to attack their territories but by what will be more dreadful to them the introduction of libertyi have not the paper by me to give the exact words but i believe they are nearly as i state themdreadful indeed will be their hostility if they should be able to carry it on according to the example of their modes of introducing liberty they have shown a perfect model of their whole design very complete though in little this gang of murderers and savages have wholly laid waste and utterly ruined the beautiful and happy country of the comtat venaissin and the city of avignon this cruel and treacherous outrage the sovereigns of europe in my opinion with a great mistake of their honor and interest have permitted even without a remonstrance to be carried to the desired point on the principles on which they are now themselves threatened in their own states and this because according to the poor and narrow spirit now in fashion their brother sovereign whose subjects have been thus traitorously and inhumanly treated in violation of the law of nature and of nations has a name somewhat different from theirs and instead of being styled king or duke or landgrave is usually called pope  sidenote state of the empire  the electors of treves and mentz were frightened with the menace of a similar mode of war the assembly however not thinking that the electors of treves and mentz had done enough under their first terror have again brought forward condorcet preceded by brissot as i have just stated the declaration which they have ordered now to be circulated in all countries is in substance the same as the first but still more insolent because more full of detail there they have the impudence to state that they aim at no conquest insinuating that all the old lawful powers of the world had each made a constant open profession of a design of subduing his neighbors they add that if they are provoked their war will be directed only against those who assume to be masters but to the people they will bring peace law liberty c c there is not the least hint that they consider those whom they call persons assuming to be matters to be the lawful government of their country or persons to be treated with the least management or respect they regard them as usurpers and enslavers of the people if i do not mistake they are described by the name of tyrants in condorcets first draught i am sure they are so in brissots speech ordered by the assembly to be printed at the same time and for the same purposes the whole is in the same strain full of false philosophy and false rhetoricboth however calculated to captivate and influence the vulgar mind and to excite sedition in the countries in which it is ordered to be circulated indeed it is such that if any of the lawful acknowledged sovereigns of europe had publicly ordered such a manifesto to be circulated in the dominions of another the ambassador of that power would instantly be ordered to quit every court without an audience  sidenote effect of fear on the sovereign powers  the powers of europe have a pretext for concealing their fears by saying that this language is not used by the king though they well know that there is in effect no such personthat the assembly is in reality and by that king is acknowledged to be the masterthat what he does is but matter of formalityand that he can neither cause nor hinder accelerate nor retard any measure whatsoever nor add to nor soften the manifesto which the assembly has directed to be published with the declared purpose of exciting mutiny and rebellion in the several countries governed by these powers by the generality also of the menaces contained in this paper though infinitely aggravating the outrage they hope to remove from each power separately the idea of a distinct affront the persons first pointed at by the menace are certainly the princes of germany who harbor the persecuted house of bourbon and the nobility of france the declaration however is general and goes to every state with which they may have a cause of quarrel but the terror of france has fallen upon all nations a few months since all sovereigns seemed disposed to unite against her at present they all seem to combine in her favor at no period has the power of france ever appeared with so formidable an aspect in particular the liberties of the empire can have nothing more than an existence the most tottering and precarious whilst france exists with a great power of fomenting rebellion and the greatest in the weakestbut with neither power nor disposition to support the smaller states in their independence against the attempts of the more powerful  i wind up all in a full conviction within my own breast and the substance of which i must repeat over and over again that the state of france is the first consideration in the politics of europe and of each state externally as well as internally considered  most of the topics i have used are drawn from fear and apprehension topics derived from fear or addressed to it are i well know of doubtful appearance to be sure hope is in general the incitement to action alarm some menyou do not drive them to provide for their security you put them to a stand you induce them not to take measures to prevent the approach of danger but to remove so unpleasant an idea from their minds you persuade them to remain as they are from a new fear that their activity may bring on the apprehended mischief before its time i confess freely that this evil sometimes happens from an overdone precaution but it is when the measures are rash illchosen or illcombined and the effects rather of blind terror than of enlightened foresight but the few to whom i wish to submit my thoughts are of a character which will enable them to see danger without astonishment and to provide against it without perplexity  to what lengths this method of circulating mutinous manifestoes and of keeping emissaries of sedition in every court under the name of ambassadors to propagate the same principles and to follow the practices will go and how soon they will operate it is hard to say but go on it will more or less rapidly according to events and to the humor of the time the princes menaced with the revolt of their subjects at the same time that they have obsequiously obeyed the sovereign mandate of the new roman senate have received with distinction in a public character ambassadors from those who in the same act had circulated the manifesto of sedition in their dominions this was the only thing wanting to the degradation and disgrace of the germanic body  the ambassadors from the rights of man and their admission into the diplomatic system i hold to be a new era in this business it will be the most important step yet taken to affect the existence of sovereigns and the higher classes of life i do not mean to exclude its effects upon all classes but the first blow is aimed at the more prominent parts in the ancient order of things  what is to be done  it would be presumption in me to do more than to make a case many things occur but as they like all political measures depend on dispositions tempers means and external circumstances for all their effect not being well assured of these i do not know how to let loose any speculations of mine on the subject the evil is stated in my opinion as it exists the remedy must be where power wisdom and information i hope are more united with good intentions than they can be with me i have done with this subject i believe forever it has given me many anxious moments for the two last years if a great change is to be made in human affairs the minds of men will be fitted to it the general opinions and feelings will draw that way every fear every hope will forward it and then they who persist in opposing this mighty current in human affairs will appear rather to resist the decrees of providence itself than the mere designs of men they will not be resolute and firm but perverse and obstinate  footnotes  30 see vattel b ii c 4 sect 56 and b iii c 18 sect 296  31 originally called the bengal club but since opened to persons from the other presidencies for the purpose of consolidating the whole indian interest  32 until now they the national assembly have prejudged nothing reserving to themselves a right to appoint a preceptor to the dauphin they did not declare that this child was to reign but only that possibly the constitution might destine him to it they willed that while education should efface from his mind all the prejudices arising from the delusions of the throne respecting his pretended birthright it should also teach him not to forget that it is from the people he is to receive the title of king and that the people do not even possess the right of giving up their power to take it from him  they willed that this education should render him worthy by his knowledge and by his virtues both to receive with submission the dangerous burden of a crown and to resign it with pleasure into the hands of his brethren that he should be conscious that the hastening of that moment when he is to be only a common citizen constitutes the duty and the glory of a king of a free people  they willed that the uselessness of a king the necessity of seeking means to establish something in lieu of a power founded on illusions should be one of the first truths offered to his reason the obligation of conforming himself to this the first of his moral duties and the desire of no longer being freed from the yoke of the law by an injurious inviolability the first and chief sentiment of his heart they are not ignorant that in the present moment the object is less to form a king than to teach him that he should know how to wish no longer to be such     heads for consideration  on the  present state of affairs  written in november 1792   that france by its mere geographical position independently of every other circumstance must affect every state of europe some of them immediately all of them through mediums not very remote  that the standing policy of this kingdom ever has been to watch over the external proceedings of france whatever form the interior government of that kingdom might take and to prevent the extension of its dominion or its ruling influence over other states  that there is nothing in the present internal state of things in france which alters the national policy with regard to the exterior relations of that country  that there are on the contrary many things in the internal circumstances of france and perhaps of this country too which tend to fortify the principles of that fundamental policy and which render the active assertion of those principles more pressing at this than at any former time  that by a change effected in about three weeks france has been able to penetrate into the heart of germany to make an absolute conquest of savoy to menace an immediate invasion of the netherlands and to awe and overbear the whole helvetic body which is in a most perilous situation the great aristocratic cantons having perhaps as much or more to dread from their own people whom they arm but do not choose or dare to employ as from the foreign enemy which against all public faith has butchered their troops serving by treaty in france to this picture it is hardly necessary to add the means by which prance has been enabled to effect all thisnamely the apparently entire destruction of one of the largest and certainly the highest disciplined and best appointed army ever seen headed by the first military sovereign in europe with a captain under him of the greatest renown and that without a blow given or received on any side this state of things seems to me even if it went no further truly serious  circumstances have enabled france to do all this by land on the other element she has begun to exert herself and she must succeed in her designs if enemies very different from those she has hitherto had to encounter do not resist her  she has fitted out a naval force now actually at sea by which she is enabled to give law to the whole mediterranean it is known as a fact and if not so known it is in the nature of things highly probable that she proposes the ravage of the ecclesiastical state and the pillage of rome as her first object that nest she means to bombard naplesto awe to humble and thus to command all italyto force it to a nominal neutrality but to a real dependenceto compel the italian princes and republics to admit the free entrance of the french commerce an open intercourse and the sure concomitant of that intercourse the affiliated societies in a manner similar to those she has established at avignon the comtat chambéry london manchester c c which are so many colonies planted in all these countries for extending the influence and securing the dominion of the french republic  that there never has been hitherto a period in which this kingdom would have suffered a french fleet to domineer in the mediterranean and to force italy to submit to such terms as france would think fit to imposeto say nothing of what has been done upon land in support of the same system the great object for which we preserved minorca whilst we could keep it and for which we still retain gibraltar both at a great expense was and is to prevent the predominance of france over the mediterranean  thus far as to the certain and immediate effect of that armament upon the italian states the probable effect which that armament and the other armaments preparing at toulon and other ports may have upon spain on the side of the mediterranean is worthy of the serious attention of the british councils  that it is most probable we may say in a manner certain that if there should be a rupture between france and spain france will not confine her offensive piratical operations against spain to her efforts in the mediterranean on which side however she may grievously affect spain especially if she excites morocco and algiers which undoubtedly she will to fall upon that power  that she will fit out armaments upon the ocean by which the flota itself may be intercepted and thus the treasures of all europe as well as the largest and surest resources of the spanish monarchy may be conveyed into france and become powerful instruments for the annoyance of all her neighbors  that she makes no secret of her designs  that if the inward and outward bound flota should escape still france has more and better means of dissevering many of the provinces in the west and east indies from the state of spain than holland had when she succeeded in the same attempt the french marine resembles not a little the old armaments of the flibustiers which about a century back in conjunction with pirates of our nation brought such calamities upon the spanish colonies they differ only in thisthat the present piratical force is out of all measure and comparison greater one hundred and fifty ships of the line and frigates being readybuilt most of them in a manner new and all applicable in different ways to that service privateers and moorish corsairs possess not the best seamanship and very little discipline and indeed can make no figure in regular service but in desperate adventures and animated with a lust of plunder they are truly formidable  that the land forces of france are well adapted to concur with their marine in conjunct expeditions of this nature in such expeditions enterprise supplies the want of discipline and perhaps more than supplies it both for this and for other service however contemptible their military is in other respects one arm is extremely good the engineering and artillery branch the old officer corps in both being composed for the greater part of those who were not gentlemen or gentlemen newly such few have abandoned the service and the men are veterans well enough disciplined and very expert in this piratical way they must make war with good advantage they must do so even on the side of flanders either offensively or defensively this shows the difference between the policy of louis the fourteenth who built a wall of brass about his kingdom and that of joseph the second who premeditatedly uncovered his whole frontier  that spain from the actual and expected prevalence of french power is in a most perilous situationperfectly dependent on the mercy of that republic if austria is broken or even humbled she will not dare to dispute its mandates  in the present state of things we have nothing at all to dread from the power of spain by sea or by land or from any rivalry in commerce  that we have much to dread from the connections into which spain may be forced  from the circumstances of her territorial possessions of her resources and the whole of her civil and political state we may be authorized safely and with undoubted confidence to affirm that  spain is not a substantive power  that she must lean on france or on england  that it is as much for the interest of great britain to prevent the predominancy of a french interest in that kingdom as if spain were a province of the crown of great britain or a state actually dependent on itfull as much so as ever portugal was reputed to be this is a dependency of much greater value and its destruction or its being carried to any other dependency of much more serious misfortune  one of these two things must happen either spain must submit to circumstances and take such conditions as france will impose or she must engage in hostilities along with the emperor and the king of sardinia  if spain should be forced or awed into a treaty with the republic of france she must open her ports and her commerce as well as the land communication for the french laborers who were accustomed annually to gather in the harvest in spain indeed she must grant a free communication for travellers and traders through her whole country in that case it is not conjectural it is certain the clubs will give law in the provinces bourgoing or some such miscreant will give law at madrid  in this england may acquiesce if she pleases and france will conclude a triumphant peace with spain under her absolute dependence with a broad highway into that and into every state of europe she actually invites great britain to divide with her the spoils of the new world and to make a partition of the spanish monarchy clearly it is better to do so than to suffer france to possess those spoils and that territory alone which without doubt unresisted by us she is altogether as able as she is willing to do  this plan is proposed by the french in the way in which they propose all their plansand in the only way in which indeed they can propose them where there is no regular communication between his majesty and their republic  what they propose is a plan it is a plan also to resist their predatory project to remain quiet and to suffer them to make their own use of a naval power before our face so as to awe and bully spain into a submissive peace or to drive them into a ruinous war without any measure on our part i fear is no plan at all  however if the plan of coöperation which france desires and which her affiliated societies here ardently wish and are constantly writing up should not be adopted and the war between the emperor and france should continue i think it not at all likely that spain should not be drawn into the quarrel in that case the neutrality of england will be a thing absolutely impossible the time only is the subject of deliberation  then the question will be whether we are to defer putting ourselves into a posture for the common defence either by armament or negotiation or both until spain is actually attackedthat is whether our court will take a decided part for spain whilst spain on her side is yet in a condition to act with whatever degree of vigor she may have whilst that vigor is yet unexhaustedor whether we shall connect ourselves with her broken fortunes after she shall have received material blows and when we shall have the whole slow length of that always unwieldy and illconstructed and then wounded and crippled body to drag after us rather than to aid us whilst our disposition is uncertain spain will not dare to put herself in such a state of defence as will make her hostility formidable or her neutrality respectable  if the decision is such as the solution of this question i take it to be the true question conducts to no time is to be lost but the measures though prompt ought not to be rash and indigested they ought to be well chosen well combined and well pursued the system must be general but it must be executed not successively or with interruption but all together uno flatu in one melting and one mould  for this purpose we must put europe before us which plainly is just now in all its parts in a state of dismay derangement and confusion and very possibly amongst all its sovereigns full of secret heartburning distrust and mutual accusation perhaps it may labor under worse evils there is no vigor anywhere except the distempered vigor and energy of france that country has but too much life in it when everything around is so disposed to tameness and languor the very vices of the french system at home tend to give force to foreign exertions the generals must join the armies they must lead them to enterprise or they are likely to perish by their hands thus without law or government of her own france gives law to all the governments in europe  this great mass of political matter must have been always under the view of thinkers for the public whether they act in office or not amongst events even the late calamitous events were in the book of contingency of course they must have been in design at least provided for a plan which takes in as many as possible of the states concerned will rather tend to facilitate and simplify a rational scheme for preserving spain if that were our sole as i think it ought to be our principal object than to delay and perplex it  if we should think that a provident policy perhaps now more than provident urgent and necessary should lead us to act we cannot take measures as if nothing had been done we must see the faults if any which have conducted to the present misfortunes not for the sake of criticism military or political or from the common motives of blaming persons and counsels which have not been successful but in order if we can to administer some remedy to these disasters by the adoption of plans more bottomed in principle and built on with more discretion mistakes may be lessons  there seem indeed to have been several mistakes in the political principles on which the war was entered into as well as in the plans upon which it was conductedsome of them very fundamental and not only visibly but i may say palpably erroneous and i think him to have less than the discernment of a very ordinary statesman who could not foresee from the very beginning unpleasant consequences from those plans though not the unparalleled disgraces and disasters which really did attend them for they were both principles and measures wholly new and out of the common course without anything apparently very grand in the conception to justify this total departure from all rule  for in the first place the united sovereigns very much injured their cause by admitting that they had nothing to do with the interior arrangements of francein contradiction to the whole tenor of the public law of europe and to the correspondent practice of all its states from the time we have any history of them in this particular the two german courts seem to have as little consulted the publicists of germany as their own true interests and those of all the sovereigns of germany and europe this admission of a false principle in the law of nations brought them into an apparent contradiction when they insisted on the reëstablishment of the royal authority in france but this confused and contradictory proceeding gave rise to a practical error of worse consequence it was derived from one and the same root namely that the person of the monarch of france was everything and the monarchy and the intermediate orders of the state by which the monarchy was upheld were nothing so that if the united potentates had succeeded so far as to reëstablish the authority of that king and that he should be so illadvised as to confirm all the confiscations and to recognize as a lawful body and to class himself with that rabble of murderers and there wanted not persons who would so have advised him there was nothing in the principle or in the proceeding of the united powers to prevent such an arrangement  an expedition to free a brother sovereign from prison was undoubtedly a generous and chivalrous undertaking but the spirit and generosity would not have been less if the policy had been more profound and more comprehensivethat is if it had taken in those considerations and those persons by whom and in some measure for whom monarchy exists this would become a bottom for a system of solid and permanent policy and of operations conformable to that system  the same fruitful error was the cause why nothing was done to impress the people of france so far as we can at all consider the inhabitants of france as a people with an idea that the government was ever to be really french or indeed anything else than the nominal government of a monarch a monarch absolute as over them but whose sole support was to arise from foreign potentates and who was to be kept on his throne by german forcesin short that the king of france was to be a viceroy to the emperor and the king of prussia  it was the first time that foreign powers interfering in the concerns of a nation divided into parties have thought proper to thrust wholly out of their councils to postpone to discountenance to reject and in a manner to disgrace the party whom those powers came to support the single person of a king cannot be a party woe to the king who is himself his party the royal party with the king or his representatives at its head is the royal cause foreign powers have hitherto chosen to give to such wars as this the appearance of a civil contest and not that of an hostile invasion when the spaniards in the sixteenth century sent aids to the chiefs of the league they appeared as allies to that league and to the imprisoned king the cardinal de bourbon which that league had set up when the germans came to the aid of the protestant princes in the same series of civil wars they came as allies when the english came to the aid of henry the fourth they appeared as allies to that prince so did the french always when they intermeddled in the affairs of germany they came to aid a party there when the english and dutch intermeddled in the succession of spain they appeared as allies to the emperor charles the sixth in short the policy has been as uniform as its principles were obvious to an ordinary eye  according to all the old principles of law and policy a regency ought to have been appointed by the french princes of the blood nobles and parliaments and then recognized by the combined powers fundamental law and ancient usage as well as the clear reason of the thing have always ordained it during an imprisonment of the king of france as in the case of john and of francis the first a monarchy ought not to be left a moment without a representative having an interest in the succession the orders of the state ought also to have been recognized in those amongst whom alone they existed in freedom that is in the emigrants  thus laying down a firm foundation on the recognition of the authorities of the kingdom of france according to nature and to its fundamental laws and not according to the novel and inconsiderate principles of the usurpation which the united powers were come to extirpate the king of prussia and the emperor as allies of the ancient kingdom of france would have proceeded with dignity first to free the monarch if possibleif not to secure the monarchy as principal in the design and in order to avoid all risks to that great object the object of other ages than the present and of other countries than that of france they would of course avoid proceeding with more haste or in a different manner than what the nature of such an object required  adopting this the only rational system the rational mode of proceeding upon it was to commence with an effective siege of lisle which the french generals must have seen taken before their faces or be forced to fight a plentiful country of friends from whence to draw supplies would have been behind them a plentiful country of enemies from whence to force supplies would have been before them good towns were always within reach to deposit their hospitals and magazines the march from lisle to paris is through a less defensible country and the distance is hardly so great as from longwy to paris  if the old politic and military ideas had governed the advanced guard would have been formed of those who best knew the country and had some interest in it supported by some of the best light troops and light artillery whilst the grand solid body of an army disciplined to perfection proceeded leisurely and in close connection with all its stores provisions and heavy cannon to support the expedite body in case of misadventure or to improve and complete its success  the direct contrary of all this was put in practice in consequence of the original sin of this project the army of the french princes was everywhere thrown into the rear and no part of it brought forward to the last moment the time of the commencement of the secret negotiation this naturally made an ill impression on the people and furnished an occasion for the rebels at paris to give out that the faithful subjects of the king were distrusted despised and abhorred by his allies the march was directed through a skirt of lorraine and thence into a part of champagne the duke of brunswick leaving all the strongest places behind himleaving also behind him the strength of his artilleryand by this means giving a superiority to the french in the only way in which the present france is able to oppose a german force  in consequence of the adoption of those false politics which turned everything on the kings sole and single person the whole plan of the war was reduced to nothing but a coup de main in order to set that prince at liberty if that failed everything was to be given up  the scheme of a coup de main might under favorable circumstances be very fit for a partisan at the head of a light corps by whose failure nothing material would be deranged but for a royal army of eighty thousand men headed by a king in person who was to march an hundred and fifty miles through an enemys countrysurely this was a plan unheard of  although this plan was not well chosen and proceeded upon principles altogether illjudged and impolitic the superiority of the military force might in a great degree have supplied the defects and furnished a corrective to the mistakes the greater probability was that the duke of brunswick would make his way to paris over the bellies of the rabble of drunkards robbers assassins rioters mutineers and halfgrown boys under the illobeyed command of a theatrical vaporing reduced captain of cavalry who opposed that great commander and great army butdiis aliter visum he began to treatthe winds blew and the rains beatthe house fell because it was built upon sandand great was the fall thereof this march was not an exact copy of either of the two marches made by the duke of parma into france  there is some secret sickness and weather may defeat an army pursuing a wrong plan not that i believe the sickness to have been so great as it has been reported but there is a great deal of superfluous humiliation in this business a perfect prodigality of disgrace some advantage real or imaginary must compensate to a great sovereign and to a great general for so immense a loss of reputation longwy situated as it is might one should think be evacuated without a capitulation with a republic just proclaimed by the king of prussia as an usurping and rebellious body he was not far from luxembourg he might have taken away the obnoxious french in his flight it does not appear to have been necessary that those magistrates who declared for their own king on the faith and under the immediate protection of the king of prussia should be delivered over to the gallows it was not necessary that the emigrant nobility and gentry who served with the king of prussias army under his immediate command should be excluded from the cartel and given up to be hanged as rebels never was so gross and so cruel a breach of the public faith not with an enemy but with a friend dumouriez has dropped very singular hints custine has spoken out more broadly these accounts have never been contradicted they tend to make an eternal rupture between the powers the french have given out that the duke of brunswick endeavored to negotiate some name and place for the captive king amongst the murderers and proscribers of those who have lost their all for his cause even this has not been denied  it is singular and indeed a thing under all its circumstances inconceivable that everything should by the emperor be abandoned to the king of prussia that monarch was considered as principal in the nature of things as well as in his position with regard to the war he was only an ally and a new ally with crossing interests in many particulars and of a policy rather uncertain at best and supposing him to act with the greatest fidelity the emperor and the empire to him must be but secondary objects countries out of germany must affect him in a still more remote manner france other than from the fear of its doctrinal principles can to him be no object at all accordingly the rhine sardinia and the swiss are left to their fate the king of prussia has no direct and immediate concern with france consequentially to be sure a great deal but the emperor touches france directly in many parts he is a near neighbor to sardinia by his milanese territories he borders on switzerland cologne possessed by his uncle is between mentz treves and the king of prussias territories on the lower rhine the emperor is the natural guardian of italy and germanythe natural balance against the ambition of france whether republican or monarchical his ministers and his generals therefore ought to have had their full share in every material consultationwhich i suspect they had not if he has no minister capable of plans of policy which comprehend the superintendency of a war or no general with the least of a political head things have been as they must be however in all the parts of this strange proceeding there must be a secret  it is probably known to ministers i do not mean to penetrate into it my speculations on this head must be only conjectural if the king of prussia under the pretext or on the reality of some information relative to ill practice on the part of the court of vienna takes advantage of his being admitted into the heart of the emperors dominions in the character of an ally afterwards to join the common enemy and to enable france to seize the netherlands and to reduce and humble the empire i cannot conceive upon every principle anything more alarming for this country separately and as a part of the general system after all we may be looking in vain in the regions of politics for what is only the operation of temper and character upon accidental circumstances but i never knew accidents to decide the whole of any great business and i never knew temper to act but that some system of politics agreeable to its peculiar spirit was blended with it strengthened it and got strength from it therefore the politics can hardly be put out of the question  great mistakes have been committed at least i hope so if there have been none the case in future is desperate i have endeavored to point out some of those which have occurred to me and most of them very early  whatever may be the cause of the present state of things on a full and mature view and comparison of the historical matter of the transactions that have passed before our eyes and of the future prospect i think i am authorized to form an opinion without the least hesitation  that there never was nor is nor ever will be nor ever can be the least rational hope of making an impression on france by any continental powers if england is not a part is not the directing part is not the soul of the whole confederacy against it  this so far as it is an anticipation of future is grounded on the whole tenor of former history in speculation it is to be accounted for on two plain principles  first that great britain is likely to take a more fair and equal part in the alliance than the other powers as having less of crossing interest or perplexed discussion with any of them  secondly because france cannot have to deal with any of these continental sovereigns without their feeling that nation as a maritime power greatly superior to them all put togethera force which is only to be kept in check by england  england except during the eccentric aberration of charles the second has always considered it as her duty and interest to take her place in such a confederacy her chief disputes must ever be with france and if england shows herself indifferent and unconcerned when these powers are combined against the enterprises of france she is to look with certainty for the same indifference on the part of these powers when she may be at war with that nation this will tend totally to disconnect this kingdom from the system of europe in which if she ought not rashly to meddle she ought never wholly to withdraw herself from it  if then england is put in motion whether by a consideration of the general safety or of the influence of france upon spain or by the probable operations of this new system on the netherlands it must embrace in its project the whole as much as possible and the part it takes ought to be as much as possible a leading and presiding part  i therefore beg leave to suggest  first that a minister should forthwith be sent to spain to encourage that court to persevere in the measures they have adopted against franceto make a close alliance and guaranty of possessions as against france with that powerand whilst the formality of the treaty is pending to assure them of our protection postponing any lesser disputes to another occasion  secondly to assure the court of vienna of our desire to enter into our ancient connections with her and to support her effectually in the war which france has declared against her  thirdly to animate the swiss and the king of sardinia to take a part as the latter once did on the principles of the grand alliance  fourthly to put an end to our disputes with russia and mutually to forget the past i believe if she is satisfied of this oblivion she will return to her old sentiments with regard to this court and will take a more forward part in this business than any other power  fifthly if what has happened to the king of prussia is only in consequence of a sort of panic or of levity and an indisposition to persevere long in one design the support and concurrence of russia will tend to steady him and to give him resolution if he be illdisposed with that power on his back and without one ally in europe i conceive he will not be easily led to derange the plan  sixthly to use the joint influence of our court and of our then allied powers with holland to arm as fully as she can by sea and to make some addition by land  seventhly to acknowledge the king of frances next brother assisted by such a council and such representatives of the kingdom of france as shall be thought proper regent of france and to send that prince a small supply of money arms clothing and artillery  eighthly to give force to these negotiations an instant naval armament ought to be adoptedone squadron for the mediterranean another for the channel the season is convenientmost of our trade being as i take it at home  after speaking of a plan formed upon the ancient policy and practice of great britain and of europe to which this is exactly conformable in every respect with no deviation whatsoever and which is i conceive much more strongly called for by the present circumstances than by any former i must take notice of another which i hear but cannot persuade myself to believe is in agitation this plan is grounded upon the very same view of things which is here statednamely the danger to all sovereigns and old republics from the prevalence of french power and influence  it is to form a congress of all the european powers for the purpose of a general defensive alliance the objects of which should be  first the recognition of this new republic which they well know is formed on the principles and for the declared purpose of the destruction of all kings and whenever the heads of this new republic shall consent to release the royal captives to make peace with them  secondly to defend themselves with their joint forces against the open aggressions or the secret practices intrigues and writings which are used to propagate the french principles  it is easy to discover from whose shop this commodity comes it is so perfectly absurd that if that or anything like it meets with a serious entertainment in any cabinet i should think it the effect of what is called a judicial blindness the certain forerunner of the destruction of all crowns and kingdoms  an offensive alliance in which union is preserved by common efforts in common dangers against a common active enemy may preserve its consistency and may produce for a given time some considerable effect though this is not easy and for any very long period can hardly be expected but a defensive alliance formed of long discordant interests with innumerable discussions existing having no one pointed object to which it is directed which is to be held together with an unremitted vigilance as watchful in peace as in war is so evidently impossible is such a chimera is so contrary to human nature and the course of human affairs that i am persuaded no person in his senses except those whose country religion and sovereign are deposited in the french funds could dream of it there is not the slightest petty boundary suit no difference between a family arrangement no sort of misunderstanding or cross purpose between the pride and etiquette of courts that would not entirely disjoint this sort of alliance and render it as futile in its effects as it is feeble in its principle but when we consider that the main drift of that defensive alliance must be to prevent the operation of intrigue mischievous doctrine and evil example in the success of unprovoked rebellion regicide and systematic assassination and massacre the absurdity of such a scheme becomes quite lamentable open the communication with france and the rest follows of course  how far the interior circumstances of this country support what is said with regard to its foreign polities must be left to bettor judgments i am sure the french faction here is infinitely strengthened by the success of the assassins on the other side of the water this evil in the heart of europe must be extirpated from that centre or no part of the circumference can be free from the mischief which radiates from it and which will spread circle beyond circle in spite of all the little defensive precautions which can be employed against it  i do not put my name to these hints submitted to the consideration of reflecting men it is of too little importance to suppose the name of the writer could add any weight to the state of things contained in this paper that state of things presses irresistibly on my judgment and it lies and has long lain with a heavy weight upon my mind i cannot think that what is done in france is beneficial to the human race if it were the english constitution ought no more to stand against it than the ancient constitution of the kingdom in which the new system prevails i thought it the duty of a man not unconcerned for the public and who is a faithful subject to the king respectfully to submit this state of facts at this new step in the progress of the french arms and politics to his majesty to his confidential servants and to those persons who though not in office by their birth their rank their fortune their character and their reputation for wisdom seem to me to have a large stake in the stability of the ancient order of things  bath november 5 1792     remarks  on  the policy of the allies  with respect to france  begun in october 1793     on the policy of the allies   as the proposed manifesto is i understand to promulgate to the world the general idea of a plan for the regulation of a great kingdom and through the regulation of that kingdom probably to decide the fate of europe forever nothing requires a more serious deliberation with regard to the time of making it the circumstances of those to whom it is addressed and the matter it is to contain  as to the time with the due diffidence in my own opinion i have some doubts whether it is not rather unfavorable to the issuing any manifesto with regard to the intended government of france and for this reason that it is upon the principal point of our attack a time of calamity and defeat manifestoes of this nature are commonly made when the army of some sovereign enters into the enemys country in great force and under the imposing authority of that force employs menaces towards those whom he desires to awe and makes promises to those whom he wishes to engage in his favor  as to a party what has been done at toulon leaves no doubt that the party for which we declare must be that which substantially declares for royalty as the basis of the government  as to menaces nothing in my opinion can contribute more effectually to lower any sovereign in the public estimation and to turn his defeats into disgraces than to threaten in a moment of impotence the second manifesto of the duke of brunswick appeared therefore to the world to be extremely illtimed however if his menaces in that manifesto had been seasonable they were not without an object great crimes then apprehended and great evils then impending were to be prevented at this time every act which early menaces might possibly have prevented is done punishment and vengeance alone remainand god forbid that they should ever be forgotten but the punishment of enormous offenders will not be the less severe or the less exemplary when it is not threatened at a moment when we have it not in our power to execute our threats on the other side to pass by proceedings of such a nefarious nature in all kinds as have been carried on in france without any signification of resentment would be in effect to ratify them and thus to become accessaries after the fact in all those enormities which it is impossible to repeat or think of without horror an absolute silence appears to me to be at this time the only safe course  the second usual matter of manifestoes is composed of promises to those who cooperate with our designs these promises depend in a great measure if not wholly on the apparent power of the person who makes them to fulfil his engagements a time of disaster on the part of the promiser seems not to add much to the dignity of his person or to the effect of his offers one would hardly wish to seduce any unhappy persons to give the last provocation to a merciless tyranny without very effectual means of protecting them  the time therefore seems as i said not favorable to a general manifesto on account of the unpleasant situation of our affairs however i write in a changing scene when a measure very imprudent today may be very proper tomorrow some great victory may alter the whole state of the question so far as it regards our power of fulfilling any engagement we may think fit to make  but there is another consideration of far greater importance for all the purposes of this manifesto the public and the parties concerned will look somewhat to the disposition of the promiser indicated by his conduct as well as to his power of fulfilling his engagements  speaking of this nation as part of a general combination of powers are we quite sure that others can believe us to be sincere or that we can be even fully assured of our own sincerity in the protection of those who shall risk their lives for the restoration of monarchy in france when the world sees that those who are the natural legal constitutional representatives of that monarchy if it has any have not had their names so much as mentioned in any one public act that in no way whatever are their persons brought forward that their rights have not been expressly or implicitly allowed and that they have not been in the least consulted on the important interests they have at stake on the contrary they are kept in a state of obscurity and contempt and in a degree of indigence at times bordering on beggary they are in fact little less prisoners in the village of hanau than the royal captives who are locked up in the tower of the temple what is this according to the common indications which guide the judgment of mankind but under the pretext of protecting the crown of france in reality to usurp it  i am also very apprehensive that there are other circumstances which must tend to weaken the force of our declarations no partiality to the allied powers can prevent great doubts on the fairness of our intentions as supporters of the crown of france or of the true principles of legitimate government in opposition to jacobinism when it is visible that the two leading orders of the state of france who are now the victims and who must always be the true and sole supports of monarchy in that country are at best in some of their descriptions considered only as objects of charity and others are when employed employed only as mercenary soldiersthat they are thrown back out of all reputable service are in a manner disowned considered as nothing in their own cause and never once consulted in the concerns of their king their country their laws their religion and their property we even affect to be ashamed of them in all our proceedings we carefully avoid the appearance of being of a party with them in all our ideas of treaty we do not regard them as what they are the two leading orders of the kingdom if we do not consider them in that light we must recognize the savages by whom they have been ruined and who have declared war upon europe whilst they disgrace and persecute human nature and openly defy the god that made them as real proprietors of france  i am much afraid too that we shall scarcely be believed fair supporters of lawful monarchy against jacobinism so long as we continue to make and to observe cartels with the jacobins and on fair terms exchange prisoners with them whilst the royalists invited to our standard and employed under our public faith against the jacobins if taken by that savage faction are given up to the executioner without the least attempt whatsoever at reprisal for this we are to look at the king of prussias conduct compared with his manifestoes about a twelvemonth ago for this we are to look at the capitulations of mentz and valenciennes made in the course of the present campaign by those two capitulations the christian royalists were excluded from any participation in the cause of the combined powers they were considered as the outlaws of europe two armies were in effect sent against them one of those armies that which surrendered mentz was very near overpowering the christians of poitou and the other that which surrendered at valenciennes has actually crushed the people whom oppression and despair had driven to resistance at lyons has massacred several thousands of them in cold blood pillaged the whole substance of the place and pursued their rage to the very houses condemning that noble city to desolation in the unheardof manner we have seen it devoted  it is then plain by a conduct which overturns a thousand declarations that we take the royalists of france only as an instrument of some convenience in a temporary hostility with the jacobins but that we regard those atheistic and murderous barbarians as the bonâ fide possessors of the soil of france it appears at least that we consider them as a fair government de facto if not de jure a resistance to which in favor of the king of prance by any man who happened to be born within that country might equitably be considered by other nations as the crime of treason  for my part i would sooner put my hand into the fire than sign an invitation to oppressed men to fight under my standard and then on every sinister event of war cruelly give them up to be punished as the basest of traitors as long as i had one of the common enemy in my hands to be put to death in order to secure those under my protection and to vindicate the common honor of sovereigns we hear nothing of this kind of security in favor of those whom we invite to the support of our cause without it i am not a little apprehensive that the proclamations of the combined powers might contrary to their intention no doubt be looked upon as frauds and cruel traps laid for their lives  so far as to the correspondence between our declarations and our conduct let the declaration be worded as it will the conduct is the practical comment by which and which alone it can be understood this conduct acting on the declaration leaves a monarchy without a monarch and without any representative or trustee for the monarch and the monarchy it supposes a kingdom without states and orders a territory without proprietors and faithful subjects who are to be left to the fate of rebels and traitors  the affair of the establishment of a government is a very difficult undertaking for foreign powers to act in as principals though as auxiliaries and mediators it has been not at all unusual and may be a measure full of policy and humanity and true dignity  the first thing we ought to do supposing us not giving the law as conquerors but acting as friendly powers applied to for counsel and assistance in the settlement of a distracted country is well to consider the composition nature and temper of its objects and particularly of those who actually do or who ought to exercise power in that state it is material to know who they are and how constituted whom we consider as the people of france  the next consideration is through whom our arrangements are to be made and on what principles the government we propose is to be established  the first question on the people is this whether we are to consider the individuals now actually in france numerically taken and arranged into jacobin clubs as the body politic constituting the nation of franceor whether we consider the original individual proprietors of lands expelled since the revolution and the states and the bodies politic such as the colleges of justice called parliaments the corporations noble and not noble of bailliages and towns and cities the bishops and the clergy as the true constituent parts of the nation and forming the legally organized parts of the people of france  in this serious concern it is very necessary that we should have the most distinct ideas annexed to the terms we employ because it is evident that an abuse of the term people has been the original fundamental cause of those evils the cure of which by war and policy is the present object of all the states of europe  if we consider the acting power in prance in any legal construction of public law as the people the question is decided in favor of the republic one and indivisible but we have decided for monarchy if so we have a king and subjects and that king and subjects have rights and privileges which ought to be supported at home for i do not suppose that the government of that kingdom can or ought to be regulated by the arbitrary mandate of a foreign confederacy  as to the faction exercising power to suppose that monarchy can be supported by principled regicides religion by professed atheists order by clubs of jacobins property by committees of proscription and jurisprudence by revolutionary tribunals is to be sanguine in a degree of which i am incapable on them i decide for myself that these persons are not the legal corporation of france and that it is not with them we can if we would settle the government of france  since then we have decided for monarchy in that kingdom we ought also to settle who is to be the monarch who is to be the guardian of a minor and how the monarch and monarchy is to be modified and supported if the monarch is to be elected who the electors are to beif hereditary what order is established corresponding with an hereditary monarchy and fitted to maintain it who are to modify it in its exercise who are to restrain its powers where they ought to be limited to strengthen them where they are to be supported or to enlarge them where the object the time and the circumstances may demand their extension these are things which in the outline ought to be made distinct and clear for if they are not especially with regard to those great points who are the proprietors of the soil and what is the corporation of the kingdom there is nothing to hinder the complete establishment of a jacobin republic such as that formed in 1790 and 1791 under the name of a démocratie royale jacobinism does not consist in the having or not having a certain pageant under the name of a king but in taking the people as equal individuals without any corporate name or description without attention to property without division of powers and forming the government of delegates from a number of men so constitutedin destroying or confiscating property and bribing the public creditors or the poor with the spoils now of one part of the community now of another without regard to prescription or possession  i hope no one can be so very blind as to imagine that monarchy can be acknowledged and supported in france upon any other basis than that of its property corporate and individualor that it can enjoy a moments permanence or security upon any scheme of things which sets aside all the ancient corporate capacities and distinctions of the kingdom and subverts the whole fabric of its ancient laws and usages political civil and religious to introduce a system founded on the supposed rights of man and the absolute equality of the human race unless therefore we declare clearly and distinctly in favor of the restoration of property and confide to the hereditary property of the kingdom the limitation and qualifications of its hereditary monarchy the blood and treasure of europe is wasted for the establishment of jacobinism in france there is no doubt that danton and robespierre chaumette and barère that condorcet that thomas paine that la fayette and the exbishop of autun the abbé grégoire with all the gang of the sieyèses the henriots and the santerres if they could secure themselves in the fruits of their rebellion and robbery would be perfectly indifferent whether the most unhappy of all infants whom by the lessons of the shoemaker his governor and guardian they are training up studiously and methodically to be an idiot or what is worse the most wicked and base of mankind continues to receive his civic education in the temple or the tuileries whilst they and such as they really govern the kingdom  it cannot be too often and too strongly inculcated that monarchy and property must in france go together or neither can exist to think of the possibility of the existence of a permanent and hereditary royalty where nothing else is hereditary or permanent in point either of personal or corporate dignity is a ruinous chimera worthy of the abbé sieyès and those wicked fools his associates who usurped power by the murders of the 19th of july and the 6th of october 1789 and who brought forth the monster which they called démocratie royale or the constitution  i believe that most thinking men would prefer infinitely some sober and sensible form of a republic in which there was no mention at all of a king but which held out some reasonable security to property life and personal freedom to a scheme of tilings like this démocratie royale founded on impiety immorality fraudulent currencies the confiscation of innocent individuals and the pretended rights of manand which in effect excluding the whole body of the nobility clergy and landed property of a great nation threw everything into the hands of a desperate set of obscure adventurers who led to every mischief a blind and bloody band of sansculottes at the head or rather at the tail of this system was a miserable pageant as its ostensible instrument who was to be treated with every species of indignity till the moment when he was conveyed from the palace of contempt to the dungeon of horror and thence led by a brewer of his capital through the applauses of an hired frantic drunken multitude to lose his head upon a scaffold  this is the constitution or démocratie royale and this is what infallibly would be again set up in france to run exactly the same round if the predominant power should so far be forced to submit as to receive the name of a king leaving it to the jacobins that is to those who have subverted royalty and destroyed property to modify the one and to distribute the other as spoil by the jacobins i mean indiscriminately the brissotins and the maratists knowing no sort of difference between them as to any other party none exists in that unhappy country the royalists those in poitou excepted are banished and extinguished and as to what they call the constitutionalists or democrates royaux they never had an existence of the smallest degree of power consideration or authority nor if they differ at all from the rest of the atheistic banditti which from their actions and principles i have no reason to think were they ever any other than the temporary tools and instruments of the more determined able and systematic regicides several attempts have been made to support this chimerical démocratie royale the first was by la fayette the last by dumouriez they tended only to show that this absurd project had no party to support it the girondists under wimpfen and at bordeaux have made some struggle the constitutionalists never could make any and for a very plain reason they were leaders in rebellion all their principles and their whole scheme of government being republican they could never excite the smallest degree of enthusiasm in favor of the unhappy monarch whom they had rendered contemptible to make him the executive officer in their new commonwealth they only appeared as traitors to their own jacobin cause not as faithful adherents to the king  in an address to france in an attempt to treat with it or in considering any scheme at all relative to it it is impossible we should mean the geographical we must always mean the moral and political country i believe we shall be in a great error if we act upon an idea that there exists in that country any organized body of men who might be willing to treat on equitable terms for the restoration of their monarchy but who are nice in balancing those terms and who would accept such as to them appeared reasonable but who would quietly submit to the predominant power if they were not gratified in the fashion of some constitution which suited with their fancies  sidenote no individual influence civil or military  i take the state of france to be totally different i know of no such body and of no such party so far from a combination of twenty men always excepting poitou i never yet heard that a single man could be named of sufficient force or influence to answer for another man much less for the smallest district in the country or for the most incomplete company of soldiers in the army we see every man that the jacobins choose to apprehend taken up in his village or in his house and conveyed to prison without the least shadow of resistanceand this indifferently whether he is suspected of royalism or federalism moderantism democracy royal or any other of the names of faction which they start by the hour what is much more astonishing and if we did not carefully attend to the genius and circumstances of this revolution must indeed appear incredible all their most accredited military men from a generalissimo to a corporal may be arrested each in the midst of his camp and covered with the laurels of accumulated victories tied neck and heels thrown into a cart and sent to paris to be disposed of at the pleasure of the revolutionary tribunals  sidenote no corporations of justice commerce or police  as no individuals have power and influence so there are no corporations whether of lawyers or burghers existing the assembly called constituent destroyed all such institutions very early the primary and secondary assemblies by their original constitution were to be dissolved when they answered the purpose of electing the magistrates and were expressly disqualified from performing any corporate act whatsoever the transient magistrates have been almost all removed before the expiration of their terms and new have been lately imposed upon the people without the form or ceremony of an election these magistrates during their existence are put under as all the executive authorities are from first to last the popular societies called jacobin clubs of the several countries and this by an express order of the national convention it is even made a case of death to oppose or attack those clubs they too have been lately subjected to an expurgatory scrutiny to drive out from them everything savoring of what they call the crime of moderantism of which offence however few were guilty but as people began to take refuge from their persecutions amongst themselves they have driven them from that last asylum  the state of france is perfectly simple it consists of but two descriptionsthe oppressors and the oppressed  the first has the whole authority of the state in their handsall the arms all the revenues of the public all the confiscations of individuals and corporations they have taken the lower sort from their occupations and have put them into pay that they may form them into a body of janizaries to overrule and awe property the heads of these wretches they never suffer to cool they supply them with a food for fury varied by the daybesides the sensual state of intoxication from which they are rarely free they have made the priests and people formally abjure the divinity they have estranged them from every civil moral and social or even natural and instinctive sentiment habit and practice and have rendered them systematically savages to make it impossible for them to be the instruments of any sober and virtuous arrangement or to be reconciled to any state of order under any name whatsoever  the other descriptionthe oppressedare people of some property they are the small relics of the persecuted landed interest they are the burghers and the farmers by the very circumstance of their being of some property though numerous in some points of view they cannot be very considerable as a number in cities the nature of their occupations renders them domestic and feeble in the country it confines them to their farm for subsistence the national guards are all changed and reformed everything suspicious in the description of which they were composed is rigorously disarmed committees called of vigilance and safety are everywhere formed a most severe and scrutinizing inquisition far more rigid than anything ever known or imagined two persons cannot meet and confer without hazard to their liberty and even to their lives numbers scarcely credible have been executed and their property confiscated at paris and in most other towns the bread they buy is a daily dolewhich they cannot obtain without a daily ticket delivered to them by their masters multitudes of all ages and sexes are actually imprisoned i have reason to believe that in france there are not for various state crimes so few as twenty thousand33 actually in jaila large proportion of people of property in any state if a father of a family should show any disposition to resist or to withdraw himself from their power his wife and children are cruelly to answer for it it is by means of these hostages that they keep the troops which they force by masses as they call it into the field true to their colors  another of their resources is not to be forgotten they have lately found a way of giving a sort of ubiquity to the supreme sovereign authority which no monarch has been able yet to give to any representation of his  the commissioners of the national convention who are the members of the convention itself and really exercise all its powers make continual circuits through every province and visits to every army there they supersede all the ordinary authorities civil and military and change and alter everything at their pleasure so that in effect no deliberative capacity exists in any portion of the inhabitants  toulon republican in principle having taken its decision in a moment under the guillotine and before the arrival of these commissionerstoulon being a place regularly fortified and having in its bosom a navy in part highly discontented has escaped though by a sort of miracle and it would not have escaped if two powerful fleets had not been at the door to give them not only strong but prompt and immediate succor especially as neither this nor any other seaport town in france can be depended on from the peculiarly savage dispositions manners and connections among the lower sort of people in those places this i take to be the true state of things in france so far as it regards any existing bodies whether of legal or voluntary association capable of acting or of treating in corps  as to the oppressed individuals they are many and as discontented as men must be under the monstrous and complicated tyranny of all sorts with which they are crushed they want no stimulus to throw off this dreadful yoke but they do want not manifestoes which they have had even to surfeit but real protection force and succor  the disputes and questions of men at their ease do not at all affect their minds or ever can occupy the minds of men in their situation these theories are long since gone by they have had their day and have done their mischief the question is not between the rabble of systems fayettism condorcetism monarchism or democratism or federalism on the one side and the fundamental laws of france on the otheror between all these systems amongst themselves it is a controversy weak indeed and unequal on the one part between the proprietor and the robber between the prisoner and the jailer between the neck and the guillotine four fifths of the french inhabitants would thankfully take protection from the emperor of morocco and would never trouble their heads about the abstract principles of the power by which they were snatched from imprisonment robbery and murder but then these men can do little or nothing for themselves they have no arms nor magazines nor chiefs nor union nor the possibility of these things within themselves on the whole therefore i lay it down as a certainty that in the jacobins no change of mind is to be expected and that no others in the territory of france have an independent and deliberative existence  the truth is that france is out of itselfthe moral france is separated from the geographical the master of the house is expelled and the robbers are in possession if we look for the corporate people of france existing as corporate in the eye and intention of public law that corporate people i mean who are free to deliberate and to decide and who have a capacity to treat and conclude they are in flanders and germany in switzerland spain italy and england there are all the princes of the blood there are all the orders of the state there are all the parliaments of the kingdom  this being as i conceive the true state of france as it exists territorially and as it exists morally the question will be with whom we are to concert our arrangements and whom we are to use as our instruments in the reduction in the pacification and in the settlement of france the work to be done must indicate the workmen supposing us to have national objects we have two principal and one secondary the first two are so intimately connected as not to be separated even in thought the reëstablishment of royalty and the reëstablishment of property one would think it requires not a great deal of argument to prove that the most serious endeavors to restore royalty will be made by royalists property will be most energetically restored by the ancient proprietors of that kingdom  when i speak of royalists i wish to be understood of those who were always such from principle every arm lifted up for royalty from the beginning was the arm of a man so principled i do not think there are ten exceptions  the principled royalists are certainly not of force to effect these objects by themselves if they were the operations of the present great combination would be wholly unnecessary what i contend for is that they should be consulted with treated with and employed and that no foreigners whatsoever are either in interest so engaged or in judgment and local knowledge so competent to answer all these purposes as the natural proprietors of the country  their number for an exiled party is also considerable almost the whole body of the landed proprietors of france ecclesiastical and civil have been steadily devoted to the monarchy this body does not amount to less than seventy thousanda very great number in the composition of the respectable classes in any society i am sure that if half that number of the same description were taken out of this country it would leave hardly anything that i should call the people of england on the faith of the emperor and the king of prussia a body of ten thousand nobility on horseback with the kings two brothers at their head served with the king of prussia in the campaign of 1792 and equipped themselves with the last shilling of their ruined fortunes and exhausted credit34 it is not now the question how that great force came to be rendered useless and totally dissipated i state it now only to remark that a great part of the same force exists and would act if it were enabled i am sure everything has shown us that in this war with france one frenchman is worth twenty foreigners la vendée is a proof of this  if we wish to make an impression on the minds of any persons in france or to persuade them to join our standard it is impossible that they should not be more easily led and more readily formed and disciplined civilly and martially disciplined by those who speak their language who are acquainted with their manners who are conversant with their usages and habits of thinking and who have a local knowledge of their country and some remains of ancient credit and consideration than with a body congregated from all tongues and tribes where none of the respectable native interests are seen in the transaction it is impossible that any declarations can convince those that are within or those that are without that anything else than some sort of hostility in the style of a conqueror is meant at best it will appear to such wavering persons if such there are whom we mean to fix with us a choice whether they are to continue a prey to domestic banditti or to be fought for as a carrion carcass and picked to the bone by all the crows and vultures of the sky they may take protection and they would i doubt not but they can have neither alacrity nor zeal in such a cause when they see nothing but bands of english spaniards neapolitans sardinians prussians austrians hungarians bohemians slavonians croatians acting as principals it is impossible they should think we come with a beneficent design many of those fierce and barbarous people have already given proofs how little they regard any french party whatsoever some of these nations the people of france are jealous of such are the english and the spaniardsothers they despise such are the italiansothers they hate and dread such are the german and danubian powers at best such interposition of ancient enemies excites apprehension but in this case how can they suppose that we come to maintain their legitimate monarchy in a truly paternal french government to protect their privileges their laws their religion and their property when they see us make use of no one person who has any interest in them any knowledge of them or any the least zeal for them on the contrary they see that we do not suffer any of those who have shown a zeal in that cause which we seem to make our own to come freely into any place in which the allies obtain any footing  if we wish to gain upon any people it is right to see what it is they expect we have had a proposal from the royalists of poitou they are well entitled after a bloody war maintained for eight months against all the powers of anarchy to speak the sentiments of the royalists of france do they desire us to exclude their princes their clergy their nobility the direct contrary they earnestly solicit that men of every one of these descriptions should be sent to them they do not call for english austrian or prussian officers they call for french emigrant officers they call for the exiled priests they have demanded the comte dartois to appear at their head these are the demands quite natural demands of those who are ready to follow the standard of monarchy  the great means therefore of restoring the monarchy which we have made the main object of the war is to assist the dignity the religion and the property of france to repossess themselves of the means of their natural influence this ought to be the primary object of all our politics and all our military operations otherwise everything will move in a preposterous order and nothing but confusion and destruction will follow  i know that misfortune is not made to win respect from ordinary minds i know that there is a leaning to prosperity however obtained and a prejudice in its favor i know there is a disposition to hope something from the variety and inconstancy of villany rather than from the tiresome uniformity of fixed principle there have been i admit situations in which a guiding person or party might be gained over and through him or them the whole body of a nation for the hope of such a conversion and of deriving advantage from enemies it might be politic for a while to throw your friends into the shade but examples drawn from history in occasions like the present will be found dangerously to mislead us france has no resemblance to other countries which have undergone troubles and been purified by them if france jacobinized as it has been for four full years did contain any bodies of authority and disposition to treat with you most assuredly she does not such is the levity of those who have expelled everything respectable in their country such their ferocity their arrogance their mutinous spirit their habits of defying everything human and divine that no engagement would hold with them for three months nor indeed could they cohere together for any purpose of civilized society if left as they now are there must be a means not only of breaking their strength within themselves but of civilizing them and these two things must go together before we can possibly treat with them not only as a nation but with any division of them descriptions of men of their own race but better in rank superior in property and decorum of honorable decent and orderly habits are absolutely necessary to bring them to such a frame as to qualify them so much as to come into contact with a civilized nation a set of those ferocious savages with arms in their hands left to themselves in one part of the country whilst you proceed to another would break forth into outrages at least as bad as their former they must as fast as gained if ever they are gained be put under the guide direction and government of better frenchmen than themselves or they will instantly relapse into a fever of aggravated jacobinism  we must not judge of other parts of france by the temporary submission of toulon with two vast fleets in its harbor and a garrison far more numerous than all the inhabitants able to bear arms if they were left to themselves i am quite sure they would not retain their attachment to monarchy of any name for a single week  to administer the only cure for the unheardof disorders of that undone country i think it infinitely happy for us that god has given into our hands more effectual remedies than human contrivance could point out we have in our bosom and in the bosom of other civilized states nearer forty than thirty thousand persons providentially preserved not only from the cruelty and violence but from the contagion of the horrid practices sentiments and language of the jacobins and even sacredly guarded from the view of such abominable scenes if we should obtain in any considerable district a footing in france we possess an immense body of physicians and magistrates of the mind whom we now know to be the most discreet gentle welltempered conciliatory virtuous and pious persons who in any order probably existed in the world you will have a missioner of peace and order in every parish never was a wiser national economy than in the charity of the english and of other countries never was money better expended than in the maintenance of this body of civil troops for reëstablishing order in france and for thus securing its civilization to europe this means if properly used is of value inestimable  nor is this corps of instruments of civilization confined to the first order of that statei mean the clergy the allied powers possess also an exceedingly numerous wellinformed sensible ingenious highprincipled and spirited body of cavaliers in the expatriated landed interest of france as well qualified at least as i who have been taught by time and experience to moderate my calculation of the expectancy of human abilities ever expected to see in the body of any landed gentlemen and soldiers by their birth france is well winnowed and sifted its virtuous men are i believe amongst the most virtuous as its wicked are amongst the most abandoned upon earth whatever in the territory of france may be found to be in the middle between these must be attracted to the better part this will be compassed when every gentleman everywhere being restored to his landed estate each on his patrimonial ground may join the clergy in reanimating the loyalty fidelity and religion of the peoplethat these gentlemen proprietors of land may sort that people according to the trust they severally merit that they may arm the honest and wellaffected and disarm and disable the factious and illdisposed no foreigner can make this discrimination nor these arrangements the ancient corporations of burghers according to their several modes should be restored and placed as they ought to be in the hands of men of gravity and property in the cities or bailliages according to the proper constitutions of the commons or third estate of france they will restrain and regulate the seditious rabble there as the gentlemen will on their own estates in this way and in this way alone the country once broken in upon by foreign force well directed may be gained and settled it must be gained and settled by itself and through the medium of its own native dignity and property it is not honest it is not decent still less is it politic for foreign powers themselves to attempt anything in this minute internal local detail in which they could show nothing but ignorance imbecility confusion and oppression as to the prince who has a just claim to exercise the regency of france like other men he is not without his faults and his defects but faults or defects always supposing them faults of common human infirmity are not what in any country destroy a legal title to government these princes are kept in a poor obscure country town of the king of prussias their reputation is entirely at the mercy of every calumniator they cannot show themselves they cannot explain themselves as princes ought to do after being well informed as any man here can be i do not find that these blemishes in this eminent person are at all considerable or that they at all affect a character which is full of probity honor generosity and real goodness in some points he has but too much resemblance to his unfortunate brother who with all his weaknesses had a good understanding and many parts of an excellent man and a good king but monsieur without supposing the other deficient as he was not excels him in general knowledge and in a sharp and keen observation with something of a better address and an happier mode of speaking and of writing his conversation is open agreeable and informed his manners gracious and princely his brother the comte dartois sustains still better the representation of his place he is eloquent lively engaging in the highest degree of a decided character full of energy and activity in a word he is a brave honorable and accomplished cavalier their brethren of royalty if they were true to their own cause and interest instead of relegating these illustrious persons to an obscure town would bring them forward in their courts and camps and exhibit them to what they would speedily obtain the esteem respect and affection of mankind  sidenote objection made to the regents endeavor to go to spain  as to their knocking at every door which seems to give offence can anything be more natural abandoned despised rendered in a manner outlaws by all the powers of europe who have treated their unfortunate brethren with all the giddy pride and improvident insolence of blind unfeeling prosperity who did not even send them a compliment of condolence on the murder of their brother and sister in such a state is it to be wondered at or blamed that they tried every way likely or unlikely well or ill chosen to get out of the horrible pit into which they are fallen and that in particular they tried whether the princes of their own blood might at length be brought to think the cause of kings and of kings of their race wounded in the murder and exile of the branch of france of as much importance as the killing of a brace of partridges if they were absolutely idle and only eat in sloth their bread of sorrow and dependence they would be forgotten or at best thought of as wretches unworthy of their pretensions which they had done nothing to support if they err from our interests what care has been taken to keep them in those interests or what desire has ever been shown to employ them in any other way than as instruments of their own degradation shame and ruin  the parliament of paris by whom the title of the regent is to be recognized not made according to the laws of the kingdom is ready to recognize it and to register it if a place of meeting was given to them which might be within their own jurisdiction supposing that only locality was required for the exercise of their functions for it is one of the advantages of monarchy to have no local seat it may maintain its rights out of the sphere of its territorial jurisdiction if other powers will suffer it  i am well apprised that the little intriguers and whisperers and selfconceited thoughtless babblers worse than either run about to depreciate the fallen virtue of a great nation but whilst they talk we must make our choicethey or the jacobins we have no other option as to those who in the pride of a prosperity not obtained by their wisdom valor or industry think so well of themselves and of their own abilities and virtues and so ill of other men truth obliges me to say that they are not founded in their presumption concerning themselves nor in their contempt of the french princes magistrates nobility and clergy instead of inspiring me with dislike and distrust of the unfortunate engaged with us in a common cause against our jacobin enemy they take away all my esteem for their own characters and all my deference to their judgment  there are some few french gentlemen indeed who talk a language not wholly different from this jargon those whom i have in my eye i respect as gallant soldiers as much as any one can do but on their political judgment and prudence i have not the slightest reliance nor on their knowledge of their own country or of its laws and constitution they are if not enemies at least not friends to the orders of their own statenot to the princes the clergy or the nobility they possess only an attachment to the monarchy or rather to the persons of the late king and queen in all other respects their conversation is jacobin i am afraid they or some of them go into the closets of ministers and tell them that the affairs of france will be better arranged by the allied powers than by the landed proprietors of the kingdom or by the princes who have a right to govern and that if any french are at all to be employed in the settlement of their country it ought to be only those who have never declared any decided opinion or taken any active part in the revolution35  i suspect that the authors of this opinion are mere soldiers of fortune who though men of integrity and honor would as gladly receive military rank from russia or austria or prussia as from the regent of france perhaps their not having as much importance at his court as they could wish may incline them to this strange imagination perhaps having no property in old france they are more indifferent about its restoration their language is certainly flattering to all ministers in all courts we all are men we all love to be told of the extent of our own power and our own faculties if we love glory we are jealous of partners and afraid even of our own instruments it is of all modes of flattery the most effectual to be told that you can regulate the affairs of another kingdom better than its hereditary proprietors it is formed to flatter the principle of conquest so natural to all men it is this principle which is now making the partition of poland the powers concerned have been told by some perfidious poles and perhaps they believe that their usurpation is a great benefit to the people especially to the common people however this may turn out with regard to poland i am quite sure that france could not be so well under a foreign direction as under that of the representatives of its own king and its own ancient estates  i think i have myself studied france as much as most of those whom the allied courts are likely to employ in such a work i have likewise of myself as partial and as vain an opinion as men commonly have of themselves but if i could command the whole military arm of europe i am sure that a bribe of the best province in that kingdom would not tempt me to intermeddle in their affairs except in perfect concurrence and concert with the natural legal interests of the country composed of the ecclesiastical the military the several corporate bodies of justice and of burghership making under a monarch i repeat it again and again the french nation according to its fundamental constitution no considerate statesman would undertake to meddle with it upon any other condition  the government of that kingdom is fundamentally monarchical the public law of europe has never recognized in it any other form of government the potentates of europe have by that law a right an interest and a duty to know with what government they are to treat and what they are to admit into the federative societyor in other words into the diplomatic republic of europe this right is clear and indisputable  what other and further interference they have a right to in the interior of the concerns of another people is a matter on which as on every political subject no very definite or positive rule can well be laid down our neighbors are men and who will attempt to dictate the laws under which it is allowable or forbidden to take a part in the concerns of men whether they are considered individually or in a collective capacity whenever charity to them or a care of my own safety calls forth my activity circumstances perpetually variable directing a moral prudence and discretion the general principles of which never vary must alone prescribe a conduct fitting on such occasions the latest casuists of public law are rather of a republican cast and in my mind by no means so averse as they ought to be to a right in the people a word which ill defined is of the most dangerous use to make changes at their pleasure in the fundamental laws of their country these writers however when a country is divided leave abundant liberty for a neighbor to support any of the parties according to his choice36 this interference must indeed always be a right whilst the privilege of doing good to others and of averting from them every sort of evil is a right circumstances may render that right a duty it depends wholly on this whether it be a bonâ fide charity to a party and a prudent precaution with regard to yourself or whether under the pretence of aiding one of the parties in a nation you act in such a manner as to aggravate its calamities and accomplish its final destruction in truth it is not the interfering or keeping aloof but iniquitous intermeddling or treacherous inaction which is praised or blamed by the decision of an equitable judge  it will be a just and irresistible presumption against the fairness of the interposing power that he takes with him no party or description of men in the divided state it is not probable that these parties should all and all alike be more adverse to the true interests of their country and less capable of forming a judgment upon them than those who are absolute strangers to their affairs and to the character of the actors in them and have but a remote feeble and secondary sympathy with their interest sometimes a calm and healing arbiter may be necessary but he is to compose differences not to give laws it is impossible that any one should not feel the full force of that presumption even people whose politics for the supposed good of their own country lead them to take advantage of the dissensions of a neighboring nation in order to ruin it will not directly propose to exclude the natives but they will take that mode of consulting and employing them which most nearly approaches to an exclusion in some particulars they propose what amounts to that exclusion in others they do much worse they recommend to ministry that no frenchman who has given a decided opinion or acted a decided part in this great revolution for or against it should be countenanced brought forward trusted or employed even in the strictest subordination to the ministers of the allied powers although one would think that this advice would stand condemned on the first proposition yet as it has been made popular and has been proceeded upon practically i think it right to give it a full consideration  and first i have asked myself who these frenchmen are that in the state their own country has been in for these last five years of all the people of europe have alone not been able to form a decided opinion or have been unwilling to act a decided part  looking over all the names i have heard of in this great revolution in all human affairs i find no man of any distinction who has remained in that more than stoical apathy but the prince de conti this mean stupid selfish swinish and cowardly animal universally known and despised as such has indeed except in one abortive attempt to elope been perfectly neutral however his neutrality which it seems would qualify him for trust and on a competition must set aside the prince de condé can be of no sort of service his moderation has not been able to keep him from a jail the allied powers must draw him from that jail before they can have the full advantage of the exertions of this great neutralist  except him i do not recollect a man of rank or talents who by his speeches or his votes by his pen or by his sword has not been active on this scene the time indeed could admit no neutrality in any person worthy of the name of man there were originally two great divisions in france the one is that which overturned the whole of the government in church and state and erected a republic on the basis of atheism their grand engine was the jacobin club a sort of secession from which but exactly on the same principles begat another shortlived one called the club of eightynine37 which was chiefly guided by the court rebels who in addition to the crimes of which they were guilty in common with the others had the merit of betraying a gracious master and a kind benefactor subdivisions of this faction which since we have seen do not in the least differ from each other in their principles their dispositions or the means they have employed their only quarrel has been about power in that quarrel like wave succeeding wave one faction has got the better and expelled the other thus la fayette for a while got the better of orléans and orléans afterwards prevailed over la fayette brissot overpowered orléans barère and robespierre and their faction mastered them both and cut off their heads all who were not royalists have been listed in some or other of these divisions if it were of any use to settle a precedence the elder ought to have his rank the first authors plotters and contrivers of this monstrous scheme seem to me entitled to the first place in our distrust and abhorrence i have seen some of those who are thought the best amongst the original rebels and i have not neglected the means of being informed concerning the others i can very truly say that i have not found by observation or inquiry that any sense of the evils produced by their projects has produced in them or any one of them the smallest degree of repentance disappointment and mortification undoubtedly they feel but to them repentance is a thing impossible they are atheists this wretched opinion by which they are possessed even to the height of fanaticism leading them to exclude from their ideas of a commonwealth the vital principle of the physical the moral and the political world engages them in a thousand absurd contrivances to fill up this dreadful void incapable of innoxious repose or honorable action or wise speculation in the lurkingholes of a foreign land into which in a common ruin they are driven to hide their heads amongst the innocent victims of their madness they are at this very hour as busy in the confection of the dirtpies of their imaginary constitutions as if they had not been quite fresh from destroying by their impious and desperate vagaries the finest country upon earth  it is however out of these or of such as these guilty and impenitent despising the experience of others and their own that some people talk of choosing their negotiators with those jacobins who they suppose may be recovered to a sounder mind they flatter themselves it seems that the friendly habits formed during their original partnership of iniquity a similarity of character and a conformity in the groundwork of their principles might facilitate their conversion and gain them over to some recognition of royalty but surely this is to read human nature very ill the several sectaries in this schism of the jacobins are the very last men in the world to trust each other fellowship in treason is a bad ground of confidence the last quarrels are the sorest and the injuries received or offered by your own associates are ever the most bitterly resented the people of france of every name and description would a thousand times sooner listen to the prince de condé or to the archbishop of aix or the bishop of st pol or to monsieur de cazalès then to la fayette or dumouriez or the vicomte de noailles or the bishop of autun or necker or his disciple lally tollendal against the first description they have not the smallest animosity beyond that of a merely political dissension the others they regard as traitors  the first description is that of the christian royalists men who as earnestly wished for reformation as they opposed innovation in the fundamental parts of their church and state their part has been very decided accordingly they are to be set aside in the restoration of church and state it is an odd kind of disqualification where the restoration of religion and monarchy is the question if england should god forbid it should fall into the same misfortune with france and that the court of vienna should undertake the restoration of our monarchy i think it would be extraordinary to object to the admission of mr pitt or lord grenville or mr dundas into any share in the management of that business because in a day of trial they have stood up firmly and manfully as i trust they always will do and with distinguished powers for the monarchy and the legitimate constitution of their country i am sure if i were to suppose myself at vienna at such a time i should as a man as an englishman and as a royalist protest in that case as i do in this against a weak and ruinous principle of proceeding which can have no other tendency than to make those who wish to support the crown meditate too profoundly on the consequences of the part they take and consider whether for their open and forward zeal in the royal cause they may not be thrust out from any sort of confidence and employment where the interest of crowned heads is concerned  these are the parties i have said and said truly that i know of no neutrals but as a general observation on this general principle of choosing neutrals on such occasions as the present i have this to say that it amounts to neither more nor less than this shocking propositionthat we ought to exclude men of honor and ability from serving theirs and our cause and to put the dearest interests of ourselves and our posterity into the hands of men of no decided character without judgment to choose and without courage to profess any principle whatsoever  such men can serve no cause for this plain reasonthey have no cause at heart they can at best work only as mere mercenaries they have not been guilty of great crimes but it is only because they have not energy of mind to rise to any height of wickedness they are not hawks or kites they are only miserable fowls whose flight is not above their dunghill or henroost but they tremble before the authors of these horrors they admire them at a safe and respectful distance there never was a mean and abject mind that did not admire an intrepid and dexterous villain in the bottom of their hearts they believe such hardy miscreants to be the only men qualified for great affairs if you set them to transact with such persons they are instantly subdued they dare not so much as look their antagonist in the face they are made to be their subjects not to be their arbiters or controllers  these men to be sure can look at atrocious acts without indignation and can behold suffering virtue without sympathy therefore they are considered as sober dispassionate men but they have their passions though of another kind and which are infinitely more likely to carry them out of the path of their duty they are of a tame timid languid inert temper wherever the welfare of others is concerned in such causes as they have no motives to action they never possess any real ability and are totally destitute of all resource  believe a man who has seen much and observed something i have seen in the course of my life a great many of that family of men they are generally chosen because they have no opinion of their own and as far as they can be got in good earnest to embrace any opinion it is that of whoever happens to employ them neither longer nor shorter narrower nor broader with whom they have no discussion or consultation the only thing which occurs to such a man when he has got a business for others into his hands is how to make his own fortune out of it the person he is to treat with is not with him an adversary over whom he is to prevail but a new friend he is to gain therefore he always systematically betrays some part of his trust instead of thinking how he shall defend his ground to the last and if forced to retreat how little he shall give up this kind of man considers how much of the interest of his employer he is to sacrifice to his adversary having nothing but himself in view he knows that in serving his principal with zeal he must probably incur some resentment from the opposite party his object is to obtain the goodwill of the person with whom he contends that when an agreement is made he may join in rewarding him i would not take one of these as my arbitrator in a dispute for so much as a fishpond for if he reserved the mud to me he would be sure to give the water that fed the pool to my adversary in a great cause i should certainly wish that my agent should possess conciliating qualities that he should be of a frank open and candid disposition soft in his nature and of a temper to soften animosities and to win confidence he ought not to be a man odious to the person he treats with by personal injury by violence or by deceit or above all by the dereliction of his cause in any former transactions but i would be sure that my negotiator should be minethat he should be as earnest in the cause as myself and known to be sothat he should not be looked upon as a stipendiary advocate but as a principled partisan in all treaty it is a great point that all idea of gaining your agent is hopeless i would not trust the cause of royalty with a man who professing neutrality is half a republican the enemy has already a great part of his suit without a struggleand he contends with advantage for all the rest the common principle allowed between your adversary and your agent gives your adversary the advantage in every discussion  before i shut up this discourse about neutral agency which i conceive is not to be found or if found ought not to be used i have a few other remarks to make on the cause which i conceive gives rise to it  in all that we do whether in the struggle or after it it is necessary that we should constantly have in our eye the nature and character of the enemy we have to contend with the jacobin revolution is carried on by men of no rank of no consideration of wild savage minds full of levity arrogance and presumption without morals without probity without prudence what have they then to supply their innumerable defects and to make them terrible even to the firmest minds one thing and one thing onlybut that one thing is worth a thousandthey have energy in france all things being put into an universal ferment in the decomposition of society no man comes forward but by his spirit of enterprise and the vigor of his mind if we meet this dreadful and portentous energy restrained by no consideration of god or man that is always vigilant always on the attack that allows itself no repose and suffers none to rest an hour with impunityif we meet this energy with poor commonplace proceeding with trivial maxims paltry old saws with doubts fears and suspicions with a languid uncertain hesitation with a formal official spirit which is turned aside by every obstacle from its purpose and which never sees a difficulty but to yield to it or at best to evade itdown we go to the bottom of the abyss and nothing short of omnipotence can save us we must meet a vicious and distempered energy with a manly and rational vigor as virtue is limited in its resources we are doubly bound to use all that in the circle drawn about us by our morals we are able to command  i do not contend against the advantages of distrust in the world we live in it is but too necessary some of old called it the very sinews of discretion but what signify commonplaces that always run parallel and equal distrust is good or it is bad according to our position and our purpose distrust is a defensive principle they who have much to lose have much to fear but in france we hold nothing we are to break in upon a power in possession we are to carry everything by storm or by surprise or by intelligence or by all adventure therefore and not caution is our policy here to be too presuming is the better error  the world will judge of the spirit of our proceeding in those places of france which may fall into our power by our conduct in those that are already in our hands our wisdom should not be vulgar other times perhaps other measures but in this awful hour our politics ought to be made up of nothing but courage decision manliness and rectitude we should have all the magnanimity of good faith this is a royal and commanding policy and as long as we are true to it we may give the law never can we assume this command if we will not risk the consequences for which reason we ought to be bottomed enough in principle not to be carried away upon the first prospect of any sinister advantage for depend upon it that if we once give way to a sinister dealing we shall teach others the game and we shall be outwitted and overborne the spaniards the prussians god knows who will put us under contribution at their pleasure and instead of being at the head of a great confederacy and the arbiters of europe we shall by our mistakes break up a great design into a thousand little selfish quarrels the enemy will triumph and we shall sit down under the terms of unsafe and dependent peace weakened mortified and disgraced whilst all europe england included is left open and defenceless on every part to jacobin principles intrigues and arms in the case of the king of france declared to be our friend and ally we will still be considering ourselves in the contradictory character of an enemy this contradiction i am afraid will in spite of us give a color of fraud to all our transactions or at least will so complicate our politics that we shall ourselves be inextricably entangled in them  i have toulon in my eye it was with infinite sorrow i heard that in taking the king of frances fleet in trust we instantly unrigged and dismasted the ships instead of keeping them in a condition to escape in case of disaster and in order to fulfil our trustthat is to hold them for the use of the owner and in the mean time to employ them for our common service these ships are now so circumstanced that if we are forced to evacuate toulon they must fall into the hands of the enemy or be burnt by ourselves i know this is by some considered as a fine thing for us but the athenians ought not to be better than the english or mr pitt less virtuous than aristides  are we then so poor in resources that we can do no better with eighteen or twenty ships of the line than to burn them had we sent for french royalist naval officers of which some hundreds are to be had and made them select such seamen as they could trust and filled the rest with our own and mediterranean seamen which are all over italy to be had by thousands and put them under judicious english commandersinchief and with a judicious mixture of our own subordinates the west indies would at this day have been ours it may be said that these french officers would take them for the king of france and that they would not be in our power be it so the islands would not be ours but they would not be jacobinized this is however a thing impossible they must in effect and substance be ours but all is upon that false principle of distrust which not confiding in strength can never have the full use of it they that pay and feed and equip must direct but i must speak plain upon this subject the french islands if they were all our own ought not to be all kept a fair partition only ought to be made of those territories this is a subject of policy very serious which has many relations and aspects just here i only hint at it as answering an objection whilst i state the mischievous consequences which suffer us to be surprised into a virtual breach of faith by confounding our ally with our enemy because they both belong to the same geographical territory  my clear opinion is that toulon ought to be made what we set out with a royal french city by the necessity of the case it must be under the influence civil and military of the allies but the only way of keeping that jealous and discordant mass from tearing its component parts to pieces and hazarding the loss of the whole is to put the place into the nominal government of the regent his officers being approved by us this i say is absolutely necessary for a poise amongst ourselves otherwise is it to be believed that the spaniards who hold that place with us in a sort of partnership contrary to our mutual interest will see us absolute masters of the mediterranean with gibraltar on one side and toulon on the other with a quiet and composed mind whilst we do little less than declare that we are to take the whole west indies into our hands leaving the vast unwieldy and feeble body of the spanish dominions in that part of the world absolutely at our mercy without any power to balance us in the smallest degree nothing is so fatal to a nation as an extreme of selfpartiality and the total want of consideration of what others will naturally hope or fear spain must think she sees that we are taking advantage of the confusions which reign in france to disable that country and of course every country from affording her protection and in the end to turn the spanish monarchy into a province if she saw things in a proper point of light to be sure she would not consider any other plan of politics as of the least moment in comparison of the extinction of jacobinism but her ministers to say the best of them are vulgar politicians it is no wonder that they should postpone this great point or balance it by considerations of the common politics that is the questions of power between state and state if we manifestly endeavor to destroy the balance especially the maritime and commercial balance both in europe and the west indies the latter their sore and vulnerable part from fear of what france may do for spain hereafter is it to be wondered that spain infinitely weaker than we are weaker indeed than such a mass of empire ever was should feel the same fears from our uncontrolled power that we give way to ourselves from a supposed resurrection of the ancient power of france under a monarchy it signifies nothing whether we are wrong or right in the abstract but in respect to our relation to spain with such principles followed up in practice it is absolutely impossible that any cordial alliance can subsist between the two nations if spain goes naples will speedily follow prussia is quite certain and thinks of nothing but making a market of the present confusions italy is broken and divided switzerland is jacobinized i am afraid completely i have long seen with pain the progress of french principles in that country things cannot go on upon the present bottom the possession of toulon which well managed might be of the greatest advantage will be the greatest misfortune that ever happened to this nation the more we multiply troops there the more we shall multiply causes and means of quarrel amongst ourselves i know but one way of avoiding it which is to give a greater degree of simplicity to our politics our situation does necessarily render them a good deal involved and to this evil instead of increasing it we ought to apply all the remedies in our power  see what is in that place the consequence to say nothing of every other of this complexity toulon has as it were two gatesan english and a spanish the english gate is by our policy fast barred against the entrance of any royalists the spaniards open theirs i fear upon no fixed principle and with very little judgment by means however of this foolish mean and jealous policy on our side all the royalists whom the english might select as most practicable and most subservient to honest views are totally excluded of those admitted the spaniards are masters as to the inhabitants they are a nest of jacobins which is delivered into our hands not from principle but from fear the inhabitants of toulon may be described in a few words it is differtum nautis cauponibus atque malignis the rest of the seaports are of the same description  another thing which i cannot account for is the sending for the bishop of toulon and afterwards forbidding his entrance this is as directly contrary to the declaration as it is to the practice of the allied powers the king of prussia did better when he took verdun he actually reinstated the bishop and his chapter when he thought he should be the master of chalons he called the bishop from flanders to put him into possession the austrians have restored the clergy wherever they obtained possession we have proposed to restore religion as well as monarchy and in toulon we have restored neither the one nor the other it is very likely that the jacobin sansculottes or some of them objected to this measure who rather choose to have the atheistic buffoons of clergy they have got to sport with till they are ready to come forward with the rest of their worthy brethren in paris and other places to declare that they are a set of impostors that they never believed in god and never will preach any sort of religion if we give way to our jacobins in this point it is fully and fairly putting the government civil and ecclesiastical not in the king of france to whom as the protector and governor and in substance the head of the gallican church the nomination to the bishoprics belonged and who made the bishop of toulonit does not leave it with him or even in the hands of the king of england or the king of spainbut in the basest jacobins of a low seaport to exercise pro tempore the sovereignty if this point of religion is thus given up the grand instrument for reclaiming france is abandoned we cannot if we would delude ourselves about the true state of this dreadful contest it is a religious war it includes in its object undoubtedly every other interest of society as well as this but this is the principal and leading feature it is through this destruction of religion that our enemies propose the accomplishment of all their other views the french revolution impious at once and fanatical had no other plan for domestic power and foreign empire look at all the proceedings of the national assembly from the first day of declaring itself such in the year 1789 to this very hour and you will find full half of their business to be directly on this subject in fact it is the spirit of the whole the religious system called the constitutional church was on the face of the whole proceeding set up only as a mere temporary amusement to the people and so constantly stated in all their conversations till the time should come when they might with safety cast off the very appearance of all religion whatsoever and persecute christianity throughout europe with fire and sword the constitutional clergy are not the ministers of any religion they are the agents and instruments of this horrible conspiracy against all morals it was from a sense of this that in the english addition to the articles proposed at st domingo tolerating all religions we very wisely refused to suffer that kind of traitors and buffoons  this religious war is not a controversy between sect and sect as formerly but a war against all sects and all religions the question is not whether you are to overturn the catholic to set up the protestant such an idea in the present state of the world is too contemptible our business is to leave to the schools the discussion of the controverted points abating as much as we can the acrimony of disputants on all sides it is for christian statesmen as the world is now circumstanced to secure their common basis and not to risk the subversion of the whole fabric by pursuing these distinctions with an illtimed zeal we have in the present grand alliance all modes of government as well as all modes of religion in government we mean to restore that which notwithstanding our diversity of forms we are all agreed in as fundamental in government the same principle ought to guide us in the religious part conforming the mode not to our particular ideas for in that point we have no ideas in common but to what will best promote the great general ends of the alliance as statesmen we are to see which of those modes best suits with the interests of such a commonwealth as we wish to secure and promote there can be no doubt but that the catholic religion which is fundamentally the religion of france must go with the monarchy of france we know that the monarchy did not survive the hierarchy no not even in appearance for many monthsin substance not for a single hour as little can it exist in future if that pillar is taken away or even shattered and impaired  if it should please god to give to the allies the means of restoring peace and order in that focus of war and confusion i would as i said in the beginning of this memorial first replace the whole of the old clergy because we have proof more than sufficient that whether they err or not in the scholastic disputes with us they are not tainted with atheism the great political evil of the time i hope i need not apologize for this phrase as if i thought religion nothing but policy it is far from my thoughts and i hope it is not to be inferred from my expressions but in the light of policy alone i am here considering the question i speak of policy too in a large light in which large light policy too is a sacred thing  there are many perhaps half a million or more calling themselves protestants in the south of france and in other of the provinces some raise them to a much greater number but i think this nearer to the mark i am sorry to say that they have behaved shockingly since the very beginning of this rebellion and have been uniformly concerned in its worst and most atrocious acts their clergy are just the same atheists with those of the constitutional catholics but still more wicked and daring three of their number have met from their republican associates the reward of their crimes  as the ancient catholic religion is to be restored for the body of france the ancient calvinistic religion ought to be restored for the protestants with every kind of protection and privilege but not one minister concerned in this rebellion ought to be suffered amongst them if they have not clergy of their own men well recommended as untainted with jacobinism by the synods of those places where calvinism prevails and french is spoken ought to be sought many such there are the presbyterian discipline ought in my opinion to be established in its vigor and the people professing it ought to be bound to its maintenance no man under the false and hypocritical pretence of liberty of conscience ought to be suffered to have no conscience at all the kings commissioner ought also to sit in their synods as before the revocation of the edict of nantes i am conscious that this discipline disposes men to republicanism but it is still a discipline and it is a cure such as it is for the perverse and undisciplined habits which for some time have prevailed republicanism repressed may have its use in the composition of a state inspection may be practicable and responsibility in the teachers and elders may be established in such an hierarchy as the presbyterian for a time like ours it is a great point gained that people should be taught to meet to combine and to be classed and arrayed in some other way than in clubs of jacobins if it be not the best mode of protestantism under a monarchy it is still an orderly christian church orthodox in the fundamentals and what is to our point capable enough of rendering men useful citizens it was the impolitic abolition of their discipline which exposed them to the wild opinions and conduct that have prevailed amongst the huguenots the toleration in 1787 was owing to the good disposition of the late king but it was modified by the profligate folly of his atheistic minister the cardinal de loménie this mischievous minister did not follow in the edict of toleration the wisdom of the edict of nantes but his toleration was granted to noncatholicsa dangerous word which might signify anything and was but too expressive of a fatal indifference with regard to all piety i speak for myself i do not wish any man to be converted from his sect the distinctions which we have reformed from animosity to emulation may be even useful to the cause of religion by some moderate contention they keep alive zeal whereas people who change except under strong conviction a thing now rather rare the religion of their early prejudices especially if the conversion is brought about by any political machine are very apt to degenerate into indifference laxity and often downright atheism  another political question arises about the mode of government which ought to be established i think the proclamation which i read before i had proceeded far in this memorial puts it on the best footing by postponing that arrangement to a time of peace  when our politics lead us to enterprise a great and almost total political revolution in europe we ought to look seriously into the consequences of what we are about to do some eminent persons discover an apprehension that the monarchy if restored in france may be restored in too great strength for the liberty and happiness of the natives and for the tranquillity of other states they are therefore of opinion that terms ought to be made for the modification of that monarchy they are persons too considerable from the powers of their mind and from their situation as well as from the real respect i have for them who seem to entertain these apprehensions to let me pass them by unnoticed  as to the power of france as a state and in its exterior relations i confess my fears are on the part of its extreme reduction there is undoubtedly something in the vicinity of france which makes it naturally and properly an object of our watchfulness and jealousy whatever form its government may take but the difference is great between a plan for our own security and a scheme for the utter destruction of france if there were no other countries in the political map but these two i admit that policy might justify a wish to lower our neighbor to a standard which would even render her in some measure if not wholly our dependant but the system of europe is extensive and extremely complex however formidable to us as taken in this one relation france is not equally dreadful to all other states on the contrary my clear opinion is that the liberties of europe cannot possibly be preserved but by her remaining a very great and preponderating power the design at present evidently pursued by the combined potentates or of the two who lead is totally to destroy her as such a power for great britain resolves that she shall have no colonies no commerce and no marine austria means to take away the whole frontier from the borders of switzerland to dunkirk it is their plan also to render the interior government lax and feeble by prescribing by force of the arms of rival and jealous nations and without consulting the natural interests of the kingdom such arrangements as in the actual state of jacobinism in france and the unsettled state in which property must remain for a long time will inevitably produce such distraction and debility in government as to reduce it to nothing or to throw it back into its old confusion one cannot conceive so frightful a state of a nation a maritime country without a marine and without commerce a continental country without a frontier and for a thousand miles surrounded with powerful warlike and ambitious neighbors it is possible that she might submit to lose her commerce and her colonies her security she never can abandon if contrary to all expectations under such a disgraced and impotent government any energy should remain in that country she will make every effort to recover her security which will involve europe for a century in war and blood what has it cost to france to make that frontier what will it cost to recover it austria thinks that without a frontier she cannot secure the netherlands but without her frontier france cannot secure herself austria has been however secure for an hundred years in those very netherlands and has never been dispossessed of them by the chance of war without a moral certainty of receiving them again on the restoration of peace her late dangers have arisen not from the power or ambition of the king of france they arose from her own ill policy which dismantled all her towns and discontented all her subjects by jacobinical innovations she dismantles her own towns and then says give me the frontier of france but let us depend upon it whatever tends under the name of security to aggrandize austria will discontent and alarm prussia such a length of frontier on the side of france separated from itself and separated from the mass of the austrian country will be weak unless connected at the expense of the elector of bavaria the elector palatine and other lesser princes or by such exchanges as will again convulse the empire  take it the other way and let us suppose that france so broken in spirit as to be content to remain naked and defenceless by sea and by land is such a country no prey have other nations no views is poland the only country of which it is worth while to make a partition we cannot be so childish as to imagine that ambition is local and that no others can be infected with it but those who rule within certain parallels of latitude and longitude in this way i hold war equally certain but i can conceive that both these principles may operate ambition on the part of austria to cut more and more from france and french impatience under her degraded and unsafe condition in such a contest will the other powers stand by will not prussia call for indemnity as well as austria and england is she satisfied with her gains in poland by no means germany must pay or we shall infallibly see prussia leagued with france and spain and possibly with other powers for the reduction of austria and such may be the situation of things that it will not be so easy to decide what part england may take in such a contest  i am well aware how invidious a task it is to oppose anything which tends to the apparent aggrandizement of our own country but i think no country can be aggrandized whilst france is jacobinized this post removed it will be a serious question how far her further reduction will contribute to the general safety which i always consider as included among precautions against ambition it may not be amiss to take one precaution against our own i must fairly say i dread our own power and our own ambition i dread our being too much dreaded it is ridiculous to say we are not men and that as men we shall never wish to aggrandize ourselves in some way or other can we say that even at this very hour we are not invidiously aggrandized we are already in possession of almost all the commerce of the world our empire in india is an awful thing if we should come to be in a condition not only to have all this ascendant in commerce but to be absolutely able without the least control to hold the commerce of all other nations totally dependent upon our good pleasure we may say that we shall not abuse this astonishing and hitherto unheardof power but every other nation will think we shall abuse it it is impossible but that sooner or later this state of things must produce a combination against us which may end in our ruin  as to france i must observe that for a long time she has been stationary she has during this whole century obtained far less by conquest or negotiation than any of the three great continental powers some part of lorraine excepted i recollect nothing she has gainedno not a village in truth this lorraine acquisition does little more than secure her barrier in effect and substance it was her own before  however that may be i consider these things at present chiefly in one point of view as obstructions to the war on jacobinism which must stand as long as the powers think its extirpation but a secondary object and think of taking advantage under the name of indemnity and security to make war upon the whole nation of france royal and jacobin for the aggrandizement of the allies on the ordinary principles of interest as if no jacobinism existed in the world  so far is france from being formidable to its neighbors for its domestic strength that i conceive it will be as much as all its neighbors can do by a steady guaranty to keep that monarchy at all upon its basis it will be their business to nurse france not to exhaust it france such as it is is indeed highly formidable not formidable however as a great republic but as the most dreadful gang of robbers and murderers that ever was embodied but this distempered strength of france will be the cause of proportionable weakness on its recovery never was a country so completely ruined and they who calculate the resurrection of her power by former examples have not sufficiently considered what is the present state of things without detailing the inventory of what organs of government have been destroyed together with the very materials of which alone they can be recomposed i wish it to be considered what an operose affair the whole system of taxation is in the old states of europe it is such as never could be made but in a long course of years in france all taxes are abolished the present powers resort to the capital and to the capital in kind but a savage undisciplined people suffer a robbery with more patience than an impost the former is in their habits and their dispositions they consider it as transient and as what in their turn they may exercise but the terrors of the present power are such as no regular government can possibly employ they who enter into france do not succeed to their resources they have not a system to reform but a system to begin the whole estate of government is to be reacquired  what difficulties this will meet with in a country exhausted by the taking of the capital and among a people in a manner newprincipled trained and actually disciplined to anarchy rebellion disorder and impiety may be conceived by those who know what jacobin france is and who may have occupied themselves by revolving in their thoughts what they were to do if it fell to their lot to reëstablish the affairs of france what support or what limitations the restored monarchy must have may be a doubt or how it will pitch and settle at last but one thing i conceive to be far beyond a doubt that the settlement cannot be immediate but that it must be preceded by some sort of power equal at least in vigor vigilance promptitude and decision to a military government for such a preparatory government no slowpaced methodical formal lawyerlike system still less that of a showy superficial trifling intriguing court guided by cabals of ladies or of men like ladies least of all a philosophic theoretic disputatious school of sophistrynone of these ever will or ever can lay the foundations of an order that can last whoever claims a right by birth to govern there must find in his breast or must conjure up in it an energy not to be expected perhaps not always to be wished for in wellordered states the lawful prince must have in everything but crime the character of an usurper he is gone if he imagines himself the quiet possessor of a throne he is to contend for it as much after an apparent conquest as before his task is to win it he must leave posterity to enjoy and to adorn it no velvet cushions for him he is to be always i speak nearly to the letter on horseback this opinion is the result of much patient thinking on the subject which i conceive no event is likely to alter  a valuable friend of mine who i hope will conduct these affairs so far as they fall to his share with great ability asked me what i thought of acts of general indemnity and oblivion as a means of settling france and reconciling it to monarchy before i venture upon any opinion of my own in this matter i totally disclaim the interference of foreign powers in a business that properly belongs to the government which we have declared legal that government is likely to be the best judge of what is to be done towards the security of that kingdom which it is their duty and their interest to provide for by such measures of justice or of lenity as at the time they should find best but if we weaken it not only by arbitrary limitations of our own but preserve such persons in it as are disposed to disturb its future peace as they have its past i do not know how a more direct declaration can be made of a disposition to perpetual hostility against a government the persons saved from the justice of the native magistrate by foreign authority will owe nothing to his clemency he will and must look to those to whom he is indebted for the power he has of dispensing it a jacobin faction constantly fostered with the nourishment of foreign protection will be kept alive  this desire of securing the safety of the actors in the present scene is owing to more laudable motives ministers have been made to consider the brothers of the late merciful king and the nobility of france who have been faithful to their honor and duty as a set of inexorable and remorseless tyrants how this notion has been infused into them i cannot be quite certain i am sure it is not justified by anything they have done never were the two princes guilty in the day of their power of a single hard or illnatured act no one instance of cruelty on the part of the gentlemen ever came to my ears it is true that the english jacobins the natives have not thought of it as an excuse for their infernal system of murder have so represented them it is on this principle that the massacres in the month of september 1792 were justified by a writer in the morning chronicle he says indeed that the whole french nation is to be given up to the hands of an irritated and revengeful noblesseand judging of others by himself and his brethren he says whoever succeeds in a civil war will be cruel but here the emigrants flying to revenge in the cars of military victory will almost insatiably call for their victims and their booty and a body of emigrant traitors were attending the king of prussia and the duke of brunswick to suggest the most sanguinary counsels so says this wicked jacobin but so cannot say the king of prussia nor the duke of brunswick who never did receive any sanguinary counsel nor did the kings brothers or that great body of gentlemen who attended those princes commit one single cruel action or hurt the person or property of one individual it would be right to quote the instance it is like the military luxury attributed to these unfortunate sufferers in our common cause  if these princes had shown a tyrannic disposition it would be much to be lamented we have no others to govern france if we screened the body of murderers from their justice we should only leave the innocent in future to the mercy of men of fierce and sanguinary dispositions of which in spite of all our intermeddling in their constitution we could not prevent the effects but as we have much more reason to fear their feeble lenity than any blamable rigor we ought in my opinion to leave the matter to themselves  if however i were asked to give an advice merely as such here are my ideas i am not for a total indemnity nor a general punishment and first the body and mass of the people never ought to be treated as criminal they may become an object of more or less constant watchfulness and suspicion as their preservation may best require but they can never become an object of punishment this is one of the few fundamental and unalterable principles of politics  to punish them capitally would be to make massacres massacres only increase the ferocity of men and teach them to regard their own lives and those of others as of little value whereas the great policy of government is to teach the people to think both of great importance in the eyes of god and the state and never to be sacrificed or even hazarded to gratify their passions or for anything but the duties prescribed by the rules of morality and under the direction of public law and public authority to punish them with lesser penalties would be to debilitate the commonwealth and make the nation miserable which it is the business of government to render happy and flourishing  as to crimes too i would draw a strong line of limitation for no one offence politically an offence of rebellion by council contrivance persuasion or compulsion for none properly a military offence of rebellion or anything done by open hostility in the field should any man at all be called in question because such seems to be the proper and natural death of civil dissensions the offences of war are obliterated by peace  another class will of course be included in the indemnitynamely all those who by their activity in restoring lawful government shall obliterate their offences the offence previously known the acceptance of service is a pardon for crimes i fear that this class of men will not be very numerous  so far as to indemnity but where are the objects of justice and of example and of future security to the public peace they are naturally pointed out not by their having outraged political and civil laws nor their having rebelled against the state as a state but by their having rebelled against the law of nature and outraged man as man in this list all the regicides in general all those who laid sacrilegious hands on the king who without anything in their own rebellious mission to the convention to justify them brought him to his trial and unanimously voted him guiltyall those who had a share in the cruel murder of the queen and the detestable proceedings with regard to the young king and the unhappy princessesall those who committed coldblooded murder anywhere and particularly in their revolutionary tribunals where every idea of natural justice and of their own declared rights of man have been trod under foot with the most insolent mockeryall men concerned in the burning and demolition of houses or churches with audacious and marked acts of sacrilege and scorn offered to religionin general all the leaders of jacobin clubsnot one of these should escape a punishment suitable to the nature quality and degree of their offence by a steady but a measured justice  in the first place no man ought to be subject to any penalty from the highest to the lowest but by a trial according to the course of law carried on with all that caution and deliberation which has been used in the best times and precedents of the french jurisprudence the criminal law of which country faulty to be sure in some particulars was highly laudable and tender of the lives of men in restoring order and justice everything like retaliation ought to be religiously avoided and an example ought to be set of a total alienation from the jacobin proceedings in their accursed revolutionary tribunals everything like lumping men in masses and of forming tables of proscription ought to be avoided  in all these punishments anything which can be alleged in mitigation of the offence should be fully considered mercy is not a thing opposed to justice it is an essential part of itas necessary in criminal cases as in civil affairs equity is to law it is only for the jacobins never to pardon they have not done it in a single instance a council of mercy ought therefore to be appointed with powers to report on each case to soften the penalty or entirely to remit it according to circumstances  with these precautions the very first foundation of settlement must be to call to a strict account those bloody and merciless offenders without it government cannot stand a year people little consider the utter impossibility of getting those who having emerged from very low some from the lowest classes of society have exercised a power so high and with such unrelenting and bloody a rage quietly to fall back into their old ranks and become humble peaceable laborious and useful members of society it never can be on the other hand is it to be believed that any worthy and virtuous subject restored to the ruins of his house will with patience see the coldblooded murderer of his father mother wife or children or perhaps all of these relations such things have been nose him in his own village and insult him with the riches acquired from the plunder of his goods ready again to head a jacobin faction to attack his life he is unworthy of the name of man who would suffer it it is unworthy of the name of a government which taking justice out of the private hand will not exercise it for the injured by the public arm  i know it sounds plausible and is readily adopted by those who have little sympathy with the sufferings of others to wish to jumble the innocent and guilty into one mass by a general indemnity this cruel indifference dignifies itself with the name of humanity  it is extraordinary that as the wicked arts of this regicide and tyrannous faction increase in number variety and atrocity the desire of punishing them becomes more and more faint and the talk of an indemnity towards them every day stronger and stronger our ideas of justice appear to be fairly conquered and overpowered by guilt when it is grown gigantic it is not the point of view in which we are in the habit of viewing guilt the crimes we every day punish are really below the penalties we inflict the criminals are obscure and feeble this is the view in which we see ordinary crimes and criminals but when guilt is seen though but for a time to be furnished with the arms and to be invested with the robes of power it seems to assume another nature and to get as it were out of our jurisdiction this i fear is the case with many but there is another cause full as powerful towards this security to enormous guiltthe desire which possesses people who have once obtained power to enjoy it at their ease it is not humanity but laziness and inertness of mind which produces the desire of this kind of indemnities this description of men love general and short methods if they punish they make a promiscuous massacre if they spare they make a general act of oblivion this is a want of disposition to proceed laboriously according to the cases and according to the rules and principles of justice on each case a want of disposition to assort criminals to discriminate the degrees and modes of guilt to separate accomplices from principals leaders from followers seducers from the seduced and then by following the same principles in the same detail to class punishments and to fit them to the nature and kind of the delinquency if that were once attempted we should soon see that the task was neither infinite nor the execution cruel there would be deaths but for the number of criminals and the extent of france not many there would be cases of transportation cases of labor to restore what has been wickedly destroyed cases of imprisonment and cases of mere exile but be this as it may i am sure that if justice is not done there there can be neither peace nor justice there nor in any part of europe  history is resorted to for other acts of indemnity in other times the princes are desired to look back to henry the fourth we are desired to look to the restoration of king charles these things in my opinion have no resemblance whatsoever they were cases of a civil warin france more ferocious in england more moderate than common in neither country were the orders of society subverted religion and morality destroyed on principle or property totally annihilated in england the government of cromwell was to be sure somewhat rigid but for a new power no savage tyranny the country was nearly as well in his hands as in those of charles the second and in some points much better the laws in general had their course and were admirably administered the king did not in reality grant an act of indemnity the prevailing power then in a manner the nation in effect granted an indemnity to him the idea of a preceding rebellion was not at all admitted in that convention and that parliament the regicides were a common enemy and as such given up  among the ornaments of their place which eminently distinguish them few people are better acquainted with the history of their own country than the illustrious princes now in exile but i caution them not to be led into error by that which has been supposed to be the guide of life i would give the same caution to all princes not that i derogate from the use of history it is a great improver of the understanding by showing both men and affairs in a great variety of views from this source much political wisdom may be learnedthat is may be learned as habit not as preceptand as an exercise to strengthen the mind as furnishing materials to enlarge and enrich it not as a repertory of cases and precedents for a lawyer if it were a thousand times better would it be that a statesman had never learned to readvellem nescirent literas this method turns their understanding from the object before them and from the present exigencies of the world to comparisons with former times of which after all we can know very little and very imperfectly and our guides the historians who are to give us their true interpretation are often prejudiced often ignorant often fonder of system than of truth whereas if a man with reasonable good parts and natural sagacity and not in the leadingstrings of any master will look steadily on the business before him without being diverted by retrospect and comparison he may be capable of forming a reasonable good judgment of what is to be done there are some fundamental points in which nature never changes but they are few and obvious and belong rather to morals than to politics but so far as regards political matter the human mind and human affairs are susceptible of infinite modifications and of combinations wholly new and unlookedfor very few for instance could have imagined that property which has been taken for natural dominion should through the whole of a vast kingdom lose all its importance and even its influence this is what history or books of speculation could hardly have taught us how many could have thought that the most complete and formidable revolution in a great empire should be made by men of letters not as subordinate instruments and trumpeters of sedition but as the chief contrivers and managers and in a short time as the open administrators and sovereign rulers who could have imagined that atheism could produce one of the most violently operative principles of fanaticism who could have imagined that in a commonwealth in a manner cradled in war and in an extensive and dreadful war military commanders should be of little or no account that the convention should not contain one military man of namethat administrative bodies in a state of the utmost confusion and of but a momentary duration and composed of men with not one imposing part of character should be able to govern the country and its armies with an authority which the most settled senates and the most respected monarchs scarcely ever had in the same degree this for one i confess i did not foresee though all the rest was present to me very early and not out of my apprehension even for several years  i believe very few were able to enter into the effects of mere terror as a principle not only for the support of power in given hands or forms but in those things in which the soundest political speculators were of opinion that the least appearance of force would be totally destructivesuch is the market whether of money provision or commodities of any kind yet for four years we have seen loans made treasuries supplied and armies levied and maintained more numerous than france ever showed in the field by the effects of fear alone  here is a state of things of which in its totality if history furnishes any examples at all they are very remote and feeble i therefore am not so ready as some are to tax with folly or cowardice those who were not prepared to meet an evil of this nature even now after the events all the causes may be somewhat difficult to ascertain very many are however traceable but these things history and books of speculation as i have already said did not teach men to foresee and of course to resist now that they are no longer a matter of sagacity but of experience of recent experience of our own experience it would be unjustifiable to go back to the records of other times to instruct us to manage what they never enabled us to foresee  footnotes  33 some accounts make them five times as many  34 before the revolution the french noblesse were so reduced in numbers that they did not much exceed twenty thousand at least of fullgrown men as they have been very cruelly formed into entire corps of soldiers it is estimated that by the sword and distempers in the field they have not lost less than five thousand men and if this course is pursued it is to be feared that the whole body of the french nobility may be extinguished several hundreds have also perished by famine and various accidents  35 this was the language of the ministerialists  36 vattel  37 the first object of this club was the propagation of jacobin principles     appendix  extracts from vattels law of nations  the titles marginal abstracts and notes are by mr burke excepting such of the notes as are here distinguished   cases of interference with independent powers  if then there is anywhere a nation of a restless and mischievous disposition always ready to injure others to traverse their designs and to raise domestic troubles38 it is not to be doubted that all have a right to join in order to repress chastise and put it ever after out of its power to injure them such should be the just fruits of the policy which machiavel praises in cæsar borgia the conduct followed by philip the second king of spain was adapted to unite all europe against him and it was from just reasons that henry the great formed the design of humbling a power formidable by its forces and pernicious by its maximsbook ii ch iv § 53  let us apply to the unjust what we have said above § 53 of a mischievous or maleficent nation if there be any that makes an open profession of trampling justice under foot of despising and violating the right of others39 whenever it finds an opportunity the interest of human society will authorize all others to unite in order to humble and chastise it we do not here forget the maxim established in our preliminaries that it does not belong to nations to usurp the power of being judges of each other in particular cases liable to the least doubt it ought to be supposed that each of the parties may have some right and the injustice of that which has committed the injury may proceed from error and not from a general contempt of justice but if by constant maxims and by a continued conduct one nation shows that it has evidently this pernicious disposition and that it considers no right as sacred the safety of the human race requires that it should be suppressed to form and support an unjust pretension is to do an injury not only to him who is interested in this pretension but to mock at justice in general and to injure all nationsibid ch v § 70  sidenote to succor against tyranny  sidenote case of english revolution  sidenote an odious tyrant  sidenote rebellious people  sidenote case of civil war  sidenote sovereign and his people when distinct powers  if the prince attacking the fundamental laws gives his subjects a legal right to resist him if tyranny becoming insupportable obliges the nation to rise in their defence every foreign power has a right to succor an oppressed people who implore their assistance the english justly complained of james the second the nobility and the most distinguished patriots resolved to put a check on his enterprises which manifestly tended to overthrow the constitution and to destroy the liberties and the religion of the people and therefore applied for assistance to the united provinces the authority of the prince of orange had doubtless an influence on the deliberations of the statesgeneral but it did not make them commit injustice for when a people from good reasons take up arms against an oppressor justice and generosity require that brave men should be assisted in the defence of their liberties whenever therefore a civil war is kindled in a state foreign powers may assist that party which appears to them to have justice on their side he who assists an odious tyrant he who declares for an unjust and rebellious people offends against his duty when the bands of the political society are broken or at least suspended between the sovereign and his people they may then be considered as two distinct powers and since each is independent of all foreign authority nobody has a right to judge them either may be in the right and each of those who grant their assistance may believe that he supports a good cause it follows then in virtue of the voluntary law of nations see prelim § 21 that the two parties may act as having an equal right and behave accordingly till the decision of the affair  sidenote not to be pursued to an extreme  sidenote endeavor to persuade subjects to a revolt  but we ought not to abuse this maxim for authorizing odious proceedings against the tranquillity of states it is a violation of the law of nations to persuade those subjects to revolt who actually obey their sovereign though they complain of his government  sidenote attempt to excite subjects to revolt  the practice of nations is conformable to our maxims when the german protestants came to the assistance of the reformed in france the court never undertook to treat them otherwise than as common enemies and according to the laws of war france at the same time assisted the netherlands which took up arms against spain and did not pretend that her troops should be considered upon any other footing than as auxiliaries in a regular war but no power avoids complaining of an atrocious injury if any one attempts by his emissaries to excite his subjects to revolt  sidenote tyrants  as to those monsters who under the title of sovereigns render themselves the scourges and horror of the human racethese are savage beasts from which every brave man may justly purge the earth all antiquity has praised hercules for delivering the world from an antæus a busiris and a diomedesibid ch iv § 56  after stating that nations have no right to interfere in domestic concerns he proceedsbut this rule does not preclude them from espousing the quarrel of a dethroned king and assisting him if he appears to have justice on his side they then declare themselves enemies of the nation which has acknowledged his rival as when two different nations are at war they are at liberty to assist that whose quarrel they shall think has the fairest appearancebook iv ch ii § 14   case of alliances  sidenote when an alliance to preserve a king takes place  sidenote king does not lose his quality by the loss of his kingdom  it is asked if that alliance subsists with the king and the royal family when by some revolution they are deprived of their crown we have lately remarked § 194 that a personal alliance expires with the reign of him who contracted it but that is to be understood of an alliance with the state limited as to its duration to the reign of the contracting king this of which we are here speaking is of another nature for though it binds the state since it is bound by all the public acts of its sovereign it is made directly in favor of the king and his family it would therefore be absurd for it to terminate at the moment when they have need of it and at an event against which it was made besides the king does not lose his quality merely by the loss of his kingdom if he is stripped of it unjustly by an usurper or by rebels he preserves his rights in the number of which are his alliances40  sidenote case wherein aid may be given to a deposed king  but who shall judge if the king be dethroned lawfully or by violence an independent nation acknowledges no judge if the body of the nation declares the king deprived of his rights by the abuse he has made of them and deposes him it may justly do it when its grievances are well founded and no other power has a right to censure it the personal ally of this king ought not then to assist him against the nation that has made use of its right in deposing him if he attempts it he injures that nation england declared war against louis the fourteenth in the year 1688 for supporting the interest of james the second who was deposed in form by the nation the same country declared war against him a second time at the beginning of the present century because that prince acknowledged the son of the deposed james under the name of james the third in doubtful cases and when the body of the nation has not pronounced or has not pronounced freely a sovereign may naturally support and defend an ally and it is then that the voluntary law of nations subsists between different states the party that has driven out the king pretends to have right on its side this unhappy king and his ally flatter themselves with having the same advantage and as they have no common judge upon earth they have no other method to take but to apply to arms to terminate the dispute they therefore engage in a formal war  sidenote not obliged to pursue his right beyond a certain point  in short when the foreign prince has faithfully fulfilled his engagements towards an unfortunate monarch when he has done in his defence or to procure his restoration all he was obliged to perform in virtue of the alliance if his efforts are ineffectual the dethroned prince cannot require him to support an endless war in his favor or expect that he will eternally remain the enemy of the nation or of the sovereign who has deprived him of the throne he must think of peace abandon the ally and consider him as having himself abandoned his right through necessity thus louis the fourteenth was obliged to abandon james the second and to acknowledge king william though he had at first treated him as an usurper  sidenote case of defence against subjects  sidenote case where real alliances may be renounced  the same question presents itself in real alliances and in general in all alliances made with the state and not in particular with a king for the defence of his person an ally ought doubtless to be defended against every invasion against every foreign violence and even against his rebellious subjects in the same manner a republic ought to be defended against the enterprises of one who attempts to destroy the public liberty but it ought to be remembered that an ally of the state or the nation is not its judge if the nation has deposed its king in formif the people of a republic have driven out their magistrates and set themselves at liberty or acknowledged the authority of an usurper either expressly or tacitlyto oppose these domestic regulations by disputing their justice or validity would be to interfere in the government of the nation and to do it an injury see § 54 and following of this book the ally remains the ally of the state notwithstanding the change that has happened in it however when this change renders the alliance useless dangerous or disagreeable it may renounce it for it may say upon a good foundation that it would not have entered into an alliance with that nation had it been under the present form of government  sidenote not an eternal war  we may say here what we have said on a personal alliance however just the cause of that king may be who is driven from the throne either by his subjects or by a foreign usurper his aides are not obliged to support an eternal war in his favor after having made ineffectual efforts to restore him they must at length give peace to their people and come to an accommodation with the usurper and for that purpose treat with him as with a lawful sovereign louis the fourteenth exhausted by a bloody and unsuccessful war offered at gertruydenberg to abandon his grandson whom he had placed on the throne of spain and when affairs had changed their appearance charles of austria the rival of philip saw himself in his turn abandoned by his allies they grew weary of exhausting their states in order to give him the possession of a crown which they believed to be his due but which to all appearance they should never be able to procure for himbook ii ch xii §§ 196 197   dangerous power  sidenote all nations may join  it is still easier to prove that should this formidable power betray any unjust and ambitious dispositions by doing the least injustice to another every nation may avail themselves of the occasion and join their forces to those of the party injured in order to reduce that ambitious power and disable it from so easily oppressing its neighbors or keeping them in continual awe and fear for an injury gives a nation a right to provide for its future safety by taking away from the violator the means of oppression it is lawful and even praiseworthy to assist those who are oppressed or unjustly attackedbook iii ch iii § 45   system of europe  sidenote europe a republic to preserve order and liberty  europe forms a political system a body where the whole is connected by the relations and different interests of nations inhabiting this part of the world it is not as anciently a confused heap of detached pieces each of which thought itself very little concerned in the fate of others and seldom regarded things which did not immediately relate to it the continual attention of sovereigns to what is on the carpet the constant residence of ministers and the perpetual negotiations make europe a kind of a republic the members of which though independent unite through the ties of common interest for the maintenance of order and liberty hence arose that famous scheme of the political equilibrium or balance of power by which is understood such a disposition of things as no power is able absolutely to predominate or to prescribe laws to othersbook iii ch iii § 47  confederacies would be a sure way of preserving the equilibrium and supporting the liberty of nations did all princes thoroughly understand their true interests and regulate all their steps for the good of the stateibid § 49   contributions in the enemys country  sidenote to be moderate  instead of the pillage of the country and defenceless places a custom has been substituted more humane and more advantageous to the sovereign making war i mean that of contributions whoever carries on a just war41 has a right of making the enemys country contribute to the support of the army and towards defraying all the charges of the war thus he obtains a part of what is due to him and the subjects of the enemy on submitting to this imposition are secured from pillage and the country is preserved but a general who would not sully his reputation is to moderate his contributions and proportion them to those on whom they are imposed an excess in this point is not without the reproach of cruelty and inhumanity if it shows less ferocity than ravage and destruction it glares with avaricebook iii ch ix § 165   asylum  if an exile or banished man is driven from his country for any crime it does not belong to the nation in which he has taken refuge to punish him for a fault committed in a foreign country for nature gives to mankind and to nations the right of punishing only for their defence and safety § 169 whence it follows that he can only be punished by those he has offended  but this reason shows that if the justice of each nation ought in general to be confined to the punishment of crimes committed in its own territories we ought to except from this rule the villains who by the quality and habitual frequency of their crimes violate all public security and declare themselves the enemies of the human race poisoners assassins and incendiaries by profession may be exterminated wherever they are seized for they attack and injure all nations by trampling under foot the foundations of their common safety thus pirates are brought to the gibbet by the first into whose hands they fall if the sovereign of the country where crimes of that nature have been committed reclaims the authors of them in order to bring them to punishment they ought to be restored to him as to one who is principally interested in punishing them in an exemplary manner and it being proper to convict the guilty and to try them according to some form of law this is a second not sole reason why malefactors are usually delivered up at the desire of the state where their crimes have been committedbook i ch xix §§ 232 233  every nation has a right of refusing to admit a stranger into the country when he cannot enter it without putting it in evident danger or without doing it a remarkable prejudice42ibid § 230   foreign ministers  the obligation does not go so far as to suffer at all times perpetual ministers who are desirous of residing with a sovereign though they have nothing to negotiate it is natural indeed and very agreeable to the sentiments which nations owe to each other that these resident ministers when there it nothing to be feared from their stay should be friendly received but if there be any solid reason against this what is for the good of the state ought unquestionably to be preferred and the foreign sovereign cannot take it amiss if his minister who has concluded the affairs of his commission and has no other affairs to negotiate be desired to depart43 the custom of keeping everywhere ministers continually resident is now so strongly established that the refusal of a conformity to it would without very good reasons give offence these reasons may arise from particular conjunctures but there are also common reasons always subsisting and such as relate to the constitution of a government and the state of a nation the republics have often very good reasons of the latter kind to excuse themselves from continually suffering foreign ministers who corrupt the citizens in order to gain them over to their masters to the great prejudice of the republic and fomenting of the parties
