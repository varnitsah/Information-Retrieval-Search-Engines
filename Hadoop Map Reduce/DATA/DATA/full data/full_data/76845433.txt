76845433	a first family of tasajara   by bret harte     chapter i   it blows said joe wingate  as if to accent the words of the speaker a heavy gust of wind at that moment shook the long light wooden structure which served as the general store of sidon settlement in contra costa even after it had passed a prolonged whistle came through the keyhole sides and openings of the closed glass front doors that served equally for windows and filled the canvas ceiling which hid the roof above like a bellying sail a wave of enthusiastic emotion seemed to be communicated to a line of straw hats and souwesters suspended from a crossbeam and swung them with every appearance of festive rejoicing while a few dusters overcoats and hickory shirts hanging on the side walls exhibited such marked though idiotic animation that it had the effect of a satirical comment on the lazy purposeless figures of the four living inmates of the store  ned billings momentarily raised his head and shoulders depressed in the back of his wooden armchair glanced wearily around said you bet its no slouch of a storm and then lapsed again with further extended legs and an added sense of comfort  here the third figure which had been leaning listlessly against the shelves putting aside the arm of a swaying overcoat that seemed to be emptily embracing him walked slowly from behind the counter to the door examined its fastenings and gazed at the prospect he was the owner of the store and the view was a familiar onea long stretch of treeless waste before him meeting an equal stretch of dreary sky above and night hovering somewhere between the two this was indicated by splashes of darker shadow as if washed in with india ink and a lighter lowlying streak that might have been the horizon but was not to the right on a line with the front door of the store were several scattered widely dispersed objects that although vague in outline were rigid enough in angles to suggest sheds or barns but certainly not trees  theres a heap more wet to come afore the wind goes down he said glancing at the sky hark to that now  they listened lazily there was a faint murmur from the shingles above then suddenly the whole window was filmed and blurred as if the entire prospect had been wiped out with a damp sponge the man turned listlessly away  thats the kind that soaks in thar wont be much teamin over tasajara for the next two weeks i reckon said the fourth lounger who seated on a high barrel was nibblingalbeit critically and fastidiouslybiscuits and dried apples alternately from open boxes on the counter its lucky youve got in your winter stock harkutt  the shrewd eyes of mr harkutt proprietor glanced at the occupation of the speaker as if even his foresight might have its possible drawbacks but he said nothing  therell be no show for sidon until youve got a wagon road from here to the creek said billings languidly from the depths of his chair but whats the use o talkin thar aint energy enough in all tasajara to build it a godforsaken place that two months of the year can only be reached by a mailrider once a week dont look ez if it was goin to break its back haulin in goods and settlers i tell ye what gentlemen it makes me sick and apparently it had enfeebled him to the extent of interfering with his aim in that expectoration of disgust against the stove with which he concluded his sentence  why dont you build it asked wingate carelessly  i wouldnt on principle said billings its govment work what did we whoop up things here last spring to elect kennedy to the legislation for what did i rig up my shed and a thousand feet of lumber for benches at the barbecue for why to get kennedy elected and make him get a bill passed for the road thats my share of building it if it comes to that and i only wish some folks that blow enough about what oughter be done to bulge out that ceiling would only do as much as i have done for sidon  as this remark seemed to have a personal as well as local application the storekeeper diplomatically turned it theres a good many as dont believe that a road from here to the creek is going to do any good to sidon its very well to say the creek is an embarcadero but callin it so dont put anough water into it to float a steamboat from the bay nor clear out the reeds and tules in it even if the state builds you roads it aint got no call to make tasajara creek navigable for ye and as that will cost as much as the road i dont see where the moneys comin from for both  theres water enough in front of lige curtiss shanty and his location is only a mile along the bank returned billings  water enough for him to laze away his time fishin when hes sober and deep enough to drown him when hes drunk said wingate if you call that an embarcadero you kin buy it any day from ligetitle possession and shanty thrown infor a demijohn o whiskey  the fourth man here distastefully threw back a halfnibbled biscuit into the box and languidly slipped from the barrel to the floor fastidiously flicking the crumbs from his clothes as he did so i reckon somebodyll get it for nothing if lige dont pull up mighty soon hell either go off his head with jimjams or jump into the creek hes about as near desprit as they make em and havin no partner to look after him and him alone in the tules ther s no tellin what he may do  billings stretched at full length in his chair here gurgled derisively despritketch him why thats his little game hes jist playin off his desprit condition to frighten sidon whenever any one asks him why he dont go to work whenever hes hard up for a drink whenever hes had too much or too little hes workin that desprit dodge and even talkin o killin himself why look here he continued momentarily raising himself to a sitting posture in his disgust it was only last week he was over at rawletts trying to raise provisions and whiskey outer his water rights on the creek fact sirhad it all written down lawyerlike on paper rawlett didnt exactly see it in that light and told him so then he up with the desprit dodge and began to work that said if he had to starve in a swamp like a dog he might as well kill himself at once and would too if he could afford the weppins johnson said it was not a bad idea and offered to lend him his revolver bilson handed up his shotgun and left it alongside of him and turned his head away consideratelike and thoughtful while rawlett handed him a box of rat pizon over the counter in case he preferred suthin more quiet well what did lige do nothin smiled kinder sickly looked sorter wild and shut up he didnt suicide much no sir he didnt kill himselfnot he why old bixbyand hes a deacon in good standinallowed in liges hearin and for liges benefit that selfdestruction was better nor bad example and proved it by scripture too and yet lige did nothin desprit hes only desprit to laze around and fish all day off a log in the tules and soak up with whiskey until betwixt fever an ague and the jumps he kinder shakes hisself free o responsibility  a long silence followed it was somehow felt that the subject was incongruously exciting billings allowed himself to lapse again behind the back of his chair meantime it had grown so dark that the dull glow of the stove was beginning to outline a faint halo on the ceiling even while it plunged the further lines of shelves behind the counter into greater obscurity  time to light up harkutt aint it said wingate tentatively  well i was reckoning ez its such a wild night there wouldnt be any use keepin open and when you fellows left id just shut up for good and make things fast said harkutt dubiously before his guests had time to fully weigh this delicate hint another gust of wind shook the tenement and even forced the unbolted upper part of the door to yield far enough to admit an eager current of humid air that seemed to justify the wisdom of harkutts suggestion billings slowly and with a sigh assumed a sitting posture in the chair the biscuitnibbler selected a fresh dainty from the counter and wingate abstractedly walked to the window and rubbed the glass sky and water had already disappeared behind a curtain of darkness that was illuminated by a single point of lightthe lamp in the window of some invisible but nearer housewhich threw its rays across the glistening shallows in the road well said wingate buttoning up his coat in slow dejection i reckon i oughter be travelin to help the old woman do the chores before supper he had just recognized the light in his own diningroom and knew by that sign that his longwaiting helpmeet had finally done the chores herself  some folks have it mighty easy said billings with longdrawn discontent as he struggled to his feet youve only a step to go and yers me and peters thereindicating the biscuitnibbler who was beginning to show alarming signs of returning to the barrel againhev got to trapse five times that distance  moren half a mile if it comes to that said peters gloomily he paused in putting on his overcoat as if thinking better of it while even the more fortunate and contiguous wingate languidly lapsed against the counter again  the moment was a critical one billings was evidently also regretfully eying the chair he had just quitted harkutt resolved on a heroic effort  come boys he said with brisk conviviality take a parting drink with me before you go producing a black bottle from some obscurity beneath the counter that smelt strongly of indiarubber boots he placed it with four glasses before his guests each made a feint of holding his glass against the opaque window while filling it although nothing could be seen a sudden tumult of wind and rain again shook the building but even after it had passed the glass door still rattled violently  just see whats loose peters said billings youre nearest it  peters still holding the undrained glass in his hand walked slowly towards it  its suthinor somebody outside he said hesitatingly  the three others came eagerly to his side through the glass clouded from within by their breath and filmed from without by the rain some vague object was moving and what seemed to be a mop of tangled hair was apparently brushing against the pane the door shook again but less strongly billings pressed his face against the glass hol on he said in a quick whisperits lige but it was too late harkutt had already drawn the lower bolt and a man stumbled from the outer obscurity into the darker room  the inmates drew away as he leaned back for a moment against the door that closed behind him then dimly but instinctively discerning the glass of liquor which wingate still mechanically held in his hand he reached forward eagerly took it from wingates surprised and unresisting fingers and drained it at a gulp the four men laughed vaguely but not as cheerfully as they might  i was just shutting up began harkutt dubiously  i wont keep you a minit said the intruder nervously fumbling in the breast pocket of his hickory shirt its a matter of businessharkuttibut he was obliged to stop here to wipe his face and forehead with the ends of a loose handkerchief tied round his throat from the action and what could be seen of his pale exhausted face it was evident that the moisture upon it was beads of perspiration and not the rain which some abnormal heat of his body was converting into vapor from his sodden garments as he stood there  ive got a document here he began again producing a roll of paper tremblingly from his pocket that id like you to glance over and perhaps youdhis voice which had been feverishly exalted here broke and rattled with a cough  billings wingate and peters fell apart and looked out of the window its too dark to read anything now lige said harkutt with evasive good humor and i aint lightin up tonight  but i can tell you the substance of it said the man with a faintness that however had all the distinctness of a whisper if youll just step inside a minute its a matter of importance and a bargain  i reckon we must be goin said billings to the others with marked emphasis were keepin harkutt from shuttin up goodnight goodnight added peters and wingate ostentatiously following billings hurriedly through the door so long  the door closed behind them leaving harkutt alone with his importunate intruder possibly his resentment at his customers selfish abandonment of him at this moment developed a vague spirit of opposition to them and mitigated his feeling towards lige he groped his way to the counter struck a match and lit a candle its feeble rays faintly illuminated the pale drawn face of the applicant set in a tangle of wet unkempt partycolored hair it was not the face of an ordinary drunkard although tremulous and sensitive from some artificial excitement there was no engorgement or congestion in the features or complexion albeit they were morbid and unhealthy the expression was of a suffering that was as much mental as physical and yet in some vague way appeared unmeaningand unheroic  i want to see you about selling my place on the creek i want you to take it off my hands for a bargain i want to get quit of it at once for just enough to take me out o this i dont want any profit only money enough to get away his utterance which had a certain kind of cultivation here grew thick and harsh again and he looked eagerly at the bottle which stood on the counter  look here lige said harkutt not unkindly its too late to do anythin tonight you come in tomorrow he would have added when youre sober but for a traders sense of politeness to a possible customer and probably some doubt of the mans actual condition  god knows where or what i may be tomorrow it would kill me to go back and spend another night as the last if i dont kill myself on the way to do it  harkutts face darkened grimly it was indeed as billings had said the pitiable weakness of the mans manner not only made his desperation inadequate and ineffective but even lent it all the cheapness of acting and as if to accent his simulation of a part his fingers feebly groping in his shirt bosom slipped aimlessly and helplessly from the shining handle of a pistol in his pocket to wander hesitatingly towards the bottle on the counter  harkutt took the bottle poured out a glass of the liquor and pushed it before his companion who drank it eagerly whether it gave him more confidence or his attention was no longer diverted he went on more collectedly and cheerfully and with no trace of his previous desperation in his manner come harkutt buy my place its a bargain i tell you ill sell it cheap i only want enough to get away with give me twentyfive dollars and its yours see theres the papersthe quitclaimall drawn up and signed he drew the roll of paper from his pocket again apparently forgetful of the adjacent weapon  look here lige said harkutt with a businesslike straightening of his lips i aint buyin any land in tasajaraleast of all yours on the creek ive got more invested here already than ill ever get back again but i tell you what ill do you say you cant go back to your shanty well seein how rough it is outside and that the waters of the creek are probably all over the trail by this time i reckon youre about right now theres five dollars he laid down a coin sharply on the counter take that and go over to rawletts and get a bed and some supper in the mornin you may be able to strike up a trade with somebody elseor change your mind how did you get here on your hoss  yes  he aint starved yet  no he can eat grass i cant  either the liquor or harkutts practical unsentimental treatment of the situation seemed to give him confidence he met harkutts eye more steadily as the latter went on you kin turn your hoss for the night into my stock corral next to rawletts itll save you payin for fodder and stablin  the man took up the coin with a certain slow gravity which was almost like dignity thank you he said laying the paper on the counter ill leave that as security  dont want it lige said harkutt pushing it back  id rather leave it  but suppose you have a chance to sell it to somebody at rawletts continued harkutt with a precaution that seemed ironical  i dont think theres much chance of that  he remained quiet looking at harkutt with an odd expression as he rubbed the edge of the coin that he held between his fingers abstractedly on the counter something in his gazerather perhaps the apparent absence of anything in it approximate to the present occasionwas beginning to affect harkutt with a vague uneasiness providentially a resumed onslaught of wind and rain against the panes effected a diversion come he said with brisk practicality youd better hurry on to rawletts before it gets worse have your clothes dried by his fire take suthin to eat and youll be all right he rubbed his hands cheerfully as if summarily disposing of the situation and incidentally of all liges troubles and walked with him to the door nevertheless as the mans look remained unchanged he hesitated a moment with his hand on the handle in the hope that he would say something even if only to repeat his appeal but he did not then harkutt opened the door the man moved mechanically out and at the distance of a few feet seemed to melt into the rain and darkness harkutt remained for a moment with his face pressed against the glass after an interval he thought he heard the faint splash of hoofs in the shallows of the road he opened the door softly and looked out  the light had disappeared from the nearest house only an uncertain bulk of shapeless shadows remained other remoter and more vague outlines near the horizon seemed to have a funereal suggestion of tombs and grave mounds and onea low shed near the roadlooked not unlike a halted bier he hurriedly put up the shutters in a momentary lulling of the wind and reentering the store began to fasten them from within  while thus engaged an inner door behind the counter opened softly and cautiously projecting a brighter light into the deserted apartment from some sacred domestic interior with the warm and wholesome incense of cooking it served to introduce also the equally agreeable presence of a young girl who after assuring herself of the absence of every one but the proprietor idly slipped into the store and placing her rounded elbows from which her sleeves were uprolled upon the counter leaned lazily upon them with both hands supporting her dimpled chin and gazed indolently at him so indolently that with her pretty face once fixed in this comfortable attitude she was constrained to follow his movements with her eyes alone and often at an uncomfortable angle it was evident that she offered the final but charming illustration of the enfeebling listlessness of sidon  so those loafers have gone at last she said meditatively theyll take root here some day pop the idea of three strong men like that lazing round for two mortal hours doin nothin well as if to emphasize her disgust she threw her whole weight upon the counter by swinging her feet from the floor to touch the shelves behind her  mr harkutt only replied by a slight grunt as he continued to screw on the shutters  want me to help you dad she said without moving  mr harkutt muttered something unintelligible which however seemed to imply a negative and her attention here feebly wandered to the roll of paper and she began slowly and lazily to read it aloud  for value received i hereby sell assign and transfer to daniel d harkutt all my right titles and interest in and to the undivided half of quarter section 4 range 5 tasajara townshiphumhum she murmured running her eyes to the bottom of the page why lord its that lige curtis she laughed the idea of him having property why dad you aint been that silly  put down that paper miss he said aggrievedly bring the candle here and help me to find one of these infernal screws thats dropped  the girl indolently disengaged herself from the counter and elijah curtiss transfer and brought the candle to her father the screw was presently found and the last fastening secured supper gettin cold dad she said with a slight yawn her father sympathetically responded by stretching himself from his stooping position and the two passed through the private door into inner domesticity leaving the already forgotten paper lying with other articles of barter on the counter     chaper ii   with the closing of the little door behind them they seemed to have shut out the turmoil and vibration of the storm the reason became apparent when after a few paces they descended half a dozen steps to a lower landing this disclosed the fact that the dwelling part of the sidon general store was quite below the level of the shop and the road and on the slope of the solitary undulation of the tasajara plaina little ravine that fell away to a brawling stream below the only arboreous growth of tasajara clothed its banks in the shape of willows and alders that set compactly around the quaint irregular dwelling which straggled down the ravine and looked upon a slope of bracken and foliage on either side the transition from the black treeless stormswept plain to this sheltered declivity was striking and suggestive from the opposite bank one might fancy that the youthful and original dwelling had ambitiously mounted the crest but appalled at the dreary prospect beyond had gone no further while from the road it seemed as if the fastidious proprietor had tried to draw a line between the vulgar tradingpost with which he was obliged to face the coarser civilization of the place and the privacy of his domestic life the real fact however was that the ravine furnished wood and water and as nature also provided one wall of the houseas in the wellknown example of aboriginal cave dwellingsits peculiar construction commended itself to sidon on the ground of involving little labor  howbeit from the two open windows of the sittingroom which they had entered only the faint pattering of dripping boughs and a slight murmur from the swollen brook indicated the storm that shook the upper plain and the cool breath of laurel syringa and alder was wafted through the neat apartment passing through that pleasant rural atmosphere they entered the kitchen a much larger room which appeared to serve occasionally as a diningroom and where supper was already laid out a stout comfortablelooking womanwho had however a singularly permanent expression of pained sympathy upon her facewelcomed them in tones of gentle commiseration  ah there you be you two now sit ye right down dears do you must be tired out and you phemie love draw up by your poor father therethats right youll be better soon  there was certainly no visible sign of suffering or exhaustion on the part of either father or daughter nor the slightest apparent earthly reason why they should be expected to exhibit any but as already intimated it was part of mrs harkutts generous idiosyncrasy to look upon all humanity as suffering and toiling to be petted humored condoled with and fed it had in the course of years imparted a singularly caressing sadness to her voice and given her the habit of ending her sentences with a melancholy cooing and an unintelligible murmur of agreement it was undoubtedly sincere and sympathetic but at times inappropriate and distressing it had lost her the friendship of the one humorist of tasajara whose best jokes she had received with such heartfelt commiseration and such pained appreciation of the evident labor involved as to reduce him to silence  accustomed as mr harkutt was to his wifes peculiarity he was not above assuming a certain slightly fatigued attitude befitting it yes he said with a vague sigh wheres clemmie  lyin down since dinner she reckoned she wouldnt get up to supper she returned soothingly phemies goin to take her up some sass and tea the poor dear child wants a change  she wants to go to frisco and so do i pop said phemie leaning her elbow half over her fathers plate come pop say dojust for a week  only for a week murmured the commiserating mrs harkutt  perhaps responded harkutt with gloomy sarcasm ye wouldnt mind tellin me how youre goin to get there and where the moneys comin from to take you theres no teamin over tasajara till the rain stops and no money comin in till the ranchmen can move their stuff there aint a hundred dollars in all tasajara at least there aint been the first red cent of it paid across my counter for a fortnit perhaps if you do go you wouldnt mind takin me and the store along with ye and leavin us there  yes dear said mrs harkutt with sympathetic but shameless tergiversation dont bother your poor father phemie love dont you see hes just tired out and youre not eatin anything dad  as mr harkutt was uneasily conscious that he had been eating heartily in spite of his financial difficulties he turned the subject abruptly wheres john milton  mrs harkutt shaded her eyes with her hand and gazed meditatively on the floor before the fire and in the chimney corner for her only son baptized under that historic title he was here a minit ago she said doubtfully i really cant think where hes gone but assuringly it aint far  hes skipped with one o those storybooks hes borrowed said phemie hes always doin it like as not hes reading with a candle in the woodshed well all be burnt up some night  but hes got through his chores interposed mrs harkutt deprecatingly  yes continued harkutt aggrievedly but instead of goin to bed or addin up bills or takin count o stock or even doin sums or suthin useful hes ruinin his eyes and wastin his time over trash he rose and walked slowly into the sittingroom followed by his daughter and a murmur of commiseration from his wife but mrs harkutts ministration for the present did not pass beyond her domain the kitchen  i reckon ye aint expectin anybody tonight phemie said mr harkutt sinking into a chair and placing his slippered feet against the wall  no said phemie unless something possesses that sappy little parmlee to make one of his visitations john milton says that out on the road it blows so you cant stand up its just like that idiot parmlee to be blown in here and not have strength of mind enough to get away again  mr harkutt smiled it was that arch yet approving severe yet satisfied smile with which the deceived male parent usually receives any depreciation of the ordinary young man by his daughters euphemia was no giddy thing to be carried away by young mens attentionsnot she sitting back comfortably in his rockingchair he said play something  the young girl went to the closet and took from the top shelf an excessively ornamented accordionthe opulent gift of a reckless admirer it was so inordinately decorated so gorgeous in the blaze of papier mache motherofpearl and tortoiseshell on keys and keyboard and so ostentatiously radiant in the pink silk of its bellows that it seemed to overawe the plainly furnished room with its splendors you ought to keep it on the table in a glass vase phemie said her father admiringly  and have him think i worshiped it not me indeed hes conceited enough already she returned saucily  mr harkutt again smiled his approbation then deliberately closed his eyes and threw his head back in comfortable anticipation of the coming strains  it is to be regretted that in brilliancy finish and even cheerfulness of quality they were not up to the suggestions of the keys and keyboard the most discreet and cautious effort on the part of the young performer seemed only to produce startlingly unexpected but instantly suppressed complaints from the instrument accompanied by impatient interjections of no no from the girl herself nevertheless with her pretty eyebrows knitted in some charming distress of memory her little mouth half open between an apologetic smile and the exertion of working the bellows with her white rounded arms partly lifted up and waving before her she was pleasantly distracting to the eye gradually as the scattered strains were marshaled into something like an air she began to sing also glossing over the instrumental weaknesses filling in certain dropped notes and omissions and otherwise assisting the ineffectual accordion with a youthful but not unmusical voice the song was a lugubrious religious chant under its influence the house seemed to sink into greater quiet permitting in the intervals the murmur of the swollen creek to appear more distinct and even the far moaning of the wind on the plain to become faintly audible at last having fairly mastered the instrument phemie got into the full swing of the chant unconstrained by any criticism carried away by the sound of her own voice and perhaps a youthful love for mere uproar or possibly desirous to drown her fathers voice which had unexpectedly joined in with a discomposing bass the conjoined utterances seemed to threaten the frail structure of their dwelling even as the gale had distended the store behind them when they ceased at last it was in an accession of dripping from the apparently stirred leaves outside and then a voice evidently from the moist depths of the abyss below called out  hullo there  phemie put down the accordion said whos that now went to the window lazily leaned her elbows on the sill and peered into the darkness nothing was to be seen the open space of dimly outlined landscape had that blank uncommunicative impenetrability with which nature always confronts and surprises us at such moments it seemed to phemie that she was the only human being present yet after the feeling had passed she fancied she heard the wash of the current against some object in the stream half stationary and half resisting  is any one down there is that you mr parmlee she called  there was a pause some invisible auditor said to another its a young lady then the first voice rose again in a more deferential tone are we anywhere near sidon  this is sidon answered harkutt who had risen and was now quite obliterating his daughters outline at the window  thank you said the voice can we land anywhere here on this bank  run down pop theyre strangers said the girl with excited almost childish eagerness  hold on called out harkutt ill be thar in a moment he hastily thrust his feet into a pair of huge boots clapped on an oilskin hat and waterproof and disappeared through a door that led to a lower staircase phemie still at the window albeit with a newly added sense of selfconsciousness hung out breathlessly presently a beam of light from the lower depths of the house shot out into the darkness it was her father with a bullseye lantern as he held it up and clambered cautiously down the bank its rays fell upon the turbid rushing stream and what appeared to be a rough raft of logs held with difficulty against the bank by two men with long poles in its centre was a roll of blankets a valise and saddlebags and the shining brasses of some oddlooking instruments  as mr harkutt supporting himself by a willow branch that overhung the current held up the lantern the two men rapidly transferred their freight from the raft to the bank and leaped ashore the action gave an impulse to the raft which no longer held in position by the poles swung broadside to the current and was instantly swept into the darkness  not a word had been spoken but now the voices of the men rose freely together phemie listened with intense expectation the explanation was simple they were surveyors who had been caught by the overflow on tasajara plain had abandoned their horses on the bank of tasajara creek and with a hastily constructed raft had intrusted themselves and their instruments to the current but said harkutt quickly there is no connection between tasajara creek and this stream  the two men laughed there is now said one of them  but tasajara creek is a part of the bay said the astonished harkutt and this stream rises inland and only runs into the bay four miles lower down and i dont see how  youre almost twelve feet lower here than tasajara creek said the first man with a certain professional authority and thats why theres more water than tasajara creek can carry and its seeking the bay this way look he continued taking the lantern from harkutts hand and casting its rays on the stream thats salt drift from the upper bay and part of tasajara creeks running by your house now dont be alarmed he added reassuringly glancing at the staring storekeeper youre all right here this is only the overflow and will find its level soon  but mr harkutt remained gazing abstractedly at the smiling speaker from the window above the impatient phemie was wondering why he kept the strangers waiting in the rain while he talked about things that were perfectly plain it was so like a man  then theres a waterway straight to tasajara creek he said slowly  there is as long as this flood lasts returned the first speaker promptly and a cutting through the bank of two or three hundred yards would make it permanent well whats the matter with that  nothin said harkutt hurriedly i am only considerin but come in dry yourselves and take suthin  the light over the rushing water was withdrawn and the whole prospect sank back into profound darkness mr harkutt had disappeared with his guests then there was the familiar shuffle of his feet on the staircase followed by other more cautious footsteps that grew delicately and even courteously deliberate as they approached at which the young girl in some new sense of decorum drew in her pretty head glanced around the room quickly reset the tidy on her fathers chair placed the resplendent accordion like an ornament in the exact centre of the table and then vanished into the hall as mr harkutt entered with the strangers  they were both of the same age and appearance but the principal speaker was evidently the superior of his companion and although their attitude to each other was equal and familiar it could be easily seen that he was the leader he had a smooth beardless face with a critical expression of eye and mouth that might have been fastidious and supercilious but for the kindly humorous perception that tempered it his quick eye swept the apartment and then fixed itself upon the accordion but a smile lit up his face as he said quietly  i hope we havent frightened the musician away it was bad enough to have interrupted the young lady  no no said mr harkutt who seemed to have lost his abstraction in the nervousness of hospitality i reckon shes only lookin after her sick sister but come into the kitchen both of you straight off and while youre dryin your clothes motherll fix you suthin hot  we only need to change our boots and stockings weve some dry ones in our pack downstairs said the first speaker hesitatingly  ill fetch em up and you can change in the kitchen the old woman wont mind said harkutt reassuringly come along he led the way to the kitchen the two strangers exchanged a glance of humorous perplexity and followed  the quiet of the little room was once more unbroken a faroff commiserating murmur indicated that mrs harkutt was receiving her guests the cool breath of the wet leaves without slightly stirred the white dimity curtains and somewhere from the darkened eaves there was a still somnolent drip presently a hurried whisper and a halflaugh appeared to be suppressed in the outer passage or hall there was another moment of hesitation and the door opened suddenly and ostentatiously disclosing phemie with a taller and slighter young woman her elder sister at her side perceiving that the room was empty they both said oh yet with a certain artificiality of manner that was evidently a lingering trace of some previous formal attitude they had assumed then without further speech they each selected a chair and a position having first shaken out their dresses and gazed silently at each other  it may be said briefly that sitting thusin spite of their unnatural attitude or perhaps rather because of its suggestion of a photographic posethey made a striking picture and strongly accented their separate peculiarities they were both pretty but the taller girl apparently the elder had an ideal refinement and regularity of feature which was not only unlike phemie but gratuitously unlike the rest of her family and as hopelessly and even wantonly inconsistent with her surroundings as was the elaborately ornamented accordion on the centretable she was one of those occasional creatures episodical in the south and west who might have been stamped with some vague antenatal impression of a mother given to oversentimental contemplation of books of beauty and albums rather than the family features offspring of typical men and women and yet themselves incongruous to any known local or even general type the long swanlike neck tendriled hair swimming eyes and small patrician head had never lived or moved before in tasajara or the west nor perhaps even existed except as a personified constancy meditation or the barons bride in mezzotint or copperplate even the girls common pink print dress with its high sleeves and shoulders could not conventionalize these original outlines and the hand that rested stiffly on the back of her chair albeit neither overwhite nor well kept looked as if it had never held anything but a lyre a rose or a good book even the few sprays of wild jessamine which she had placed in the coils of her waving hair although a local fashion became her as a special ornament  the two girls kept their constrained and artificially elaborated attitude for a few moments accompanied by the murmur of voices in the kitchen the monotonous drip of the eaves before the window and the faroff sough of the wind then phemie suddenly broke into a constrained giggle which she however quickly smothered as she had the accordion and with the same look of mischievous distress  im astonished at you phemie said clementina in a deep contralto voice which seemed even deeper from its restraint you dont seem to have any sense anybodyd think you never had seen a stranger before  saw him before you did retorted phemie pertly but here a pushing of chairs and shuffling of feet in the kitchen checked her clementina fixed an abstracted gaze on the ceiling phemie regarded a leaf on the window sill with photographic rigidity as the door opened to the strangers and her father  the look of undisguised satisfaction which lit the young mens faces relieved mr harkutts awkward introduction of any embarrassment and almost before phemie was fully aware of it she found herself talking rapidly and in a high key with mr lawrence grant the surveyor while her sister was equally although more sedately occupied with mr stephen rice his assistant but the enthusiasm of the strangers and the desire to please and be pleased was so genuine and contagious that presently the accordion was brought into requisition and mr grant exhibited a surprising faculty of accompaniment to mr rices tenor in which both the girls joined  then a game of cards with partners followed into which the rival parties introduced such delightful and shameless obviousness of cheating and displayed such fascinating and exaggerated partisanship that the game resolved itself into a hilarious melee to which peace was restored only by an exhibition of tricks of legerdemain with the cards by the young surveyor all of which mr harkutt supervised patronizingly with occasional fits of abstraction from his rockingchair and later mrs harkutt from her kitchen threshold wiping her arms on her apron and commiseratingly observing that she declared the young folks looked better already  but it was here a more dangerous element of mystery and suggestion was added by mr lawrence grant in the telling of miss euphemias fortune from the cards before him and that young lady pink with excitement fluttered her little hands not unlike timid birds over the cards to be drawn taking them from him with an audible twitter of anxiety and great doubts whether a certain fairhaired gentleman was in hearts or diamonds  here are two strangers said mr grant with extraordinary gravity laying down the cards and here is a journey this is unexpected news and this ten of diamonds means great wealth to you which you see follows the advent of the two strangers and is some way connected with them  oh indeed said the young lady with great pertness and a toss of her head i suppose theyve got the money with them  no though it reaches you through them he answered with unflinching solemnity wait a bit i have it i see ive made a mistake with this card it signifies a journey or a road queer isnt it steve its the road  it is queer said rice with equal gravity but its so the road sure nevertheless he looked up into the large eyes of clementina with a certain confidential air of truthfulness  you see ladies continued the surveyor appealing to them with unabashed rigidity of feature the cards dont lie luckily we are in a position to corroborate them the road in question is a secret known only to us and some capitalists in san francisco in fact even they dont know that it is feasible until we report to them but i dont mind telling you now as a slight return for your charming hospitality that the road is a railroad from oakland to tasajara creek of which weve just made the preliminary survey so you see what the cards mean is this youre not far from tasajara creek in fact with a very little expense your father could connect this stream with the creek and have a waterway straight to the railroad terminus thats the wealth the cards promise and if your father knows how to take a hint he can make his fortune  it was impossible to say which was the most dominant in the face of the speaker the expression of assumed gravity or the twinkling of humor in his eyes the two girls with superior feminine perception divined that there was much truth in what he said albeit they didnt entirely understand it and what they did understandexcept the mans goodhumored motivewas not particularly interesting in fact they were slightly disappointed what had promised to be an audaciously flirtatious declaration and even a mischievous suggestion of marriage had resolved itself into something absurdly practical and businesslike  not so mr harkutt he quickly rose from his chair and leaning over the table with his eyes fixed on the card as if it really signified the railroad repeated quickly railroad eh whats that a railroad to tasajara creek ye dont mean itthat isit aint a sure thing  perfectly sure the money is ready in san francisco now and by this time next year  a railroad to tasajara creek continued harkutt hurriedly what part of it where  at the embarcadero naturally responded grant there isnt but the one place for the terminus theres an old shanty there now belongs to somebody  why pop said phemie with sudden recollection aint it lige curtiss house the land he offered  hush said her father  you know the one written in that bit of paper continued the innocent phemie  hush will you god amighty are you goin to mind me are you goin to keep up your jabber when im speakin to the gentlemen is that your manners what next i wonder  the sudden and unexpected passion of the speaker the incomprehensible change in his voice and the utterly disproportionate exaggeration of his attitude towards his daughters enforced an instantaneous silence the rain began to drip audibly at the window the rush of the river sounded distinctly from without even the shaking of the front part of the dwelling by the distant gale became perceptible an angry flash sprang for an instant to the young assistants eye but it met the cautious glance of his friend and together both discreetly sought the table the two girls alone remained white and collected will you go on with my fortune mr grant said phemie quietly  a certain respect perhaps not before observable was suggested in the surveyors tone as he smilingly replied certainly i was only waiting for you to show your confidence in me and took up the cards  mr harkutt coughed it looks as if that blamed wind had blown suthin loose in the store he said affectedly i reckon ill go and see he hesitated a moment and then disappeared in the passage yet even here he stood irresolute looking at the closed door behind him and passing his hand over his still flushed face presently he slowly and abstractedly ascended the flight of steps entered the smaller passage that led to the back door of the shop and opened it  he was at first a little startled at the halo of light from the still glowing stove which the greater obscurity of the long room had heightened rather than diminished then he passed behind the counter but here the box of biscuits which occupied the centre and cast a shadow over it compelled him to grope vaguely for what he sought then he stopped suddenly the paper he had just found dropping from his fingers and said sharply  whos there  me pop  john milton  yes sir  what the devil are you doin there sir  readin  it was true the boy was half reclining in a most distorted posture on two chairs his figure in deep shadow but his book was raised above his head so as to catch the red glow of the stove on the printed page even then his fathers angry interruption scarcely diverted his preoccupation he raised himself in his chair mechanically with his eyes still fixed on his book seeing which his father quickly regained the paper but continued his objurgation  how dare you clear off to bed will you do you hear me pretty goins on he added as if to justify his indignation sneakin in here andand lyin round at this time o night why if i hadnt come in here to  what asked the boy mechanically catching vaguely at the unfinished sentence and staring automatically at the paper in his fathers hand  nothin sir go to bed i tell you will you what are you standin gawpin at continued harkutt furiously  the boy regained his feet slowly and passed his father but not without noticing with the same listless yet ineffaceable perception of childhood that he was hurriedly concealing the paper in his pocket with the same youthful inconsequence wondering at this more than at the interruption which was no novel event he went slowly out of the room  harkutt listened to the retreating tread of his bare feet in the passage and then carefully locked the door taking the paper from his pocket and borrowing the idea he had just objurgated in his son he turned it towards the dull glow of the stove and attempted to read it but perhaps lacking the patience as well as the keener sight of youth he was forced to relight the candle which he had left on the counter and reperused the paper yes there was certainly no mistake here was the actual description of the property which the surveyor had just indicated as the future terminus of the new railroad and here it was conveyed to himdaniel harkutt what was that somebody knocking what did this continual interruption mean an odd superstitious fear now mingled with his irritation  the sound appeared to come from the front shutters it suddenly occurred to him that the light might be visible through the crevices he hurriedly extinguished it and went to the door  whos there  mepeters want to speak to you  mr harkutt with evident reluctance drew the bolts the wind still boisterous and besieging did the rest and precipitately propelled peters through the carefully guarded opening but his surprise at finding himself in the darkness seemed to forestall any explanation of his visit  well he said with an odd mingling of reproach and suspicion i declare i saw a light here just this minit thats queer  yes i put it out just now i was goin away replied harkutt with illdisguised impatience  what been here ever since  no said harkutt curtly  well i want to speak to ye about lige seein the candle shinin through the chinks i thought he might be still with ye if he aint it looks bad light up cant ye i want to show you something  there was a peremptoriness in his tone that struck harkutt disagreeably but observing that he was carrying something in his hand he somewhat nervously relit the candle and faced him peters had a hat in his hand it was liges  bout an hour after we fellers left here said peters i heard the rattlin of hoofs on the road and then it seemed to stop just by my house i went out with a lantern and darn my skin if there warnt liges hoss the saddle empty and lige nowhere i looked round and called himbut nothing were to be seen thinkin he might have slipped offtho ez a general rule drunken men dont and he is a good rideri followed down the road lookin for him i kept on follerin it down to your run half a mile below  but began harkutt with a quick nervous laugh you dont reckon that because of that he  hold on said peters grimly producing a revolver from his sidepocket with the stock and barrel clogged and streaked with mud i found that tooand look one barrel discharged and he added hurriedly as approaching a climax look yewhat i natrally took for wet from the raininside that hatwasblood  nonsense said harkutt putting the hat aside with a new fastidiousness you dont think  i think said peters lowering his voice i think by god hes bin and done it  no  sure oh its all very well for billings and the rest of that conceited crowd to sneer and sling their ideas of lige genrally as they did jess now herebut id like em to see that it was difficult to tell if mr peters triumphant delight in confuting his late companions theories had not even usurped in his mind the importance of the news he brought as it had of any human sympathy with it  look here returned harkutt earnestly yet with a singularly cleared brow and a more natural manner you ought to take them things over to squire kerbys right off and show em to him you kin tell him how you left lige here and say that i can prove by my daughter that he went away about ten minutes afterat least not more than fifteen like all unprofessional humanity mr harkutt had an exaggerated conception of the majesty of unimportant detail in the eye of the law id go with you myself he added quickly but ive got companystrangershere  how did he look when he leftkinder wild suggested peters  harkutt had begun to feel the prudence of present reticence well he said cautiously you saw how he looked  you wasnt rough with himthat might have sent him off you know said peters  no said harkutt forgetting himself in a quick indignation no i not only treated him to another drink but gave himhe stopped suddenly and awkwardly  eh said peters  some good adviceyou know said harkutt hastily but come youd better hurry over to the squires you know youve made the discovery your evidence is important and theres a law that obliges you to give information at once  the excitement of discovery and the triumph over his disputants being spent peters after the sidon fashion evidently did not relish activity as a duty you know he said dubiously he mightnt be dead after all  harkutt became a trifle distant you know your own opinion of the thing he replied after a pause youve circumstantial evidence enough to see the squire and set others to work on it and he added significantly youve done your share then and can wipe your hands of it eh  thats so said peters eagerly ill just run over to the squire  and on account of the women folks you know and the strangers here ill say nothin about it tonight added harkutt  peters nodded his head and taking up the hat of the unfortunate elijah with a certain hesitation as if he feared it had already lost its dramatic intensity as a witness disappeared into the storm and darkness again a lurking gust of wind lying in ambush somewhere seemed to swoop down on him as if to prevent further indecision and whirl him away in the direction of the justices house and mr harkutt shut the door bolted it and walked aimlessly back to the counter  from a slow deliberate and cautious man he seemed to have changed within an hour to an irresolute and capricious one he took the paper from his pocket and unlocking the money drawer of his counter folded into a small compass that which now seemed to be the last testament of elijah curtis and placed it in a recess then he went to the back door and paused then returned reopened the money drawer took out the paper and again buttoned it in his hip pocket standing by the stove and staring abstractedly at the dull glow of the fire he even went through the mechanical process of raking down the ashessolely to gain time and as an excuse for delaying some other necessary action  he was thinking what he should do had the question of his right to retain and make use of that paper been squarely offered to him an hour ago he would without doubt have decided that he ought not to keep it even now looking at it as an abstract principle he did not deceive himself in the least but nature has the reprehensible habit of not presenting these questions to us squarely and fairly and it is remarkable that in most of our offending the abstract principle is never the direct issue mr harkutt was conscious of having been unwillingly led step by step into a difficult not to say dishonest situation and against his own seeking he had never asked elijah to sell him the property he had distinctly declined it it had even been forced upon him as security for the pittance he so freely gave him this proved to himself that he himself was honest it was only the circumstances that were queer of course if elijah had lived he harkutt might have tried to drive some bargain with him before the news of the railroad survey came outfor that was only business but now that elijah was dead who would be a penny the worse or better but himself if he chose to consider the whole thing as a lucky speculation and his gift of five dollars as the price he paid for it nobody could think that he had calculated upon liges suicide any more than that the property would become valuable in fact if it came to that if lige had really contemplated killing himself as a hopeless bankrupt after taking harkutts money as a loan it was a swindle on hisharkuttsgoodnature he worked himself into a rage which he felt was innately virtuous at this tyranny of cold principle over his own warmhearted instincts but if it came to the law hed stand by law and not sentiment hed just let themby which he vaguely meant the world tasajara and possibly his own consciencesee that he wasnt a sentimental fool and hed freeze on to that paper and that property  only he ought to have spoken out before he ought to have told the surveyor at once that he owned the land he ought to have said why thats my land i bought it of that drunken lige curtis for a song and out of charity yes that was the only real trouble and that came from his own goodness his own extravagant sense of justice and righthis own cursed goodnature yet on second thoughts he didnt know why he was obliged to tell the surveyor time enough when the company wanted to buy the land as soon as it was settled that lige was dead hed openly claim the property but what if he wasnt dead or they couldnt find his body or he had only disappeared his plain matteroffact face contracted and darkened of course he couldnt ask the company to wait for him to settle that point he had the power to dispose of the property under that paper andhe should do it if lige turned up that was another matter and he and lige could arrange it between them he was quite firm here and oddly enough quite relieved in getting rid of what appeared only a simple question of detail he never suspected that he was contemplating the one irretrievable step and summarily dismissing the whole ethical question  he turned away from the stove opened the back door and walked with a more determined step through the passage to the sittingroom but here he halted again on the threshold with a quick return of his old habits of caution the door was slightly open apparently his angry outbreak of an hour ago had not affected the spirits of his daughters for he could hear their hilarious voices mingling with those of the strangers they were evidently still fortunetelling but this time it was the prophetic and divining accents of mr rice addressed to clementina which were now plainly audible  i see heaps of money and a great many friends in the change that is coming to you dear me how many suitors but i cannot promise you any marriage as brilliant as my friend has just offered your sister you may be certain however that youll have your own choice in this as you have in all things  thank you for nothing said clementinas voice but what are those horrid black cards beside themthats trouble im sure  not for you though near you perhaps some one you dont care much for and dont understand will have a heap of trouble on your accountyes on account of these very riches see he follows the ten of diamonds it may be a suitor it may be some one now in the house perhaps  he means himself miss clementina struck in grants voice laughingly  youre not listening miss harkutt said rice with halfserious reproach perhaps you know who it is  but miss clementinas reply was simply a hurried recognition of her fathers pale face that here suddenly confronted her with the opening door  why its father     chaper iii   in his strange mental condition even the change from harkutts feeble candle to the outer darkness for a moment blinded elijah curtis yet it was part of that mental condition that he kept moving steadily forward as in a trance or dream though at first purposelessly then it occurred to him that he was really looking for his horse and that the animal was not there this for a moment confused and frightened him first with the supposition that he had not brought him at all but that it was part of his delusion secondly with the conviction that without his horse he could neither proceed on the course suggested by harkutt nor take another more vague one that was dimly in his mind yet in his hopeless vacillation it seemed a relief that now neither was practicable and that he need do nothing perhaps it was a mysterious providence  the explanation however was much simpler the horse had been taken by the luxurious and indolent billings unknown to his companions overcome at the dreadful prospect of walking home in that weather this perfect product of lethargic sidon had artfully allowed peters and wingate to precede him and cautiously unloosing the tethered animal had safely passed them in the darkness when he gained his own inclosure he had lazily dismounted and with a sharp cut on the mustangs haunches sent him galloping back to rejoin his master with what result has been already told by the unsuspecting peters in the preceding chapter  yet no conception of this possibility entered lige curtiss alcoholized consciousness part of whose morbid phantasy it was to distort or exaggerate all natural phenomena he had a vague idea that he could not go back to harkutts already his visit seemed to have happened long long ago and could not be repeated he would walk on enwrapped in this uncompromising darkness which concealed everything suggested everything and was responsible for everything  it was very dark for the wind having lulled no longer thinned the veil of clouds above nor dissipated a steaming mist that appeared to rise from the sodden plain yet he moved easily through the darkness seeming to be upheld by it as something tangible upon which he might lean at times he thought he heard voicesnot a particular voice he was thinking of but strange voicesof course unreal to his present fancy and then he heard one of these voices unlike any voice in sidon and very faint and far off asking if it was anywhere near sidonevidently some one lost like himself he answered in a voice that seemed quite as unreal and as faint and turned in the direction from which it came there was a light moving like a willothewisp far before him yet below him as if coming out of the depths of the earth it must be fancy but he would seeah  he had fallen violently forward and at the same moment felt his revolver leap from his breast pocket like a living thing and an instant after explode upon the rock where it struck blindingly illuminating the declivity down which he was plunging the sulphurous sting of burning powder was in his eyes and nose yet in that swift revealing flash he had time to clutch the stems of a trailing vine beside him but not to save his head from sharp contact with the same rocky ledge that had caught his pistol the pain and shock gave way to a sickening sense of warmth at the roots of his hair giddy and faint his fingers relaxed he felt himself sinking with a languor that was half acquiescence down downuntil with another shock a wild gasping for air and a swift reaction he awoke in the cold rushing water  clear and perfectly conscious now though frantically fighting for existence with the current he could dimly see a floating black object shooting by the shore at times striking the projections of the bank until in its recoil it swung half round and drifted broadside on towards him he was near enough to catch the frayed ends of a trailing rope that fastened the structure which seemed to be a few logs together with a convulsive effort he at last gained a footing upon it and then fell fainting along its length it was the raft which the surveyors from the embarcadero had just abandoned  he did not know this nor would he have thought it otherwise strange that a raft might be a part of the drift of the overflow even had he been entirely conscious but his senses were failing though he was still able to keep a secure position on the raft and to vaguely believe that it would carry him to some relief and succor how long he lay unconscious he never knew in his afterrecollections of that night it seemed to have been haunted by dreams of passing dim banks and strange places of a face and voice that had been pleasant to him of a terror coming upon him as he appeared to be nearing a place like that home that he had abandoned in the lonely tules he was roused at last by a violent headache as if his soft felt hat had been changed into a tightening crown of iron lifting his hand to his head to tear off its covering he was surprised to find that he was wearing no hat but that his matted hair stiffened and dried with blood and ooze was clinging like a cap to his skull in the hot morning sunlight his eyelids and lashes were glued together and weighted down by the same sanguinary plaster he crawled to the edge of his frail raft not without difficulty for it oscillated and rocked strangely and dipped his hand in the current when he had cleared his eyes he lifted them with a shock of amazement creeks banks and plain had disappeared he was alone on a bend of the tossing bay of san francisco  his first and only sensecleared by fasting and quickened by reactionwas one of infinite relief he was not only free from the vague terrors of the preceding days and nights but his whole past seemed to be lost and sunk forever in this illimitable expanse the low plain of tasajara with its steadfast monotony of light and shadow had sunk beneath another level but one that glistened sparkled was instinct with varying life and moved and even danced below him the low palisades of regularly recurring tules that had fenced in impeded but never relieved the blankness of his horizon were forever swallowed up behind him all trail of past degradation all record of pain and suffering all footprints of his wandering and misguided feet were smoothly wiped out in that obliterating sea he was physically helpless and he felt it he was in danger and he knew itbut he was free  happily there was but little wind and the sea was slight the raft was still intact so far as he could judge but even in his ignorance he knew it would scarcely stand the surges of the lower bay like most californians who had passed the straits of carquinez at night in a steamer he did not recognize the locality nor even the distant peak of tamalpais there were a few dotting sails that seemed as remote as uncertain and as unfriendly as sea birds the raft was motionless almost as motionless as he was in his cramped limbs and sundried stiffened clothes too weak to keep an upright position without mast stick or oar to lift a signal above that vast expanse it seemed impossible for him to attract attention even his pistol was gone  suddenly in an attempt to raise himself he was struck by a flash so blinding that it seemed to pierce his aching eyes and brain and turned him sick it appeared to come from a crevice between the logs at the further end of the raft creeping painfully towards it he saw that it was a triangular slip of highly polished metal that he had hitherto overlooked he did not know that it was a flashing mirror used in topographical observation which had slipped from the surveyors instruments when they abandoned the raft but his excited faculties instinctively detected its value to him he lifted it and facing the sun raised it at different angles with his feeble arms but the effort was too much for him the raft presently seemed to be whirling with his movement and he again fell    ahoy there  the voice was close uponin his very ears he opened his eyes the sea still stretched emptily before him the dotting sails still unchanged and distant yet a strange shadow lay upon the raft he turned his head with difficulty on the opposite sideso close upon him as to be almost over his headthe great white sails of a schooner hovered above him like the wings of some enormous sea bird then a heavy boom swung across the raft so low that it would have swept him away had he been in an upright position the sides of the vessel grazed the raft and she fell slowly off a terrible fear of abandonment took possession of him he tried to speak but could not the vessel moved further away but the raft followed he could see now it was being held by a boathookcould see the odd eager curiosity on two faces that were raised above the taffrail and with that sense of relief his eyes again closed in unconsciousness  a feeling of chilliness followed by a grateful sensation of drawing closer under some warm covering a stinging taste in his mouth of fiery liquor and the aromatic steam of hot coffee were his first returning sensations his head and neck were swathed in coarse bandages and his skin stiffened and smarting with soap he was lying in a rude berth under a halfdeck from which he could see the sky and the bellying sail and presently a bearded face filled with rough and practical concern that peered down upon him  hulloo comin round eh hold on the next moment the stranger had leaped down beside elijah he seemed to be an odd mingling of the sailor and ranchero with the shrewdness of a seaport trader  hulloo boss what was it a free fight or a washout  a washout elijah grasped the idea as an inspiration yes his cabin had been inundated he had taken to a raft had been knocked off twice or thrice and had lost everythingeven his revolver        a mining term for the temporary inundation of a claim by      flood also used for the sterilizing effect of flood on      fertile soil  the man looked relieved then it aint a free fight nor havin your crust busted and bein robbed by beach combers eh  no said elijah with his first faint smile  glad o that said the man bluntly then thar aint no police business to tie up to in frisco we were stuck thar a week once just because we chanced to pick up a feller whod been found gagged and then thrown overboard by wharf thieves had to dance attendance at court thar and lost our trip he stopped and looked halfpathetically at the prostrate elijah look yer ye aint just dyin to go ashore now and see yer friends and send messages are ye  elijah shuddered inwardly but outwardly smiled faintly as he replied no  and the tide and wind jest servin us now ye wouldnt mind keepin straight on with us this trip  where to asked elijah  santy barbara  no said elijah after a moments pause ill go with you  the man leaped to his feet lifted his head above the upper deck shouted let her go free jerry and then turned gratefully to his passenger look yer a washout is a washout i reckon put it any way you like it dont put anything back into the land or anything back into your pocket afterwards eh no and yer well out of it pardner now theres a right smart chance for locatin jest back of santy barbara where thar aint no godforsaken tules to overflow and ez far ez the land and licker lies ye neednt take any water in yours ef ye dont want it you kin start fresh thar pardner and brail up whats the matter with you old man is only fever n agur ketched in them tules i kin see it in your eyes now you hold on whar you be till i go forrard and see everything taut and then ill come back and well have a talk  and they did the result of which was that at the end of a weeks tossing and seasickness elijah curtis was landed at santa barbara pale thin but selfcontained and resolute and having found favor in the eyes of the skipper of the kitty hawk general trader lumberdealer and ranchman a week later he was located on the skippers land and installed in the skippers service and from that day for five years sidon and tasajara knew him no more     chaper iv   it was part of the functions of john milton harkutt to take down the early morning shutters and sweep out the store for his father each day before going to school it was a peculiarity of this performance that he was apt to linger over it partly from the fact that it put off the evil hour of lessons partly that he imparted into the process a purely imaginative and romantic element gathered from his latest novelreading in this he was usually assisted by one or two schoolfellows on their way to school who always envied him his superior menial occupation to go to school it was felt was a common calamity of boyhood that called into play only the simplest forms of evasion whereas to take down actual shutters in a bona fide store and wield a real broom that raised a palpable cloud of dust was something that really taxed the noblest exertions and it was the morning after the arrival of the strangers that john milton stood on the veranda of the store ostentatiously examining the horizon with his hand shading his eyes as one of his companions appeared  hollo milt wot yer doin  john milton started dramatically and then violently dashed at one of the shutters and began to detach it ha he said hoarsely clear the ship for action open the ports on deck there steady you lubbers in an instant his enthusiastic schoolfellow was at his side attacking another shutter a long low schooner bearing down upon us lively lads lively continued john milton desisting a moment to take another dramatic look at the distant plain how does she head now he demanded fiercely  sou by soueast sir responded the other boy frantically dancing before the window but shell weather it  they each then wrested another shutter away violently depositing them as they ran to and fro in a rack at the corner of the veranda added to an extraordinary and unnecessary clattering with their feet they accompanied their movements with a singular hissing sound supposed to indicate in one breath the fury of the elements the bustle of the eager crew and the wild excitement of the coming conflict when the last shutter was cleared away john milton with the cry man the starboard guns dashed into the store whose floor was marked by the muddy footprints of yesterdays buyers seized a broom and began to sweep violently a cloud of dust arose into which his companion at once precipitated himself with another broom and a loud bang to indicate the somewhat belated sound of cannon for a few seconds the two boys plied their brooms desperately in that stifling atmosphere accompanying each long sweep and puff of dust out of the open door with the report of explosions and loud has of defiance until not only the store but the veranda was obscured with a cloud which the morning sun struggled vainly to pierce in the midst of this tumult and dusty confusionhappily unheard and unsuspected in the secluded domestic interior of the buildinga shrill little voice arose from the road  think youre mighty smart dont ye  the two naval heroes stopped in their imaginary fury and as the dust of conflict cleared away recognized little johnny peters gazing at them with mingled inquisitiveness and envy  guess ye dont know what happened down the run last night he continued impatiently lige curtis got killed or killed hisself blood all over the rock down thar seed it myseff dad picked up his sixshooterone barrel gone off my dad was the first to find it out and hes bin to squire kerby tellin him  the two companions albeit burning with curiosity affected indifference and preknowledge  dad sez your father druv lige outer the store lass night dad sez your fathers sponsible dad sez your father ez good ez killed him dad sez the squirell set the constable on your father yah but here the small insulter incontinently fled pursued by both the boys nevertheless when he had made good his escape john milton showed neither a disposition to take up his former nautical role nor to follow his companion to visit the sanguinary scene of elijahs disappearance he walked slowly back to the store and continued his work of sweeping and putting in order with an abstracted regularity and no trace of his former exuberant spirits  the first one of those instinctive fears which are common to imaginative children and often assume the functions of premonition had taken possession of him the oddity of his fathers manner the evening before which had only half consciously made its indelible impression on his sensitive fancy had recurred to him with johnny peterss speech he had no idea of literally accepting the boys charges he scarcely understood their gravity but he had a miserable feeling that his fathers anger and excitement last night was because he had been discovered hunting in the dark for that paper of lige curtiss it was lige curtiss paper for he had seen it lying there a sudden dreadful conviction came over him that he must never never let any one know that he had seen his father take up that paper that he must never admit it even to him it was not the boys first knowledge of that attitude of hypocrisy which the grownup world assumes towards childhood and in which the innocent victims eventually acquiesce with a machiavellian subtlety that at last avenges thembut it was his first knowledge that that hypocrisy might not be so innocent his father had concealed something from him because it was not right  but if childhood does not forget it seldom broods and is not above being diverted and the two surveyorsof whose heroic advent in a raft john milton had only heard that morning with their traveled ways their strange instruments and stranger talk captured his fancy kept in the background by his sisters when visitors came as an unpresentable feature in the household he however managed to linger near the strangers when in company with euphemia and clementina after breakfast they strolled beneath the sparkling sunlight in the rude garden inclosure along the sloping banks of the creek it was with the average brothers supreme contempt that he listened to his sisters practicin upon the goodness of these superior beings it was with an exceptional pity that he regarded the evident admiration of the strangers in return he felt that in the case of euphemia who sometimes evinced a laudable curiosity in his pleasures and a flattering ignorance of his reading this might be pardonable but what any one could find in the useless statuesque clementina passed his comprehension could they not see at once that she was just that kind of person who would lie abed in the morning pretending she was sick in order to make phemie do the housework and make him john milton clean her boots and fetch things for her was it not perfectly plain to them that her present sickening politeness was solely with a view to extract from them caramels rockcandy and gum drops which she would meanly keep herself and perhaps some buggyriding later alas john milton it was not for standing there with her tall perfectlyproportioned figure outlined against a willow an elastic branch of which she had drawn down by one curved arm above her head and on which she leanedas everybody leaned against something in sidonthe two young men saw only a straying goddess in a glorified rosebud print whether the clearlycut profile presented to rice or the full face that captivated grant each suggested possibilities of position pride poetry and passion that astonished while it fascinated them by one of those instincts known only to the freemasonry of the sex euphemia lent herself to this advertisement of her sisters charms by subtle comparison with her own prettinesses and thus combined against their common enemy man  clementina certainly is perfect to keep her supremacy over that pretty little sister thought rice  what a fascinating little creature to hold her own against that tall handsome girl thought grant  theyre takin stock o them two fellers so as to gabble about em when their backs is turned said john milton gloomily to himself with a dismal premonition of the prolonged teatable gossip he would be obliged to listen to later  we were very fortunate to make a landing at all last night said rice looking down upon the still swollen current and then raising his eyes to clementina still more fortunate to make it where we did i suppose it must have been the singing that lured us on to the bankas you know the sirens used to lure peopleonly with less disastrous consequences  john milton here detected three glaring errors first it was not clementina who had sung secondly he knew that neither of his sisters had ever read anything about sirens but he had thirdly that the young surveyor was glaringly ignorant of local phenomena and should be corrected  its nothin but the current he said with that feverish youthful haste that betrays a fatal experience of impending interruption its always leavin drift and rubbish from everywhere here there aint anythin thats chucked into the creek above that aint bound to fetch up on this bank why there was two sheep and a dead hoss here long afore you thought of coming he did not understand why this should provoke the laughter that it did and to prove that he had no ulterior meaning added with pointed politeness so it isnt your fault you knowyou couldnt help it supplementing this with the distinct courtesy otherwise you wouldnt have come  but it would seem that your visitors are not all as accidental as your brother would imply and one at least seems to have been expected last evening you remember you thought we were a mr parmlee said mr rice looking at clementina  it would be strange indeed he thought if the beautiful girl were not surrounded by admirers but without a trace of selfconsciousness or any change in her reposeful face she indicated her sister with a slight gesture and said one of phemies friends he gave her the accordion shes very popular  and i suppose you are very hard to please he said with a tentative smile  she looked at him with her large clear eyes and that absence of coquetry or changed expression in her beautiful face which might have stood for indifference or dignity as she said i dont know i am waiting to see  but here miss phemie broke in saucily with the assertion that mr parmlee might not have a railroad in his pocket but that at least he didnt have to wait for the flood to call on young ladies nor did he usually come in pairs for all the world as if he had been let out of noahs ark but on horseback and like a christian by the front door all this provokingly and bewitchingly delivered however and with a simulated exaggeration that was incited apparently more by mr lawrence grants evident enjoyment of it than by any desire to defend the absent parmlee  but where is the front door asked grant laughingly  the young girl pointed to a narrow zigzag path that ran up the bank beside the house until it stopped at a small picketed gate on the level of the road and store  but i should think it would be easier to have a door and private passage through the store said grant  we dont said the young lady pertly we have nothing to do with the store i go in to see paw sometimes when hes shutting up and theres nobody there but clem has never set foot in it since we came its bad enough to have it and the lazy loafers that hang around it as near to us as they are but paw built the house in such a fashion that we aint troubled by their noise and we might be tother side of the creek as far as our having to come across them and because paw has to sell pork and flour we havent any call to go there and watch him do it  the two men glanced at each other this reserve and fastidiousness were something rare in a pioneer community harkutts manners certainly did not indicate that he was troubled by this sensitiveness it must have been some individual temperament of his daughters stephen felt his respect increase for the goddesslike clementina mr lawrence grant looked at miss phemie with a critical smile  but you must be very limited in your company he said or is mr parmlee not a customer of your fathers  as mr parmlee does not come to us through the store and dont talk trade to me we dont know responded phemie saucily  but have you no lady acquaintancesneighborswho also avoid the store and enter only at the straight and narrow gate up there continued grant mischievously regardless of the uneasy halfreproachful glances of rice  but phemie triumphantly oblivious of any satire answered promptly if you mean the pike county billingses who live on the turnpike road as much as they do off it or the six daughters of that georgia cracker who wear mens boots and hats we havent  and mr parmlee your admirer suggested rice hasnt he a mother or sisters here  yes but they dont want to know us and have never called here  the embarrassment of the questioner at this unexpected reply which came from the faultless lips of clementina was somewhat mitigated by the fact that the young womans voice and manner betrayed neither annoyance nor anger  here however harkutt appeared from the house with the information that he had secured two horses for the surveyors and their instruments and that he would himself accompany them a part of the way on their return to tasajara creek to show them the road his usual listless deliberation had given way to a certain nervous but uneasy energy if they started at once it would be better before the loungers gathered at the store and confused them with lazy counsel and languid curiosity he took it for granted that mr grant wished the railroad survey to be a secret and he had said nothing as they would be pestered with questions sidon was inquisitiveand oldfashioned the benefit its inhabitants would get from the railroad would not prevent them from throwing obstacles in its way at first he remembered the way they had acted with a proposed wagon roadin fact an idea of his own something like the railroad he knew them thoroughly and if he might advise them it would be to say nothing here until the thing was settled  he evidently does not intend to give us a chance said grant goodhumoredly to his companion as they turned to prepare for their journey we are to be conducted in silence to the outskirts of the town like horsethieves  but you gave him the tip for himself said rice reproachfully you cannot blame him for wanting to keep it  i gave it to him in trust for his two incredible daughters said grant with a grimace but hang it if i dont believe the fellow has more concern in it than i imagined  but isnt she perfect said rice with charming abstraction  who  clementina and so unlike her father  discomposingly so said grant quietly one feels in calling her miss harkutt as if one were touching upon a manifest indiscretion but here comes john milton well my lad what can i do for you  the boy who had been regarding them from a distance with wistful and curious eyes as they replaced their instruments for the journey had gradually approached them after a moments timid hesitation he said looking at grant you dont know anybody in this kind o business pointing to the instruments whod like a boy about my size  im afraid not j m said grant cheerfully without suspending his operation the fact is you see its not exactly the kind of work for a boy of your size  john milton was silent for a moment shifting himself slowly from one leg to another as he watched the surveyor after a pause he said there dont seem to be much show in this world for boys o my size there dont seem to be much use for em any way this not bitterly but philosophically and even politely as if to relieve grants rejection of any incivility  really you quite pain me john milton said grant looking up as he tightened a buckle i never thought of it before but youre right  now continued the boy slowly with girls its just different girls of my size everybody does things for theres clemmyshes only two years older nor me and dont know half that i do and yet she kin lie about all day and hasnt to get up to breakfast and phemiewhos jest the same age size and weight as memaw and paw lets her do everything she wants to and so does everybody and so would you  but you surely dont want to be like a girl said grant smiling  it here occurred to john miltons youthful but not illogical mind that this was not argument and he turned disappointedly away as his father was to accompany the strangers a short distance he john milton was today left in charge of the store that duty however did not involve any pecuniary transactionsthe taking of money or making of change but a simple record on a slate behind the counter of articles selected by those customers whose urgent needs could not wait mr harkutts return perhaps on account of this degrading limitation perhaps for other reasons the boy did not fancy the task imposed upon him the presence of the idle loungers who usually occupied the armchairs near the stove and occasionally the counter dissipated any romance with which he might have invested his charge he wearied of the monotony of their dull gossip but mostly he loathed the attitude of hypercritical counsel and instruction which they saw fit to assume towards him at such moments instead o lazin thar behind the counter when your father aint here to see ye john remarked billings from the depths of his armchair a few moments after harkutt had ridden away ye orter be bustlin round dustin the shelves yell never come to anythin when youre a man ef you go on like that ye never heard o harry claythat was called the millboy of the slashessittin down doin nothin when he was a boy  i never heard of him loafin round in a grocery store when he was growned up either responded john milton darkly  praps you reckon he got to be a great man by standin up sassin his fathers customers said peters angrily i kin tell ye young man if you was my boy  if i was your boy id be playin hookey instead of goin to school jest as your boy is doin now interrupted john milton with a literal recollection of his quarrel and pursuit of the youth in question that morning  an undignified silence on the part of the adults followed the usual sequel to those passages sidon generally declining to expose itself to the youthful harkutts terrible accuracy of statement  the men resumed their previous lazy gossip about elijah curtiss disappearance with occasional mysterious allusions in a lower tone which the boy instinctively knew referred to his father but which either from indolence or caution the two great conservators of sidon were never formulated distinctly enough for his relentless interference the morning sunshine was slowly thickening again in an indolent mist that seemed to rise from the saturated plain a stray lounger shuffled over from the blacksmiths shop to the store to take the place of another idler who had joined an equally lethargic circle around the slumbering forge a dull intermittent sound of hammering came occasionally from the wheelwrights shedat sufficiently protracted intervals to indicate the enfeebled progress of sidons vehicular repair a yellow dog left his patch of sunlight on the opposite side of the way and walked deliberately over to what appeared to be more luxurious quarters on the veranda was manifestly disappointed but not equal to the exertion of returning and sank down with blinking eyes and a regretful sigh without going further a procession of six ducks got well into a line for a laborious march past the store but fell out at the first mud puddle and gave it up a highly nervous but respectable hen who had ventured upon the veranda evidently against her better instincts walked painfully on tiptoe to the door apparently was met by language which no mother of a family could listen to and retired in strong hysterics a little later the sun became again obscured the wind arose rain fell and the opportunity for going indoors and doing nothing was once more availed of by all sidon  it was afternoon when mr harkutt returned he did not go into the store but entered the dwelling from the little picketgate and steep path there he called a family council in the sittingroom as being the most reserved and secure mrs harkutt sympathizing and cheerfully ready for any affliction still holding a dustcloth in her hand took her seat by the window with phemie breathless and sparkling at one side of her while clementina all faultless profile and repose sat on the other to mrs harkutts motherly concern at john miltons absence it was pointed out that he was wanted at the storewas a mere boy anyhow and could not be trusted mr harkutt a little ruddier from weather excitement and the unusual fortification of a glass of liquor a little more rugged in the lines of his face and with an odd ring of defiant selfassertion in his voice stood before them in the centre of the room  he wanted them to listen to him carefully to remember what he said for it was important it might be a matter of lawing hereafterand he couldnt be always repeating it to themhe would have enough to do there was a heap of it that as womenfolks they couldnt understand and werent expected to but hed got it all clear now and what he was saying was gospel hed always known to himself that the only good that could ever come to sidon would come by railroad when those fools talked wagon road he had said nothing but he had his own ideas he had worked for that idea without saying anything to anybody that idea was to get possession of all the land along the embarcadero which nobody cared for and lige curtis was ready to sell for a song well now considering what had happened he didnt mind telling them that he had been gradually getting possession of it little by little paying lige curtis in advances and installments until it was his own they had heard what those surveyors said how that it was the only fit terminus for the railroad well that land and that waterfront and the terminus were his and all from his own foresight and prudence  it is needless to say that this was not the truth but it is necessary to point out that this fabrication was the result of his last nights cogitations and his mornings experience he had resolved upon a bold course he had reflected that his neighbors would be more ready to believe in and to respect a hard mercenary and speculative foresight in his taking advantage of liges necessities than if he hadas was the casemerely benefited by them through an accident of circumstance and good humor in the latter case he would be envied and hated in the former he would be envied and feared by logic of circumstance the greater wrong seemed to be less obviously offensive than the minor fault it was true that it involved the doing of something he had not contemplated and the certainty of exposure if lige ever returned but he was nevertheless resolved the step from passive to active wrongdoing is not only easy it is often a relief it is that return to sincerity which we all require howbeit it gave that ring of assertion to daniel harkutts voice already noted which most women like and only men are prone to suspect or challenge the incompleteness of his statement was for the same reason overlooked by his feminine auditors  and what is it worth dad asked phemie eagerly  grant says i oughter get at least ten thousand dollars for the site of the terminus from the company but of course i shall hold on to the rest of the land the moment they get the terminus there and the depot and wharf built i can get my own price and buyers for the rest before the year is out grant thinks it ought to go up ten per cent on the value of the terminus and that a hundred thousand  oh dad gasped phemie frantically clasping her knees with both hands as if to perfectly assure herself of this good fortune  mrs harkutt audibly murmured poor dear danl and stood as it were sympathetically by ready to commiserate the pains and anxieties of wealth as she had those of poverty clementina alone remained silent cleareyed and unchanged  and to think it all came through them continued phemie i always had an idea that mr grant was smart dad and it was real kind of him to tell you  i reckon father could have found it out without them i dont know why we should be beholden to them particularly i hope he isnt expected to let them think that he is bound to consider them our intimate friends just because they happened to drop in here at a time when his plans have succeeded  the voice was clementinas unexpected but quiet unemotional and convincing it seemed as mrs harkutt afterwards said as if the child had already touched that hundred thousand phemie reddened with a sense of convicted youthful extravagance  you neednt fear for me said harkutt responding to clementinas voice as if it were an echo of his own and instinctively recognizing an unexpected ally ive got my own ideas of this thing and whats to come of it ive got my own ideas of openin up that property and showin its resources im goin to run it my own way im goin to have a town along the embarcadero thatll lay over any town in contra costa im goin to have the courthouse and county seat there and a couple of hotels as good as any in the bay im goin to build that wagon road through here that those lazy louts slipped up on and carry it clear over to five mile corner and open up the whole tasajara plain  they had never seen him look so strong so resolute so intelligent and handsome a dimly prophetic vision of him in a black broadcloth suit and gold watchchain addressing a vague multitude as she remembered to have seen the hon stanley riggs of alasco at the great barbecue rose before phemies blue enraptured eyes with the exception of mrs harkuttequal to any possibilities on the part of her husbandthey had honestly never expected it of him they were pleased with their fathers attitude in prosperity and felt that perhaps he was not unworthy of being proud of them hereafter  but were goin to leave sidon said phemie aint we paw  as soon as i can run up a new house at the embarcadero said harkutt peevishly and thats got to be done mighty quick if i want to make a show to the company and be in possession  and thats easier for you to do dear now that liges disappeared said mrs harkutt consolingly  what do ye mean by that what the devil are ye talkin about demanded harkutt suddenly with unexpected exasperation  i mean that that drunken lige would be mighty poor company for the girls if he was our only neighbor returned mrs harkutt submissively  harkutt after a fixed survey of his wife appeared mollified the two girls who were mindful of his previous outburst the evening before exchanged glances which implied that his manners needed correction for prosperity  youll want a heap o money to build there danl said mrs harkutt in plaintive diffidence  yes yes said harkutt impatiently ive kalkilated all that and im goin to frisco tomorrow to raise it and put this bill of sale on record he half drew elijah curtiss paper from his pocket but paused and put it back again  then that was the paper dad said phemie triumphantly  yes said her father regarding her fixedly and you know now why i didnt want anything said about it last nightnor even now  and lige had just given it to you wasnt it lucky  he hadnt just given it to me said her father with another unexpected outburst god amighty aint i tellin you all the time it was an old matter but you jabber jabber all the time and dont listen wheres john milton it had occurred to him that the boy might have read the paperas his sister hadwhile it lay unheeded on the counter  in the storeyou know you said he wasnt to hear anything of this but ill call him said mrs harkutt rising eagerly  never mind returned her husband stopping her reflectively best leave it as it is if its necessary ill tell him but dont any of you say anything do you hear  nevertheless a few hours later when the store was momentarily free of loungers and harkutt had relieved his son of his monotonous charge he made a pretense while abstractedly listening to an account of the boys stewardship to look through a drawer as if in search of some missing article  you didnt see anything of a paper i left somewhere about here yesterday he asked carelessly  the one you picked up when you came in last night said the boy with discomposing directness  harkutt flushed slightly and drew his breath between his set teeth not only could he place no reliance upon ordinary youthful inattention but he must be on his guard against his own son as from a spy but he restrained himself  i dont remember he said with affected deliberation what it was i picked up do you did you read it  the meaning of his fathers attitude instinctively flashed upon the boy he had read the paper but he answered as he had already determined no  an inspiration seized mr harkutt he drew lige curtiss bill of sale from his pocket and opening it before john milton said was it that  i dont know said the boy i couldnt tell he walked away with affected carelessness already with a sense of playing some part like his father and pretended to whistle for the dog across the street harkutt coughed ostentatiously put the paper back in his pocket set one or two boxes straight on the counter locked the drawer and disappeared into the back passage john milton remained standing in the doorway looking vacantly out but he did not see the dull familiar prospect beyond he only saw the paper his father had opened and unfolded before him it was the same paper he had read last night but there were three words written there that were not there before after the words value received there had been a blank he remembered that distinctly this was filled in by the words five hundred dollars the handwriting did not seem like his fathers nor yet entirely like lige curtiss what it meant he did not knowhe would not try to think he should forget it as he had tried to forget what had happened before and he should never tell it to any one  there was a feverish gayety in his sisters manner that afternoon that he did not understand short colloquies that were suspended with ill concealed impatience when he came near them and resumed when he was sent on equally palpable excuses out of the room he had been accustomed to this exclusion when there were strangers present but it seemed odd to him now when the conversation did not even turn upon the two superior visitors who had been there and of whom he confidently expected they would talk such fragments as he overheard were always in the future tense and referred to what they intended to do his mother whose affection for him had always been shown in excessive and depressing commiseration of him in even his lightest moments that afternoon seemed to add a prophetic and cassandralike sympathy for some vague future of his that would require all her ministration you wont need them new boots milty dear in the changes that may be comin to ye so dont be bothering your poor father in his worriments over his new plans  what new plans mommer asked the boy abruptly are we goin away from here  hush dear and dont ask questions thats enough for grown folks to worry over let alone a boy like you now be gooda quality in mrs harkutts mind synonymous with ceasing from troublingand after supper while im in the parlor with your father and sisters you kin sit up here by the fire with your book  but persisted the boy in a flash of inspiration is popper goin to join in business with those surveyorsa surveyin  no child what an idea run away thereand minddont bother your father  nevertheless john miltons inspiration had taken a new and characteristic shape all this he reflected had happened since the surveyors camesince they had weakly displayed such a shameless and unmanly interest in his sisters it could have but one meaning he hung around the sittingroom and passages until he eventually encountered clementina taller than ever evidently wearing a guilty satisfaction in her face engrafted upon that habitual bearing of hers which he had always recognized as belonging to a vague but objectionable race whose members were individually known to him as a proudy  which of those two surveyor fellows is it clemmy he said with an engaging smile yet halting at a strategic distance  is what  wot youre goin to marry  idiot  that aint tellin which responded the boy darkly  clementina swept by him into the sittingroom where he heard her declare that really that boy was getting too low and vulgar for anything yet it struck him that being pressed for further explanation she did not specify why this was girls meanness  howbeit he lingered late in the road that evening hearing his father discuss with the searchparty that had followed the banks of the creek vainly looking for further traces of the missing lige the possibility of his being living or dead of the body having been carried away by the current to the bay or turning up later in some distant marsh when the spring came with low water one who had been to his cabin beside the embarcadero reported that it was as had been long suspected barely habitable and contained neither books papers nor records which would indicate his family or friends it was a godforsaken dreary worthless place he wondered how a white man could ever expect to make a living there if elijah never turned up again it certainly would be a long time before any squatter would think of taking possession of it john milton knew instinctively without looking up that his fathers eyes were fixed upon him and he felt himself constrained to appear to be abstracted in gazing down the darkening road then he heard his father say with what he felt was an equal assumption of carelessness yes i reckon ive got somewhere a bill of sale of that land that i had to take from lige for an old bill but i kalkilate thats all ill ever see of it  rain fell again as the darkness gathered but he still loitered on the road and the sloping path of the garden filled with a half resentful sense of wrong and hugging with gloomy pride an increasing sense of loneliness and of getting dangerously wet the swollen creek still whispered murmured and swirled beside the bank at another time he might have had wild ideas of emulating the surveyors on some extempore raft and so escaping his present dreary home existence but since the disappearance of lige who had always excited an odd boyish antipathy in his heart although he had never seen him he shunned the stream contaminated with the missing mans unheroic fate presently the light from the open window of the sittingroom glittered on the wet leaves and sprays where he stood and the voices of the family conclave came fitfully to his ear they didnt want him there they had never thought of asking him to come in wellwho cared and he wasnt going to be bought off with a candle and a seat by the kitchen fire no  nevertheless he was getting wet to no purpose there was the toolhouse and carpenters shed near the bank its floor was thickly covered with sawdust and pinewood shavings and there was a mouldy buffalo skin which he had once transported thither from the old wagonbed there too was his secret cache of a candle in a bottle buried with other piratical treasures in the presence of the youthful peters who consented to be sacrificed on the spot in buccaneering fashion to complete the unhallowed rites he unearthed the candle lit it and clearing away a part of the shavings stood it up on the floor he then brought a prized battered and coverless volume from a hidden recess in the rafters and lying down with the buffalo robe over him and his cap in his hand ready to extinguish the light at the first footstep of a trespasser gave himself upas he had given himself up i fear many other timesto the enchantment of the page before him  the current whispered murmured and sang unheeded at his side the voices of his mother and sisters raised at times in eagerness or expectation of the future fell upon his unlistening ears for with the spell that had come upon him the mean walls of his hidingplace melted away the vulgar stream beside him might have been that dim subterraneous river down which sindbad and his bale of riches were swept out of the cave of death to the sunlight of life and fortune so surely and so simply had it transported him beyond the cramped and darkened limits of his present life he was in the better world of boyish romanceof gallant deeds and high emprises of miraculous atonement and devoted sacrifice of brave men and those rarer impossible womenthe immaculate conception of a boys virgin heart what mattered it that behind that glittering window his mother and sisters grew feverish and excited over the vulgar details of their real but baser fortune from the dark toolshed by the muddy current john milton with a battered dogseared chronicle soared on the wings of fancy far beyond their wildest ken     chaper v   prosperity had settled upon the plains of tasajara not only had the embarcadero emerged from the tules of tasajara creek as a thriving town of steamboat wharves warehouses and outlying mills and factories but in five years the transforming railroad had penetrated the great plain itself and revealed its undeveloped fertility the lowlying lands that had been yearly overflowed by the creek now drained and cultivated yielded treasures of wheat and barley that were apparently inexhaustible even the helpless indolence of sidon had been surprised into activity and change there was nothing left of the straggling settlement to recall its former aspect the site of harkutts old store and dwelling was lost and forgotten in the new mill and granary that rose along the banks of the creek decay leaves ruin and traces for the memory to linger over prosperity is unrelenting in its complete and smiling obliteration of the past  but tasajara city as the embarcadero was now called had no previous record and even the former existence of an actual settler like the forgotten elijah curtis was unknown to the present inhabitants it was daniel harkutts idea carried out in daniel harkutts land with daniel harkutts capital and energy but daniel harkutt had become daniel harcourt and harcourt avenue harcourt square and harcourt house ostentatiously proclaimed the new spelling of his patronymic when the change was made and for what reason who suggested it and under what authority were not easy to determine as the sign on his former store had borne nothing but the legend goods and provisions and his name did not appear on written record until after the occupation of tasajara but it is presumed that it was at the instigation of his daughters and there was no one to oppose it harcourt was a pretty name for a street a square or a hotel even the few in sidon who had called it harkutt admitted that it was an improvement quite consistent with the change from the feverhaunted tules and sedges of the creek to the broad level and handsome squares of tasajara city  this might have been the opinion of a visitor at the harcourt house who arrived one summer afternoon from the stockton boat but whose shrewd halfcritical halfprofessional eyes and quiet questionings betrayed some previous knowledge of the locality seated on the broad veranda of the harcourt house and gazing out on the wellkept green and young eucalyptus trees of the harcourt square or plaza he had elicited a counter question from a prosperouslooking citizen who had been lounging at his side  i reckon you look ez if you might have been here before stranger  yes said the stranger quietly i have been but it was when the tules grew in the square opposite and the tide of the creek washed them  well said the tasajaran looking curiously at the stranger i call myself a pioneer of tasajara my names petersof peters and coand those warehouses along the wharf where you landed just now are mine but i was the first settler on harcourts land and built the next cabin after him i helped to clear out them tules and dredged the channels yonder i took the contract with harcourt to build the last fifteen miles o railroad and put up that depot for the company perhaps you were here before that  i was returned the stranger quietly  i say said peters hitching his chair a little nearer to his companion you never knew a kind of brokendown feller called curtislige curtiswho once squatted here and sold his right to harkutt he disappeared it was allowed he killed hisself but they never found his body and between you and me i never took stock in that story you know harcourt holds under him and all tasajara rests on that title  ive heard so assented the stranger carelessly but i never knew the original settler then harcourt has been lucky  you bet hes got three millions right about here or within this quarter section to say nothing of his outside speculations  and lives here  not for two years thats his old house across the plaza but his womenfolks live mostly in frisco and new york where hes got houses too they say they sorter got sick of tasajara after his youngest daughter ran off with a feller  hallo said the stranger with undisguised interest i never heard of that you dont mean that she elopedhe hesitated  oh it was a square enough marriage i reckon too square to suit some folks but the fellow hadnt nothin and wasnt worth shucksa sort of land surveyor doin odd jobs you know and the old man and old woman were agin it and the tother daughter worse of all it was allowed hereyou know how womenfolks talkthat the surveyor had been sweet on clementina but had got tired of being played by her and took up with phemie out o spite anyhow they got married and harcourt gave them to understand they couldnt expect anything from him praps thats why it didnt last long for only about two months ago she got a divorce from rice and came back to her family again  rice queried the stranger was that her husbands name stephen rice  i reckon you knew him  yeswhen the tide came up to the tules yonder answered the stranger musingly and the other daughteri suppose she has made a good match being a beauty and the sole heiress  the tasajaran made a grimace not much i reckon shes waitin for the angel gabrielthere aint another good enough to suit her here they say shes had most of the big men in california waitin in a line with their offers like that cue the fellows used to make at the frisco postoffice steamer daysand she with nary a letter or answer for any of them  then harcourt doesnt seem to have been as fortunate in his family affairs as in his speculations  peters uttered a grim laugh well i reckon you know all about his sons stampeding with that girl last spring  his son interrupted the stranger do you mean the boy they called john milton why he was a mere child  he was old enough to run away with a young woman that helped in his mothers house and marry her afore a justice of the peace the old man just snorted with rage and swore hed have the marriage put aside for the boy was under age he said it was a putup job of the girls that she was older by two years and only wanted to get what money might be comin some day but that theyd never see a red cent of it then they say john milton up and sassed the old man to his face and allowed that he wouldnt take his dirty money if he starved first and that if the old man broke the marriage hed marry her again next year that true love and honorable poverty were better nor riches and a lot more o that stuff he picked out o them tencent novels he was allus reading my womenfolks say that he actually liked the girl because she was the only one in the house that was ever kind to him they say the girls were just ragin mad at the idea o havin a hired gal who had waited on em as a sisterinlaw and they even got old mammy harcourts back up by sayin that johns wife would want to rule the house and run her out of her own kitchen some say he shook them talked back to em mighty sharp and held his head a heap higher nor them anyhow hes livin with his wife somewhere in frisco in a shanty on a sand lot and workin odd jobs for the newspapers no takin it by and largeit dont look as if harcourt had run his family to the same advantage that he has his land  perhaps he doesnt understand them as well said the stranger smiling  morn likely the material aint thar or aint as vallyble for a new country said peters grimly i reckon the trouble is that he lets them two daughters run him and the man who lets any woman or women do that lets himself in for all their meannesses and all he gets in return is a womans resultshow  here the stranger who was slowly rising from his chair with the polite suggestion of reluctantly tearing himself from the speakers spell said and harcourt spends most of his time in san francisco i suppose  yes but today hes here to attend a directors meeting and the opening of the free library and tasajara hall i saw the windows open and the blinds up in his house across the plaza as i passed just now  the stranger had by this time quite effected his courteous withdrawal goodafternoon mr peters he said smilingly lifting his hat and turned away  peters who was obliged to take his legs off the chair and half rise to the strangers politeness here reflected that he did not know his interlocutors name and business and that he had really got nothing in return for his information this must be remedied as the stranger passed through the hall into the street followed by the unwonted civilities of the spruce hotel clerk and the obsequious attentions of the negro porter peters stepped to the window of the office who was that man who just passed out he asked  the clerk stared in undisguised astonishment you dont mean to say you didnt know who he wasall the while you were talking to him  no returned peters impatiently  why that was professor lawrence grantthe lawrence grantdont you knowthe biggest scientific man and recognized expert on the pacific slope why thats the man whose single word is enough to make or break the biggest mine or claim going that manwhy thats the man whose opinions worth thousands for it carries millions with itand cant be bought thats him who knocked the bottom outer el dorado last year and next day sent eureka up booming ye remember that sure  of coursebutstammered peters  and to think you didnt know him repeated the hotel clerk wonderingly and here i was reckoning you were getting points from him all the time why some men would have given a thousand dollars for your chance of talking to himyesof even being seen talking to him why old wingate once got a tip on his prairie flower lead worth five thousand dollars while just changing seats with him in the cars and passing the time of day sociable like why what did you talk about  peters with a miserable conviction that he had thrown away a valuable opportunity in mere idle gossip nevertheless endeavored to look mysterious as he replied oh business ginrally then in the faint hope of yet retrieving his blunder he inquired how long will he be here  dont know i reckon he and harcourts got something on hand he just asked if he was likely to be at home or at his office i told him i reckoned at the house for some of the familyi didnt get to see who they weredrove up in a carriage from the 340 train while you were sitting there  meanwhile the subject of this discussion quite unconscious of the sensation he had created or perhaps like most heroes philosophically careless of it was sauntering indifferently towards harcourts house but he had no business with his former host his only object was to pass an idle hour before his train left he was of course not unaware that he himself was largely responsible for harcourts success that it was his hint which had induced the petty trader of sidon to venture his all in tasajara his knowledge of the topography and geology of the plain that had stimulated harcourts agricultural speculations his hydrographic survey of the creek that had made harcourts plan of widening the channel to commerce practicable and profitable this he could not help but know but that it was chiefly owing to his own clear cool farseeing but never visionary scientific observationhis own accurate analysis unprejudiced by even a savants enthusiasm and uninfluenced by any personal desire or greed of gainthat tasajara city had risen from the stagnant tules was a speculation that had never occurred to him there was a much more uneasy consciousness of what he had done in mr harcourts face a few moments later when his visitors name was announced and it is to be feared that if that name had been less widely honored and respected than it was no merely grateful recollection of it would have procured grant an audience as it was it was with a frown and a touch of his old impatient asperity that he stepped to the threshold of an adjoining room and called clemmy  clementina appeared at the door  theres that man grant in the parlor what brings him here i wonder who does he come to see  who did he ask for  mebut that dont mean anything  perhaps he wants to see you on some business  no that isnt his hightoned style he makes other people go to him for that he said bitterly anyhowdont you think its mighty queer his coming here after his friendfor it was he who introduced rice to ushad behaved so to your sister and caused all this divorce and scandal  perhaps he may know nothing about it he and rice separated long ago even before grant became so famous we never saw much of him you know after we came here suppose you leave him to me ill see him  mr harcourt reflected didnt he used to be rather attentive to phemie  clementina shrugged her shoulders carelessly i dare saybut i dont think that now  who said anything about now retorted her father with a return of his old abruptness after a pause he said ill go down and see him first and then send for you you can keep him for the opening and dinner if you like  meantime lawrence grant serenely unsuspicious of these domestic confidences had been shown into the parlora large room furnished in the same style as the drawingroom of the hotel he had just quitted he had ample time to note that it was that wonderful second empire furniture which he remembered that the early san francisco pioneers in the first flush of their wealth had imported directly from france and which for years after gave an unexpected foreign flavor to the western domesticity and a tawdry gilt equality to saloons and drawingrooms public and private but he was observant of a corresponding change in harcourt when a moment later he entered the room that individuality which had kept the former shopkeeper of sidon distinct from although perhaps not superior to his customerswas strongly marked he was perhaps now more nervously alert than then he was certainly more impatient than beforebut that was pardonable in a man of large affairs and action grant could not deny that he seemed improvedrather perhaps that the setting of fine clothes cleanliness and the absence of petty worries made his characteristics respectable that which is ill breeding in homespun is apt to become mere eccentricity in purple and fine linen grant felt that harcourt jarred on him less than he did before and was grateful without superciliousness harcourt relieved to find that grant was neither critical nor aggressively reminiscent and above all not inclined to claim the credit of creating him and tasajara became more confident more at his ease and i fear in proportion more unpleasant it is the repose and not the struggle of the parvenu that confounds us  and you grantyou have made yourself famous and i hear have got pretty much your own prices for your opinions ever since it was known that youyouerwere connected with the growth of tasajara  grant smiled he was not quite prepared for this but it was amusing and would pass the time he murmured a sentence of half ironical deprecation and mr harcourt continued  i havent got my san francisco house here to receive you in but i hope some day sir to see you there we are only here for the day and night but if you care to attend the opening ceremonies at the new hall we can manage to give you dinner afterwards you can escort my daughter clementinashes here with me  the smile of apologetic declination which had begun to form on grants lips was suddenly arrested then your daughter is here he asked with unaffected interest  yesshe is in fact a patroness of the library and sewingcircle and takes the greatest interest in it the reverend doctor pilsbury relies upon her for everything she runs the society even to the training of the young ladies sir you shall see their exercises  this was certainly a new phase of clementinas character yet why should she not assume the role of lady bountiful with the other functions of her new condition i should have thought miss harcourt would have found this rather difficult with her other social duties he said and would have left it to her married sister he thought it better not to appear as if avoiding reference to euphemia although quietly ignoring her late experiences mr harcourt was less easy in his response  now that euphemia is again with her own family he said ponderously with an affectation of social discrimination that was in weak contrast to his usual direct business astuteness i suppose she may take her part in these things but just now she requires rest you may have heard some rumor that she is going abroad for a time the fact is she hasnt the least intention of doing so nor do we consider there is the slightest reason for her going he paused as if to give great emphasis to a statement that seemed otherwise unimportant but heres clementina coming and i must get you to excuse me ive to meet the trustees of the church in ten minutes but i hope shell persuade you to stay and ill see you later at the hall  as clementina entered the room her father vanished and i fear as completely dropped out of mr grants mind for the daughters improvement was greater than her fathers yet so much more refined as to be at first only delicately perceptible grant had been prepared for the vulgar enhancement of fine clothes and personal adornment for the specious setting of luxurious circumstances and surroundings for the aplomb that came from flattery and conscious power but he found none of these her calm individuality was intensified rather than subdued she was dressed simply with an economy of ornament rich material and jewelry but an accuracy of taste that was always dominant her plain gray merino dress beautifully fitting her figure suggested with its pale blue facings some uniform as of the charitable society she patronized she came towards him with a graceful movement of greeting yet her face showed no consciousness of the interval that had elapsed since they met he almost fancied himself transported back to the sittingroom at sidon with the monotonous patter of the leaves outside and the cool moist breath of the bay and alder coming in at the window  father says that you are only passing through tasajara today as you did through sidon five years ago she said with a smiling earnestness that he fancied however was the one new phase of her character but i wont believe it at least we will not accept another visit quite as accidental as that even though you brought us twice the good fortune you did then you see we have not forgotten it if you have mr grant and unless you want us to believe that your fairy gifts will turn some day to leaves and ashes you will promise to stay with us tonight and let me show you some of the good we have done with them perhaps you dont know or dont want to know that it was i who got up this library and home circle of the sisters of tasajara which we are to open today and can you imagine why you rememberor have you forgottenthat you once affected to be concerned at the social condition of the young ladies on the plains of sidon well mr grant this is gotten up in order that the future mr grants who wander may find future miss billingses who are worthy to converse with them and entertain them and who no longer wear mens hats and live on the public road  it was such a long speech for one so taciturn as he remembered clementina to have been so unexpected in tone considering her fathers attitude towards him and so unlooked for in its reference to a slight incident of the past that grants critical contemplation of her gave way to a quiet and grateful glance of admiration how could he have been so mistaken in her character he had always preferred the outspoken euphemia and yet why should he not have been equally mistaken in her without having any personal knowledge of rices matrimonial troublesfor their intimate companionship had not continued after the surveyhe had been inclined to blame him now he seemed to find excuses for him he wondered if she really had liked him as peters had hinted he wondered if she knew that he grant was no longer intimate with him and knew nothing of her affairs all this while he was accepting her proffered hospitality and sending to the hotel for his luggage then he drifted into a conversation which he had expected would be brief pointless and confined to a stupid resume of their mutual and social progress since they had left sidon but here he was again mistaken she was talking familiarly of present social topics of things that she knew clearly and well without effort or attitude she had been to new york and boston for two winters she had spent the previous summer at newport it might have been her whole youth for the fluency accuracy and familiarity of her detail and the absence of provincial enthusiasm she was going abroad probably in the spring she had thought of going to winter in italy but she would wait now until her sister was ready to go with her mr grant of course knew that euphemia was separated from mr ricenonot until her father told him wellthe marriage had been a wild and foolish thing for both but euphemia was back again with them in the san francisco house she had talked of coming to tasajara today perhaps she might be there tonight and good heavens it was actually three oclock already and they must start at once for the hall she would go and get her hat and return instantly  it was true he had been talking with her an hourpleasantly intelligently and yet with a consciousness of an indefinite satisfaction beyond all this it must have been surprise at her transformation or his previous misconception of her character he had been watching her features and wondering why he had ever thought them expressionless there was also the pleasant suggestioncommon to humanity in such instancesthat he himself was in some way responsible for the change that it was some awakened sympathy to his own nature that had breathed into this cold and faultless statue the warmth of life in an odd flash of recollection he remembered how five years ago when rice had suggested to her that she was hard to please she had replied that she didnt know but that she was waiting to see it did not occur to him to wonder why she had not awakened then or if this awakening had anything to do with her own volition it was not probable that they would meet again after today or if they did that she would not relapse into her former self and fail to impress him as she had now buthere she wasa paragon of feminine promptitudealready standing in the doorway accurately gloved and booted and wearing a demure gray hat that modestly crowned her decorously elegant figure  they crossed the plaza side by side in the still garish sunlight that seemed to mock the scant shade of the youthful eucalyptus trees and presently fell in with the stream of people going in their direction the former daughters of sidon the billingses the peterses and wingates were there bourgeoning and expanding in the glare of their new prosperity with silk and gold there were newer faces still and pretty onesfor tasajara as a cow county had attracted settlers with large familiesand there were already the contrasting types of east and west many turned to look after the tall figure of the daughter of the founder of tasajaraa spectacle lately rare to the town a few glanced at her companion equally noticeable as a stranger thanks however to some judicious preliminary advertising from the hotel clerk peters and daniel harcourt himself by the time grant and miss harcourt had reached the hall his name and fame were already known and speculation had already begun whether this new stroke of harcourts shrewdness might not unite clementina to a renowned and profitable partner  the hall was in one of the further and newly opened suburbs and its side and rear windows gave immediately upon the outlying and illimitable plain of tasajara it was a tasteful and fairseeming structure of wood surprisingly and surpassingly new in fact that was its one dominant feature nowhere else had youth and freshness ever shown itself as unconquerable and allconquering the spice of virgin woods and trackless forests still rose from its pine floors and breathed from its outer shell of cedar that still oozed its sap and redwood that still dropped its lifeblood nowhere else were the plastered walls and ceilings as white and dazzling in their unstained purity or as redolent of the outlying quarry in their clear cool breath of lime and stone even the turpentine of fresh and spotless paint added to this sense of wholesome germination and as the clear and brilliant californian sunshine swept through the open windows west and east suffusing the whole palpitating structure with its searching and resistless radiance the very air seemed filled with the aroma of creation  the fresh colors of the young republic the bright blazonry of the newest state the coatofarms of the infant county of tasajaraa vignette of sunsettules cloven by the steam of an advancing trainhanging from the walls were all a part of this invincible juvenescence even the newest silks ribbons and prints of the latest holiday fashions made their first virgin appearance in the new building as if to consecrate it until it was stirred by the rustle of youth as with the sound and movement of budding spring  a strain from the new organwhose heart however had prematurely learned its own bitternessand a thin clear but somewhat shrill chanting from a choir of young ladies were followed by a prayer from the reverend mr pilsbury then there was a pause of expectancy and grants fair companion who up to that moment had been quietly acting as guide and cicerone to her fathers guest excused herself with a little grimace of mock concern and was led away by one of the committee grants usually keen eyes were wandering somewhat abstractedly over the agitated and rustling field of ribbons flowers and feathers before him past the blazonry of banner on the walls and through the open windows to the long sunlit levels beyond when he noticed a stir upon the raised dais or platform at the end of the room where the notables of tasajara were formally assembled the mass of black coats suddenly parted and drew back against the wall to allow the coming forward of a single graceful figure a thrill of nervousness as unexpected as unaccountable passed over him as he recognized clementina in the midst of a sudden silence she read the report of the committee from a paper in her hand in a clear untroubled voicethe old voice of sidonand formally declared the building opened the sunlight nearly level streamed through the western window across the front of the platform where she stood and transfigured her slight but noble figure the hush that had fallen upon the hall was as much the effect of that tranquil ideal presence as of the message with which it was charged and yet that apparition was as inconsistent with the clear searching light which helped to set it off as it was with the broad new blazonry of decoration the yet unsullied record of the white walls or even the frank animated and pretty faces that looked upon it perhaps it was some such instinct that caused the applause which hesitatingly and tardily followed her from the platform to appear polite and half restrained rather than spontaneous  nevertheless grant was honestly and sincerely profuse in his congratulations you were far cooler and far more selfcontained than i should have been in your place he said than in fact i actually was only as your auditor but i suppose you have done it before  she turned her beautiful eyes on his wonderingly nothis is the first time i ever appeared in publicnot even at school for even there i was always a private pupil  you astonish me said grant you seemed like an old hand at it  perhaps i did or rather as if i didnt think anything of it myselfand that no doubt is why the audience didnt think anything of it either  so she had noticed her cold reception and yet there was not the slightest trace of disappointment regret or wounded vanity in her tone or manner you must take me to the refreshment room now she said pleasantly and help me to look after the young ladies who are my guests im afraid there are still more speeches to come and father and mr pilsbury are looking as if they confidently expected something more would be expected of them  grant at once threw himself into the task assigned to him with his natural gallantry and a certain captivating playfulness which he still retained perhaps he was the more anxious to please in order that his companion might share some of his popularity for it was undeniable that miss harcourt still seemed to excite only a constrained politeness among those with whom she courteously mingled and this was still more distinctly marked by the contrast of a later incident  for some moments the sound of laughter and greeting had risen near the door of the refreshment room that opened upon the central hall and there was a perceptible movement of the crowdparticularly of youthful male tasajarain that direction it was evident that it announced the unexpected arrival of some popular resident attracted like the others grant turned and saw the company making way for the smiling easy halfsaucy halfcomplacent entry of a handsomely dressed young girl as she turned from time to time to recognize with rallying familiarity or charming impertinence some of her admirers there was that in her tone and gesture which instantly recalled to him the past it was unmistakably euphemia his eyes instinctively sought clementinas she was gazing at him with such a grave penetrating lookhalf doubting half wistfula look so unlike her usual unruffled calm that he felt strangely stirred but the next moment when she rejoined him the look had entirely gone you have not seen my sister since you were at sidon i believe she said quietly she would be sorry to miss you but euphemia and her train were already passing them on the opposite side of the long table she had evidently recognized grant yet the two sisters were looking intently into each others eyes when he raised his own then euphemia met his bow with a momentary accession of color a coquettish wave of her hand across the table a slight exaggeration of her usual fascinating recklessness and smilingly moved away he turned to clementina but here an ominous tapping at the farther end of the long table revealed the fact that mr harcourt was standing on a chair with oratorical possibilities in his face and attitude there was another forward movement in the crowd andsilence in that solid blackbroadclothed respectable figure that massive watchchain that white waistcoat that diamond pin glistening in the satin cravat euphemia might have seen the realization of her prophetic vision at sidon five years before  he spoke for ten minutes with a fluency and comprehensive businesslike directness that surprised grant he was not there he said to glorify what had been done by himself his family or his friends in tasajara others who were to follow him might do that or at least might be better able to explain and expatiate upon the advantages of the institution they had just opened and its social moral and religious effect upon the community he was there as a business man to demonstrate to themas he had always done and always hoped to dothe money value of improvement the profitif they might choose to call itof wellregulated and properly calculated speculation the plot of land upon which they stood of which the building occupied only one eighth was bought two years before for ten thousand dollars when the plans of the building were completed a month afterwards the value of the remaining seven eighths had risen enough to defray the cost of the entire construction he was in a position to tell them that only that morning the adjacent property subdivided and laid out in streets and buildingplots had been admitted into the corporate limits of the city and that on the next anniversary of the building they would approach it through an avenue of finished dwellings an outburst of applause followed the speakers practical climax the fresh young faces of his auditors glowed with invincible enthusiasm the afternoon tradewinds freshening over the limitless plain beyond tossed the bright banners at the windows as with sympathetic rejoicing and a few odorous pine shavings overlooked in a corner in the hurry of preparation touched by an eddying zephyr crept out and rolled in yellow ringlets across the floor  the reverend doctor pilsbury arose in a more decorous silence he had listened approvingly admiringly he might say even reverently to the preceding speaker but although his distinguished friend had with his usual modesty made light of his own services and those of his charming family he the speaker had not risen to sing his praises no it was not in this hall projected by his foresight and raised by his liberality in this town called into existence by his energy and stamped by his attributes in this county developed by his genius and sustained by his capital ay in this very state whose grandeur was made possible by such giants as heit was not in any of these places that it was necessary to praise daniel harcourt or that a panegyric of him would be more than idle repetition nor would he as that distinguished man had suggested enlarge upon the social moral and religious benefits of the improvement they were now celebrating it was written on the happy innocent faces in the festive garb in the decorous demeanor in the intelligent eyes that sparkled around him in the presence of those of his parishioners whom he could meet as freely here today as in his own church on sunday what then could he say what then was there to say perhaps he should say nothing if it were not for the presence of the young before himhe stopped and fixed his eyes paternally on the youthful johnny billings who with a half dozen other sundayschool scholars had been marshaled before the reverend speakerand what was to be the lesson they were to learn from it they had heard what had been achieved by labor enterprise and diligence perhaps they would believe and naturally too that what labor enterprise and diligence had done could be done again but was that all was there nothing behind these qualitieswhich after all were within the reach of every one here had they ever thought that back of every pioneer every explorer every pathfinder every founder and creator there was still another there was no terra incognita so rare as to be unknown to one no wilderness so remote as to be beyond a greater ken than theirs no waste so trackless but that one had already passed that way did they ever reflect that when the dull sea ebbed and flowed in the tules over the very spot where they were now standing who it was that also foresaw conceived and ordained the mighty change that would take place who even guided and directed the feeble means employed to work it whose spirit moved as in still older days of which they had read over the face of the stagnant waters perhaps they had who then was the real pioneer of tasajaraback of the harcourts the peterses the billingses and wingates the reverend gentleman gently paused for a reply it was given in the clear but startled accents of the half frightened halffascinated johnny billings in three words  lige curtis sir     chaper vi   the trade wind that blowing directly from the golden gate seemed to concentrate its full force upon the western slope of russian hill might have dismayed any climber less hopeful and sanguine than that most imaginative of newspaper reporters and most youthful of husbands john milton harcourt but for all that it was an honest wind and its dry practical energy and saltpervading breath only seemed to sting him to greater and more enthusiastic exertions until quite at the summit of the hill and last of a straggling line of little cottages half submerged in drifting sand he stood upon his own humble porch  i was thinking coming up the hill loo he said bursting into the sittingroom pantingly of writing something about the future of the hill how it will look fifty years from now all terraced with houses and gardensand right up here a kind of acropolis dont you know i had quite a picture of it in my mind just now  a plainlydressed young woman with a pretty face that however looked as if it had been prematurely sapped of color and vitality here laid aside some white sewing she had in her lap and said  but you did that once before milty and you know the herald wouldnt take it because they said it was a free notice of mr boorems building lots and he didnt advertise in the herald i always told you that you ought to have seen boorem first  the young fellow blinked his eyes with a momentary arrest of that buoyant hopefulness which was their peculiar characteristic but nevertheless replied with undaunted cheerfulness i forgot anyhow its all the same for i worked it into that sunday walk and its just as easy to write it the other way you seelooking back down the hill you know something about the old padres toiling through the sand just before the angelus or as far back as sir francis drakes time and have a runaway boats crew coming ashore to look for gold that the mexicans had talked of lord thats easy enough i tell you what loo its worth living up here just for the inspiration even while boyishly exhaling this enthusiasm he was also divesting himself of certain bundles whose contents seemed to imply that he had brought his dinner with himthe youthful mrs harcourt setting the table in a perfunctory listless way that contrasted oddly with her husbands cheerful energy  you havent heard of any regular situation yet she asked abstractedly  nonot exactly he replied but buoyantly its a great deal better for me not to take anything in a hurry and tie myself to any particular line now im quite free  and i suppose you havent seen that mr fletcher again she continued  no he only wanted to know something about me thats the way with them all loo whenever i apply for work anywhere its always so youre danl harcourts son eh quarreled with the old man bad job better make it up youll make more stickin to him hes worth millions everybody seems to think everything of him as if i had no individuality beyond that ive a good mind to change my name  and pray what would mine be then  there was so much irritation in her voice that he drew nearer her and gently put his arm around her waist why whatever mine was darling he said with a tender smile you didnt fall in love with any particular name did you loo  no but i married a particular one she said quickly  his eyelids quivered again as if he was avoiding some unpleasantly staring suggestion and she stopped  you know what i mean dear she said with a quick little laugh just because your fathers an old crosspatch you havent lost your rights to his name and property and those people who say you ought to make it up perhaps know whats for the best  but you remember what he said of you loo said the young man with a flashing eye do you think i can ever forget that  but you do forget it dear you forget it when you go in town among fresh faces and people when you are looking for work you forget it when youre at work writing your copyfor ive seen you smile as you wrote you forget it climbing up the dreadful sand for you were thinking just now of what happened years ago or is to happen years to come and i want to forget it too milty i dont want to sit here all day thinking of it with the wind driving the sand against the window and nothing to look at but those white tombs in lone mountain cemetery and those white caps that might be gravestones too and not a soul to talk to or even see pass by until i feel as if i were dead and buried also if you were meyouyouyoucouldnt help crying too  indeed he was very near it now for as he caught her in his arms suddenly seeing with a lovers sympathy and the poets swifter imagination all that she had seen and even more he was aghast at the vision conjured in her delicate health and loneliness how dreadful must have been these monotonous days and this glittering cruel sea what a selfish brute he was yet as he stood there holding her silently and rhythmically marking his tenderness and remorseful feelings by rocking her from side to side like a languid metronome she quietly disengaged her wet lashes from his shoulder and said in quite another tone  so they were all at tasajara last week  who dear  your father and sisters  yes said john milton hesitatingly  and theyve taken back your sister after her divorce  the staring obtrusiveness of this fact apparently made her husbands bright sympathetic eye blink as before  and if you were to divorce me you would be taken back too she added quickly suddenly withdrawing herself with a pettish movement and walking to the window  but he followed dont talk in that way loo dont look in that way dear he said taking her hand gently yet not without a sense of some inconsistency in her conduct that jarred upon his own simple directness you know that nothing can part us now i was wrong to let my little girl worry herself all alone here but iithought it was all soso bright and free out on this hilllooking far away beyond the golden gateas far as cathay you know and such a change from those dismal flats of tasajara and that awful stretch of tules but its all right now and now that i know how you feel well go elsewhere  she did not reply perhaps she found it difficult to keep up her injured attitude in the face of her husbands gentleness perhaps her attention had been attracted by the unusual spectacle of a stranger who had just mounted the hill and was now slowly passing along the line of cottages with a hesitating air of inquiry he may be looking for this housefor you she said in an entirely new tone of interest run out and see it may be some one who wants  an article said milton cheerfully by jove he is coming here  the stranger was indeed approaching the little cottage and with apparently some confidence he was a welldressed wellmade man whose age looked uncertain from the contrast between his heavy brown moustache and his hair that curling under the brim of his hat was almost white in color the young man started and said hurriedly i really believe it is fletcherthey say his hair turned white from the panama fever  it was indeed mr fletcher who entered and introduced himselfa gentle reserved man with something of that colorlessness of premature age in his speech which was observable in his hair he had heard of mr harcourt from a friend who had recommended him highly as mr harcourt had probably been told he the speaker was about to embark some capital in a firstclass newspaper in san francisco and should select the staff himself he wanted to secure only firstrate talentbut above all youthfulness directness and originality the clarion for that was to be its name was to have nothing old fogy about it no it was distinctly to be the organ of young california this and much more from the grave lips of the elderly young man whose speech seemed to be divided between the pretty but equally faded young wife and the one personification of invincible youth presenther husband  but i fear i have interrupted your household duties he said pleasantly you were preparing dinner pray go on and let me help youim not a bad cookand you can give me my reward by letting me share it with you for the climb up here has sharpened my appetite we can talk as we go on  it was in vain to protest there was something paternal as well as practical in the camaraderie of this actual capitalist and possible maecenas and patron as he quietly hung up his hat and overcoat and helped to set the table with a practiced hand nor as he suggested did the conversation falter and before they had taken their seats at the frugal board he had already engaged john milton harcourt as assistant editor of the clarion at a salary that seemed princely to this son of a millionaire the young wife meantime had taken active part in the discussion whether it was vaguely understood that the possession of poetical and imaginative faculties precluded any capacity for business or whether it was owing to the apparent superior maturity of mrs harcourt and the stranger it was certain that they arranged the practical details of the engagement and that the youthful husband sat silent merely offering his always hopeful and sanguine consent  youll take a house nearer to town i suppose continued mr fletcher to the lady though youve a charming view here i suppose it was quite a change from tasajara and your fatherinlaws house i daresay he had as fine a place thereon his own homesteadas he has here  young harcourt dropped his sensitive eyelids again it seemed hard that he could never get away from these allusions to his father perhaps it was only to that relationship that he was indebted for his visitors kindness in his simple honesty he could not bear the thought of such a misapprehension perhaps mr fletcher you do not know he said that my father is not on terms with me and that we neither expect anything nor could we ever take anything from him could we loo he added the useless question partly because he saw that his wifes face betrayed little sympathy with him and partly that fletcher was looking at her curiously as if for confirmation but this was another of john miltons trials as an imaginative reporter nobody ever seemed to care for his practical opinions or facts  mr fletcher is not interested in our little family differences milty she said looking at mr fletcher however instead of him youre daniel harcourts son whatever happens  the cloud that had passed over the young mans face and eyes did not however escape mr fletchers attention for he smiled and added gayly and i hope my valued lieutenant in any case nevertheless john milton was quite ready to avail himself of an inspiration to fetch some cigars for his guest from the bar of the seaview house on the slope of the hill beyond and thereby avoid a fateful subject once in the fresh air again he promptly recovered his boyish spirits the light flying scud had already effaced the first rising stars the lower creeping seafog had already blotted out the western shore and sea but below him to the east the glittering lights of the city seemed to start up with a new mysterious and dazzling brilliancy it was the valley of diamonds that sindbad saw lying almost at his feet perhaps somewhere there the light of his own fame and fortune was already beginning to twinkle  he returned to his humble roof joyous and inspired as he entered the hall he heard his wifes voice and his own name mentioned followed by that awkward meaningless silence on his entrance which so plainly indicated either that he had been the subject of conversation or that it was not for his ears it was a dismal reminder of his boyhood at sidon and tasajara but he was too full of hope and ambition to heed it tonight and later when mr fletcher had taken his departure his pentup enthusiasm burst out before his youthful partner had she realized that their struggles were over now that their future was secure they need no longer fear ever being forced to take bounty from the family they were independent of them all he would make a name for himself that should be distinct from his fathers as he should make a fortune that would be theirs alone the young wife smiled but all that need not prevent you dear from claiming your rights when the time comes  but if i scorn to make the claim or take a penny of his loo  you say you scorn to take the money you think your father got by a mere trickat the bestand didnt earn and now you will be able to show you can live without it and earn your own fortune well dear for that very reason why should you let your father and others enjoy and waste what is fairly your share for it is your share whether it came to your father fairly or not and if not it is still your duty believing as you do to claim it from him that at least you may do with it what you choose you might want to restore ittotosomebody  the young man laughed but my dear loo suppose that i were weak enough to claim it do you think my father would give it up he has the right and no law could force him to yield to me more than he chooses  not the law but you could  i dont understand you he said quickly  you could force him by simply telling him what you once told me  john milton drew back and his hand dropped loosely from his wifes the color left his fresh young face the light quivered for a moment and then became fixed and set in his eyes for that moment he looked ten years her senior i was wrong ever to tell even you that loo he said in a low voice you are wrong to ever remind me of it forget it from this moment as you value our love and want it to live and be remembered and forget loo as i doand ever shallthat you ever suggested to me to use my secret in the way you did just now  but here mrs harcourt burst into tears more touched by the alteration in her husbands manner i fear than by any contrition for wrongdoing of course if he wished to withdraw his confidences from her just as he had almost confessed he wished to withdraw his name she couldnt help it but it was hard that when she sat there all day long trying to think what was best for them she should be blamed at which the quiet and forgiving john milton smiled remorsefully and tried to comfort her nevertheless an occasional odd indefinable chill seemed to creep across the feverish enthusiasm with which he was celebrating this day of fortune and yet he neither knew nor suspected until long after that his foolish wife had that night half betrayed his secret to the stranger  the next day he presented a note of introduction from mr fletcher to the business manager of the clarion and the following morning was duly installed in office he did not see his benefactor again that single visit was left in the mystery and isolation of an angelic episode it later appeared that other and larger interests in the san jose valley claimed his patrons residence and attendance only the capital and general purpose of the paperto develop into a party organ in the interest of his possible senatorial aspirations in due seasonwas furnished by him grateful as john milton felt towards him he was relieved it seemed probable that mr fletcher had selected him on his individual merits and not as the son of a millionaire  he threw himself into his work with his old hopeful enthusiasm and perhaps an originality of method that was part of his singular independence without the students training or restraintfor his two years schooling at tasajara during his parents prosperity came too late to act as a disciplinehe was unfettered by any rules and guided only by an unerring instinctive taste that became near being genius he was a brilliant and original if not always a profound and accurate reporter by degrees he became an accustomed interest to the readers of the clarion then an influence actors themselves in many a fierce drama living lives of devotion emotion and picturesque incident they had satisfied themselves with only the briefest and most practical daily record of their adventure and even at first were dazed and startled to find that many of them had been heroes and some poets the stealthy boyish reader of romantic chronicle at sidon had learned by heart the chivalrous story of the emigration the second column of the clarion became famous even while the figure of its youthful writer unknown and unrecognized was still nightly climbing the sands of russian hill and even looking down as before on the lights of the growing city without a thought that he had added to that glittering constellation  cheerful and contented with the exercise of work he would have been happy but for the gradual haunting of another dread which presently began to drag him at earlier hours up the steep path to his little home to halt him before the door with the quickened breath of an anxiety he would scarcely confess to himself and sometimes hold him aimlessly a whole day beneath his roof for the pretty but delicate mrs harcourt like others of her class had added a weak and ineffective maternity to their other conjugal trials and one early dawn a baby was born that lingered with them scarcely longer than the morning mist and exhaled with the rising sun the young wife regained her strength slowlyso slowly that the youthful husband brought his work at times to the house to keep her company and a singular change had come over her she no longer talked of the past nor of his family as if the little life that had passed with that morning mist had represented some ascending expiatory sacrifice it seemed to have brought them into closer communion  yet her weak condition made him conceal another trouble that had come upon him it was in the third month of his employment on the clarion that one afternoon while correcting some proofs on his chiefs desk he came upon the following editorial paragraph  the playedout cant of pioneer genius and pioneer discovery appears to have reached its climax in the attempt of some of our contemporaries to apply it to dan harcourts new tasajara job before the legislature it is perfectly well known in harcourts own district that far from being a pioneer and settler himself he simply succeeded after a fashion to the genuine work of one elijah curtis an actual pioneer and discoverer years before while harcourt we believe was keeping a frontier doggery in sidon and dispensing tanglefoot and salt junk to the hayfooted pike countians of his precinct this would make him as much of the pioneer discoverer as the rattlesnake who first takes up board and lodgings and then possession in a prairie dogs burrow and if the travelers tale is true that the rattlesnake sometimes makes a meal of his landlord the story told at sidon may be equally credible that the original pioneer mysteriously disappeared about the time that dan harcourt came into the property from which it would seem that harcourt is not in a position for his friends to invite very deep scrutiny into his pioneer achievements  stupefaction a vague terror and rising anger rapidly succeeded each other in the young mans mind as he stood mechanically holding the paper in his hand it was the writing of his chief editor whose easy brutality he had sometimes even boyishly admired without stopping to consider their relative positions he sought him indignantly and laid the proof before him the editor laughed but whats that to you youre not on terms with the old man  but he is my father said john milton hotly  look here said the editor goodnaturedly id like to oblige you but it isnt business you knowand this is you understandproprietors business too of course i see it might stand in the way of your making up to the old man afterwards and coming in for a million well you can tell him its me say i would put it in say im nastyand i am  then it must go in said john milton with a white face  you bet  then i must go out and writing out his resignation he laid it before his chief and left  but he could not bear to tell this to his wife when he climbed the hill that night and he invented some excuse for bringing his work home the invalid never noticed any change in his usual buoyancy and indeed i fear when he was fairly installed with his writing materials at the foot of her bed he had quite forgotten the episode he was recalled to it by a faint sigh  what is it dear he said looking up  i like to see you writing milty you always look so happy  always so happy dear  yes you are happy are you not  always he got up and kissed her nevertheless when he sat down to his work again his face was turned a little more to the window  another serious incidentto be also kept from the invalidshortly followed the article in the clarion had borne its fruit the third day after his resignation a rival paper sharply retorted the cowardly insinuations against the record of a justly honored capitalist said the pioneer although quite in keeping with the brazen clarion might attract the attentions of the slandered party if it were not known to his friends as well as himself that it may be traced almost directly to a castoff member of his own family who it seems is reduced to haunting the back doors of certain blatant journals to dispose of his cheap wares the slanderer is secure from public exposure in the superior decency of his relations who refrain from airing their family linen upon editorial lines  this was the journal to which john milton had hopefully turned for work when he read it there seemed but one thing for him to doand he did it gentle and optimistic as was his nature he had been brought up in a community where sincere directness of personal offense was followed by equally sincere directness of personal redress andhe challenged the editor the bearer of his cartel was one jack hamlin i grieve to say a gambler by profession but between whom and john milton had sprung up an odd friendship of which the best that can be said is that it was to each equally and unselfishly unprofitable the challenge was accepted the preliminaries arranged i suppose said jack carelessly as the old man ought to do something for your wife in case of accident youve made some sort of a will  ive thought of that said john milton dubiously but im afraid its no use you seehe hesitatedim not of age  may i ask how old you are sonny said jack with great gravity  im almost twenty said john milton coloring  it isnt exactly vingtetun but id stand on it if i were you i wouldnt draw to such a hand said jack coolly  the young husband had arranged to be absent from his home that night and early morning found him with jack grave but courageous in a little hollow behind the mission hills to them presently approached his antagonist jauntily accompanied by colonel starbottle his second they halted but after the formal salutation were instantly joined by jack hamlin for a few moments john milton remained awkwardly alonepending a conversation which even at that supreme moment he felt as being like the general attitude of his friends towards him in its complete ignoring of himself the next moment the three men stepped towards him we have come sir said colonel starbottle in his precisest speech but his jauntiest manner to offer you a full and ample apologya personal apologywhich only supplements that full public apology that my principal sir this gentleman indicating the editor of the pioneer has this morning made in the columns of his paper as you will observe producing a newspaper we have sir continued the colonel loftily only within the last twelve hours become aware of theerreal circumstances of the case we would regret that the affair had gone so far already if it had not given us sir the opportunity of testifying to your gallantry we do so gladly and iferera few years later mr harcourt you should ever needa friend in any matter of this kind i am sir at your service john milton gazed half inquiringly half uneasily at jack  its all right milt he said sotto voce shake hands all round and lets go to breakfast and i rather think that editor wants to employ you himself  it was true for when that night he climbed eagerly the steep homeward hill he carried with him the written offer of an engagement on the pioneer as he entered the door his wifes nurse and companion met him with a serious face there had been a strange and unexpected change in the patients condition and the doctor had already been there twice as he put aside his coat and hat and entered her room it seemed to him that he had forever put aside all else of essay and ambition beyond those four walls and with the thought a great peace came upon him it seemed good to him to live for her alone  it was not for long as each monotonous day brought the morning mist and evening fog regularly to the little hilltop where his whole being was now centred she seemed to grow daily weaker and the little circle of her life narrowed day by day one morning when the usual mist appeared to have been withheld and the sun had risen with a strange and cruel brightness when the waves danced and sparkled on the bay below and light glanced from dazzling sails and even the white tombs on lone mountain glittered keenly when cheery voices hailing each other on the hillside came to him clearly but without sense or meaning when earth sky and sea seemed quivering with life and motionhe opened the door of that one little house on which the only shadow seemed to have fallen and went forth again into the world alone     chaper vii   mr daniel harcourts town mansion was also on an eminence but it was that gentler acclivity of fashion known as rincon hill and sunned itself on a southern slope of luxury it had been described as princely and fairylike by a grateful reporter tourists and travelers had sung its praises in letters to their friends and in private reminiscences for it had dispensed hospitality to most of the celebrities who had visited the coast nevertheless its charm was mainly due to the ruling taste of miss clementina harcourt who had astonished her father by her marvelous intuition of the nice requirements and elegant responsibilities of their position and had thrown her mother into the pained perplexity of a matronly hen who among the ducks eggs intrusted to her fostering care had unwittingly hatched a graceful but discomposing cygnet  indeed after holding out feebly against the siege of wealth at tasajara and san francisco mrs harcourt had abandoned herself hopelessly to the horrors of its invasion had allowed herself to be dragged from her kitchen by her exultant daughters and set up in black silk in a certain conventional respectability in the drawingroom strange to say her commiserating hospitality or hospitallike ministration not only gave her popularity but a certain kind of distinction an exaltation so sorrowfully deprecated by its possessor was felt to be a sign of superiority she was spoken of as motherly even by those who vaguely knew that there was somewhere a discarded son struggling in poverty with a helpless wife and that she had sided with her husband in disinheriting a daughter who had married unwisely she was sentimentally spoken of as a true wife while never opposing a single meanness of her husband suggesting a single active virtue nor questioning her right to sacrifice herself and her family for his sake with nothing she cared to affect she was quite free from affectation and even the critical lawrence grant was struck with the dignity which her narrow simplicity that had seemed small even in sidon attained in her palatial hall in san francisco it appeared to be a perfectly logical conclusion that when such unaffectedness and simplicity were forced to assume a hostile attitude to anybody the latter must be to blame  since the festival of tasajara mr grant had been a frequent visitor at harcourts and was a guest on the eve of his departure from san francisco the distinguished position of each made their relations appear quite natural without inciting gossip as to any attraction in harcourts daughters it was late one afternoon as he was passing the door of harcourts study that his host called him in he found him sitting at his desk with some papers before him and a folded copy of the clarion with his back to the fading light of the window his face was partly in shadow  by the way grant he began with an assumption of carelessness somewhat inconsistent with the fact that he had just called him in it may be necessary for me to pull up those fellows who are blackguarding me in the clarion  why they havent been saying anything new asked grant laughingly as he glanced towards the paper  nothat isonly a rehash of what they said before returned harcourt without opening the paper  well said grant playfully you dont mind their saying that youre not the original pioneer of tasajara for its true nor that that fellow lige curtis disappeared suddenly for he did if i remember rightly but theres nothing in that to invalidate your rights to tasajara to say nothing of your five years undisputed possession  of course theres no legal question said harcourt almost sharply but as a matter of absurd report i may want to contradict their insinuations and you remember all the circumstances dont you  i should think so why my dear fellow ive told it everywherehere in new york newport and in london by jove its one of my best stories how a company sent me out with a surveyor to look up a railroad and agricultural possibilities in the wilderness how just as i found themand a rather big thing they made tooi was set afloat by a flood and a raft and drifted ashore on your bank and practically demonstrated to you what you didnt know and didnt dare to hope forthat there could be a waterway straight to sidon from the embarcadero ive told what a charming evening we had with you and your daughters in the old house and how i returned your hospitality by giving you a tip about the railroad and how you slipped out while we were playing cards to clinch the bargain for the land with that drunken fellow lige curtis  whats that interrupted harcourt quickly  it was well that the shadow hid from grant the expression of harcourts face or his reply might have been sharper as it was he answered a little stiffly  i beg your pardon  harcourt recovered himself youre all wrong he said that bargain was made long before i never saw lige curtis after you came to the house it was before that in the afternoon he went on hurriedly that he was last in my store i can prove it nevertheless he was so shocked and indignant at being confronted in his own suppressions and falsehoods by an even greater and more astounding misconception of fact that for a moment he felt helpless what he reflected if it were alleged that lige had returned again after the loafers had gone or had never left the store as had been said nonsense there was john milton who had been there reading all the time and who could disprove it yes but john milton was his discarded sonhis enemyperhaps even his very slanderer  but said grant quietly dont you remember that your daughter euphemia said something that evening about the land lige had offered you and you snapped up the young lady rather sharply for letting out secrets and then you went out at least thats my impression  it was however more than an impression with grants scientific memory for characteristic details he had noticed that particular circumstance as part of the social phenomena  i dont know what phemie said returned harcourt impatiently i know there was no offer pending the land had been sold to me before i ever saw you whyyou must have thought me up to pretty sharp practice with curtiseh he added with a forced laugh  grant smiled he had been accustomed to hear of such sharp practice among his business acquaintance although he himself by nature and profession was incapable of it but he had not deemed harcourt more scrupulous than others perhaps so he said lightly but for heavens sake dont ask me to spoil my reputation as a raconteur for the sake of a mere fact or two i assure you its a mighty taking story as i tell itand it dont hurt you in a business way youre the hero of ithang it all  yes said harcourt without noticing grants half cynical superiority but youll oblige me if you wont tell it again in that way there are men here mean enough to make the worst of it its nothing to me of course but my familythe girls you knoware rather sensitive  i had no idea they even knew itmuch less cared for it said grant with sudden seriousness i dare say if those fellows in the clarion knew that they were annoying the ladies theyd drop it whos the editor look hereleave it to me ill look into it better that you shouldnt appear in the matter at all  you understand that if it was a really serious matter grant said harcourt with a slight attitude i shouldnt allow any one to take my place  my dear fellow therell be nobody called out and no shooting at sight whatever is the result of my interference returned grant lightly itll be all right he was quite aware of the power of his own independent position and the fact that he had been often appealed to before in delicate arbitration  harcourt was equally conscious of this but by a strange inconsistency now felt relieved at the coolness with which grant had accepted the misconception which had at first seemed so dangerous if he were ready to condone what he thought was sharp practice he could not be less lenient with the real facts that might come outof course always excepting that interpolated consideration in the bill of sale which however no one but the missing curtis could ever discover the fact that a man of grants secure position had interested himself in this matter would secure him from the working of that personal vulgar jealousy which his humbler antecedents had provoked and if as he fancied grant really cared for clementina  as you like he said with halfaffected lightness and now let us talk of something else clementina has been thinking of getting up a riding party to san mateo for mrs ashwood we must show them some civility and that boston brother of hers mr shipley will have to be invited also i cant get away and my wife of course will only be able to join them at san mateo in the carriage i reckon it would be easier for clementina if you took my place and helped her look after the riding party it will need a man and i think shed prefer youas you know shes rather particularunless of course youd be wanted for mrs ashwood or phemie or somebody else  from his shadowed corner he could see that a pleasant light had sprung into grants eyes although his reply was in his ordinary easy banter i shall be only too glad to act as miss clementinas vaquero and lasso her runaways or keep stragglers in the road  there seemed to be small necessity however for this active cooperation for when the cheerful cavalcade started from the house a few mornings later mr lawrence grants onerous duties seemed to be simply confined to those of an ordinary cavalier at the side of miss clementina a few paces in the rear of the party but this safe distance gave them the opportunity of conversing without being overheardan apparently discreet precaution  your father was so exceedingly affable to me the other day that if i hadnt given you my promise to say nothing i think i would have fallen on my knees to him then and there revealed my feelings asked for your hand and his blessingor whatever one does at such a time but how long do you intend to keep me in this suspense  clementina turned her clear eyes half abstractedly upon him as if imperfectly recalling some forgotten situation you forget she said that part of your promise was that you wouldnt even speak of it to me again without my permission  but my time is so short now give me some definite hope before i go let me believe that when we meet in new york  you will find me just the same as now yes i think i can promise that let that suffice you said the other day you liked me because i had not changed for five years you can surely trust that i will not alter in as many months  if i only knew  ah if i only knewif we all only knew but we dont come mr grant let it rest as it is unless you want to go still further back and have it as it was at sidon there i think you fancied euphemia most  clementina  that is my name and those people ahead of us know it already  you are called clementinabut you are not merciful  you are very wrong for you might see that mr shipley has twice checked his horse that he might hear what you are saying and phemie is always showing mrs ashwood something in the landscape behind us  all this was the more hopeless and exasperating to grant since in the young girls speech and manner there was not the slightest trace of coquetry or playfulness he could not help saying a little bitterly i dont think that any one would imagine from your manner that you were receiving a declaration  but they might imagine from yours that you had the right to quarrel with mewhich would be worse  we cannot part like this it is too cruel to me  we cannot part otherwise without the risk of greater cruelty  but say at least clementina that i have no rival there is no other more favored suitor  that is so like a manand yet so unlike the proud one i believed you to be why should a man like you even consider such a possibility if i were a man i know i couldnt she turned upon him a glance so clear and untroubled by either conscious vanity or evasion that he was hopelessly convinced of the truth of her statement and she went on in a slightly lowered tone you have no right to ask me such a questionbut perhaps for that reason i am willing to answer you there is none hush for a good rider you are setting a poor example to the others by crowding me towards the bank go forward and talk to phemie and tell her not to worry mrs ashwoods horse nor race with her i dont think hes quite safe and mrs ashwood isnt accustomed to using the spanish bit i suppose i must say something to mr shipley who doesnt seem to understand that im acting as chaperon and you as captain of the party  she cantered forward as she spoke and grant was obliged to join her sister who mounted on a powerful roan was mischievously exciting a beautiful quakercolored mustang ridden by mrs ashwood already irritated by the unfamiliar pressure of the eastern womans hand upon his bit the thick dust which had forced the party of twenty to close up in two solid files across the road compelled them at the first opening in the roadside fence to take the field in a straggling gallop grant eager to escape from his own discontented self by doing something for others reined in beside euphemia and the fair stranger  let me take your place until mrs ashwoods horse is quieted he half whispered to euphemia  thank youand i suppose it does not make any matter to clem who quiets mine she said with provoking eyes and a toss of her head worthy of the spirited animal she was riding  she thinks you quite capable of managing yourself and even others he replied with a playful glance at shipley who was riding somewhat stiffly on the other side  dont be too sure retorted phemie with another dangerous look i may give you trouble yet  they were approaching the first undulation of the russet plain they had emerged uponan umbrageous slope that seemed suddenly to diverge in two defiles among the shaded hills grant had given a few words of practical advice to mrs ashwood and shown her how to guide her mustang by the merest caressing touch of the rein upon its sensitive neck he had not been sympathetically inclined towards the fair stranger a rich and still youthful widow although he could not deny her unquestioned good breeding mental refinement and a certain languorous thoughtfulness that was almost melancholy which accented her blonde delicacy but he had noticed that her manner was politely reserved and slightly constrained towards the harcourts and he had already resented it with a lovers instinctive loyalty he had at first attributed it to a want of sympathy between mrs ashwoods more intellectual sentimentalities and the harcourts undeniable lack of any sentiment whatever but there was evidently some other innate antagonism he was very polite to mrs ashwood she responded with a gentlewomans courtesy and he was forced to admit even a broader comprehension of his own merits than the harcourt girls had ever shown but he could still detect that she was not in accord with the party  i am afraid you do not like california mrs ashwood he said pleasantly you perhaps find the life here too unrestrained and unconventional  she looked at him in quick astonishment are you quite sincere why it strikes me that this is just what it is not and i have so longed for something quite different from what i have been told about the originality and adventure of everything here and your independence of old social forms and customs i am afraid i expected the opposite of what ive seen why this very partyexcept that the ladies are prettier and more expensively gotten upis like any party that might have ridden out at saratoga or new york  and as stupid you would say  as conventional mr grant always excepting this lovely creature beneath me whom i cant make out and who doesnt seem to care that i should there look i told you so  her mustang had suddenly bounded forward but as grant followed he could see that the cause was the example of phemie who had in some mad freak dashed out in a frantic gallop a halfdozen of the younger people hilariously accepted the challenge the excitement was communicated to the others until the whole cavalcade was sweeping down the slope grant was still at mrs ashwoods side restraining her mustang and his own impatient horse when clementina joined them phemies mare has really bolted i fear she said in a quick whisper ride on and never mind us grant looked quickly ahead phemies roan excited by the shouts behind her and to all appearance ungovernable was fast disappearing with her rider without a word trusting to his own good horsemanship and better knowledge of the ground he darted out of the cavalcade to overtake her  but the unfortunate result of this was to give further impulse to the now racing horses as they approached a point where the slope terminated in two diverging canyons mrs ashwood gave a sharp pull upon her bit to her consternation the mustang stopped short almost instantlyplanting his two fore feet rigidly in the dust and even sliding forward with the impetus had her seat been less firm she might have been thrown but she recovered herself although in doing so she still bore upon the bit when to her astonishment the mustang deliberately stiffened himself as if for a shock and then began to back slowly quivering with excitement she did not know that her nativebred animal fondly believed that he was participating in a rodeo and that to his equine intelligence his fair mistress had just lassoed something in vain she urged him forward he still waited for the shock when the cloud of dust in which she had been enwrapped drifted away she saw to her amazement that she was alone the entire party had disappeared into one of the canyonsbut which one she could not tell  when she succeeded at last in urging her mustang forward again she determined to take the righthand canyon and trust to being either met or overtaken a more practical and less adventurous nature would have waited at the point of divergence for the return of some of the party but mrs ashwood was in truth not sorry to be left to herself and the novel scenery for a while and she had no doubt but she would eventually find her way to the hotel at san mateo which could not be far away in time for luncheon  the road was still well defined although it presently began to wind between ascending ranks of pines and larches that marked the terraces of hills so high that she wondered she had not noticed them from the plains an unmistakable suggestion of some haunting primeval solitude a sense of the hushed and mysterious proximity of a nature she had never known before the strange halfintoxicating breath of unsunned foliage and untrodden grasses and herbs all combined to exalt her as she cantered forward even her horse seemed to have acquired an intelligent liberty or rather to have established a sympathy with her in his needs and her own longings instinctively she no longer pulled him with the curb the reins hung loosely on his selfarched and unfettered neck secure in this loneliness she found herself even talking to him with barbaric freedom as she went on the vague hush of all things animate and inanimate around her seemed to thicken until she unconsciously halted before a dim and pillared wood and a vast and heathless opening on whose mute brown lips nature seemed to have laid the finger of silence she forgot the party she had left she forgot the luncheon she was going to more important still she forgot that she had already left the traveled track far behind her and tremulous with anticipation rode timidly into that arch of shadow  as her horses hoofs fell noiselessly on the elastic mosscarpeted aisle she forgot even more than that she forgot the artificial stimulus and excitement of the life she had been leading so long she forgot the small meannesses and smaller worries of her welltodo experiences she forgot herselfrather she regained a self she had long forgotten for in the sweet seclusion of this half darkened sanctuary the clinging fripperies of her past slipped from her as a tawdry garment the petted spoiled and vapidly precocious girlhood which had merged into a womanhood of aimless triumphs and meaner ambitions the worldly but miserable triumph of a marriage that had left her delicacy abused and her heart sick and unsatisfied the wifehood without home seclusion or maternity the widowhood that at last brought relief but with it the consciousness of hopelessly wasted youthall this seemed to drop from her here as lightly as the winged needles or noiseless withered spray from the dim gray vault above her head in the sovereign balm of that woodland breath her better spirit was restored somewhere in these wholesome shades seemed to still lurk what should have been her innocent and nymphlike youth and to come out once more and greet her old songs she had forgotten or whose music had failed in the discords of her frivolous life sang themselves to her again in that sweet grave silence girlish dreams that she had foolishly been ashamed of or had put away with her childish toys stole back to her once more and became real in this tender twilight old fancies old fragments of verse and childish lore grew palpable and moved faintly before her the boyish prince who should have come was there the babe that should have been hers was thereshe stopped suddenly with flaming eyes and indignant color for it appeared that a man was there too and had just risen from the fallen tree where he had been sitting     chaper viii   she had so far forgotten herself in yielding to the spell of the place and in the revelation of her naked soul and inner nature that it was with something of the instinct of outraged modesty that she seemed to shrink before this apparition of the outer world and outer worldliness in an instant the nearer past returned she remembered where she was how she had come there from whom she had come and to whom she was returning she could see that she had not only aimlessly wandered from the world but from the road and for that instant she hated this man who had reminded her of it even while she knew she must ask his assistance it relieved her slightly to observe that he seemed as disturbed and impatient as herself and as he took a pencil from between his lips and returned it to his pocket he scarcely looked at her  but with her return to the world of convenances came its repression and with a gentlewomans ease and modulated voice she leaned over her mustangs neck and said i have strayed from my party and am afraid i have lost my way we were going to the hotel at san mateo would you be kind enough to direct me there or show me how i can regain the road by which i came  her voice and manner were quite enough to arrest him where he stood with a pleased surprise in his fresh and ingenuous face she looked at him more closely he was in spite of his long silken mustache so absurdly young he might in spite of that youth be so absurdly manlike what was he doing there was he a farmers son an artist a surveyor or a city clerk out for a holiday was there perhaps a youthful female of his species somewhere for whom he was waiting and upon whose tryst she was now breaking was heterrible thoughtthe outlying picket of some family picnic his dress neat simple free from ostentatious ornament betrayed nothing she waited for his voice  oh you have left san mateo miles away to the right he said with quick youthful sympathy at least five miles where did you leave your party  his voice was winning and even refined she thought she answered it quite spontaneously at a fork of two roads i see now i took the wrong turning  yes you took the road to crystal spring its just down there in the valley not more than a mile youd have been there now if you hadnt turned off at the woods  i couldnt help it it was so beautiful  isnt it  perfect  and such shadows and such intensity of color  wonderfuland all along the ridge looking down that defile  yes and that point where it seems as if you had only to stretch out your hand to pick a manzanita berry from the other side of the canyon half a mile across  yes and that first glimpse of the valley through the gothic gateway of rocks  and the color of those rockscinnamon and bronze with the light green of the yerba buena vine splashing over them  yes but for color did you notice that hillside of yellow poppies pouring down into the valley like a golden niagara  certainlyand the perfect clearness of everything  and yet such complete silence and repose  oh yes  ah yes  they were both gravely nodding and shaking their heads with sparkling eyes and brightened color looking not at each other but at the far landscape vignetted through a lozengeshaped wind opening in the trees suddenly mrs ashwood straightened herself in the saddle looked grave lifted the reins and apparently the ten years with them that had dropped from her but she said in her easiest wellbred tones and a half sigh then i must take the road back again to where it forks  oh no you can go by crystal spring its no further and ill show you the way but youd better stop and rest yourself and your horse for a little while at the springs hotel its a very nice place many people ride there from san francisco to luncheon and return i wonder that your party didnt prefer it and if they are looking for youas they surely must be he said as if with a sudden conception of her importance theyll come there when they find youre not at san mateo  this seemed reasonable although the process of being fetched and taking the five miles ride which she had enjoyed so much alone in company was not attractive couldnt i go on at once she said impulsively  you would meet them sooner he said thoughtfully  this was quite enough for mrs ashwood i think ill rest this poor horse who is really tired she said with charming hypocrisy and stop at the hotel  she saw his face brighten perhaps he was the son of the hotel proprietor or a youthful partner himself i suppose you live here she suggested gently you seem to know the place so well  no he returned quickly i only run down here from san francisco when i can get a day off  a day off he was in some regular employment but he continued and i used to go to boardingschool near here and know all these woods well  he must be a native how odd she had not conceived that there might be any other population here than the immigrants perhaps that was what made him so interesting and different from the others then your father and mother live here she said  his frank face incapable of disguise changed suddenly no he said simply but without any trace of awkwardness then after a slight pause he laid his handshe noticed it was white and well kepton her mustangs neck and said ifif you care to trust yourself to me i could lead you and your horse down a trail into the valley that is at least a third of the distance shorter it would save you going back to the regular road and there are one or two lovely views that i could show you i should be so pleased if it would not trouble you theres a steep place or twobut i think theres no danger  i shall not be afraid  she smiled so graciously and as she fully believed maternally that he looked at her the second time to his first hurried impression of her as an elegant and delicately nurtured womanone of the class of distinguished tourists that fashion was beginning to send thitherhe had now to add that she had a quantity of fine silkenspun light hair gathered in a heavy braid beneath her gray hat that her mouth was very delicately lipped and beautifully sensitive that her soft skin although just then touched with excitement was a pale faded velvet and seemed to be worn with ennui rather than experience that her eyes were hidden behind a strip of gray veil whence only a faint glow was discernible to this must still be added a poetic fancy all his own that as she sat there with the skirt of her gray habit falling from her long bodiced waist over the mustangs fawncolored flanks and with her slim gauntleted hands lightly swaying the reins she looked like queen guinevere in the forest not that he particularly fancied queen guinevere or that he at all imagined himself launcelot but it was quite in keeping with the suggestionhaunted brain of john milton harcourt whom the astute reader has of course long since recognized  preceding her through the soft carpeted vault with a woodmans instinctfor there was apparently no trail to be seenthe soft inner twilight began to give way to the outer stronger day and presently she was startled to see the clear blue of the sky before her on apparently the same level as the brown pinetessellated floor she was treading not only did this show her that she was crossing a ridge of the upland but a few moments later she had passed beyond the woods to a golden hillside that sloped towards a leafy sheltered and exquisitelyproportioned valley a tiny but picturesque tower and a few straggling roofs and gables the flashing of a crystal stream through the leaves and a narrow white ribbon of road winding behind it indicated the hostelry they were seeking so peaceful and unfrequented it looked nestling between the hills that it seemed as if they had discovered it  with his hand at times upon the bridle at others merely caressing her mustangs neck he led the way there were a few breathless places where the crown of his straw hat appeared between her horses reins and again when she seemed almost slipping over on his shoulder but they were passed with such frank fearlessness and invincible youthful confidence on the part of her escort that she felt no timidity there were moments when a bit of the charmed landscape unfolding before them overpowered them both and they halted to gazesometimes without a word or only a significant gesture of sympathy and attention at one of those artistic manifestations mrs ashwood laid her slim gloved fingers lightly but unwittingly on john miltons arm and withdrew them however with a quick girlish apology and a foolish color which annoyed her more than the appearance of familiarity but they were now getting well down into the valley the court of the little hotel was already opening before them their unconventional relations in the idyllic world above had changed the new one required some delicacy of handling and she had an idea that even the simplicity of the young stranger might be confusing  i must ask you to continue to act as my escort she said laughingly i am mrs ashwood of philadelphia visiting san francisco with my sister and brother who are i am afraid even now hopelessly waiting luncheon for me at san mateo but as there seems to be no prospect of my joining them in time i hope you will be able to give me the pleasure of your company with whatever they may give us here in the way of refreshment  i shall be very happy returned john milton with unmistakable candor but perhaps some of your friends will be arriving in quest of you if they are not already here  then they will join us or wait said mrs ashwood incisively with her first exhibition of the imperiousness of a rich and pretty woman perhaps she was a little annoyed that her elaborate introduction of herself had produced no reciprocal disclosure by her companion will you please send the landlord to me she added  john milton disappeared in the hotel as she cantered to the porch in another moment she was giving the landlord her orders with the easy confidence of one who knew herself only as an always welcome and highly privileged guest which was not without its effect and she added carelessly when everything is ready you will please tellmr  harcourt suggested the landlord promptly  mrs ashwoods perfectly trained face gave not the slightest sign of the surprise that had overtaken her of coursemr harcourt  you know hes the son of the millionaire continued the landlord not at all unwilling to display the importance of the habitues of crystal spring though theyve quarreled and dont get on together  i know said the lady languidly and if any one comes here for me ask them to wait in the parlor until i come  then submitting herself and her dusty habit to the awkward ministration of the irish chambermaid she was quite thrilled with a delightful curiosity she vaguely remembered that she had heard something of the harcourt family discordbut that was the divorced daughter surely and this young man was harcourts son and they had quarreled a quarrel with a frank open ingenuous fellow like thata mere boycould only be the fathers fault luckily she had never mentioned the name of harcourt she would not now he need not know that it was his father who had originated the party why should she make him uncomfortable for the few moments they were together  there was nothing of this in her face as she descended and joined him he thought that face handsome wellbred and refined but this breeding and refinement seemed to himin his ignorance of the world possiblyas only a graceful concealment of a self of which he knew nothing and he was not surprised to find that her pretty gray eyes now no longer hidden by her veil really told him no more than her lips he was a little afraid of her and now that she had lost her naive enthusiasm he was conscious of a vague remorsefulness for his interrupted work in the forest what was he doing here he who had avoided the cruel selfish world of wealth and pleasurea world that this woman representedthe world that had stood apart from him in the one dream of his lifeand had let loo die his quickly responsive face darkened  i am afraid i really interrupted you up there she said gently looking in his face with an expression of unfeigned concern you were at work of some kind i know and i have very selfishly thought only of myself but the whole scene was so new to me and i so rarely meet any one who sees things as i do that i know you will forgive me she bent her eyes upon him with a certain soft timidity you are an artist  i am afraid not he said coloring and smiling faintly i dont think i could draw a straight line  dont try to theyre not pretty and the mere ability to draw them straight or curved doesnt make an artist but you are a lover of nature i know and from what i have heard you say i believe you can do what lovers cannot domake others feel as they doand that is what i call being an artist you write you are a poet  oh dear no he said with a smile half of relief and half of naive superiority im a prose writeron a daily newspaper  to his surprise she was not disconcerted rather a look of animation lit up her face as she said brightly oh then you can of course satisfy my curiosity about something you know the road from san francisco to the cliff house except for the view of the sealions when one gets there its stupid my brother says its like all the san francisco excursionsa dusty drive with a julep at the end of it well one day we were coming back from a drive there and when we were beginning to wind along the brow of that dreadful staring lone mountain cemetery i said i would get out and walk and avoid the obtrusive glitter of those tombstones rising before me all the way i pushed open a little gate and passed in once among these funereal shrubs and cold statuesque lilies everything was changed i saw the staring tombstones no longer for like them i seemed to be always facing the sea the road had vanished everything had vanished but the endless waste of ocean below me and the last slope of rock and sand it seemed to be the fittest place for a cemeterythis end of the crumbling earththis beginning of the eternal sea there dont think that idea my own or that i thought of it then noi read it all afterwards and thats why im telling you this  she could not help smiling at his now attentive face and went on some days afterwards i got hold of a newspaper four or six months old and there was a description of all that i thought i had seen and feltonly far more beautiful and touching as you shall see for i cut it out of the paper and have kept it it seemed to me that it must be some personal experienceas if the writer had followed some dear friend therealthough it was with the unostentation and indefiniteness of true and delicate feeling it impressed me so much that i went back there twice or thrice and always seemed to move to the rhythm of that beautiful funeral marchand i am afraid being a woman that i wandered around among the graves as though i could find out who it was that had been sung so sweetly and if it were man or woman ive got it here she said taking a dainty ivory portemonnaie from her pocket and picking out with two slim fingertips a folded slip of newspaper and i thought that maybe you might recognize the style of the writer and perhaps know something of his history for i believe he has one there that is only a part of the article of course but it is the part that interested me just read from there she pointed leaning partly over his shoulder so that her soft breath stirred his hair to the end it isnt long  in the film that seemed to come across his eyes suddenly the print appeared blurred and indistinct but he knew that she had put into his hand something he had written after the death of his wife something spontaneous and impulsive when her loss still filled his days and nights and almost unconsciously swayed his pen he remembered that his eyes had been as dim when he wrote itand nowhanded to him by this smiling welltodo woman he was as shocked at first as if he had suddenly found her reading his private letters this was followed by a sudden sense of shame that he had ever thus publicly bared his feelings and then by the illogical but irresistible conviction that it was false and stupid the few phrases she had pointed out appeared as cheap and hollow rhetoric amid the surroundings of their social teteatete over the luncheontable there was small danger that this heady wine of womans praise would make him betray himself there was no sign of gratified authorship in his voice as he quietly laid down the paper and said dryly i am afraid i cant help you you know it may be purely fanciful  i dont think so said mrs ashwood thoughtfully at the same time it doesnt strike me as a very abiding grief for that very reason its too sympathetic it strikes me that it might be the first grief of some one too young to be inured to sorrow or experienced enough to accept it as the common lot but like all youthful impressions it is very sincere and true while it lasts i dont know whether one gets anything more real when one gets older  with an insincerity he could not account for he now felt inclined to defend his previous sentiment although all the while conscious of a certain charm in his companions graceful skepticism he had in his truthfulness and independence hitherto always been quite free from that feeble admiration of cynicism which attacks the intellectually weak and immature and his present predilection may have been due more to her charming personality she was not at all like his sisters she had none of clementinas cold abstraction and none of euphemias sharp and demonstrative effusiveness and in his secret consciousness of her flattering foreknowledge of him with her assurance that before they had ever met he had unwittingly influenced her he began to feel more at his ease his fair companion also in the equally secret knowledge she had acquired of his history felt as secure as if she had been formally introduced nobody could find fault with her for showing civility to the ostensible son of her host it was not necessary that she should be aware of their family differences there was a charm too in their enforced isolation in what was the exceptional solitude of the little hotel that day and the seclusion of their table by the window of the diningroom which gave a charming domesticity to their repast from time to time they glanced down the lonely canyon losing itself in the afternoon shadow nevertheless mrs ashwoods preoccupation with nature did not preclude a human curiosity to hear something more of john miltons quarrel with his father there was certainly nothing of the prodigal son about him there was no precocious evil knowledge in his frank eyes no record of excesses in his healthy fresh complexion no unwholesome or disturbed tastes in what she had seen of his rural preferences and understanding of natural beauty to have attempted any direct questioning that would have revealed his name and identity would have obliged her to speak of herself as his fathers guest she began indirectly he had said he had been a reporter and he was still a chronicler of this strange life he had of course heard of many cases of family feuds and estrangements her brother had told her of some dreadful vendettas he had known in the southwest and how whole families had been divided since she had been here she had heard of odd cases of brothers meeting accidentally after long and unaccounted separations of husbands suddenly confronted with wives they had deserted of fathers encountering discarded sons  john miltons face betrayed no uneasy consciousness if anything it was beginning to glow with a boyish admiration of the grace and intelligence of the fair speaker that was perhaps heightened by an assumption of half coquettish discomfiture  you are laughing at me she said finally but inhuman and selfish as these stories may seem and sometimes are i believe that these curious estrangements and separations often come from some fatal weakness of temperament that might be strengthened or some trivial misunderstanding that could be explained it is separation that makes them seem irrevocable only because they are inexplicable and a vague memory always seems more terrible than a definite one facts may be forgiven and forgotten but mysteries haunt one always i believe there are weak sensitive people who dread to put their wrongs into shape those are the kind who sulk and when you add separation to sulking reconciliation becomes impossible i knew a very singular case of that kind once if you like ill tell it to you may be you will be able some day to weave it into one of your writings and its quite true  it is hardly necessary to say that john milton had not been touched by any personal significance in his companions speech whatever she may have intended and it is equally true that whether she had presently forgotten her purpose or had become suddenly interested in her own conversation her face grew more animated her manner more confidential and something of the youthful enthusiasm she had shown in the mountain seemed to come back to her  i might say it happened anywhere and call the people m or n but it really did occur in my own family and although i was much younger at the time it impressed me very strongly my cousin who had been my playmate was an orphan and had been intrusted to the care of my father who was his guardian he was always a clever boy but singularly sensitive and quick to take offense perhaps it was because the little property his father had left made him partly dependent on my father and that i was rich but he seemed to feel the disparity in our positions i was too young to understand it i think it existed only in his imagination for i believe we were treated alike but i remember that he was full of vague threats of running away and going to sea and that it was part of his weak temperament to terrify me with his extravagant confidences i was always frightened when after one of those scenes he would pack his valise or perhaps only tie up a few things in a handkerchief as in the advertisement pictures of the runaway slaves and declare that we would never lay eyes upon him again at first i never saw the ridiculousness of all thisfor i ought to have told you that he was a rather delicate and timid boy and quite unfitted for a rough life or any exposurebut others did and one day i laughed at him and told him he was afraid i shall never forget the expression of his face and never forgive myself for it he went awaybut he returned the next day he threatened once to commit suicide left his clothes on the bank of the river and came home in another suit of clothes he had taken with him when i was sent abroad to school i lost sight of him when i returned he was at college apparently unchanged when he came home for vacation far from having been subdued by contact with strangers it seemed that his unhappy sensitiveness had been only intensified by the ridicule of his fellows he had even acquired a most ridiculous theory about the degrading effects of civilization and wanted to go back to a state of barbarism he said the wilderness was the only true home of man my father instead of bearing with what i believe was his infirmity dryly offered him the means to try his experiment he started for some place in texas saying we would never hear from him again a month after he wrote for more money my father replied rather impatiently i supposei never knew exactly what he wrote that was some years ago he had told the truth at last for we never heard from him again  it is to be feared that john milton was following the animated lips and eyes of the fair speaker rather than her story perhaps that was the reason why he said may he not have been a disappointed man  i dont understand she said simply  perhaps said john milton with a boyish blush you may have unconsciously raised hopes in his heartand  i should hardly attempt to interest a chronicler of adventure like you in such a very commonplace everyday style of romance she said with a little impatience even if my vanity compelled me to make such confidences to a stranger noit was nothing quite as vulgar as that and she added quickly with a playfully amused smile as she saw the young fellows evident distress i should have probably heard from him again those stories always end in that way  and you thinksaid john milton  i think said mrs ashwood slowly that he actually did commit suicideor effaced himself in some way just as firmly as i believe he might have been saved by judicious treatment otherwise we should have heard from him youll say thats only a womans reasoningbut i think our perceptions are often instinctive and i knew his character  still following the play of her delicate features into a romance of his own weaving the imaginative young reporter who had seen so much from the heights of russian hill said earnestly then i have your permission to use this material at any future time  yes said the lady smilingly  and you will not mind if i should take some liberties with the text  i must of course leave something to your artistic taste but you will let me see it  there were voices outside now breaking the silence of the veranda they had been so preoccupied as not to notice the arrival of a horseman steps came along the passage the landlord returned mrs ashwood turned quickly towards him  mr grant of your party maam to fetch you  she saw an unmistakable change in her young friends mobile face i will be ready in a moment she said to the landlord then turning to john milton the archhypocrite said sweetly my brother must have known instinctively that i was in good hands as he didnt come but i am sorry for i should have so liked to introduce him to youalthough by the way with a bright smile i dont think you have yet told me your name i know i couldnt have forgotten it  harcourt said john milton with a halfembarrassed laugh  but you must come and see me mrmr harcourt she said producing a card from a case already in her fingers at my hotel and let my brother thank you there for your kindness and gallantry to a stranger i shall be here a few weeks longer before we go south to look for a place where my brother can winter do come and see me although i cannot introduce you to anything as real and beautiful as what you have shown me today goodby mr harcourt i wont trouble you to come down and bore yourself with my escorts questions and congratulations  she bent her head and allowed her soft eyes to rest upon his with a graciousness that was beyond her speech pulled her veil over her eyes again with a pretty suggestion that she had no further use for them and taking her ridingskirt lightly in her hand seemed to glide from the room  on her way to san mateo where it appeared the disorganized party had prolonged their visit to accept an invitation to dine with a local magnate she was pleasantly conversational with the slightly abstracted grant she was so sorry to have given them all this trouble and anxiety of course she ought to have waited at the fork of the road but she had never doubted but she could rejoin them presently on the main road she was glad that miss euphemias runaway horse had been stopped without accident it would have been dreadful if anything had happened to her mr harcourt seemed so wrapped up in his girls it was a pity they never had a sonah indeed then there was a son soand father and son had quarreled that was so sad and for some trifling cause no doubt  i believe he married the housemaid said grant grimly be carefulallow me  its no use said mrs ashwood flushing with pink impatience as she recovered her seat which a sudden bolt of her mustang had imperiled i really cant make out the tricks of this beast thank you she added with a sweet smile but i think i can manage him now i cant see why he stopped ill be more careful you were saying the son was marriedsurely not that boy  boy echoed grant then you know  i mean of course he must be a boythey all grew up hereand it was only five or six years ago that their parents emigrated she retorted a little impatiently and what about this creature  your horse  you know i mean the woman he married of course she was older than heand caught him  i think there was a year or two difference said grant quietly  yes but your gallantry keeps you from telling the truth which is that the women in cases of this kind are much older and more experienced  are they well perhaps she is now she is dead  mrs ashwood walked her horse poor thing she said then a sudden idea took possession of her and brought a film to her eyes how long ago she asked in a low voice  about six or seven months i think i believe there was a baby who died too  she continued to walk her horse slowly stroking its curved neck i think its perfectly shameful she said suddenly  not so bad as that mrs ashwood surely the girl may have loved himand he  you know perfectly what i mean mr grant i speak of the conduct of the mother and father and those two sisters  grant slightly elevated his eyebrows but you forget mrs ashwood it was young harcourt and his wifes own act they preferred to take their own path and keep it  i think said mrs ashwood authoritatively that the idea of leaving those two unfortunate children to suffer and struggle on aloneout thereon the sand hills of san franciscowas simply disgraceful  later that evening she was unreasonably annoyed to find that her brother mr john shipley had taken advantage of the absence of grant to pay marked attention to clementina and had even prevailed upon that imperious goddess to accompany him after dinner on a moonlight stroll upon the veranda and terraces of los pajaros nevertheless she seemed to recover her spirits enough to talk volubly of the beautiful scenery she had discovered in her late perilous abandonment in the wilds of the coast range to aver her intention to visit it again to speak of it in a severely practical way as offering a far better site for the cottages of the young married couples just beginning life than the outskirts of towns or the bleak sand hills of san francisco and thence by graceful degrees into a dissertation upon popular fallacies in regard to hasty marriages and the mistaken idea of some parents in not accepting the inevitable and making the best of it she still found time to enter into an appreciative and exhaustive criticism upon the literature and journalistic enterprise of the pacific coast with the proprietor of the pioneer and to cause that gentleman to declare that whatever people might say about rich and fashionable eastern women that mrs ashwoods head was about as level as it was pretty  the next morning found her more thoughtful and subdued and when her brother came upon her sitting on the veranda while the party were preparing to return she was reading a newspaper slip that she had taken from her portemonnaie with a face that was partly shadowed  what have you struck there conny said her brother gayly it looks too serious for a recipe  something i should like you to read some time jack she said lifting her lashes with a slight timidity if you would take the trouble i really wonder how it would impress you  pass it over said jack shipley goodhumoredly with his cigar between his lips ill take it now  she handed him the slip and turned partly away he took it glanced at it sideways turned it over and suddenly his look grew concentrated and he took the cigar from his lips  well she said playfully turning to him again what do you think of it  think of it he said with a rising color i think its infamous who did it  she stared at him then glanced quickly at the slip what are you reading she said  this of course he said impatiently what you gave me but he was pointing to the other side of the newspaper slip  she took it from him impatiently and read for the first time the printing on the reverse side of the article she had treasured so long it was the concluding paragraph of an apparently larger editorial one thing is certain that a man in daniel harcourts position cannot afford to pass over in silence accusations like the above that affect not only his private character but the integrity of his title to the land that was the foundation of his fortune when trickery sharp practice and even criminality in the past are more than hinted at they cannot be met by mere pompous silence or allusions to private position social prestige or distinguished friends in the present  mrs ashwood turned the slip over with scornful impatience a pretty uplifting of her eyebrows and a slight curl of her lip i suppose none of those peoples beginnings can bear looking intoand they certainly should be the last ones to find fault with anybody but good gracious jack what has this to do with you  with me said shipley angrily why i proposed to clementina last night     chaper ix   the wayfarers on the tasajara turnpike whom mr daniel harcourt passed with his fast trotting mare and sulky saw that their great fellowtownsman was more than usually preoccupied and curt in his acknowledgment of their salutations nevertheless as he drew near the creek he partly checked his horse and when he reached a slight acclivity of the interminable plainwhich had really been the bank of the creek in bygone dayshe pulled up alighted tied his horse to a rail fence and clambering over the inclosure made his way along the ridge it was covered with nettles thistles and a few wiry dwarf larches of native growth dust from the adjacent highway had invaded it with a few scattered and torn handbills waste paper rags empty provision cans and other suburban debris yet it was the site of lige curtiss cabin long since erased and forgotten the bed of the old creek had receded the last tules had been cleared away the channel and embarcadero were half a mile from the bank and log whereon the pioneer of tasajara had idly sunned himself  mr harcourt walked on occasionally turning over the scattered objects with his foot and stopping at times to examine the ground more closely it had not apparently been disturbed since he himself six years ago had razed the wretched shanty and carried off its timbers to aid in the erection of a larger cabin further inland he raised his eyes to the prospect before himto the town with its steamboats lying at the wharves to the grain elevator the warehouses the railroad station with its puffing engines the flagstaff of harcourt house and the clustering roofs of the town and beyond the painted dome of his last creation the free library this was all his work his planning his foresight whatever they might say of the wandering drunkard from whose tremulous fingers he had snatched the opportunity they could not take that from him however they might follow him with envy and reviling any more than they could wrest from him the five years of peaceful possession it was with something of the prosperous consciousness with which he had mounted the platform on the opening of the free library that he now climbed into his buggy and drove away  nevertheless he stopped at his land office as he drove into town and gave a few orders i want a strong picket fence put around the fiftyvara lot in block fiftyseven and the ground cleared up at once let me know when the men get to work and ill overlook them  reentering his own house in the square where mrs harcourt and clementinawho often accompanied him in those business visitswere waiting for him with luncheon he smiled somewhat superciliously as the servant informed him that professor grant had just arrived really that man was trying to make the most of his time with clementina perhaps the rival attractions of that boston swell shipley had something to do with it he must positively talk to clementina about this in point of fact he himself was a little disappointed in grant who since his offer to take the task of hunting down his calumniators had really done nothing he turned into his study but was slightly astonished to find that grant instead of paying court to clementina in the adjoining drawingroom was sitting rather thoughtfully in his own armchair  he rose as harcourt entered i didnt let them announce me to the ladies he said as i have some important business with you first and we may find it necessary that i should take the next train back to town you remember that a few weeks ago i offered to look into the matter of those slanders against you i apprehended it would be a trifling matter of envy or jealousy on the part of your old associates or neighbors which could be put straight with a little good feeling but i must be frank with you harcourt and say at the beginning that it turns out to be an infernally ugly business call it conspiracy if you like or organized hostility im afraid it will require a lawyer rather than an arbitrator to manage it and the sooner the better for the most unpleasant thing about it is that i cant find out exactly how bad it is  unfortunately the weaker instinct of harcourts nature was first roused the vulgar rage which confounds the bearer of ill news with the news itself filled his breast and this is all that your confounded intermeddling came to he said brutally  no said grant quietly with a preoccupied ignoring of the insult that was more hopeless for harcourt i found out that it is claimed that this lige curtis was not drowned nor lost that night but that he escaped and for three years has convinced another man that you are wrongfully in possession of this land that these two naturally hold you in their power and that they are only waiting for you to be forced into legal proceedings for slander to prove all their charges until then for some reason best known to themselves curtis remains in the background  does he deny the deed under which i hold the property said harcourt savagely  he says it was only a security for a trifling loan and not an actual transfer  and dont those fools know that his security could be forfeited  yes but not in the way it is recorded in the county clerks office they say that the record shows that there was an interpolation in the paper he left with youwhich was a forgery briefly harcourt you are accused of that moreit is intimated that when he fell into the creek that night and escaped on a raft that was floating past that he had been first stunned by a blow from some one interested in getting rid of him  he paused and glanced out of the window  is that all asked harcourt in a perfectly quiet steady voice  all replied grant struck with the change in his companions manner and turning his eyes upon him quickly  the change indeed was marked and significant whether from relief at knowing the worst or whether he was experiencing the same reaction from the utter falsity of this last accusation that he had felt when grant had unintentionally wronged him in his previous recollection certain it is that some unknown reserve of strength in his own nature of which he knew nothing before suddenly came to his aid in this extremity it invested him with an uncouth dignity that for the first time excited grants respect  i beg your pardon grant for the hasty way i spoke to you a moment ago for i thank you and appreciate thoroughly and sincerely what you have done you are right it is a matter for fighting and not fussing over but i must have a head to hit whose is it  the man who holds himself legally responsible is fletcherthe proprietor of the clarion and a man of property  the clarion that is the paper which began the attack said harcourt  yes and it is only fair to tell you here that your son threw up his place on it in consequence of its attack upon you  there was perhaps the slightest possible shrinking in harcourts eyelidsthe one congenital likeness to his discarded sonbut his otherwise calm demeanor did not change grant went on more cheerfully ive told you all i know when i spoke of an unknown worst i did not refer to any further accusation but to whatever evidence they might have fabricated or suborned to prove any one of them it is only the strength and fairness of the hands they hold that is uncertain against that you have your certain uncontested possession the peculiar character and antecedents of this lige curtis which would make his evidence untrustworthy and even make it difficult for them to establish his identity i am told that his failure to contest your appropriation of his property is explained by the fact of his being absent from the country most of the time but again this would not account for their silence until within the last six months unless they have been waiting for further evidence to establish it but even then they must have known that the time of recovery had passed you are a practical man harcourt i neednt tell you therefore what your lawyer will probably tell you that practically so far as your rights are concerned you remain as before these calumnies that a cause of action unprosecuted or in abeyance is practically no cause and that it is not for you to anticipate one but  he paused and looked steadily at harcourt harcourt met his look with a dull oxlike stolidity i shall begin the suit at once he said  and i said grant holding out his hand will stand by you but tell me now what you knew of this man curtishis character and disposition it may be some clue as to what are his methods and his intentions  harcourt briefly sketched lige curtis as he knew him and understood him it was another indication of his reserved power that the description was so singularly clear practical unprejudiced and impartial that it impressed grant with its truthfulness  i cant make him out he said you have drawn a weak but neither a dishonest nor malignant man there must have been somebody behind him can you think of any personal enemy  i have been subjected to the usual jealousy and envy of my old neighbors i suppose but nothing more i have harmed no one knowingly  grant was silent it had flashed across him that rice might have harbored revenge for his fatherinlaws interference in his brief matrimonial experience he had also suddenly recalled his conversation with billings on the day that he first arrived at tasajara it would not be strange if this man had some intimation of the secret he would try to find him that evening he rose  you will stay to dinner my wife and clementina will expect you  not tonight i am dining at the hotel said grant smilingly but i will come in later in the evening if i may he paused hesitatingly for a moment have your wife and daughter ever expressed any opinion on this matter  no said harcourt mrs harcourt knows nothing of anything that does not happen in the house euphemia knows only the things that happen out of it where she is visitingand i suppose that young men prefer to talk to her about other things than the slanders of her father and clementinawell you know how calm and superior to these things she is  for that very reason i thought that perhaps she might be able to see them more clearlybut no matter i dare say you are quite right in not discussing them at home this was the fact although grant had not forgotten that harcourt had put forward his daughters as a reason for stopping the scandal some weeks beforea reason which however seemed never to have been borne out by any apparent sensitiveness of the girls themselves  when grant had left harcourt remained for some moments steadfastly gazing from the window over the tasajara plain he had not lost his look of concentrated power nor his determination to fight a struggle between himself and the phantoms of the past had become now a necessary stimulus for its own sakefor the sake of his mental and physical equipoise he saw before him the pale agitated irresolute features of lige curtisnot the man he had injured but the man who had injured him whose spirit was aimlessly and wantonlyfor he had never attempted to get back his possessions in his lifetime nor ever tried to communicate with the possessorstriking at him in the shadow and it was that man that pale writhing frightened wretch whom he had once mercifully helped yes whose life he had even saved that night from exposure and delirium tremens when he had given him the whiskey and this life he had saved only to have it set in motion a conspiracy to ruin him who knows that lige had not purposely conceived what they had believed to be an attempt at suicide only to cast suspicion of murder on him from which it will be perceived that harcourts powers of moral reasoning had not improved in five years and that even the impartiality he had just shown in his description of lige to grant had been swallowed up in this new sense of injury the founder of tasajara whose cool business logic unfailing foresight and practical deductions were never at fault was once more childishly adrift in his moral ethics  and there was clementina of whose judgment grant had spoken so persistentlycould she assist him it was true as he had said he had never talked to her of his affairs in his sometimes uneasy consciousness of her superiority he had shrunk from even revealing his anxieties much less his actual secret and from anything that might prejudice the lofty paternal attitude he had taken towards his daughters from the beginning of his good fortune he was never quite sure if her acceptance of it was real he was never entirely free from a certain jealousy that always mingled with his pride in her superior rectitude and yet his feeling was distinct from the goodnatured contempt he had for his wifes loyalty the anger and suspicion that his sons opposition had provoked and the halfaffectionate toleration he had felt for euphemias waywardness however he would sound clementina without betraying himself  he was anticipated by a slight step in the passage and the pushing open of his study door the tall graceful figure of the girl herself stood in the opening  they tell me mr grant has been here does he stay to dinner  no he has an engagement at the hotel but he will probably drop in later come in clemmy i want to talk to you shut the door and sit down  she slipped in quietly shut the door took a seat on the sofa softly smoothed down her gown and turned her graceful head and serenely composed face towards him sitting thus she looked like some finely finished painting that decorated rather than belonged to the roomnot only distinctly alien to the flesh and blood relative before her but to the house and even the local monotonous landscape beyond the window with the shining new shingles and chimneys that cut the new blue sky these singular perfections seemed to increase in harcourts mind the exasperating sense of injury inflicted upon him by liges exposures with a daughter so incomparably gifteda matchless creation that was enough in herself to ennoble that fortune which his own skill and genius had lifted from the muddy tules of tasajara where this lige had left itthat she should be subjected to this annoyance seemed an infamy that providence could not allow what was his mere venial transgression to this exaggerated retribution  clemmy girl im going to ask you a question listen pet he had begun with a reminiscent tenderness of the epoch of her childhood but meeting the unresponding maturity of her clear eyes he abandoned it you know clementina i have never interfered in your affairs nor tried to influence your friendships for anybody whatever people may have to say of me they cant say that ive always trusted you as i would myself to choose your own associates i have never regretted it and i dont regret it now but id like to knowi have reasons today for askinghow matters stand between you and grant  the parian head of minerva on the bookcase above her did not offer the spectator a face less free from maidenly confusion than clementinas at that moment her father had certainly expected none but he was not prepared for the perfect coolness of her reply  do you mean have i accepted him  nowellyes  no then is that what he wished to see you about it was understood that he was not to allude again to the subject to any one  he has not to me it was only my own idea he had something very different to tell me you may not know clementina he begun cautiously that i have been lately the subject of some anonymous slanders and grant has taken the trouble to track them down for me it is a calumny that goes back as far as sidon and i may want your level head and good memory to help me to refute it he then repeated calmly and clearly with no trace of the fury that had raged within him a moment before the substance of grants revelation  the young girl listened without apparent emotion when he had finished she said quickly and what do you want me to recollect  the hardest part of harcourts task was coming well dont you remember that i told you the day the surveyors went awaythati had bought this land of lige curtis some time before  yes i remember your saying so but  but what  i thought you only meant that to satisfy mother  daniel harcourt felt the blood settling round his heart but he was constrained by an irresistible impulse to know the worst well what did you think it really was  i only thought that lige curtis had simply let you have it thats all  harcourt breathed again but what for why should he  wellon my account  on your account what in heavens name had you to do with it  he loved me there was not the slightest trace of vanity selfconsciousness or coquetry in her quiet fateful face and for this very reason harcourt knew that she was speaking the truth  loved youyou clementinamy daughter did he ever tell you so  not in words he used to walk up and down on the road when i was at the back window or in the garden and often hung about the bank of the creek for hours like some animal i dont think the others saw him and when they did they thought it was parmlee for euphemia even euphemia thought so too and that was why she was so conceited and hard to parmlee towards the end she thought it was parmlee that night when grant and rice came but it was lige curtis who had been watching the window lights in the rain and who must have gone off at last to speak to you in the store i always let phemie believe that it was parmleeit seemed to please her  there was not the least tone of mischief or superiority or even of patronage in her manner it was as quiet and cruel as the fate that might have led lige to his destruction even her father felt a slight thrill of awe as she paused then he never really spoke to you he asked hurriedly  only once i was gathering swamp lilies all alone a mile below the bend of the creek and he came upon me suddenly perhaps it was that i didnt jump or starti didnt see anything to jump or start atthat he said youre not frightened at me miss harcourt like the other girls you dont think im drunk or half madas they do i dont remember exactly what i said but it meant that whether he was drunk or half mad or sober i didnt see any reason to be afraid of him and then he told me that if i was fond of swamp lilies i might have all i wanted at his place and for the matter of that the place too as he was going away for he couldnt stand the loneliness any longer he said that he had nothing in common with the place and the peopleno more than i hadand that was what he had always fancied in me i told him that if he felt in that way about his place he ought to leave it or sell it to some one who cared for it and go away that must have been in his mind when he offered it to youat least thats what i thought when you told us you had bought it i didnt know but what he might have told you but you didnt care to say it before mother  mr harcourt sat gazing at her with breathless amazement and youthink thatlige curtislovliked you  yes i think he didand that he does now  now what do you mean the man is dead said harcourt starting  thats just what i dont believe  impossible think of what you are saying  i never could quite understand or feel that he was dead when everybody said so and now that ive heard this story i know that he is living  but why did he not make himself known in time to claim the property  because he did not care for it  what did he care for then  me i suppose  but this calumny is not like a man who loves you  it is like a jealous one  with an effort harcourt threw off his bewildered incredulity and grasped the situation he would have to contend with his enemy in the flesh and blood but that flesh and blood would be very weak in the hands of the impassive girl beside him his face lightened  the same idea might have been in clementinas mind when she spoke again although her face had remained unchanged i do not see why you should bother yourself further about it she said it is only a matter between myself and him you can leave it to me  but if you are mistaken and he should not be living  i am not mistaken i am even certain now that i have seen him  seen him  yes said the girl with the first trace of animation in her face it was four or five months ago when we were visiting the briones at monterey we had ridden out to the old mission by moonlight there were some mexicans lounging around the posada and one of them attracted my attention by the way he seemed to watch me without revealing any more of his face than i could see between his serape and the black silk handkerchief that was tied around his head under his sombrero but i knew he was an americanand his eyes were familiar i believe it was he  why did you not speak of it before  the look of animation died out of the girls face why should i she said listlessly i did not know of these reports then he was nothing more to us you wouldnt have cared to see him again she rose smoothed out her skirt and stood looking at her father there is one thing of course that youll do at once  her voice had changed so oddly that he said quickly whats that  call grant off the scent hell only frighten or exasperate your game and thats what you dont want  her voice was as imperious as it had been previously listless and it was the first time he had ever known her to use slang  it seemed as startling as if it had fallen from the marble lips above him  but ive promised him that we should go together to my lawyer tomorrow and begin a suit against the proprietors of the clarion  do nothing of the kind get rid of grants assistance in this matter and see the clarion proprietor yourself what sort of a man is he can you invite him to your house  i have never seen him i believe he lives at san jose he is a wealthy man and a large land owner there you understand that after the first article appeared in his paper and i knew that he had employed your brotheralthough grant says that he had nothing to do with it and left fletcher on account of iti could have no intercourse with him even if i invited him he would not come  he must come leave it to me she stopped and resumed her former impassive manner i had something to say to you too father mr shipley proposed to me the day we went to san mateo  her fathers eyes lit with an eager sparkle well he said quickly  i reminded him that i had known him only a few weeks and that i wanted time to consider  consider why clemmy hes one of the oldest boston families rich from his father and grandfatherrich when i was a shopkeeper and your mother  i thought you liked grant she said quietly  yes but if you have no choice nor feeling in the matter why shipley is far the better man and if any of the scandal should come to his ears  so much the better that the hesitation should come from me but if you think it better i can sit down here and write to him at once declining the offer she moved towards the desk  no no i did not mean that said harcourt quickly i only thought that if he did hear anything it might be said that he had backed out  his sister knows of his offer and though she dont like it nor me she will not deny the fact by the way you remember when she was lost that day on the road to san mateo  yes  well she was with your son john milton all the time and they lunched together at crystal spring it came out quite accidentally through the hotelkeeper  harcourts brow darkened did she know him before  i cant say but she does now  harcourts face was heavy with distrust taking shipleys offer and these scandals into consideration i dont like the look of this clementina  i do said the girl simply  harcourt gazed at her keenly and with the shadow of distrust still upon him it seemed to be quite impossible even with what he knew of her calmly cold nature that she should be equally uninfluenced by grant or shipley had she some steadfast lofty ideal or perhaps some already absorbing passion of which he knew nothing she was not a girl to betray itthey would only know it when it was too late could it be possible that there was still something between her and lige that he knew nothing of the thought struck a chill to his breast she was walking towards the door when he recalled himself with an effort  if you think it advisable to see fletcher you might run down to san jose for a day or two with your mother and call on the ramirez they may know him or somebody who does of course if you meet him and casually invite him it would be different  its a good idea she said quickly ill do it and speak to mother now  he was struck by the change in her face and voice they had both nervously lightened as oddly and distinctly as they had before seemed to grow suddenly harsh and aggressive she passed out of the room with girlish brusqueness leaving him alone with a new and vague fear in his consciousness   a few hours later clementina was standing before the window of the drawingroom that overlooked the outskirts of the town the moonlight was flooding the vast bluish tasajara levels with a faint lustre as if the waters of the creek had once more returned to them in the shadow of the curtain beside her grant was facing her with anxious eyes  then i must take this as your final answer clementina  you must and had i known of these calumnies before had you been frank with me even the day we went to san mateo my answer would have been as final then and you might have been spared any further suspense i am not blaming you mr grant i am willing to believe that you thought it best to conceal this from meeven at that time when you had just pledged yourself to find out its truth or falsehoodyet my answer would have been the same so long as this stain rests on my fathers name i shall never allow that name to be coupled with yours in marriage or engagement nor will my pride or yours allow us to carry on a simple friendship after this i thank you for your offer of assistance but i cannot even accept that which might to others seem to allow some contingent claim i would rather believe that when you proposed this inquiry and my father permitted it you both knew that it put an end to any other relations between us  but clementina you are wrong believe me say that i have been foolish indiscreet madstill the few who knew that i made these inquiries on your fathers behalf know nothing of my hopes of you  but i do and that is enough for me  even in the hopeless preoccupation of his passion he suddenly looked at her with something of his old critical scrutiny but she stood there calm concentrated selfpossessed and upright yes it was possible that the pride of this southwestern shopkeepers daughter was greater than his own  then you banish me clementina  it is we whom you have banished  goodnight  goodby  he bent for an instant over her cold hand and then passed out into the hall she remained listening until the front door closed behind him then she ran swiftly through the hall and up the staircase with an alacrity that seemed impossible to the stately goddess of a moment before when she had reached her bedroom and closed the door so exuberant still and so uncontrollable was her levity and action that without going round the bed which stood before her in the centre of the room she placed her two hands upon it and lightly vaulted sideways across it to reach the window there she watched the figure of grant crossing the moonlit square then turning back into the halflit room she ran to the small dressingglass placed at an angle on a toilet table against the wall with her palms grasping her knees she stooped down suddenly and contemplated the mirror it showed what no one but clementina had ever seenand she herself only at rare intervalsthe laughing eyes and soul of a selfsatisfied materialminded ordinary countrygirl     chaper x   but mr lawrence grants character in certain circumstances would seem to have as startling and inexplicable contradictions as clementina harcourts and three days later he halted his horse at the entrance of los gatos rancho the home of the catsso called from the catamounts which infested the localitywhich had for over a century lazily basked before one of the hottest canyons in the coast range had lately been stirred into some activity by the american don diego fletcher who had bought it put up a sawmill and deforested the canyon still there remained enough suggestion of a feline haunt about it to make grant feel as if he had tracked hither some stealthy enemy in spite of the peaceful intimation conveyed by the sign on a rough boarded shed at the wayside that the los gatos land and lumber company held their office there  a cigarettesmoking peon lounged before the door yes don diego was there but as he had arrived from santa clara only last night and was going to colonel ramirez that afternoon he was engaged unless the business was importantbut the cool determined manner of grant even more than his words signified that it was important and the servant led the way to don diegos presence  there certainly was nothing in the appearance of this sylvan proprietor and newspaper capitalist to justify grants suspicion of a surreptitious foe a handsome man scarcely older than himself in spite of a wavy mass of perfectly white hair which contrasted singularly with his brown mustache and dark sunburned face so disguising was the effect of these contradictions that he not only looked unlike anybody else but even his nationality seemed to be a matter of doubt only his eyes light blue and intelligent which had a singular expression of gentleness and worry appeared individual to the man his manner was cultivated and easy he motioned his visitor courteously to a chair  i was referred to you said grant almost abruptly as the person responsible for a series of slanderous attacks against mr daniel harcourt in the clarion of which paper i believe you are the proprietor i was told that you declined to give the authority for your action unless you were forced to by legal proceedings  fletchers sensitive blue eyes rested upon grants with an expression of constrained pain and pity i heard of your inquiries mr grant you were making them on behalf of this mr harcourt or harkutthe made the distinction with intentional deliberationwith a view i believe to some arbitration the case was stated to you fairly i think i believe i have nothing to add to it  that was your answer to the ambassador of mr harcourt said grant coldly and as such i delivered it to him but i am here today to speak on my own account  what could be seen of mr fletchers lips appeared to curl in an odd smile indeed i thought it wasor would beall in the family  grants face grew more stern and his gray eyes glittered youll find my status in this matter so far independent that i dont propose like mr harcourt either to begin a suit or to rest quietly under the calumny briefly mr fletcher as you or your informant knows i was the surveyor who revealed to mr harcourt the value of the land to which he claimed a title from your man this elijah or lige curtis as you call himhe could not resist this imitation of his adversarys supercilious affectation of precise nomenclatureand it was upon my representation of its value as an investment that he began the improvements which have made him wealthy if this title was fraudulently obtained all the facts pertaining to it are sufficiently related to connect me with the conspiracy  are you not a little hasty in your presumption mr grant said fletcher with unfeigned surprise  that is for me to judge mr fletcher returned grant haughtily  but the name of professor grant is known to all california as beyond the breath of calumny or suspicion  it is because of that fact that i propose to keep it so  and may i ask in what way you wish me to assist you in so doing  by promptly and publicly retracting in the clarion every word of this slander against harcourt  fletcher looked steadfastly at the speaker and if i decline  i think you have been long enough in california mr fletcher to know the alternative expected of a gentleman said grant coldly  mr fletcher kept his gentle blue eyesin which surprise still overbalanced their expression of pained concernon grants face  but is not this more in the style of colonel starbottle than professor grant he asked with a faint smile  grant rose instantly with a white face you will have a better opportunity of judging he said when colonel starbottle has the honor of waiting upon you from me meantime i thank you for reminding me of the indiscretion into which my folly in still believing that this thing could be settled amicably has led me  he bowed coldly and withdrew nevertheless as he mounted his horse and rode away he felt his cheeks burning yet he had acted upon calm consideration he knew that to the ordinary californian experience there was nothing quixotic nor exaggerated in the attitude he had taken men had quarreled and fought on less grounds he had even half convinced himself that he had been insulted and that his own professional reputation demanded the withdrawal of the attack on harcourt on purely business grounds but he was not satisfied of the personal responsibility of fletcher nor of his gratuitous malignity nor did the man look like a tool in the hands of some unscrupulous and hidden enemy however he had played his card if he succeeded only in provoking a duel with fletcher he at least would divert the public attention from harcourt to himself he knew that his superior position would throw the lesser victim in the background he would make the sacrifice that was his duty as a gentleman even if she would not care to accept it as an earnest of his unselfish love  he had reached the point where the mountain track entered the santa clara turnpike when his attention was attracted by a handsome but oldfashioned carriage drawn by four white mules which passed down the road before him and turned suddenly off into a private road but it was not this picturesque gala equipage of some local spanish grandee that brought a thrill to his nerves and a flash to his eye it was the unmistakable tall elegant figure and handsome profile of clementina reclining in light gauzy wraps against the back seat it was no fanciful resemblance the outcome of his reveriethere never was any one like herit was she herself but what was she doing here  a vaquero cantered from the cross road where the dust of the vehicle still hung grant hailed him ah it was a fine carroza de cuatro mulas that he had just passed si senor truly it was of don jose ramirez who lived just under the hill it was bringing company to the casa  ramirez that was where fletcher was going had clementina known that he was one of fletchers friends might she not be exposed to unpleasantness marked coolness or even insult in that unexpected meeting ought she not to be warned or prepared for it she had banished grant from her presence until this stain was removed from her fathers name but could she blame him for trying to save her from contact with her fathers slanderer no he turned his horse abruptly into the cross road and spurred forward in the direction of the casa  it was quite visible nowa lowwalled quadrangular mass of whitewashed adobe lying like a drift on the green hillside the carriage and four had far preceded him and was already half up the winding road towards the house later he saw them reach the courtyard and disappear within he would be quite in time to speak with her before she retired to change her dress he would simply say that while making a professional visit to los gatos land company office he had become aware of fletchers connection with it and accidentally of his intended visit to ramirez his chance meeting with the carriage on the highway had determined his course  as he rode into the courtyard he observed that it was also approached by another road evidently nearer los gatos and probably the older and shorter communication between the two ranchos the fact was significantly demonstrated a moment later he had given his horse to a servant sent in his card to clementina and had dropped listlessly on one of the benches of the gallery surrounding the patio when a horseman rode briskly into the opposite gateway and dismounted with a familiar air a waiting peon who recognized him informed him that the dona was engaged with a visitor but that they were both returning to the gallery for chocolate in a moment the stranger was the man he had left only an hour beforedon diego fletcher  in an instant the idiotic fatuity of his position struck him fully his only excuse for following clementina had been to warn her of the coming of this man who had just entered and who would now meet her as quickly as himself for a brief moment the idea of quietly slipping out to the corral mounting his horse again and flying from the rancho crossed his mind but the thought that he would be running away from the man he had just challenged and perhaps some new hostility that had sprung up in his heart against him compelled him to remain the eyes of both men met fletchers in halfwondering annoyance grants in illconcealed antagonism what they would have said is not known for at that moment the voices of clementina and mrs ramirez were heard in the passage and they both entered the gallery the two men were standing together it was impossible to see one without the other  and yet grant whose eyes were instantly directed to clementina thought that she had noted neither she remained for an instant standing in the doorway in the same selfpossessed coldly graceful pose he remembered she had taken on the platform at tasajara her eyelids were slightly downcast as if she had been arrested by some sudden thought or some shy maiden sensitiveness in her hesitation mrs ramirez passed impatiently before her  mother of god said that lively lady regarding the two speechless men is it an indiscretion we are making hereor are you dumb you don diego are loud enough when you and don jose are together at least introduce your friend  grant quickly recovered himself i am afraid he said coming forward unless miss harcourt does that i am a mere trespasser in your house senora i saw her pass in your carriage a few moments ago and having a message for her i ventured to follow her here  it is mr grant a friend of my fathers said clementina smiling with equanimity as if just awakening from a momentary abstraction yet apparently unconscious of grants imploring eyes but the other gentleman i have not the pleasure of knowing  ah don diego fletcher a countryman of yours and yet i think he knows you not  clementinas face betrayed no indication of the presence of her fathers foe and yet grant knew that she must have recognized his name as she looked towards fletcher with perfect selfpossession he was too much engaged in watching her to take note of fletchers manifest disturbance or the evident effort with which he at last bowed to her that this unexpected double meeting with the daughter of the man he had wronged and the man who had espoused the quarrel should be confounding to him appeared only natural but he was unprepared to understand the feverish alacrity with which he accepted dona marias invitation to chocolate or the equally animated way in which clementina threw herself into her hostesss spanish levity he knew it was an awkward situation that must be surmounted without a scene he was quite prepared in the presence of clementina to be civil to fletcher but it was odd that in this feverish exchange of courtesies and compliments he grant should feel the greater awkwardness and be the most ill at ease he sat down and took his part in the conversation he let it transpire for clementinas benefit that he had been to los gatos only on business yet there was no opportunity for even a significant glance and he had the added embarrassment of seeing that she exhibited no surprise nor seemed to attach the least importance to his inopportune visit in a miserable indecision he allowed himself to be carried away by the highflown hospitality of his spanish hostess and consented to stay to an early dinner it was part of the infelicity of circumstance that the voluble dona mariaelecting him as the distinguished stranger above the resident fletchermonopolized him and attached him to her side she would do the honors of her house she must show him the ruins of the old mission beside the corral don diego and clementina would join them presently in the garden he cast a despairing glance at the placidly smiling clementina who was apparently equally indifferent to the evident constraint and assumed ease of the man beside her and turned away with mrs ramirez  a silence fell upon the gallery so deep that the receding voices and footsteps of grant and his hostess in the long passage were distinctly heard until they reached the end then fletcher arose with an inarticulate exclamation clementina instantly put her finger to her lips glanced around the gallery extended her hand to him and saying come halfled halfdragged him into the passage to the right she turned and pushed open the door of a small room that seemed a combination of boudoir and oratory lit by a french window opening to the garden and flanked by a large black and white crucifix with a prie dieu beneath it closing the door behind them she turned and faced her companion but it was no longer the face of the woman who had been sitting in the gallery it was the face that had looked back at her from the mirror at tasajara the night that grant had left hereager flushed material with commonplace excitement  lige curtis she said  yes he answered passionately lige curtis whom you thought dead lige curtis whom you once pitied condoled with and despised lige curtis whose lands and property have enriched you lige curtis who would have shared it with you freely at the time but whom your father juggled and defrauded of it lige curtis branded by him as a drunken outcast and suicide lige curtis  hush she clapped her little hand over his mouth with a quick but awkward schoolgirl gesture inconceivable to any who had known her usual languid elegance of motion and held it there he struggled angrily impatiently reproachfully and then with a sudden characteristic weakness that seemed as much of a revelation as her once hoydenish manner kissed it when she let it drop then placing both her hands still girlishly on her slim waist and curtseying grotesquely before him she said lige curtis oh yes lige curtis who swore to do everything for me lige curtis who promised to give up liquor for mewho was to leave tasajara for me lige curtis who was to reform and keep his land as a nestegg for us both in the future and then who sold itand himselfand meto dad for a glass of whiskey lige curtis who disappeared and then let us think he was dead only that he might attack us out of the ambush of his grave  yes but think what i have suffered all these years not for the cursed landyou know i never cared for thatbut for youyou clementinayou rich admired by every one idolized held far above meme the forgotten outcast the wretched suicideand yet the man to whom you had once plighted your troth which of those greedy fortunehunters whom my moneymy lifeblood as you might have thought it wasattracted to you did you care to tell that you had ever slipped out of the little garden gate at sidon to meet that outcast do you wonder that as the years passed and you were happy i did not choose to be so forgotten do you wonder that when you shut the door on the past i managed to open it againif only a little waythat its light might startle you  yet she did not seem startled or disturbed and remained only looking at him critically  you say that you have suffered she replied with a smile you dont look it your hair is white but it is becoming to you and you are a handsomer man lige curtis than you were when i first met you you are finer she went on still regarding him stronger and healthier than you were five years ago you are rich and prosperous you have everything to make you happy buthere she laughed a little held out both her hands taking his and holding his arms apart in a rustic homely fashionbut you are still the same old lige curtis it was like you to go off and hide yourself in that idiotic way it was like you to let the property slide in that stupid unselfish fashion it was like you to get real mad and say all those mean silly things to dad that didnt hurt himin your regular looney style for rich or poor drunk or sober ragged or elegant plain or handsomeyoure always the same lige curtis  in proportion as that material practical rustic selfwhich nobody but lige curtis had ever seencame back to her so in proportion the irresolute wavering weak and emotional vagabond of sidon came out to meet it he looked at her with a vague smile his five years of childish resentment albeit carried on the shoulders of a man mentally and morally her superior melted away he drew her towards him yet at the same moment a quick suspicion returned  well and what are you doing here has this man who has followed you any right any claim upon you  none but what you in your folly have forced upon him you have made him fathers ally i dont know why he came here i only know why i didto find you  you suspected then  i knew hush  the returning voices of grant and of mrs ramirez were heard in the courtyard clementina made a warning yet girlishly mirthful gesture again caught his hand drew him quickly to the french window and slipped through it with him into the garden where they were quickly lost in the shadows of a ceanothus hedge  they have probably met don jose in the orchard and as he and don diego have business together dona clementina has without doubt gone to her room and left them for you are not very entertaining to the ladies todayyou two caballeros you have much politics together ehor you have discussed and disagreed eh i will look for the senorita and let you go don distraido  it is to be feared that grants apologies and attempts to detain her were equally feebleas it seemed to him that this was the only chance he might have of seeing clementina except in company with fletcher as mrs ramirez left he lit a cigarette and listlessly walked up and down the gallery but clementina did not come neither did his hostess return a subdued step in the passage raised his hopesit was only the grizzled major domo to show him his room that he might prepare for dinner  he followed mechanically down the long passage to a second corridor there was a chance that he might meet clementina but he reached his room without encountering any one it was a large vaulted apartment with a single window a deep embrasure in the thick wall that seemed to focus like a telescope some forgotten sequestered part of the leafy garden while washing his hands gazing absently at the green vignette framed by the dark opening his attention was drawn to a movement of the foliage stirred apparently by the rapid passage of two halfhidden figures the quick flash of a feminine skirt seemed to indicate the coy flight of some romping maid of the casa and the pursuit and struggle of her vaquero swain to a despairing lover even the spectacle of innocent pastoral happiness in others is not apt to be soothing and grant was turning impatiently away when he suddenly stopped with a rigid face and quickly approached the window in her struggles with the unseen corydon the clustering leaves seemed to have yielded at the same moment with the coy chloris and partingdisclosed a stolen kiss grants hand lay like ice against the wall for disengaging fletchers arm from her waist and freeing her skirt from the foliage it was the calm passionless clementina herself who stepped out and moved pensively towards the casa     chaper xi   readers of the clarion will have noticed that allusion has been frequently made in these columns to certain rumors concerning the early history of tasajara which were supposed to affect the pioneer record of daniel harcourt it was deemed by the conductors of this journal to be only consistent with the fearless and independent duty undertaken by the clarion that these rumors should be fully chronicled as part of the information required by the readers of a firstclass newspaper unbiased by any consideration of the social position of the parties but simply as a matter of news for this the clarion does not deem it necessary to utter a word of apology but for that editorial comment or attitude which the proprietors felt was justified by the reliable sources of their information they now consider it only due in honor to themselves their readers and mr harcourt to fully and freely apologize a patient and laborious investigation enables them to state that the alleged facts published by the clarion and copied by other journals are utterly unsupported by testimony and the chargesalthough more or less vaguewhich were based upon them are equally untenable we are now satisfied that one elijah curtis a former pioneer of tasajara who disappeared five years ago and was supposed to be drowned has not only made no claim to the tasajara property as alleged but has given no sign of his equally alleged resuscitation and present existence and that on the minutest investigation there appears nothing either in his disappearance or the transfer of his property to daniel harcourt that could in any way disturb the uncontested title to tasajara or the unimpeachable character of its present owner the whole story now seems to have been the outcome of one of those stupid rural hoaxes too common in california   well said mrs ashwood laying aside the clarion with a skeptical shrug of her pretty shoulders as she glanced up at her brother i suppose this means that you are going to propose again to the young lady  i have said jack shipley thats the worst of itand got my answer before this came out  jack said mrs ashwood thoroughly surprised  yes you see conny as i told you three weeks ago she said she wanted time to considerthat she scarcely knew me and all that well i thought it wasnt exactly a gentlemans business to seem to stand off after that last attack on her father and so last week i went down to san jose where she was staying and begged her not to keep me in suspense and by jove she froze me with a look and said that with these aspersions on her fathers character she preferred not to be under obligations to any one  and you believed her  oh hang it all look here connyi wish youd just try for once to find out some good in that family besides what that sentimental young widower john milton may have you seem to think because theyve quarreled with him there isnt a virtue left among them  far from seeming to offer any suggestion of feminine retaliation mrs ashwood smiled sweetly my dear jack i have no desire to keep you from trying your luck again with miss clementina if thats what you mean and indeed i shouldnt be surprised if a family who felt a mesalliance as sensitively as the harcourts felt that affair of their sons would be as keenly alive to the advantages of a good match for their daughter as to young mr harcourt he never talked to me of the vices of his family nor has he lately troubled me much with the presence of his own virtues i havent heard from him since we came here  i suppose he is satisfied with the government berth you got for him returned her brother dryly  he was very grateful to senator flynn who appreciates his talents but who offered it to him as a mere question of fitness replied mrs ashwood with great precision of statement but you dont seem to know he declined it on account of his other work  preferred his old bohemian ways eh you cant change those fellows conny they cant get over the fascinations of vagabondage sorry your ladypatroness scheme didnt work pity you couldnt have promoted him in the line of his profession as the grand duchess of girolstein did fritz  for heavens sake jack go to clementina you may not be successful but there at least the perfect gentlemanliness and good taste of your illustrations will not be thrown away  i think of going to san francisco tomorrow anyway returned jack with affected carelessness im getting rather bored with this wild seaside watering place and its glitter of ocean and hopeless background of mountain its nothing to me that theres no land nearer than japan out there it may be very healthful to the tissues but its weariness to the spirit and i dont see why we cant wait at san francisco till the rains send us further south as well as here  he had walked to the balcony of their sittingroom in the little seaside hotel where this conversation took place and gazed discontentedly over the curving bay and sandy shore before him after a slight pause mrs ashwood stepped out beside him  very likely i may go with you she said with a perceptible tone of weariness we will see after the post arrives  by the way there is a little package for you in my room that came this morning i brought it up but forgot to give it to you youll find it on my table  mrs ashwood abstractedly turned away and entered her brothers room from the same balcony the forgotten parcel which looked like a roll of manuscript was lying on his dressingtable she gazed attentively at the handwriting on the wrapper and then gave a quick glance around her a sudden and subtle change came over her she neither flushed nor paled nor did the delicate lines of expression in her face quiver or change but as she held the parcel in her hand her whole being seemed to undergo some exquisite suffusion as the medicines which the arabian physician had concealed in the hollow handle of the mallet permeated the languid royal blood of persia so some volatile balm of youth seemed to flow in upon her with the contact of that strange missive and transform her weary spirit  jack she called in a high clear voice but jack had already gone from the balcony when she reached it with an elastic step and a quick youthful swirl and rustling of her skirt he was lighting his cigar in the garden  jack she said leaning half over the railing come back here in an hour and well talk over that matter of yours again  jack looked up eagerly and as if he might even come up then but she added quickly in about an houri must think it over and withdrew  she reentered the sittingroom shut the door carefully and locked it half pulled down the blind walking once or twice around the table on which the parcel lay with one eye on it like a graceful cat then she suddenly sat down took it up with a grave practical face examined the postmark curiously and opened it with severe deliberation it contained a manuscript and a letter of four closely written pages she glanced at the manuscript with bright approving eyes ran her fingers through its leaves and then laid it carefully and somewhat ostentatiously on the table beside her then still holding the letter in her hand she rose and glanced out of the window at her bored brother lounging towards the beach and at the heaving billows beyond and returned to her seat this apparently important preliminary concluded she began to read  there were as already stated four blessed pages of it all vital earnest palpitating with youthful energy preposterous in premises precipitate in conclusionsyet irresistible and convincing to every woman in their illogical sincerity there was not a word of love in it yet every page breathed a wholesome adoration there was not an epithet or expression that a greater prude than mrs ashwood would have objected to yet every sentence seemed to end in a caress there was not a line of poetry in it and scarcely a figure or simile and yet it was poetical boyishly egotistic as it was in attitude it seemed to be written less of himself than to her in its delicate because unconscious flattery it made her at once the provocation and excuse and yet so potent was its individuality that it required no signature no one but john milton harcourt could have written it his personality stood out of it so strongly that once or twice mrs ashwood almost unconsciously put up her little hand before her face with a half mischievous halfdeprecating smile as if the big honest eyes of its writer were upon her  it began by an elaborate apology for declining the appointment offered him by one of her friends which he was bold enough to think had been prompted by her kind heart that was like her but yet what she might do to any one and he preferred to think of her as the sweet and gentle lady who had recognized his merit without knowing him rather than the powerful and gracious benefactress who wanted to reward him when she did know him the crown that she had all unconsciously placed upon his head that afternoon at the little hotel at crystal spring was more to him than the senators appointment perhaps he was selfish but he could not bear that she who had given so much should believe that he could accept a lesser gift all this and much more some of it he had wanted to say to her in san francisco at times when they had met but he could not find the words but she had given him the courage to go on and do the only thing he was fit for and he had resolved to stick to that and perhaps do something once more that might make him hear again her voice as he had heard it that day and again see the light that had shone in her eyes as she sat there and read and this was why he was sending her a manuscript she might have forgotten that she had told him a strange story of her cousin who had disappearedwhich she thought he might at some time work up here it was perhaps she might not recognize it again in the way he had written it here perhaps she did not really mean it when she had given him permission to use it but he remembered her truthful eyes and believed herand in any event it was hers to do with what she liked it had been a great pleasure for him to write it and think that she would see it it was like seeing her himselfthat was in his better selfmore worthy the companionship of a beautiful and noble woman than the poor young man she would have helped this was why he had not called the week before she went away but for all that she had made his life less lonely and he should be ever grateful to her he could never forget how she unconsciously sympathized with him that day over the loss that had blighted his life foreveryet even then he did not know that she herself had passed through the same suffering but just here the stricken widow of thirty after a vain attempt to keep up the knitted gravity of her eyebrows bowed her dimpling face over the letter of the blighted widower of twenty and laughed so long and silently that the tears stood out like dew on her lightbrown eyelashes  but she became presently severe again and finished her reading of the letter gravely then she folded it carefully deposited it in a box on her table which she locked after a few minutes however she unlocked the box again and transferred the letter to her pocket the serenity of her features did not relax again although her previous pretty prepossession of youthful spirit was still indicated in her movements going into her bedroom she reappeared in a few minutes with a light cloak thrown over her shoulders and a whitetrimmed broadbrimmed hat then she rolled up the manuscript in a paper and called her french maid as she stood there awaiting her with the roll in her hand she might have been some young girl on her way to her music lesson  if my brother returns before i do tell him to wait  madame is going  out said mrs ashwood blithely and tripped downstairs  she made her way directly to the shore where she remembered there was a group of rocks affording a shelter from the northwest trade winds it was reached at low water by a narrow ridge of sand and here she had often basked in the sun with her book it was here that she now unrolled john miltons manuscript and read  it was the story she had told him but interpreted by his poetry and adorned by his fancy until the facts as she remembered them seemed to be no longer hers or indeed truths at all she had always believed her cousins unhappy temperament to have been the result of a moral and physical idiosyncrasyshe found it here to be the effect of a lifelong and hopeless passion for herself the ingenious john milton had given a poets precocity to the youth whom she had only known as a suspicious moody boy had idealized him as a sensitive but songless byron had given him the added infirmity of pulmonary weakness and a handkerchief that in moments of great excitement after having been hurriedly pressed to his pale lips was withdrawn with a crimson stain opposed to this interesting figurethe more striking to her as she had been hitherto haunted by the impression that her cousin during his boyhood had been subject to facial eruption and boilswas her own equally idealized self cruelly kind to her cousin and gentle with his weaknesses while calmly ignoring their cause leading him unconsciously step by step in his fatal passion he only became aware by accident that she nourished an ideal hero in the person of a hard proud middleaged practical man of the worldher future husband at this picture of the late mr ashwood who had really been an indistinctive social bon vivant his amiable relict grew somewhat hysterical the discovery of her real feelings drove the consumptive cousin into a secret selfimposed exile on the shores of the pacific where he hoped to find a grave but the complete and sudden change of life and scene the balm of the wild woods and the wholesome barbarism of nature wrought a magical change in his physical health and a philosophical rest in his mind he married the daughter of an indian chief years passed the heroinea rich and still young and beautiful widowunwittingly sought the same medicinal solitude here in the depth of the forest she encountered her former playmate the passion which he had fondly supposed was dead revived in her presence and for the first time she learned from his bearded lips the secret of his passion alas not she alone the contiguous forest could not be bolted out and the indian wife heard all recognizing the situation with aboriginal directness of purpose she committed suicide in the fond belief that it would reunite the survivors but in vain the cousins parted on the spot to meet no more  even mrs ashwoods predilection for the youthful writer could not overlook the fact that the denouement was by no means novel nor the situation human but yet it was here that she was most interested and fascinated the description of the forest was a description of the wood where she had first met harcourt the charm of it returned until she almost seemed to again inhale its balsamic freshness in the pages before her now as then her youth came back with the same longing and regret but more bewildering than all it was herself that moved there painted with the loving hand of the narrator for the first time she experienced the delicious flattery of seeing herself as only a lover could see her the smallest detail of her costume was suggested with an accuracy that pleasantly thrilled her feminine sense the grace of her figure slowly moving through the shadow the curves of her arm and the delicacy of her hand that held the bridle rein the gentle glow of her softly rounded cheek the sweet mystery of her veiled eyes and forehead and the escaping gold of her lovely hair beneath her hat were all in turn masterfully touched or tenderly suggested and when to this was added the faint perfume of her nearer presencethe scent she always usedthe delicate revelations of her withdrawn gauntlet the bracelet clasping her white wrist and at last the thrilling contact of her soft hand on his armshe put down the manuscript and blushed like a very girl then she started  a shouthis voice surelyand the sound of oars in their rowlocks  an instant revulsion of feeling overtook her with a quick movement she instantly hid the manuscript beneath her cloak and stood up erect and indignant not twenty yards away apparently advancing from the opposite shore of the bay was a boat it contained only john milton resting on his oars and scanning the group of rocks anxiously his face which was quite strained with anxiety suddenly flushed when he saw her and then recognizing the unmistakable significance of her look and attitude paled once more he bent over his oars again a few strokes brought him close to the rock  i beg your pardon he said hesitatingly as he turned towards her and laid aside his oars buti thoughtyou werein danger  she glanced quickly round her she had forgotten the tide the ledge between her and the shore was already a foot under brown seawater yet if she had not thought that it would look ridiculous she would have leaped down even then and waded ashore  its nothing she said coldly with the air of one to whom the situation was an everyday occurrence its only a few steps and a slight wettingand my brother would have been here in a moment more  john miltons frank eyes made no secret of his mortification i ought not to have disturbed you i know he said quickly i had no right but i was on the other shore opposite and i saw you come down herethat ishe blushed prodigiouslyi thought it might be youand i venturedi meanwont you let me row you ashore  there seemed to be no reasonable excuse for refusing she slipped quickly into the boat without waiting for his helping hand avoiding that contact which only a moment ago she was trying to recall  a few strokes brought them ashore he continued his explanation with the hopeless frankness and persistency of youth and inexperience i only came here the day before yesterday i would not have come but mr fletcher who has a cottage on the other shore sent for me to offer me my old place on the clarion i had no idea of intruding upon your privacy by calling here without permission  mrs ashwood had resumed her conventional courtesy without however losing her feminine desire to make her companion pay for the agitation he had caused her we would have been always pleased to see you she said vaguely and i hope as you are here now you will come with me to the hotel my brother  but he still retained his hold of the boatrope without moving and continued i saw you yesterday through the telescope sitting in your balcony and later at night i think it was your shadow i saw near the blue shaded lamp in the sittingroom by the windowi dont mean the red lamp that you have in your own room i watched you until you put out the blue lamp and lit the red one i tell you thisbecausebecausei thought you might be reading a manuscript i sent you at least he smiled faintly i liked to think it so  in her present mood this struck her only as persistent and somewhat egotistical but she felt herself now on ground where she could deal firmly with him  oh yes she said gravely i got it and thank you very much for it i intended to write to you  dont he said looking at her fixedly i can see you dont like it  on the contrary she said promptly i think it beautifully written and very ingenious in plot and situation of course it isnt the story i told youi didnt expect that for im not a genius the man is not at all like my cousin you know and the womanwell really to tell the truth she is simply inconceivable  you think so he said gravely he had been gazing abstractedly at some shining brown seaweed in the water and when he raised his eyes to hers they seemed to have caught its color  think so im positive theres no such a woman she isnt human but let us walk to the hotel  thank you but i must go back now  but at least let my brother thank you for taking his placein rescuing me it was so thoughtful in you to put off at once when you saw i was surrounded i might have been in great danger  please dont make fun of me mrs ashwood he said with a faint return of his boyish smile you know there was no danger i have only interrupted you in a nap or a reverieand i can see now that you evidently came here to be alone  holding the manuscript more closely hidden under the folds of her cloak she smiled enigmatically i think i did and it seems that the tide thought so too and acted upon it but you will come up to the hotel with me surely  no i am going back now there was a sudden firmness about the young fellow which she had never before noticed this was evidently the creature who had married in spite of his family  wont you come back long enough to take your manuscript i will point out the part i refer to andwe will talk it over  there is no necessity i wrote to you that you might keep it it is yours it was written for you and none other it is quite enough for me to know that you were good enough to read it but will you do one thing more for me read it again if you find anything in it the second time to change your viewsif you find  i will let you know she said quickly i will write to you as i intended  no i didnt mean that i meant that if you found the woman less inconceivable and more human dont write to me but put your red lamp in your window instead of the blue one i will watch for it and see it  i think i will be able to explain myself much better with simple pen and ink she said dryly and it will be much more useful to you  he lifted his hat gravely shoved off the boat leaped into it and before she could hold out her hand was twenty feet away she turned and ran quickly up the rocks when she reached the hotel she could see the boat already half across the bay  entering her sittingroom she found that her brother tired of waiting for her had driven out taking the hidden manuscript from her cloak she tossed it with a slight gesture of impatience on the table then she summoned the landlord  is there a town across the bay  no the whole mountainside belongs to don diego fletcher he lives away back in the coast range at los gatos but he has a cottage and mill on the beach  don diego fletcherfletcher is he a spaniard then  half and half i reckon hes from the lower country i believe  is he here often  not much he has mills at los gatos wheat ranches at santa clara and owns a newspaper in frisco but hes here now there were lights in his house last night and his cutter lies off the point  could you get a small package and note to him  certainly it is only a row across the bay  thank you  without removing her hat and cloak she sat down at the table and began a letter to don diego fletcher she begged to inclose to him a manuscript which she was satisfied for the interests of its author was better in his hands than hers it had been given to her by the author mr j m harcourt whom she understood was engaged on mr fletchers paper the clarion in fact it had been written at her suggestion and from an incident in real life of which she was cognizant she was sorry to say that on account of some very foolish criticism of her own as to the facts the talented young author had become so dissatisfied with it as to make it possible that if left to himself this very charming and beautifully written story would remain unpublished as an admirer of mr harcourts genius and a friend of his family she felt that such an event would be deplorable and she therefore begged to leave it to mr fletchers delicacy and tact to arrange with the author for its publication she knew that mr fletcher had only to read it to be convinced of its remarkable literary merit and she again would impress upon him the fact that her playful and thoughtless criticismwhich was personal and confidentialwas only based upon the circumstances that the author had really made a more beautiful and touching story than the poor facts which she had furnished seemed to warrant she had only just learned the fortunate circumstance that mr fletcher was in the neighborhood of the hotel where she was staying with her brother  with the same practical businesslike directness but perhaps a certain unbusinesslike haste superadded she rolled up the manuscript and dispatched it with the letter  this done however a slight reaction set in and having taken off her hat and shawl she dropped listlessly on a chair by the window but as suddenly rose and took a seat in the darker part of the room she felt that she had done right that highest but most depressing of human convictions it was entirely for his good there was no reason why his best interests should suffer for his folly if anybody was to suffer it was she but what nonsense was she thinking she would write to him later when she was a little cooleras she had said but then he had distinctly told her and very rudely too that he didnt want her to write wanted her to make signals to himthe idiot and probably was even now watching her with a telescope it was really too preposterous  the result was that her brother found her on his return in a somewhat uncertain mood and as a counselor variable and conflicting in judgment if this clementina who seemed to have the family qualities of obstinacy and audacity really cared for him she certainly wouldnt let delicacy stand in the way of letting him know itand he was therefore safe to wait a little a few moments later she languidly declared that she was afraid that she was no counselor in such matters really she was getting too old to take any interest in that sort of thing and she never had been a matchmaker by the way now wasnt it odd that this neighbor that rich capitalist across the bay should be called fletcher and james fletcher too for diego meant james in spanish exactly the same name as poor cousin jim who disappeared did he remember her old playmate jim but her brother thought something else was a deuced sight more odd namely that this same don diego fletcher was said to be very sweet on clementina now and was always in her company at the ramirez and that with this clarion apology on the top of it looked infernally queer  mrs ashwood felt a sudden consternation here had shejacks sisterjust been taking jacks probable rival into confidential correspondence she turned upon jack sharply  why didnt you say that before  i did tell you he said gloomily but you didnt listen but what difference does it make to you now  none whatever said mrs ashwood calmly as she walked out of the room  nevertheless the afternoon passed wearily and her usual ride into the upland canyon did not reanimate her for reasons known best to herself she did not take her afterdinner stroll along the shore to watch the outlying fog at a comparatively early hour while there was still a roseate glow in the western sky she appeared with grim deliberation and the blue lampshade in her hand and placed it over the lamp which she lit and stood on her table beside the window this done she sat down and began to write with brighteyed but vicious complacency  but you dont want that light and the window constance said jack wonderingly  mrs ashwood could not stand the dreadful twilight  but take away your lamp and youll have light enough from the sunset responded jack  that was just what she didnt want the light from the window was that horrid vulgar red glow which she hated it might be very romantic and suit lovers like jack but as she had some work to do she wanted the blue shade of the lamp to correct that dreadful glare     chaper xii   john milton had rowed back without lifting his eyes to mrs ashwoods receding figure he believed that he was right in declining her invitation although he had a miserable feeling that it entailed seeing her for the last time with all that he believed was his previous experience of the affections he was still so untutored as to be confused as to his reasons for declining or his right to have been shocked and disappointed at her manner it seemed to him sufficiently plain that he had offended the most perfect woman he had ever known without knowing more the feeling he had for her was none the less powerful because in his great simplicity it was vague and unformulated and it was a part of this strange simplicity that in his miserable loneliness his thoughts turned unconsciously to his dead wife for sympathy and consolation loo would have understood him  mr fletcher who had received him on his arrival with singular effusiveness and cordiality had put off their final arrangements until after dinner on account of pressing business it was therefore with some surprise that an hour before the time he was summoned to fletchers room he was still more surprised to find him sitting at his desk from which a number of business papers and letters had been hurriedly thrust aside to make way for a manuscript a single glance at it was enough to show the unhappy john milton that it was the one he had sent to mrs ashwood the color flashed to his cheek and he felt a mist before his eyes his employers face on the contrary was quite pale and his eyes were fixed on harcourt with a singular intensity his voice too although under great control was hard and strange  read that he said handing the young man a letter  the color again streamed into john miltons face as he recognized the hand of mrs ashwood and remained there while he read it when he put it down however he raised his frank eyes to fletchers and said with a certain dignity and manliness what she says is the truth sir but it is i alone who am at fault this manuscript is merely my stupid idea of a very simple story she was once kind enough to tell me when we were talking of strange occurrences in real life which she thought i might some time make use of in my work i tried to embellish it and failed thats all i will take it backit was written only for her  there was such an irresistible truthfulness and sincerity in his voice and manner that any idea of complicity with the sender was dismissed from fletchers mind as harcourt however extended his hand for the manuscript fletcher interfered  you forget that you gave it to her and she has sent it to me if i dont keep it it can be returned to her only now may i ask who is this lady who takes such an interest in your literary career have you known her long is she a friend of your family  the slight sneer that accompanied his question restored the natural color to the young mans face but kindled his eye ominously  no he said briefly i met her accidentally about two months ago and as accidentally found out that she had taken an interest in one of the first things i ever wrote for your paper she neither knew you nor me it was then that she told me this story she did not even then know who i was though she had met some of my family she was very good and has generously tried to help me  fletchers eyes remained fixed upon him  but this tells me only what she is not who she is  i am afraid you must inquire of her brother mr shipley said harcourt curtly  shipley  yes he is traveling with her for his health and they are going south when the rains come they are wealthy philadelphians i believe andand she is a widow  fletcher picked up her note and glanced again at the signature constance ashwood there was a moment of silence when he resumed in quite a different voice its odd i never met them nor they me  as he seemed to be waiting for a response john milton said simply i suppose its because they have not been here long and are somewhat reserved  mr fletcher laid aside the manuscript and letter and took up his apparently suspended work  when you see this mrsmrs ashwood again you might say  i shall not see her again interrupted john milton hastily  mr fletcher shrugged his shoulders very well he said with a peculiar smile i will write to her now mr harcourt he continued with a sudden business brevity if you please well drop this affair and attend to the matter for which i just summoned you since yesterday an important contract for which i have been waiting is concluded and its performance will take me east at once i have made arrangements that you will be left in the literary charge of the clarion it is only a fitting recompense that the paper owes to you and your fatherto whom i hope to see you presently reconciled but we wont discuss that now as my affairs take me back to los gatos within half an hour i am sorry i cannot dispense my hospitality in personbut you will dine and sleep here tonight goodby as you go out will you please send up mr jackson to me he nodded briefly seemed to plunge instantly into his papers again and john milton was glad to withdraw  the shock he had felt at mrs ashwoods frigid disposition of his wishes and his manuscript had benumbed him to any enjoyment or appreciation of the change in his fortune he wandered out of the house and descended to the beach in a dazed bewildered way seeing only the words of her letter to fletcher before him and striving to grasp some other meaning from them than their coldly practical purport perhaps this was her cruel revenge for his telling her not to write to him could she not have divined it was only his fear of what she might say and now it was all over she had washed her hands of him with the sending of that manuscript and letter and he would pass out of her memory as a foolish conceited ingrateperhaps a figure as wearily irritating and stupid to her as the cousin she had known he mechanically lifted his eyes to the distant hotel the glow was still in the western sky but the blue lamp was already shining in the window his cheek flushed quickly and he turned away as if she could have seen his face yesshe despised him and that was his answer  when he returned mr fletcher had gone he dragged through a dinner with mr jackson fletchers secretary and tried to realize his good fortune in listening to the subordinates congratulations but i thought said jackson you had slipped up on your luck today when the old man sent for you he was quite white and ready to rip out about something that had just come in i suppose it was one of those anonymous things against your fatherthe old mans dead set against em now but john milton heard him vaguely and presently excused himself for a row on the moonlit bay  the active exertion with intervals of placid drifting along the landlocked shore somewhat soothed him the heaving pacific beyond was partly hidden in a low creeping fog but the curving bay was softly radiant the rocks whereon she sat that morning the hotel where she was now quietly reading were outlined in black and silver in this dangerous contiguity it seemed to him that her presence returnednot the woman who had met him so coldly who had penned those lines the woman from whom he was now parting forever but the blameless ideal he had worshiped from the first and which he now felt could never pass out of his life again he recalled their long talks their rarer rides and walks in the city her quick appreciation and ready sympathy her pretty curiosity and halfmaternal consideration of his foolish youthful past even the playful way that she sometimes seemed to make herself younger as if to better understand him lingering at times in the shadow of the headland he fancied he saw the delicate nervous outlines of her face near his own again the faint shading of her brown lashes the soft intelligence of her gray eyes drifting idly in the placid moonlight pulling feverishly across the swell of the channel or lying on his oars in the shallows of the rocks but always following the curves of the bay like a bird circling around a lighthouse it was far in the night before he at last dragged his boat upon the sand then he turned to look once more at her distant window he would be away in the morning and he should never see it again it was very late but the blue light seemed to be still burning unalterably and inflexibly  but even as he gazed a change came over it a shadow seemed to pass before the blind the blue shade was lifted for an instant he could see the colorless starlike point of the light itself show clearly it was over now she was putting out the lamp suddenly he held his breath a roseate glow gradually suffused the window like a burning blush the curtain was drawn aside and the red lampshade gleamed out surely and steadily into the darkness  transfigured and breathless in the moonlight john milton gazed on it it seemed to him the dawn of love     chaper xiii   the winter rains had come but so plenteously and persistently and with such fateful preparation of circumstance that the long looked for blessing presently became a wonder an anxiety and at last a slowly widening terror before a month had passed every mountain stream and watercourse surcharged with the melted snows of the sierras had become a great tributary every tributary a great river until pouring their great volume into the engorged channels of the american and sacramento rivers they overleaped their banks and became as one vast inland sea even to a country already familiar with broad and striking catastrophe the flood was a phenomenal one for days the sullen overflow lay in the valley of the sacramento enormous silent currentlessexcept where the surplus waters rolled through carquinez straits san francisco bay and the golden gate and reappeared as the vanished sacramento river in an outflowing stream of fresh and turbid water fifty miles at sea  across the vast inland expanse brooded over by a leaden sky leaden rain fell dimpling like shot the sluggish pools of the flood a cloudy chaos of fallen trees drifting barns and outhouses wagons and agricultural implements moved over the surface of the waters or circled slowly around the outskirts of forests that stood ankle deep in ooze and the current which in serried phalanx they resisted still as night fell these forms became still more vague and chaotic and were interspersed with the scattered lanterns and flaming torches of reliefboats or occasionally the high terraced gleaming windows of the great steamboats feeling their way along the lost channel at times the opening of a furnacedoor shot broad bars of light across the sluggish stream and into the branches of dripping and driftencumbered trees at times the looming smokestacks sent out a pentup breath of sparks that illuminated the inky chaos for a moment and then fell as black and dripping rain or perhaps a hoarse shout from some faintly outlined hulk on either side brought a quick response from the reliefboats and the detaching of a canoe with a blazing pineknot in its bow into the outer darkness  it was late in the afternoon when lawrence grant from the deck of one of the larger tugs sighted what had been once the estuary of sidon creek the leader of a party of scientific observation and relief he had kept a tireless watch of eighteen hours keenly noticing the work of devastation the changes in the channel the prospects of abatement and the danger that still threatened he had passed down the length of the submerged sacramento valley through the straits of carquinez and was now steaming along the shores of the upper reaches of san francisco bay everywhere the same scene of desolationvast stretches of tule land once broken up by cultivation and dotted with dwellings now clearly erased on that watery chart long lines of symmetrical perspective breaking the monotonous level showing orchards buried in the flood indian mounds and natural eminences covered with cattle or hastily erected camps half submerged houses whose solitary chimneys however still gave signs of an undaunted life within isolated groups of trees with their lower branches heavy with the unwholesome fruit of the flood in wisps of hay and straw rakes and pitchforks or pathetically sheltering some shivering and forgotten household pet but everywhere the same dull expressionless placid tranquillity of destructiona horrible leveling of all things in one bland smiling equality of surface beneath which agony despair and ruin were deeply buried and forgotten a catastrophe without convulsiona devastation voiceless passionless and supine  the boat had slowed up before what seemed to be a collection of disarranged houses with the current flowing between lines that indicated the existence of thoroughfares and streets many of the lighter wooden buildings were huddled together on the street corners with their gables to the flow some appeared as if they had fallen on their knees and others lay complacently on their sides like the houses of a childs toy village an elevator still lifted itself above the other warehouses from the centre of an enormous square pond once the plaza still arose a liberty pole or flagstaff which now supported a swinging lantern and in the distance appeared the glittering dome of some public building grant recognized the scene at once it was all that was left of the invincible youth of tasajara  as this was an objective point of the scheme of survey and relief for the district the boat was made fast to the second story of one of the warehouses it was now used as a general store and depot and bore a singular resemblance in its interior to harcourts grocery at sidon this suggestion was the more fatefully indicated by the fact that half a dozen men were seated around a stove in the centre more or less given up to a kind of philosophical and lazy enjoyment of their enforced idleness and when to this was added the more surprising coincidence that the party consisted of billings peters and wingateformer residents of sidon and first citizens of tasajarathe resemblance was complete  they were ruinedbut they accepted their common fate with a certain indian stoicism and western sense of humor that for the time lifted them above the vulgar complacency of their former fortunes there was a deepseated if coarse and irreverent resignation in their philosophy at the beginning of the calamity it had been roughly formulated by billings in the statement that it wasnt anybodys fault there was nobody to kill and what couldnt be reached by a vigilance committee there was no use resolootin over when the reverend doctor pilsbury had suggested an appeal to a higher power peters had replied good humoredly that a creator who could fool around with them in that style was above being interfered with by prayer at first the calamity had been a thing to fight against then it became a practical joke the sting of which was lost in the victims power of endurance and assumed ignorance of its purport there was something almost pathetic in their attempts to understand its peculiar humor  how about that european trip o yours peters said billings meditatively from the depths of his chair looks as if those crowned heads over there would have to wait till the water goes down considerable afore you kin trot out your wife and darters before em  yes said peters it rather pints that way and ez far ez i kin see mame billings aint goin to no saratoga neither this year  reckon the boys wont hang about old harcourts free library to see the girls home from lectures and singingclass much this year said wingate wonder if harcourt ever thought o this the day he opened it and made that rattlin speech o his about the new property clark says everything built on that made ground has got to go after the water falls rough on harcourt after all his other losses eh he oughter have closed up with that scientific chap grant and married him to clementina while the big boom was on  hush said peters indicating grant who had just entered quietly  dont mind me gentlemen said grant stepping towards the group with a grave but perfectly collected face on the contrary i am very anxious to hear all the news of harcourts family i left for new york before the rainy season and have only just got back  his speech and manner appeared to be so much in keeping with the prevailing grim philosophy that billings after a glance at the others went on ef you left afore the first rains said he you must have left only the steamer ahead of fletcher when he run off with clementina harcourt and you might have come across them on their wedding trip in new
