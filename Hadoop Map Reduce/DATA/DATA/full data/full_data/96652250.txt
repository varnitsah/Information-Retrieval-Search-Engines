i was sitting on the deck of a savannah steamship which was lying at a dock in the east river new york i was waiting for young rectus and had already waited some time which surprised me because rectus was as a general thing a very prompt fellow who seldom kept people waiting but it was probably impossible for him to regulate his own movements this time for his father and mother were coming with him to see him off  i had no one there to see me off but i did not care for that i was sixteen years old and felt quite like a man whereas rectus was only fourteen and couldnt possibly feel like a manunless his looks very much belied his feelings my father and mother and sister lived in a small town some thirty miles from new york and that was a very good reason for their not coming to the city just to see me sail away in a steamship they took a good leave of me though before i left home  i shall never forget how i first became acquainted with rectus about a couple of years before he was a new boy in the academy at willisville one saturday a lot of us went down to the river to swim our favorite place was near an old wharf which ran out into deep water and a fellow could take a good dive there when the tide was high there were some of the smaller boys along that day but they didnt dive any and if they even swam it was in shallow water near the shore by the side of the wharf but i think most of them spent their time wading about  i was a good swimmer and could dive very well i was learning to swim under water but had not done very much in that line at the time i speak of we were nearly ready to come out when i took a dive from a post on the end of the wharf and then turned under water to swim in shore i intended to try to keep under until i got into water shallow enough for me to touch bottom and walk ashore after half a dozen strokes i felt for the bottom and my feet touched it then i raised my head but i didnt raise it out of the water it struck something hard  in an instant i knew what had happened there was a big mudscow lying by the side of the wharf and i had got under that it was a great flat thing ever so long and very wide i knew i must get from under it as quickly as i could indeed i could hardly hold my breath now i waded along with my head bent down but i didnt reach the side of it then i turned the other way but my hands which i held up still touched nothing but the hard slimy bottom of the scow i must have been wading up and down the length of the thing i was bewildered i couldnt think which way to turn i could only think of one thing i would be drowned in less than a minute scott would be head of the class my mother and little helenbut i cant tell what my thoughts were then they were dreadful but just as i was thinking of helen and mother i saw through the water some white things not far from me i knew by their looks that they were a boys legs  i staggered toward them and in a moment my hands went out of water just at the side of the scow i stood up and my head with half my body came up into the air  what a breath i drew but i felt so weak and shaky that i had to take hold of the side of the scow and stand there for a while before i waded ashore the boy who was standing by me was rectus he did not have that name then and i didnt know him  it must be pretty hard to stay under water so long he said  hard i answered as soon as i could get my breath i should think so why i came near being drowned  is that so said he i didnt know that i saw you go down and have been watching for you to come up but i didnt expect you to come from under the scow  how glad i was that he had been standing there watching for me to come up if he had not been there or if his legs had been green or the color of water i believe i should have drowned  i always liked the boy after that though of course there was no particular reason for it he was a boarder his parents lived in new york samuel colbert was his real name and the title of rectus he obtained at school by being so good he scarcely ever did anything wrong which was rather surprising to the rest of us because he was not sickly or anything of that kind after a while we got into the way of calling him rectus and as he didnt seem to mind it the name stuck to him the boys generally liked him and he got on quite well in the schoolin every way except in his studies he was not a smart boy and did not pretend to be  i went right through the academy from the lowest to the highest class and when i left the professor as we called our principal said that i was ready to go to college and urged me very much to do so but i was not in any hurry and my parents agreed with me that after four years of schoollife i had better wait a while before beginning a new course all this disturbed the professor very much but he insisted on my keeping up my studies so as not to get rusty and he came up to our house very often for the purpose of seeing what i was doing in the study line and how i was doing it  i thought over things a good deal for myself and a few months after i left the academy i made up my mind to travel a little i talked about it at home and it was generally thought to be a good idea although my sister was in favor of it only in case i took her with me otherwise she opposed it but there were a great many reasons why i could not take her she was only eleven  i had some money of my own which i thought i would rather spend in travel than in any other way and as it was not a large sum and as my father could not afford to add anything to it my journey could not be very extensive indeed i only contemplated going to florida and perhaps a few other southern states and thenif it could be donea visit to some of the west india islands and as it was wintertime that would be a very good trip my father did not seem to be afraid to trust me to go alone he and the professor talked it over and they thought that i would take good enough care of myself the professor would have much preferred to see me go to college but as i was not to do that he thought travelling much better for me than staying at home although i made no promise about taking my books along but it was pretty well settled that i was to go to college in the fall and this consoled him a little  the person who first suggested this travelling plan was our old physician dr mathews i dont know exactly what he said about it but i knew he thought i had been studying too hard and needed to let up for a while and im sure too that he was quite positive that i would have no let up as long as i staid in the same town with the professor  nearly a year before this time rectus had left the academy he had never reached the higher classesin fact he didnt seem to get on well at all he studied well enough but he didnt take hold of things properly and i believe he really did not care to go through the school but he was such a quiet fellow that we could not make much out of him his father was very rich and we all thought that rectus was taken away to be brought up as a partner in the firm but we really knew nothing about it for as i found out afterward rectus spent all his time after he left school in studying music  soon after my trip was all agreed upon and settled father had to go to new york and there he saw mr colbert and of course told him of my plans that afternoon old colbert came to my fathers hotel and proposed to him that i should take his son with me he had always heard he said that i was a sensible fellow and fit to be trusted and he would be very glad to have his boy travel with me and he furthermore said that if i had the care of samuelfor of course he didnt call his son rectushe would pay me a salary he had evidently read about young english fellows travelling on the continent with their tutors and i suppose he wanted me to be his sons tutor or something like it  when father told me what mr colbert had proposed i agreed instantly i liked rectus and the salary would help immensely i wrote to new york that very night accepting the proposition  when my friends in the town and those at the school heard that rectus and i were going off together they thought it an uncommonly good joke and they crowded up to our house to see me about it  two such good young men as you and rectus travelling together ought to have a beneficial influence upon whole communities said harry alden and scott remarked that if there should be a bad storm at sea he would advise us two to throw everybody else overboard to the whales for the other people would be sure to be the wicked ones i am happy to say that i got a twist on scotts ear that made him howl and then mother came in and invited them all to come and take supper with me the tuesday before i started we invited rectus to come up from the city but he did not make his appearance however we got on firstrate without him and had a splendid time there was never a woman who knew just how to make boys have a good time like my mother  i had been a long while on the steamer waiting for rectus she was to sail at three oclock and it was then after two the day was clear and fine but so much sitting and standing about had made me cold so that i was very glad to see a carriage drive up with rectus and his father and mother i went down to them i was anxious to see rectus for it had been nearly a year since we had met he seemed about the same as he used to be and had certainly not grown much he just shook hands with me and said how d ye do gordon mr and mrs colbert seemed ever so much more pleased to see me and when we went on the upper deck the old gentleman took me into the captains room the door of which stood open the captain was not there but i dont believe mr colbert would have cared if he had been all he seemed to want was to find a place where we could get away from the people on deck when he had partly closed the door he said  have you got your ticket  oh yes i answered i bought that ten days ago i wrote for it  thats right said he and here is sammys ticket i was glad to see that you had spoken about the other berth in your stateroom being reserved for sammy  i thought he neednt have asked me if i had my ticket when he knew that i had bought it but perhaps he thought i had lost it by this time he was a very particular little man  where do you keep your money he asked me and i told him that the greater part of itall but some pocketmoneywas stowed away in an inside pocket of my vest  very good said he thats better than a pocketbook or belt but you must pin it in now here is sammys moneyfor his travelling expenses and his other necessities i have calculated that that will be enough for a four months trip and you wont want to stay longer than that but if this runs out you can write to me if you were going to europe now id get you a letter of credit but for your sort of travelling youd better have the money with you i did think of giving you a draft on savannah but youd have to draw the money thereand you might as well have it here youre big enough to know how to take care of it and with this he handed me a lot of banknotes  and now what about your salary would you like to have it now or wait until you come back  this question made my heart jump for i had thought a great deal about how i was to draw that salary so quick enough i said that id like to have it now  i expected so said he and heres the amount for four months i brought a receipt you can sign it with a leadpencil that will do now put all this money in your inside pockets some in your vest and some in your undercoat dont bundle it up too much and be sure and pin it in pin it from the inside right through the money if you can put your clothes under your pillow at night goodbye i expect theyll be sounding the gong directly for us to get ashore  and so he hurried out i followed him very much surprised he had spoken only of money and had said nothing about his sonwhat he wished me to do for him what plans of travel or instruction he had decided upon or anything indeed about the duties for which i was to be paid i had expected that he would come down early to the steamer and have a long talk about these matters there was no time to ask him any questions now for he was with his wife trying to get her to hurry ashore he was dreadfully afraid that they would stay on board too long and be carried to sea  mrs colbert however did not leave me in any doubt as to what she wanted me to do she rushed up to me and seized me by both hands  now you will take the greatest and the best care of my boy wont you youll cherish him as the apple of your eye youll keep him out of every kind of danger now do take good care of himespecially in storms  illustration she seized me by both hands  i tried to assure rectuss mothershe was a wide goodhumored ladythat i would do as much of all this as i could and what i said seemed to satisfy her for she wiped her eyes in a very comfortable sort of a way  mr colbert got his wife ashore as soon as he could and rectus and i stood on the upper deck and watched them get into the carriage and drive away rectus did not look as happy as i thought a fellow ought to look when starting out on such a jolly trip as we expected this to be  i proposed that we should go and look at our stateroom which was number twentytwo and so we went below the stateroom hadnt much state about it it was very small with two shelves for us to sleep on i let rectus choose his shelf and he took the lower one this suited me very well for id much rather climb over a boy than have one climb over me  there wasnt anything else in the room to divide and we were just about to come out and call the thing settled when i heard a shout at the door i turned around and there stood harry alden and scott and tom myers and his brother george  i tell you i was glad to see them in spite of all my reasoning that it made no difference about anybody coming to see me off it did make a good deal of difference it was a lonely sort of business starting off in that wayespecially after seeing rectuss father and mother come down to the boat with him  we didnt think of this until this morning cried scott and then we voted it was too mean to let you go off without anybody to see you safely on board  oh yes said i  and so our class appointed a committee scott went on to come down and attend to you and were the committee it ought to have been fellows that had gone through the school but there were none of them there  irish said harry  so we came said scott we raised all the spare cash there was in the class and there was only enough to send four of us we drew lots if it hadnt been you i dont believe the professor would have let us off any way we missed the noon train and were afraid all the way here that wed be too late do you two fellows have to sleep in those cubbyholes  certainly said i theyre big enough  dont believe it said harry alden theyre too short  thats so said scott who was rather tall for his age lets try em  this was agreed to on the spot and all four of the boys took off their boots and got into the berths while rectus and i sat down on the little bench at the side of the room and laughed at them tom myers and his brother george both climbed into the top berth at once and as they found it was a pretty tight squeeze they both tried to get out at once and down they came on scott who was just turning out of the lower berthwhich was too long for him in spite of all his talkand then there was a much bigger tussle all around than any six boys could make with comfort in a little room like that  i hustled tom myers and his brother george out into the diningroom and the other fellows followed  is this where you eat asked scott looking up and down at the long tables with the swinging shelves above them  no this isnt where they eat said harry this is where they come to look at victuals and get sick at the sight of them  sick said i not much of it  but the committee laughed and didnt seem to agree with me  youll be sick ten minutes after the boat starts said scott  we wont get into seasick water until were out of the lower bay i said and this isnt a boatits a ship you fellows know lots  tom myers and his brother george were trying to find out why the tumblers and glasses were all stuck into holes in the shelves over the tables when harry alden sung out  whats that swishing  that what said i  there it goes again harry cried splashing  its the wheels exclaimed rectus  thats so cried scott the old things off rush up here the hindstairs quick  and upstairs to the deck we all went one on top of another the wheels were going around and the steamer was off  already she was quite a distance from the wharf i suppose the tide carried her out as soon as the lines were cast off for im sure the wheels had not been in motion half a minute before we heard them but all that made no difference we were off  i never saw four such blank faces as the committee wore when they saw the wide space of water between them and the wharf  stop her cried scott to me as if i could do anything and then he made a dive toward a party of men on the deck  theyre passengers i cried we must find the captain  no no said harry go for the steersman tell him to steer back we mustnt be carried off  tom myers and his brother george had already started for the pilothouse when rectus shouted to them that hed run down to the engineer and tell him to stop the engine so they stopped and rectus was just going below when scott called to him to hold up  you neednt be scared he said he had been just as much scared as anybody that man over there says it will be all right we can go back with the pilot people often do that it will be all the more fun dont bother the engineer theres nothing id like better than a trip back with a pilot  thats so said harry i never thought of the pilot  but are you sure hell take you back asked rectus while tom myers and his brother george looked very pale and anxious  take us of course he will said scott thats one of the things a pilots forto take back passengersi mean people who are only going part way do you suppose the captain will want to take us all the way to savannah for nothing  rectus didnt suppose that and neither did any of the rest of us but i thought we ought to look up the captain and tell him  but you see said scott its just possible he might put back  well dont you want to go back i asked  yes of course but i would like a sail back in a pilotboat said scott and harry alden agreed with him tom myers and his brother george wanted to go back right away  we talked the matter over a good deal i didnt wish to appear as if i wanted to get rid of the fellows who had been kind enough to come all the way from willisville to see me off but i couldnt help thinking that it didnt look exactly fair and straightforward not to say that these boys were not passengers until the pilot was ready to go back i determined to go and see about the matter but i would wait a little while  it was cool on deck especially now that the vessel was moving along but we all buttoned up our coats and walked up and down the sun shone brightly and the scene was so busy and lively with the tugboats puffing about and the vessels at anchor and the ferryboats and a whole bayfull of sights curious to us country boys that we all enjoyed ourselves very muchexcept tom myers and his brother george they didnt look happy     chapter ii  going back with the pilot   we were pretty near the narrows when i thought it was about time to let the captain or one of the officers know that there were some people on board who didnt intend to take the whole trip i had read in the newspapers that committees and friends who went part way with distinguished people generally left them in the lower bay  but i was saved the trouble of looking for an officer for one of them the purser came along collecting tickets i didnt give him a chance to ask scott or any of the other fellows for something that they didnt have but went right up to him and told him how the matter stood  i must see the captain about this he said and off he went  he didnt look very friendly said scott and i had to admit that he didnt  in a few moments the captain came walking rapidly up to us he was a tall man dressed in blue with sidewhiskers and an oilcloth cap the purser came up behind him  whats all this said the captain are you not passengers you boys he did not look very friendly either as he asked this question  illustration the vessel is off  two of us are i said but four of us were carried off accidentally  accident fiddlesticks exclaimed the captain didnt you know the vessel was starting hadnt you time to get off didnt you hear the gong everybody else heard it are you all deaf  this was a good deal to answer at once so i just said that i didnt remember hearing any gong tom myers and his brother george however spoke up and said that they had heard a gong they thought but did not know what it was for  why didnt you ask then said the captain who was getting worse in his humor i had a good mind to tell him that it would take up a good deal of the crews time if tom myers and his brother george asked about everything they didnt understand on board this ship but i thought i had better not i have no doubt the gong sounded when we were having our row in the stateroom and were not likely to pay attention to it even if we did hear it  and why in the name of common sense the captain went on didnt you come and report the instant you found the vessel had started did you think we were fast to the pier all this time  then scott thought he might as well come out square with the truth and he told how they made up their minds after they found that the steamer had really started with them on board not to make any fuss about it nor give anybody any trouble to stop the ship or to put back but just to stay quietly on board and go back with the pilot they thought that would be most convenient all around  go back with the pilot the captain cried why you young idiot there is no pilot coastwise steamers dont carry pilots i am my own pilot there is no pilot going back  you ought to have seen scotts face  illustration scott and the captain  nobody said anything we all just stood and looked at the captain tears began to come into the eyes of tom myers and his brother george  what are they to do asked the purser of the captain buy tickets for savannah  we cant do that said scott quickly we havent any money  i dont know what theyre to do replied the captain id like to chuck em overboard and with this agreeable little speech he walked away  the purser now took the two tickets for rectus and myself and saying well see whats to be done with the rest of you fellows he walked away too  then we all looked at one another we were a pretty pale lot and i believe that rectus and i who were all right felt almost as badly as the four other boys who were all wrong  we cant go to savannah said harry alden what right have they to take us to savannah  well then youd better get out and go home said scott i dont so much mind their taking us to savannah for they cant make us pay if we havent any money but how are we going to get back thats the question and whatll the professor think hell write home that weve run away and whatll we do in savannah without any money  youd better have thought of some of these things before you got us into waiting to go back with the pilot said harry  as for tom myers and his brother george they just sat down and put their arms on the railing and clapped their faces down on their arms they cried all over their coatsleeves but kept as quiet as they could about it whenever these two boys had to cry before any of the rest of the schoolfellows they had learned to keep very quiet about it  while the rest of us were talking away and scott and harry finding fault with each other the captain came back he looked in a little better humor  the only thing that can be done with you boys he said is to put you on some tug or small craft thats going back to new york if we meet one ill lie to and let you off but it will put me to a great deal of trouble and we may meet with nothing that will take you aboard you have acted very badly if you had come right to me or to any of the officers the moment you found we had started i could have easily put you on shore there are lots of small boats about the piers that would have come out after you or i might even have put back but i can do nothing now but look out for some craft bound for new york that will take you aboard if we dont meet one youll have to go on to savannah  this made us feel a little better we were now in the lower bay and there would certainly be some sort of a vessel that would stop for the boys we all went to the forward deck and looked out it was pretty cold there and we soon began to shiver in the wind but still we stuck it out  there were a good many vessels but most of them were big ones we could hardly have the impudence to ask a great threemasted ship under full sail to stop and give us a lift to new york at any rate we had nothing to do with the asking the captain would attend to that but every time we came near a vessel going the other way we looked about to see if we could see anything of an officer with a trumpet standing all ready to sing out sail ho  but after a while we felt so cold that we couldnt stand it any longer and we went below we might have gone and stood by the smokestack and warmed ourselves but we didnt know enough about ships to think of this  we hadnt been standing around the stove in the diningroom more than ten minutes before the purser came hurrying toward us  come now he said tumble forward the captains hailed a pilotboat  hurrah said scott were going back in a pilotboat after all and we all ran after the purser to the lower forward deck our engines had stopped and not far from us was a roughlooking little schooner with a big 17 painted in black on her mainsail she was putting about the purser said and her sails were flapping in the wind  there was a great change in the countenances of tom myers and his brother george they looked like a couple of new boys  isnt this capital said scott everythings turned out all right  but all of a sudden he changed his tune  look here said he to me pulling me on one side wont that pilot want to be paid something he wont stop his vessel and take us back for nothing will he  i couldnt say anything about this but i asked the purser who still stood by us  i dont suppose hell make any regular charge said he but hell expect you to give him somethingwhatever you please  but we havent anything said scott to me we have our return tickets to willisville and thats about all  perhaps we cant go back after all said harry glumly while tom myers and his brother george began to drop their lower jaws again  i did not believe that the pilotboat people would ask to see the boys money before they took them on board but i couldnt help feeling that it would be pretty hard for them to go ashore at the city and give nothing for their passages but promises and so i called rectus on one side and proposed to lend the fellows some money he agreed and i unpinned a banknote and gave it to scott he was mightily tickled to get it and vowed hed send it back to me in the first letter he wrote and he did it too  the pilotschooner did not come very near us but she lowered a boat with two men in it and they rowed up to the steamer some of our sailors let down a pair of stairs and one of the men in the boat came up to see what was wanted the purser was telling him when the captain who was standing on the upper deck by the pilothouse sung out  hurry up there now and dont keep this vessel here any longer get em out as quick as you can mr brown  the boys didnt stop to have this kind invitation repeated and scott scuffled down the stairs into the boat as fast as he could followed closely by harry alden tom myers and his brother george stopped long enough to bid each of us goodbye and shake hands with us and then they went down the stairs they had to climb over the railing to the platform in front of the wheelhouse to get to the stairs and as the steamer rolled a little and the stairs shook they went down very slowly backward and when they got to the bottom were afraid to step into the boat which looked pretty unsteady as it wobbled about under them  come there be lively shouted the captain  just then rectus made a step forward he had been looking very anxiously at the boys as they got into the boat but he hadnt said anything  where are you going said i for as quick as a flash the thought came into my mind that rectuss heart had failed him and that he would like to back out  i think ill go back with the boys he said making another step toward the top of the stairs down which the man from the pilotboat was hurrying  just you try it said i and i put out my arm in front of him  he didnt try it and im glad he didnt for i should have been sorry enough to have had the boys go back and say that when they last saw rectus and i we were having a big fight on the deck of the steamer  the vessel now started off and rectus and i went to the upper deck and stood and watched the little boat as it slowly approached the schooner we were rapidly leaving them but we saw the boys climb on board and one of themit must have been scottwaved his handkerchief to us i waved mine in return but rectus kept his in his pocket i dont think he felt in a wavy mood  while we were standing looking at the distant pilotboat i began to consider a few matters and the principal thing was this how were rectus and i to stand toward each other should we travel like a couple of schoolfriends or should i make him understand that he was under my charge and control and must behave himself accordingly i had no idea what he thought of the matter and by the way he addressed me when we met i supposed that it was possible that he looked upon me very much as he used to when we went to school together if he had said mr gordon it would have been more appropriate i thought and would have encouraged me too in taking position as his supervisor as far as my own feelings were concerned i think i would have preferred to travel about on a level with rectus and to have a good time with him as two old schoolfellows might easily have even if one did happen to be two years older than the other but that would not be earning my salary after a good deal of thought i came to the conclusion that i would let things go on as they would for a while giving rectus a good deal of rope but the moment he began to show signs of insubordination i would march right on him and quell him with an iron hand after that all would be plain sailing and we could have as much fun as we pleased for rectus would know exactly how far he could go  there were but few passengers on deck for it was quite cold and it now began to grow dark and we went below pretty soon the dinnerbell rang and i was glad to hear it for i had the appetite of a horse there was a firstrate dinner ever so many different kinds of dishes all up and down the table which had ridges running lengthwise under the tablecloth to keep the plates from sliding off if a storm should come up before we were done with dinner the shelves above the table began to swing a good dealor rather the vessel rolled and the shelves kept their placesso i knew we must be pretty well out to sea but i had not expected it would be so rough for the day had been fine and clear when we left the table it was about as much as we could do to keep our feet and in less than a quarter of an hour i began to feel dreadfully i stuck it out as long as i could and then i went to bed the old ship rolled and she pitched and she heaved and she butted right and left against the waves and made herself just as uncomfortable for human beings as she could but for all that i went to sleep after a while  i dont know how long i slept but when i woke up there was rectus sitting on a little bench by the stateroom wall with his feet braced against the berth he was hard at work sucking a lemon i turned over and looked down at him he didnt look a bit sick i hated to see him eating lemons  dont you feel badly rectus said i  oh no said he im all right you ought to suck a lemon have one  i declined his offer the idea of eating or drinking anything was intensely disagreeable to me i wished that rectus would put down that lemon he did throw it away after a while but he immediately began to cut another one  illustration rectus and the lemons  rectus said i youll make yourself sick youd better go to bed  its just the thing to stop me from being sick said he and at that minute the vessel gave her stern a great toss over sideways which sent rectus off his seat head foremost into the washstand i was glad to see it i would have been glad of almost anything that stopped that lemon business  but it didnt stop it and he only picked himself up and sat down again his lemon at his mouth  rectus i cried leaning out of my berth put down that lemon and go to bed  he put down the lemon without a word and went to bed i turned over with a sense of relief rectus was subordinate     chapter iii  rectus opens his eyes   i was all right the next day and we staid on deck most of the time standing around the smokestack when our noses got a little blue with the cold there were not many other people on deck i was expecting young rectus to have his turn at seasickness but he disappointed me he spent a good deal of his time calculating our position on a little foldingmap he had he inquired how fast we were going and then he worked the whole thing out from sandy hook to savannah marking on the map the hours at which he ought to be at such and such a place he tried his best to get his map of the course all right and made a good many alterations so that we were off cape charles several times in the course of the day rectus had never been very good at calculations and i was glad to see that he was beginning to take an interest in such things  the next morning just after daybreak we were awakened by a good deal of tramping about on deck over our heads and we turned out sharp to see what the matter was rectus wanted me to wait after we were dressed until he could get out his map and calculate where we were but i couldnt stop for such nonsense for i knew that his kind of navigation didnt amount to much and so we scrambled up on deck the ship was pitching and tossing worse than she had done yet we had been practising the sealeg business the day before and managed to walk along pretty well but this morning our sealegs didnt work at all and we couldnt take a step without hanging on to something when we got on deck we found that the first officer or matehis name was randallwith three or four sailors was throwing the lead to see how deep the water was we hung on to a couple of stays and watched them it was a rousing big lead a foot long and the line ran out over a pulley at the stern a sailor took the lead a good way forward before he threw it so as to give it a chance to get to the bottom before the steamer passed over it and began to tow it when they pulled it in we were surprised to see that it took three men to do it then mr randall scooped out a piece of tallow that was in a hollow in the bottom of the lead and took it to show to the captain whose room was on deck i knew this was one way they had of finding out where they were for they examined the sand or mud on the tallow and so knew what sort of a bottom they were going over and all the different kinds of bottom were marked out on their charts  as mr randall passed us rectus sung out to him and asked him where we were now  off hatteras said he quite shortly  i didnt think rectus should have bothered mr randall with questions when he was so busy but after he went into the captains room the men did not seem to have much to do and i asked one of them how deep it was  about seventeen fathoms said he  can we see cape hatteras i said trying to get a good look landward as the vessel rolled over that way  no said the man we could see the light just before daybreak but the weathers gettin thick now and were keepin out  it was pretty thick to the west that was true all that i could see in the distance was a very mixedup picture of wavetops and mist i knew that cape hatteras was one of the most dangerous points on the coast and that sailors were always glad when they had safely rounded it and so i began to take a good deal of interest in what was going on there was a pretty strong wind from the southeast and we had no sail set at all every now and then the steamer would get herself up on top of a big wave and then drop down sideways as if she were sliding off the top of a house the mate and the captain soon came out on deck together and the captain went forward to the pilothouse while mr randall came over to his men and they got ready to throw the lead again it didnt seem to me that the line ran out as far as it did the last time and i think i heard mr randall say fourteen at any rate a man was sent forward to the pilothouse and directly we heard the rudderchains creaking and the big iron arms of the rudder which were on deck moved over toward the landward side of the vessel and i knew by that that the captain was putting her head out to sea mr randall took out the tallow from the lead and laid it in an empty bucket that was lashed to the deck he seemed to be more anxious now about the depth of water than about the kind of bottom we were passing over the lead was just about to be thrown again when rectus who had taken the tallow out of the bucket which stood near us and had examined it pretty closely started off to speak to mr randall with the tallow in his hand  illustration hold your tongue roared mr randall  look here said rectus holding on to the railing ill tell you what would be a sight better than tallow for your leads just you get some fine white castilesoap and  confound you roared mr randall turning savagely on him hold your tongue for three cents id tie you to this line and drag the bottom with you  rectus made no answer he didnt offer him the three cents but came away promptly and put the piece of tallow back in the bucket he didnt get any comfort from me  havent you got any better sense i said to him than to go with your nonsense to the first officer at such a time as this i never saw such a boy  but the soap is better than the tallow said rectus its finer and whiter and would take up the sand better  no it wouldnt i growled at him the water would wash it out in half a minute you neednt be trying to tell anybody on this ship what they ought to do  but supposing said he  no i exclaimed in a way that made him jump theres no supposing about it if you know their business better than they do why just let it stand that way it wont hurt you  i was pretty mad i must say for i didnt want to see a fellow like rectus trying to run the ship but you couldnt stay mad with rectus long he didnt mean any wrong and he gave no words back and so as you might expect we were all right again by breakfasttime  the next morning we were surprised to feel how warm it was on deck we didnt need our overcoats the sea was ever so much smoother too there were two or three ladies on deck who could walk pretty well  about noon i was standing on the upper deck when i saw rectus coming toward me looking very pale he was generally a dark sort of a boy and it made a good deal of difference in him to look pale i was sure he was going to be sick at lastalthough it was rather queer for him to knock under when the voyage was pretty nearly overand i began to laugh when he said to me in a nervous sort of way  i tell you what it is i believe that weve gone past the mouth of the savannah river according to my calculations said he pointing to a spot on his map which he held in his hand we must be down about here off the georgia coast  i have said that i began to laugh and now i kept on i just sat down and roared so that the people looked at me  you neednt laugh said rectus i believe its so  all right my boy said i but we wont tell the captain just lets wait and have the fun of seeing him turn around and go back  rectus didnt say anything to this but walked off with his map  illustration rectus showed me the map  now that boy was no fool i believe that he was beginning to feel like doing something and as he had never done anything before he didnt know how  about twelve oclock we reached the mouth of the savannah without turning back and sailed twenty miles up the river to the city  we were the first two persons off that vessel and we took a hack to the hotel that the purser had recommended to us and had the satisfaction of reaching it about ten minutes ahead of the people who came in the omnibus although i dont know that that was of much use to us as the clerk gave us top rooms any way  we went pretty nearly all over savannah that afternoon and the next day its a beautiful city there is a little public square at nearly every corner and one of the wide streets has a double row of big trees running right down the middle of it with grass under them and what seemed stranger yet the trees were all in leaf little children were playing on the grass and the weather was warm and splendid the gardens in front of the houses were full of roses and all sorts of flowers in blossom and rectus wanted to buy a straw hat and get his linen trousers out of his trunk  no sir said i im not going around with a fellow wearing a straw hat and linen breeches in january you dont see anybody else wearing them  no said he but its warm enough  you may think so i answered but i guess they know their own business best this is their coldest season and if they wore straw hats and linen clothes now what would they put on when the scorching hot weather comes  rectus didnt know and that matter was dropped there is a pretty park at the back of the town and we walked about it and sat under the trees and looked at the flowers and the fountain playing and enjoyed it ever so much if it had been summer and we had been at home we shouldnt have cared so much for these things but sitting under trees and lounging about over the green grass while our folks at home were up to their eyes or thereabouts in snow and ice delighted both of us especially rectus i never heard him talk so much  we reached savannah on tuesday and were to leave in the steamer for st augustine thursday afternoon thursday morning we went out to the cemetery of bonaventure one of the loveliest places in the whole world where there are long avenues of liveoaks that stretch from one side of the road to the other like great covered arbors and from every limb of every tree hang great streamers of gray moss four and five feet long it was just wonderful to look at the whole place seemed dripping with waving fringe rectus said it looked to him as if this was a graveyard for old men and that every old fellow had had to hang his beard on a tree before he went down into his grave  this was a curious idea for rectus to have and the colored man who was driving uswe went out in style in a barouche but i wouldnt do that kind of thing again without making a bargain beforehandturned around to look at him as if he thought he was a little crazy rectus was certainly in high spirits there was a sort of change coming over him his eyes had a sparkle in them that i never saw before no one could say that he didnt take interest in things now i think the warm weather had something to do with it  i tell you what it is gordon said hehe still called me gordon and i didnt insist on mr because i thought that on the whole perhaps it wouldnt doim waking up i feel as if i had been asleep all my life and was just beginning to open my eyes  a graveyard seemed a queer place to start out fresh in this way but it wasnt long before i found that if rectus hadnt really wakened up he could kick pretty hard in his sleep  nothing much happened on the trip down to st augustine for we travelled nearly all the way by night early the next morning we were lying off that old half spanish town wishing the tide would rise so that we could go in there is a bar between two islands that lie in front of the town and you have to go over that to get into the harbor we were on the tigris the bahama steamer that touched at st augustine on her way to nassau and she couldnt get over that bar until high tide we were dreadfully impatient for we could see the old town with its trees all green and bright and its low wide houses and a great lighthouse marked like a barbers pole or a stick of oldfashioned mintcandy and what was best of all a splendid old castle or fort built by the spaniards three hundred years ago we declared we would go there the moment we set foot on shore in fact we soon had about a dozen plans for seeing the town  if we had been the pilots we would have bumped that old steamer over the bar somehow or other long before the real pilot started her in but we had to wait when we did go in and steamed along in front of the old fort we could see that it was gray and crumbling and mosscovered in places and it was just like an oilpainting the whole town in fact was like an oilpainting to us  the moment the stairs were put down we scuffled ashore and left the steamer to go on to the bahamas whenever she felt like it we gave our valises and trunkchecks to a negro man with a wagon and told him to take the baggage to a hotel that we could see from the wharf and then we started off for the fort but on my way along the wharf i made up my mind that as the fort had been there for three hundred years it would probably stand a while longer and that we had better go along with our baggage and see about getting a place to live in for we were not going to be in any hurry to leave st augustine  we didnt go to any hotel at all i had a letter of introduction to a mr cholott and on our way up from the wharf i heard some one call out that name to a gentleman so i remembered my letter and went up and gave it to him he was a firstrate man and when we told him where we were going we had quite a talk and he said he would advise us to go to a boardinghouse it would be cheaper and if we were like most boys that he knew wed like it better he said that board could be had with several families that he knew and that some of the minorcans took boarders in the winter  of course rectus wanted to know right away what a minorcan was i didnt think it was exactly the place to ask questions which probably had long answers but mr cholott didnt seem to be in a hurry and he just started off and told us about the minorcans a chap called turnbull more than a hundred years ago brought over to florida a lot of the natives of the island of minorca in the mediterranean and began a colony but he was a mean sort of chap he didnt care for anything but making money out of the minorcans and it wasnt long before they found it out for he was really making slaves of them so they just rose up and rebelled and left old turnbull to run his colony by himself served him right too they started off on their own accounts and most of them came to this town where they settled and have had a good time ever since there are a great many of them here now descendants of the original minorcans and they keep pretty much together and keep their old name too they look a good deal like spaniards mr cholott said and many of them are very excellent people  rectus took the greatest interest in these minorcans but we didnt take board with any of them we went to the house of a lady who was a friend of mr cholott and she gave us a splendid room that looked right out over the harbor we could see the islands and the lighthouse and the bar with the surf outside and even get a glimpse of the ocean we saw the tigris going out over the bar the captain wanted to get out on the same tide he came in on and he did not lose any time as soon as she got fairly out to sea we hurried down to go to the fort but first rectus said we ought to go and buy straw hats there were lots of men with straw hats in st augustine this was true for it was just as warm here as we have it in june and we started off to look for a strawhat store  we found that we were in one of the queerest towns in the world rectus said it was all backstreets and it looked something that way the streets were very narrow and none of them had any pavement but sand and powdered shell and very few had any sidewalks but they didnt seem to be needed many of the houses had balconies on the second story which reached toward each other from both sides of the street and this gave the town a sociable appearance there were lots of shops and most of them sold seabeans there were other things like alligators teeth and shells and curiosities but the great trade of the town seemed to be in seabeansa rectus and i each bought one for our watchchains  i think we tried on every straw hat in town and we bought a couple in a little house where two or three young women were making them rectus asked me in a low voice if i didnt think one of the young women was a mohican i hushed him up for it was none of his business if she was i had a good deal of trouble in making rectus say minorcan whenever we had met a darkhaired person he had said to me do you think that is a mohican it was a part of his old school disposition to get things wrong in this way but he never got angry when i corrected him his temper was perfect  i bought a commonsized hat but rectus bought one that spread out far and wide it made him look like a japanese umbrella we stuffed our felt hats into our pockets and started for the fort but i looked at my watch and found it was suppertime i had suspected it when i came out of the hatshop the seatrip and fine air here had given us tremendous appetites which our walk had sharpened  so we turned back at once and hurried home agreeing to begin square on the fort the next day  footnotes  a seabeans are seeds of a west indian tree they are of different colors very hard and capable of being handsomely polished they are called seabeans because great numbers of them drift up on the florida and adjacent coasts     chapter iv  to the rescue   the next morning i was awakened by rectus coming into the room  hello said i where have you been i didnt hear you get up  i called you once or twice said rectus but you were sleeping so soundly i thought id let you alone i knew youd lost some sleep by being sick on the steamer  that was only the first night i exclaimed ive made up that long ago but what got you up so early  i went out to take a warm saltwater bath before breakfast answered rectus theres an eightcornered bathhouse right out here almost under the window where you can have your seawater warm if you like it  do they pump it from the tropics i asked as i got up and began to dress  no they heat it in the bathhouse i had a firstrate bath and i saw a minorcan  you dont say so i cried what was he like had he horns and how did you know what he was  i asked him said rectus  asked him i exclaimed you dont mean to say that you got up early and went around asking people if they were mohicans  minorcans i said  well its bad enough even if you got the name right did you ask the man plump to his face  yes but he first asked me what i was he was an oldish man and i met him just as i was coming out of the bathhouse he had a basket of clams on his arm and i asked him where he caught them that made him laugh and he said he dug them out of the sand under the wharf then he asked me if my name was cisneros and when i told him it was not he said that i looked like a spaniard and he thought that that might be my name and so as he had asked me about myself i asked him if he was a minorcan and he said yes  and what then i asked  nothing said rectus he went on with his clams and i came home  you didnt seem to make much out of him after all said i i dont wonder he thought you were a spaniard with that hat i told you youd make a show of yourself but what are you going to do with your minorcans rectus when you catch them  he laughed but didnt mention his plans  i didnt know how you got clams he said i thought you caught them some way it would never have entered my head to dig for them  theres lots to learn in this town about fish and ever so many other things besides and i tell you what it is rectus as soon as we get through with the fortand i dont know how long that will take us for i heard on the steamer that it had underground dungeonswell go off on a firstclass exploring expedition  that suited rectus exactly  after breakfast we started for the fort it is just outside of the town and you can walk all the way on the seawall which is about a yard wide on topjust a little too wide for one fellow but not quite wide enough for two  the united states government holds the fort now of course and calls it fort marion but the old spanish name was san marco and we disdained to call it anything else when we went over the drawbridge and across the moat we saw the arms of spain on a shield over the great gate of the fort we walked right in into a wide hall with dark doorways on each side and then out into a great inclosed space like a paradeground in the centre of the fort and here we saw a whole crowd of indians we didnt expect to find indians here and we were very much surprised they did not wear indian clothes but were dressed in united states military uniform they didnt look like anything but indians though for all that i asked one of them if he belonged here and he smiled and said how and held out his hand we both shook it but could make nothing out of him a good many of them now came up and said how to us and shook hands and we soon found that this meant how d ye do and was about all they knew of english  illustration how  we were lucky enough before we got through shaking hands with our new friends to see mr cholott coming toward us and he immediately took us in charge and seemed to be glad to have a job of the kind there was nothing about the fort that he didnt know he told us that the indians were prisoners taken in the far west by united states troops and that some of them were the worst indians in the whole country they were safe enough now though and were held here as hostages some were chiefs and they were all noted mensome as murderers and others in less important ways they had been here for some years and a few of them could speak a little english  he then took us all over the fortup an inclined plane to the top of the ramparts and into the indian barracks on one of the wide walls where we saw a lot of cheyennes and kiowas and indians from other tribes sitting around and making bows and arrows and polishing seabeans to sell to visitors at each corner of the fort was a lookout towera little box of a place stuck out from the top of the wall with loopholes and a long narrow passage leading to it with a high wall on each side to protect from bullets and arrows the man who went to look out one of the towers had been knocked off probably by a cannonball these towers and slim little passages took our fancy greatly then mr cholott took us downstairs to see the dungeons he got the key and gave it to a big old indian named red horse who went ahead with a lighted kerosenelamp  we first saw the dungeon where the indian chief osceola was shut up during the seminole war it was a dreary place there was another chief wild cat who was imprisoned with osceola and one night osceola boosted him to a high window where he squeezed through the bars and got away if osceola had had any one to give him a lift i suppose he would have been off too rectus and i wondered how the two indians managed this little question of who should be hoisted perhaps they tossed up or perhaps wild cat was the lighter of the two the worst dungeon though was a place that was discovered by accident about thirty years ago there was nothing there when we went in but when it was first found a chained skeleton was lying on the floor through a hole in the wall we crept into another dungeon worse yet in which two iron cages were found hung to the wall with skeletons in them it seemed like being in some other country to stand in this dark little dungeon and hear these dreadful stories while a big indian stood grinning by holding a kerosenelamp  mr cholott told us that one of the cages and the bones could now be seen in washington  after mr cholott went home we tramped all over the fort again by ourselves and that afternoon we sat on the outer wall that runs along the harborfront of the fort and watched the sailboats and the fishermen in their dugouts there were a couple of sharks swimming up and down in front of the town and every now and then they would come up and show themselves they were the first sharks we had ever seen  rectus was worked up about the indians we had been told that while a great many of the chiefs and braves imprisoned here were men known to have committed crimes still there were others who had done nothing wrong and had been captured and brought here as prisoners simply because in this way the government would have a good hold on their tribes  rectus thought this was the worst kind of injustice and i agreed with him although i didnt see what we were going to do about it  on our way home we met rectuss minorcan he was a queer old fellow  hello said he when he saw rectus have you been out catching clams  we stopped and talked a little while about the sharks and then the old man asked rectus why he wanted to know that morning whether he was a minorcan or not  i just wanted to see one said rectus as if he had been talking of kangaroos or giraffes ive been thinking a good deal about them and their bold escape from slavery and their  slavery sung out the old man we were never slaves what do you mean by that do you take us for niggers  he was pretty mad and i dont wonder if that was the way he understood rectus for he was just as much a white man as either of us  oh no said rectus but ive heard all about you and that tyrant turnbull and the way you cast off his yoke i mean your fathers of course  i reckon youve heard a little too much young man said the minorcan somebodys been stuffin you youd better get a hook and line and go out to catch clams  why you dont understand me cried rectus i honor you for it  the old man looked at him and then at me and then he laughed all right bub said he if ever you want to hire a boat ive got one my name is menendez just ask for my boat at the clubhouse wharf and then he went on  thats all you get for your sympathy with oppressed people said rectus they call you bub  well that old fellow isnt oppressed i said and if any of his ancestors were i dont suppose he cares about remembering it we ought to hire his boat some time  that evening we took a walk along the seawall it was a beautiful starlight night and a great many people were walking about when we got down near the fortwhich looked bigger and grayer than ever by the starlightrectus said he would like to get inside of it by night and i agreed that it would be a good thing to do so we went over the drawbridge this place has a drawbridge and portcullises and barbicans and demilunes and a moat just as if it were a castle or a fort of some old country in europebut the big gate was shut we didnt care to knock for all was dark and we came away rectus proposed that we should reconnoitre the place and i agreed although in reality there wasnt anything to reconnoitre we went down into the moat which was perfectly dry and very wide and walked all around the fort  we examined the walls which were pretty jagged and rough in some places and we both agreed that if we had to do it we believed we could climb to the top  as we walked home rectus proposed that we should try to climb in some night  whats the good i asked  why it would be a splendid thing said he to scale the walls of an old middleage fort like that lets try it anyway  i couldnt help thinking that it would be rather a fine thing to do but it did seem rather foolish to risk our necks to get over the walls at night when we could walk in whenever we pleased all day  but it was of no use to say anything like that to rectus he was full of the idea of scaling the walls and i found that when the boy did get worked up to anything he could talk firstrate and before we went to sleep i got the notion of it too and we made up our minds that we would try it  the next day we walked around the walls two or three times and found a place where we thought we could get up if we had a rope fastened to the top of the wall when general oglethorpe bombarded the fortat the time the spaniards held ithe made a good many dents in the wall and these would help us i did climb up a few feet but we saw that it would never do to try to get all the way up without a rope  how to fasten the rope on the top of the wall was the next question we went in the fort and found that if we could get a stout grapnel over the wall it would probably catch on the inside of the coping and give us a good enough hold there is a wide walk on top with a low wall on the outside just high enough to shelter cannon and to enable the garrison to dodge musketry and arrows  we had a good deal of trouble finding a rope but we bought one at last which was stout enoughthe man asked us if we were going to fish for sharks and didnt seem to believe us when we said noand we took it to our room and made knots in it about a foot apart the fort walls are about twenty feet high and we made the rope plenty long enough with something to spare we didnt have much trouble to find a grapnel we bought a small one but it was strong enough we talked the matter over a great deal and went to the fort several times making examinations and measuring the height of the wall from the top with a spool of cotton  it was two or three days before we got everything ready and in our trips to the fort we saw a good deal of the indians we often met them in the town too for they were frequently allowed to go out and walk about by themselves there was no danger i suppose of their trying to run away for they were several thousand miles from their homes and they probably would not care to run to any other place with no larger stock of the english language than one word how some of them however could talk a little english there was one big fellowhe was probably the largest of them allwho was called maidens heart i couldnt see how his name fitted for he looked like an outandout savage and generally wore a grin that seemed wicked enough to frighten settlers out of his part of the country but he may have had a tender spot somewhere which entitled him to his name and he was certainly very willing to talk to us to the extent of his ability which was not very great we managed however to have some interesting though rather choppy conversations  there was another fellow a young chief called crowded owl that we liked better than any of the others although we couldnt talk to him at all he was not much older than i was and so seemed to take to us he would walk all around with us and point out things we had bought some seabeans of him and it may be that he hoped to sell us some more at any rate he was very friendly  we met mr cholott several times and he told us of some good places to go to and said hed take us out fishing before long but we were in no hurry for any expedition until we had carried out our little plan of surprising the fort i gave the greater part of our money however to mr cholott to lock up in his safe i didnt like old mr colberts plan of going about with your capital pinned to your pockets it might do while we were travelling but i would rather have had it in drafts or something else not easily lost  we had a good many discussions about our grapnel we did not know whether there was a sentinel on duty in the fort at night or not but supposed there was and if so he would be likely to hear the grapnel when we threw it up and it hit the stones we thought we could get over this difficulty by wrapping the grapnel in cotton wool this would deaden the sound when it struck but would not prevent the points of the hooks from holding to the inner edge of the wall everything now seemed all right except that we had no object in view after we got over the wall i always like to have some reason for doing a thing especially when its pretty hard to do i said this to rectus and he agreed with me  what i would like to do said he would be to benefit the innocent indian prisoners  i dont know what we can do for them said i we cant let them out and theyd all go back again if we did  no we cant do that said he but we ought to do something ive been around looking at them all carefully and i feel sure that there are at least forty men among those indians who havent done a thing to warrant shutting them up  why how do you know i exclaimed  i judge from their faces said rectus  of course this made me laugh but he didnt care  ill tell you what we could do said he we could enter a protest that might be heard of and do some good we could take a pot of black paint and a brush with us and paint on one of the doors that open into the inner squarewhere everybody could see itsomething like this let the righteous indian go free that would create talk and something might be done  whod do it said i the captain in command couldnt he has no power to let any of them go free  well we might address the notice to the president of the united statesin big black letters they could not conceal such a thing  well now look here rectus said i this thing is going to cost too much money that rope was expensive and the grapnel cost a good deal more than we thought it would and now you want a big pot of black paint we mustnt spend our money too fast and if weve got to economize lets begin on black paint you can write your proclamation on paper and stick it on the door with tacks they could send that easier to the president than they could send a whole door  you may make as much fun as you please said rectus but im going to write it out now  and so he did in big letters on half a sheet of foolscap     chapter v  storming san marco   we started out on our storming expedition on a tuesday night about nine oclock we had a latchkey so we could come home when we pleased rectus carried the rope and i had the grapnel wrapped in its cotton wool we put newspapers around these things and made pretty respectable packages of them we did not go down the seawall but walked around through some of the inner streets it seemed to us like a curious expedition we were not going to do anything wrong but we had no idea what the united states government would think about it we came down to the fort on its landward side but our attack was to be made upon the waterfront and so we went around that way on the side farthest from the town there were several people about yet and we had to wait we dropped our packages into the moat and walked about on the waterbattery which is between the harbor and the moat and is used as a sort of pleasureground by the people of the town it was a pretty dark night although the stars were out and the last of the promenaders soon went home and then after giving them about ten minutes to get entirely out of sight and hearing we jumped down into the moat which is only five or six feet below the waterbattery and taking our packages went over to that part of the wall which we had fixed upon for our assault  we fastened the rope to the grapnel and then rectus stood back while i made ready for the throw it was a pretty big throw almost straight up in the air but i was strong and was used to pitching and all that sort of thing i coiled the rope on the ground took the loose end of it firmly in my left hand and then letting the grapnel hang from my right hand until it nearly touched the ground i swung it round and round perpendicularly and when it had gone round three or four times i gave it a tremendous hurl upward  it rose beautifully like a rocket and fell inside of the ramparts making only a little thud of a sound  firstrate said rectus softly and i felt pretty proud myself  i pulled on the rope and found the grapnel had caught i hung with my whole weight on it but it held splendidly  now then said i to rectus you can climb up go slowly and be very careful theres no hurry and mind you take a good hold when you get to the top  we had arranged that rectus was to go first this did not look very brave on my part but i felt that i wanted to be under him while he was climbing so that i could break his fall if he should slip down it would not be exactly a perpendicular fall for the wall slanted a little but it would be bad enough however i had climbed up worse places than that and rectus was very nimble so i felt there was no great danger  up he went hand over hand and putting his toes into nicks every now and then thereby helping himself very much he took it slowly and easily and i felt sure he would be all right as i looked at him climbing up there in the darkness while i was standing below holding the rope so that it should not swing i could not help thinking that i was a pretty curious kind of a tutor for a boy however i was taking all the care of him that i could and if he came down hed probably hurt me worse than he would hurt himself besides i had no reason to suppose that old mr colbert objected to a little fun then i began to think of mrs colbert and while i was thinking of her and looking up at rectus i was amazed to see him going up quite rapidly while the end of the rope slipped through my fingers up he went and when i ran back i could see a dark figure on the wall above him somebody was pulling him up  in a very few moments he disappeared over the top rope and all  now i was truly frightened what might happen to the boy  i was about to shout but on second thoughts decided to keep quiet yet i instantly made up my mind that if i didnt see or hear from him pretty soon i would run around to the gate and bang up the people inside however it was not necessary for me to trouble myself for in a minute the rope came down again and i took hold of it i pulled on it and found it all firm and then i went up i climbed up pretty fast and two or three times i felt a tug as if somebody above was trying to pull me up but it was of no use for i was a great deal stouter and heavier than rectus who was a light slim boy but as i neared the top a hand came down and clutched me by the collar and some one with a powerful arm and grip helped me over the top of the wall there stood rectus all right and the fellow who had helped us up was the big indian maidens heart  i looked at rectus and he whispered  he says theres a sentinel down there in the square  at this maidens heart bobbed his head two or three times and motioning to us to crouch down he crept quietly over to the inner wall of the ramparts and looked down  what shall we say we came for i whispered quickly  i dont know said rectus  well we must think of something i said or we shall look like fools  but before he had time to think maidens heart crept back he put his finger on his lips and beckoning us to follow him he led the way to a corner of the fort near one of the lookout towers we followed as quietly as we could and then we all three slipped into the narrow entrance to the tower the indian motioning us to go first when we two stood inside of the little round tower old maidens heart planted himself before us in the passage and waited to hear what we had to say  but we couldnt think of anything to say directly however i thought i must do something so i whispered to the indian  does the sentry ever come up here  he seemed to catch my meaning  i go watch he said come back tell you and off he stole making no more noise than a cat  bother on him said rectus if id known he was up here i would never have come  i reckon not said i but now that we have come what are we going to do or say that fellow evidently thinks we have some big project on hand and hes ready to help us we must be careful or hell rush down and murder the sentinel  im sure i dont know what to say to him said rectus we ought to have thought of this before i suppose it would be of no use to mention my poster to him  no indeed said i hed never understand that and besides theres a man down there lets peep out and see what hes doing  so we crept to the entrance of the passage and saw maidens heart crouched near the top of the inclined plane which serves as a stairway from the square to the ramparts and looking over the low wall evidently watching the sentry  ill tell you what lets do said rectus lets make a rush for our rope and get out of this  no sir said i wed break our necks if we tried to hurry down that rope dont think of anything of that kind and besides we couldnt both get down before hed see us  in a few minutes maidens heart crept quickly back to us and seemed surprised that we had left our hidingplace he motioned us farther back into the passage and slipped in himself  we did not have time to ask any questions before we heard the sentry coming up the stairway which was near our corner when he reached the top he walked away from us over toward the indian barracks which were on the ramparts at the other end of the fort as soon as he reached the barracks maidens heart took me by the arm and rectus by the collar and hurried us to the stairway and then down as fast as we could go he made no noise himself but rectus and i clumped a good deal we had to wear our shoes for the place was paved with rough concrete and oystershells  the sentry evidently heard the clumping for he came running down after us and caught up to us almost as soon as we reached the square  eugh said he for he was an indian and he ran in front of us and held his musket horizontally before us of course we stopped and then as there was nothing else that seemed proper to do we held out our hands and said how the sentinel took his gun in his left hand and shook hands with us then maidens heart who probably remembered that he had omitted this ceremony also shook hands with us and said how  the two indians now began to jabber to each other in a low voice but we could not of course make out what they said and i dont think they were able to imagine what we intended to do we were standing near the inner door of the great entranceway and into this they now marched us there was a lamp burning on a table  said rectus i guess theyre going to put us out of the front door but he was mistaken they walked us into a dark room on one side of the hall and maidens heart said to us stay here him mad i come back keep still and then he went out probably to discuss with the sentinel the nature of our conspiracy it was very dark in this room and at first we couldnt see anything at all but we soon found from the smell of the bread that we were in the kitchen or bakery we had been here before and had seen the headcook a ferocious indian squaw who had been taken in the act of butchering a poor emigrant woman on the plains she always seemed sullen and savage and never said a word to anybody we hoped she wasnt in here now  i didnt know they had indian sentinels said rectus that seems a little curious to me i suppose they set the innocent ones to watch the guilty  i dont believe that would work said i for the innocent chaps would want to get away just as much as the others i guess they make em take turns to stand guard there has to be a sentinel in a fort you know and i suppose these fellows are learning the business  we didnt settle this question nor the more important one of our reason for this visit for at this moment maidens heart came back carrying the lamp he looked at us in a curious way and then he said  what you want  i couldnt think of any good answer to this question but rectus whispered to me  got any money with you  yes said i  lets buy some seabeans said rectus  all right i answered  seabeans said maidens heart who had caught the word you want seabeans  yes said rectus if you have any good ones  at this the indian conducted us into the hall put the lamp on the table and took three or four seabeans from his pocket they were very nice ones and beautifully polished  good said i well take these how much maidens heart  fifty cents said the indian  for all i asked  no no for one four bean two dollar  we both exclaimed at this for it was double the regular price of the beans  all right said maidens heart twentyfive cents daytime fifty cents night  we looked at each other and concluded to pay the price and depart i gave him two dollars and asked him to open the gate and let us out  illustration another bean  he grinned  no no we got no key captain got key come up wall go down wall  at this we walked out into the square and were about to ascend the inclined plane when the sentinel came up and stopped us thereupon a low conversation ensued between him and maidens heart at the end of which the sentry put his hand into his pocket and pulled out three beans which he held out to us i did not hesitate but gave him a dollar and a half for them he took the money and let us pass onmaidens heart at my side  you want more bean said he  oh no i answered no indeed said rectus  when we reached the place where we had left our apparatus i swung the rope over the wall and hooking the grapnel firmly on the inside prepared to go down for as before i wished to be under rectus if he should slip but maidens heart put his hand on my shoulder  hold up he said i got nother bean buy this  dont want it said i  yes yes said maidens heart and he coolly unhooked the grapnel from the wall  i saw that it was of no use to contend with a big fellow like that as strong as two common men and i bought the bean  i took the grapnel from maidens heart who seemed to give it up reluctantly and as i hooked it on the wall i felt a hand upon my shoulder i looked around and saw the sentinel he held out to me another bean it was too dark to see the quality of it but i thought it was very small however i bought it one of these fellows must be treated as well as the other  maidens heart and the sentry were now feeling nervously in their pockets  i shook my head vigorously and saying no more no more threw myself over the wall and seized the rope rectus holding the grapnel in its place as i did so as i let myself down from knot to knot a thought crossed my mind how are we going to get that grapnel after we both are down  it was a frightening thought if the two indians should choose they could keep the rope and grapnel and before morning the whole posse of redskins might be off and away i did not think about their being so far from home and all that i only thought that theyd be glad to get out and that they would all come down our rope  these reflections which ran through my mind in no time at all were interrupted by rectus who called down from the top of the wall in a voice that was a little too loud to be prudent  hurry i think hes found another bean  i was on the ground in a few moments and then rectus came down i called to him to come slowly and be very careful but i cant tell how relieved i was when i saw him fairly over the wall and on his way down  when we both stood on the ground i took hold of the rope and shook it i am not generally nervous but i was a little nervous then i did not shake the grapnel loose then i let the rope go slack for a foot or two and gave it a big sweep to one side to my great delight over came the grapnel nearly falling on our heads i think i saw maidens heart make a grab at it as it came over but i am not sure however he poked his head over the wall and said  goodbye come again  we answered goodbye but didnt say anything about coming again  as we hurried along homeward rectus said  if one of those indians had kept us up there while the other one ran into the barracks and got a fresh stock of seabeans they would have just bankrupted us  no they wouldnt i said for i hadnt much more change with me and if i had had it i wouldnt have given them any more id have called up the captain first the thing was getting too expensive  well im glad im out of it said rectus and i dont believe much in any of those indians being very innocent i thought maidens heart was one of the best of them but hes a regular rascal he knew we wanted to back out of that affair and he just fleeced us  i believe he would rather have had our scalps than our money if he had had us out in his country i said  thats so said rectus a funny kind of a maidens heart hes got  we were both out of conceit with the noble red man rectus took his proclamation out of his pocket as we walked along the seawall and tearing it into little pieces threw it into the water when we reached the steamship wharf we walked out to the end of it to get rid of the rope and grapnel i whirled the grapnel round and round and let the whole thing fly far out into the harbor it was a sheer waste of a good strong rope but we should have had a dreary time getting the knots out of it  after we got home i settled up our accounts and charged half the seabeans to rectus and half to myself     chapter vi  the girl on the beach   i was not very well satisfied with our trip over the walls of san marco in the first place when the seabeans the rope and the grapnel were all considered it was a little too costly in the second place i was not sure that i had been carrying out my contract with mr colbert in exactly the right spirit for although he had said nothing about my duties i knew that he expected me to take care of his son and paid me for that and i felt pretty sure that helping a fellow climb up a knotted rope into an old fort by night was not the best way of taking care of him the third thing that troubled me in regard to this matter was the feeling i had that rectus had led me into it that he had been the leader and not i now i did not intend that anything of that kind should happen again i did not come out on this expedition to follow rectus around indeed it was to be quite the other way but to tell the truth i had not imagined that he would ever try to make people follow him he never showed at school that such a thing was in him so for these three reasons i determined that there were to be no more scrapes of that sort which generally came to nothing after all  for the next two or three days we roved around the old town and into two or three orangegroves and went out sailing with mr cholott who owned a nice little yacht or sailboat as we should call it up north  the sailing here is just splendid and one morning we thought wed hire a boat for ourselves and go out fishing somewhere so we went down to the yachtclub wharf to see about the boat that belonged to old menendezrectuss minorcan there were lots of sailboats there as well as rowboats but we hunted up the craft we were after and by good luck found menendez in her bailing her out  so we engaged her and he said hed take us over to the north beach to fish for bass that suited usany beach and any kind of fishprovided hed hurry up and get his boat ready while he was scooping away and we were standing on the wharf watching him along came crowded owl the young indian we had always likedthat is ever since we had known any of them he came up said how and shook hands and then pulled out some seabeans the sight of these things seemed to make me sick and as for rectus he sung out  do wan em so suddenly that it seemed like one word and a pretty savage one at that  crowded owl looked at me but i shook my head and said no no no then he drew himself up and just stood there he seemed struck dumb but that didnt matter as he couldnt talk to us anyway but he didnt go away when we walked farther up the wharf he followed us and again offered us some beans i began to get angry and said no pretty violently at this he left us but as we turned at the end of the wharf we saw him near the clubhouse standing and talking with maidens heart  i think its a shame to let those indians wander about here in that way said rectus they ought to be kept within bounds  i couldnt help laughing at this change of tune but said that i supposed only a few of them got leave of absence at a time  well said rectus there are some of them that ought never to come out  hello said old menendez sticking his head up above the edge of the wharf were ready now git aboard  and so we scrambled down into the sailboat and menendez pushed off while the two indians stood and watched us as we slowly moved away  when we got fairly out our sail filled and we went scudding away on a good wind then said old menendez as he sat at the tiller  what were you hollerin at them injuns about  i didnt know that we were hollerin said i but they were bothering us to buy their seabeans  thats curious he said they aint much given to that sort of thing but theres no tellin nothin about an injun if i had my way id hang every one of em  rather a bloodthirsty sentiment said i perhaps some of them dont deserve hanging  well ive never seen one o that kind said he and ive seen lots of injuns i was in the seminole war in this state and was fightin injuns from the beginnin to the end of it and i know all about how to treat the rascals you must hang em or shoot em as soon as you get hold of em  this aroused all the old sympathy for the oppressed red man that dwelt in the heart of young rectus and he exclaimed  that would be murder there are always two kinds of every sort of peopleall are not bad it is wrong to condemn a whole division of the human race that way  youre right about there bein two kinds of injuns said the old fellow theres bad ones and theres wuss ones i know what ive seen for myself id hang em all  we debated this matter some time longer but we could make no impression on the old minorcan for some reason or other probably on account of his sufferings or hardships in the war he was extremely bitter against all indians you cant tell me he replied to all of our arguments and i think he completely destroyed all the sympathy which rectus had had for the once downtrodden and deceived minorcans by this animosity toward members of another race who were yet in captivity and bondage to be sure there was a good deal of difference in the two cases but rectus wasnt in the habit of turning up every question to look at the bottom of it  the north beach is the seaward side of one of the islands that enclose the harbor or the matanzas river as it is called we landed on the inland side and then walked over to the beach which is very wide and smooth here we set to work to fish old menendez baited our lines and told us what to do it was new sport to us  first we took off our shoes and stockings and rolled up our trousers so as to wade out in the shallow water we each had a long line one end of which we tied around our waists menendez had his tied to a buttonhole of his coat but he thought he had better make our lines very safe as they belonged to him there was a big hook and a heavy lead to the other end of the line with a piece of fish for bait and we swung the lead around our heads and threw it out into the surf as far as we could i thought i was pretty good on the throw but i couldnt begin to send my line out as far as menendez threw his as for rectus he didnt pretend to do much in the throwing business he whirled his line around in such a curious way that i was very much afraid he would hook himself in the ear but menendez put his line out for him he didnt want me to do it  then we stood there in the sand with the water nearly up to our knees every time the waves came in and waited for a bite there wasnt much biting menendez said that the tide was too low but ive noticed that something is always too something every time any one takes me out fishing so i didnt mind that  menendez did hook one fellow i think for he gave a tremendous jerk at his line and began to skip inshore as if he were but ten years old but it was of no use the fish changed his mind  then we stood and waited a while longer until all of a sudden rectus made a skip but he went the wrong way instead of skipping out of the water he skipped in he went in so far that he got his trousers dripping wet  hello i shouted whats up  he didnt say anything but began to pull back and dig his heels into the sand old menendez and i saw at the same moment what was the matter and we made a rush for him i was nearest and got there first i seized rectus by the shoulder and pulled him back a little  wheww said he how this twine cuts  then i took hold of the line in front of him and there was no mistaking the facthe had a big fish on the other end of it  run out cried menendez who thought there was no good of three fellows hauling on the line and out we ran  when we had gone up the beach a good way i looked back and saw a rousing big fish flopping about furiously in the shallow water  go on shouted menendez and we ran on until we had pulled it high and dry up on the sand  then menendez fell afoul of it to take out the hook and we hurried back to see it it was a whopping big bass and by the powerful way it threw itself around on the sand i didnt wonder that rectus ran into the water when he got the first jerk  now this was something like sport and we all felt encouraged and went to work again with a will only menendez untied the line from rectuss waist and fastened it to his buttonhole  it may pull out he said but on the whole its better to lose a fishinline than a boy  we fished quietly and steadily for some time but got no more bites when suddenly i heard some one say behind me  they dont ever pull in  i turned around and it was a girl she was standing there with a gentlemanher father i soon found outand i dont know how long they had been watching us she was about thirteen years old and came over with her father in a sailboat i remembered seeing them cruising around as we were sailing over  they havent got bites said her father thats the reason they dont pull in  it was very disagreeable to me and i know it was even more so to rectus to stand here and have those strangers watch us fishing if we had not been barefooted and barelegged we should not have minded it so much as for the old minorcan i dont suppose he cared at all i began to think it was time to stop  as the tides getting lower and lower i said to menendez i suppose our chances are getting less and less  yes said he i reckon wed better shut up shop before long  oh cried out the girl just look at that fish father father just look at it did any of you catch it i didnt see it till this minute i thought you hadnt caught any if i only had a fishingline now i would like to catch just one fish oh father why didnt you bring a fishingline  i didnt think of it my dear said he indeed i didnt know there were any fish here  old menendez turned around and grinned at this and i thought there was a good chance to stop fishing so i offered to let the girl try my line for a while if she wanted to  it was certain enough that she wanted to for she was going to run right into the water to get it but i came out and as her father said she might fish if she didnt have to walk into the water old menendez took a spare piece of line from his pocket and tied it on to the end of mine and he put on some fresh bait and gave it a tremendous send out into the surf then he put the other end around the girl and tied it i suppose he thought that it didnt matter if a girl should be lost but he may have considered that her father was there to seize her if she got jerked in  she took hold of the line and stood on the edge of the dry sand ready to pull in the biggest kind of a fish that might come along i put on my shoes and stockings and rectus his hed had enough glory for one day old menendez wound up his line too but that girl saw nothing of all this she just kept her eyes and her whole mind centred on her line at first she talked right straight ahead asking what she should do when it bit how big we thought it would be why we didnt have a cork and fifty other things but all without turning her head to the right or the left then said her father  my dear you mustnt talk you will frighten the fish when persons fish they always keep perfectly quiet you never heard me talking while i was fishing i fish a good deal when i am at home said he turning to us and i always remain perfectly quiet  menendez laughed a little at this and said that he didnt believe the fish out there in the surf would mind a little quiet chat but the gentleman said that he had always found it best to be just as still as possible the girl now shut her mouth tight and held herself more ready if possible than ever and i believe that if she had got a bite she would have jerked the fishs head off we all stood around her and her father watched her as earnestly as if she was about to graduate at a normal school  we stood and waited and waited and she didnt move and neither did the line menendez now said he thought she might as well give it up the tide was too low and it was pretty near dinnertime and besides this there was a shower coming on  oh no said she not just yet i feel sure ill get a bite in a minute or two now just wait a little longer  and so it went on every few minutes until we had waited about half an hour and then menendez said he must go but if the gentleman wanted to buy the line and stay there until the tide came in again hed sell it to him at this the girls father told her that she must stop and so she very dolefully let menendez untie the line  its too bad she said almost with tears in her eyes if they had only waited a few minutes longer and then she ran up to rectus and me and said  when are you coming out here again do you think you will come tomorrow or next day  i dont know said i we havent settled our plans for tomorrow  oh father father she cried perhaps they will come out here tomorrow and you must get me a fishingline and we will come and fish all day  we didnt stay to hear what her father said but posted off to our boat for we were all beginning to feel pretty hungry we took rectuss fish along to give to our landlady the gentleman and the girl came close after us as if they were afraid to be left alone on the island their boat was hauled up near ours and we set off at pretty much the same time  we went ahead a little and menendez turned around and called out to the gentleman that hed better follow us for there were some bad shoals in this part of the harbor and the tide was pretty low  all right my hearty called out the gentleman this isnt the first time ive sailed in this harbor i guess i know where the shoals are and just at that minute he ran his boat hard and fast on one of them  he jumped up and took an oar and pushed and pushed but it was of no goodhe was stuck fast by this time we had left him pretty far behind but we all had been watching and rectus asked if we couldnt go back and help him  well i spose so said menendez but its a shame to keep three decent people out of their dinner for the sake of a man like that who hasnt got sense enough to take good advice when its give to him  wed better go said i and menendez in no good humor put his boat about we found the other boat aground in the very worst way the old minorcan said that he could see that sandbar through the water and that they might as well have run up on dry land better for that matter because then we could have pushed her off  there aint nuthin to be done he said after we had worked at the thing for a while but to jist wait here till the tide turns its pretty near dead low now an youll float off in an hour or two  this was cold comfort for the gentleman especially as it was beginning to rain but he didnt seem a bit cast down he laughed and said  well i suppose it cant be helped but i am used to being out in all weathers i can wait just as well as not but i dont want my daughter here to get wet and she has no umbrella would you mind taking her on your boat when you get to the town she can run up to our hotel by herself she knows the way  of course we had no objection to this and the girl was helped aboard then we sailed off and the gentleman waved his hat to us if i had been in his place i dont think i should have felt much like waving my hat  illustration the gentleman waved his hat to us  menendez now said that he had an oilskin coat stowed away forward and i got it and put it around the girl she snuggled herself up in it as comfortably as she could and began to talk  the way of it was this she said father he said wed go out sailing and mother and i went with him and when we got down to the wharf there were a lot of boats but they all had men to them and so father he said he wanted to sail the boat himself and mother she said that if he did she wouldnt go but he said pooh he could do it as well as anybody and wasnt going to have any man so he got a boat without a man and mother she didnt want me to go but i went and he stuck fast coming back because he never will listen to anything anybody tells him as mother and i found out long ago and here we are almost at the wharf i didnt think we were anywhere near it  well you see sis sich a steady gale o talkin right behind the sail is bound to hurry the boat along and now spose you tell us your name said menendez  my names cornelia but father he calls me corny which mother hates to hear the very sound of said she and the rest of it is mary chipperton father he came down here because he had a weak lung and im sure i dont see what good its going to do him to sit out there in the rain well take a man next time and father and ill be sure to be here early tomorrow to go out fishing with you goodbye  and with this having mounted the steps to the pier off ran miss corny  i wouldnt like to be the ole man o that family said mr menendez  that night after we had gone to bed rectus began to talk we generally went to sleep in pretty short order but the moon did not shine in our windows now until quite late and so we noticed for the first time the curious way in which the lighthousewhich stood almost opposite on anastasia islandbrightened up the room every minute or two it is a revolving light and when the light got on the landward side it gave us a flash which produced a very queer effect on the furniture and on rectuss broad hat which hung on the wall right opposite the window it seemed exactly as if this hat was a sort of portable sun of a very mild power which warmed up every now and then and lighted the room  but rectus did not talk long about this  i think said he that we have had about enough of st augustine there are too many indians and girls here  and seabeans too perhaps said i but i dont think theres any reason for going so soon im going to settle those indians and youve only seen one girl and perhaps well never see her again  dont you believe that said rectus very solemnly and he turned over either to ponder on the matter or to go to sleep his remarks made me imagine that perhaps he was one of those fellows who soon get tired of a place and want to be moving on but that wasnt my way and i didnt intend to let him hurry me i think the indians worried him a good deal he was afraid they would keep on troubling us but as i had said i had made up my mind to settle the indians as for corny i know he hated her i dont believe he spoke a word to her all the time we were with her  the next morning we talked over the indian question and then went down to the fort we hadnt been there for three or four days but now we had decided not to stand nagging by a couple of redskinned savages but to go and see the captain and tell him all about it all except the proclamationrectus wouldnt agree to have that brought in at all mr cholott had introduced us to the captain and he was a firstrate fellow and when we told him how we had stormed his old fort he laughed and said he wondered we didnt break our necks and that the next time we did it hed put us in the guardhouse sure  that would be cheaper for you than buying so many beans he said  as to the two indians he told us he would see to it that they let us alone he didnt think that maidens heart would ever harm us for he was more of a blower than anything else but he said that crowded owl was really one of the worsttempered indians in the fort and he advised us to have nothing more to do with him in any way  all of this was very good of the captain and we were very glad we had gone to see him  i tell you what it is said rectus as we were coming away i dont believe that any of these indians are as innocent as they try to make out did you ever see such a rascally set of faces  somehow or other i seldom felt sorry when rectus changed his mind i thought indeed that he ought to change it as much as he could and yet as i have said he was a thoroughly good fellow the trouble with him was that he wasnt used to making up his mind about things and didnt make a very good beginning at it  the next day we set out to explore anastasia island right opposite the town it is a big island but we took our lunch and determined to do what we could we hired a boat and rowed over to the mouth of a creek in the island we went up this creek quite a long way and landed at a little pier where we made the boat fast the man who owned the boat told us just how to go we first made a flying call at the coquina quarries where they dig the curious stuff of which the town is built this is formed of small shells all conglomerated into one solid mass that becomes as hard as stone after it is exposed to the air it must have taken thousands of years for so many little shellfish to pile themselves up into a quarryingground we now went over to the lighthouse and climbed to the top of it where we had a view that made rectus feel even better than he felt in the cemetery at savannah  when we came down we started for the beach and stopped a little while at the old spanish lighthouse which looked more like a crackerbakery than anything else but i suppose it was good enough for all the ships the spaniards had to light up we would have cared more for the old lighthouse if it had not had an inscription on it that said it had been destroyed and rebuilt by some american after that we considered it merely in the light of a chromo  we had a good time on the island and stayed nearly all day toward the end of the afternoon we started back for the creek and our boat we had a long walk for we had been exploring the island pretty well and when at last we reached the creek we saw that our boat was gone  this was astounding we could not make out how the thing could have happened the boatman from whom we had hired it had said that it would be perfectly safe for us to leave the boat at the landing if we tied her up well and hid the oars i had tied her up very well and we had hidden the oars so carefully under some bushes that we found them there when we went to look for them  could the old thing have floated off of itself said rectus  that couldnt have happened i said i tied her hard and fast  but how could any one have taken her away without oars asked rectus  rectus said i dont let us have any more riddles some one may have cut a pole and poled her away up or down the creek or  ill tell you interrupted rectus crowded owl  i didnt feel much like laughing but i did laugh a little  yes i said he probably swam over with a pair of oars on purpose to steal our boat but whether he did it or not its very certain that somebody has taken the boat and there isnt any way that i see of getting off this place tonight therell be nobody going over so late in the afternoonexcept to be sure those men we saw at the other end of the island with a flatboat  but thats away over at the upper end of the island said rectus  thats not so very far said i i wonder if they have gone back yet if one of us could run over there and ask them to send a boatman from the town after us we might get back by suppertime  why not both of us asked rectus  one of us should stay here to see if our boat does come back it must have been some one from the island who took it because any one from the mainland would have brought his own boat  very well said rectus lets toss up to see who goes the winner stays  i pitched up a cent  heads said rectus  tails said i  tails it was and rectus started off like a good fellow  i sat down and waited i waited a long long time and then i got up and walked up and down in about an hour i began to get anxious it was more than time for rectus to return the walk to the end of the island and back was not much over a mileat least i supposed it was not could anything have happened to the boy it was not yet sunset and i couldnt imagine what there was to happen  after waiting about half an hour longer i heard a distant sound of oars i ran to the landing and looked down the creek a boat with a man in it was approaching when it came nearer i saw plainly that it was our boat when it had almost reached the landing the man turned around and i was very much surprised indeed to see that he was mr chipperton     chapter vii  mr chipperton   i took hold of the boat and pulled the bow up on the beach mr chipperton looked around at me  why how do you do said he  illustration why how do you do  for an instant i could not answer him i was so angry and then i said  what did you how did you come to take our boat away  your boat he exclaimed is this your boat i didnt know that but where is my boat did you see a sailboat leave here it is very strangeremarkably strange i dont know what to make of it  i know nothing about a sailboat said i if we had seen one leave here we should have gone home in her why did you take our boat  mr chipperton had now landed  i came over here he said with my wife and daughter we were in a sailboat with a man to manage it my wife would not come otherwise we came to see the lighthouse but i do not care for lighthousesi have seen a great many of them i am passionately fond of the water seeing a small boat here which no one was using i let the man conduct my wife and cornymy daughterup to the lighthouse while i took a little row i know the man he is very trustworthy he would let no harm come to them there was a pair of oars in the sailboat and i took them and rowed down the creek and then went along the river below the town and i assure you sir i went a great deal farther than i intended for the tide was with me but it wasnt with me coming back of course and i had a very hard time of it i thought i never should get back this boat of yours sir seems to be an uncommonly hard boat to row  against a strong tide i suppose it is said i but i wish you hadnt taken it here i have been waiting ever so long and my friend  oh im sorry too interrupted mr chipperton who had been looking about as if he expected to see his sailboat somewhere under the trees i cant imagine what could have become of my boat my wife and my child if i had staid here they could not have sailed away without my knowing it it would even have been better to go with them although as i said before i dont care for lighthouses  well said i not quite as civilly as i generally speak to people older than myself your boat has gone that is plain enough i suppose when your family came from the lighthouse they thought you had gone home and so went themselves  thats very likely said hevery likely indeed or it may be that corny wouldnt wait she is not good at waiting she persuaded her mother to sail away no doubt but now i suppose you will take me home in your boat and the sooner we get off the better for it is growing late  you neednt be in a hurry said i for i am not going off until my friend comes back you gave him a good long walk to the other end of the island  indeed said mr chipperton how was that  then i told him all about it  do you think that the flatboat is likely to be there yet he asked  its gone long ago said i and im afraid rectus has lost his way either going there or coming back  i said this as much to myself as to my companion for i had walked back a little to look up the path i could not see far for it was growing dark i was terribly worried about rectus and would have gone to look for him but i was afraid that if i left mr chipperton he would go off with the boat  directly mr chipperton set up a yell  hi hi hi he cried  i ran down to the pier and saw a rowboat approaching  hi cried mr chipperton come this way come here boat ahoy  were coming shouted a man from the boat ye neednt holler for us  and in a few more strokes the boat touched land there were two men in it  did you come for me cried mr chipperton  no said the man who had spoken we came for this other party but i reckon you can come along  for me said i who sent you  your pardner said the man he came over in a flatboat and he said you was stuck here for somebody had stole your boat and so he sent us for you  and hes over there is he said i  yes hes all right eatin his supper i reckon but isnt this here your boat  yes it is i said and im going home in it you can take the other man  and without saying another word i picked up my oars which i had brought from the bushes jumped into my boat and pushed off  i reckon youre a little riled aint ye said the man but i made him no answer and left him to explain to mr chipperton his remark about stealing the boat they set off soon after me and we had a race down the creek i was a little riled and i pulled so hard that the other boat did not catch up to me until we got out into the river then it passed me but it didnt get to town much before i did  the first person i met on the pier was rectus he had had his supper and had come down to watch for me i was so angry that i would not speak to him he kept by my side though as i walked up to the house excusing himself for going off and leaving me  you see it wasnt any use for me to take that long walk back there to the creek i told the men of the fix we were in and they said theyd send somebody for us but they thought id better come along with them as i was there  i had a great mind to say something here but i didnt  it wouldnt have done you any good for me to come back through the woods in the dark the boat wouldnt get over to you any faster you see if thered been any good at all in it i would have come backbut there wasnt  all this might have been very true but i remembered how i had sat and walked and thought and worried about rectus and his explanation did me no good  when i reached the house i found that our landlady who was one of the very best women in all florida had saved me a splendid supperhot and smoking i was hungry enough and i enjoyed this meal until there didnt seem to be a thing left i felt in a better humor then and i hunted up rectus and we talked along as if nothing had happened it wasnt easy to keep mad with rectus because he didnt get mad himself and besides he had a good deal of reason on his side  it was a lovely evening and pretty nearly all the people of the town were outofdoors rectus and i took a walk around the plazaa public square planted thick with liveoak and prideofindia trees and with a monument in the centre with a spanish inscription on it stating how the king of spain once gave a very satisfactory charter to the town rectus and i agreed however that we would rather have a prideofindia tree than a charter as far as we were concerned these trees have on them long bunches of blossoms which smell deliciously  now then said i i think its about time for us to be moving along im beginning to feel about that corny family as you do  oh i only objected to the girl said rectus in an offhand way  well i object to the father said i i think weve had enough anyway of fathers and daughters i hope the next couple we fall in with will be a mother and a son  whats the next place on the bill asked rectus  well said i we ought to take a trip up the oclawaha river thats one of the things to do it will take us two or three days and we can leave our baggage here and come back again then if we want to stay we can and if we dont we neednt  all right said rectus lets be off tomorrow  the next morning i went to buy the oclawaha tickets while rectus staid home to pack up our handbags and i believe to sew some buttons on his clothes he could sew buttons on so strongly that they would never come off again without bringing the piece out with them  the ticketoffice was in a small store where you could get any kind of alligator or seabean combination that the mind could dream of we had been in there before to look at the things i found i was in luck for the storekeeper told me that it was not often that people could get berths on the little oclawaha steamboats without engaging them some days ahead but he had a couple of staterooms left for the boat that left pilatka the next day i took one room as quick as lightning and i had just paid for the tickets when mr chipperton and corny walked in  how d ye do said he as cheerfully as if he had never gone off with another fellows boat buying tickets for the oclawaha  i had to say yes and then he wanted to know when we were going i wasnt very quick to answer but the storekeeper said  hes just taken the last room but one in the boat that leaves pilatka tomorrow morning  and when do you leave here to catch that boat said mr chipperton  this afternoonand stay all night at pilatka  oh father father cried corny who had been standing with her eyes and ears wide open all this time lets go lets go  i believe i will said mr chippertoni believe i will you say you have one more room all right ill take it this will be very pleasant indeed said he turning to me it will be quite a party its ever so much better to go to such places in a party weve been thinking of going for some time and im so glad i happened in here now goodbye well see you this afternoon at the dépôt  i didnt say anything about being particularly glad but just as i left the door corny ran out after me  do you think it would be any good to take a fishingline she cried  guess youd better i shouted back and then i ran home laughing  here are the tickets i cried out to rectus and weve got to be at the station by four oclock this afternoon theres no backing out now  who wants to back out said rectus looking up from his trunk into which he had been diving  cant say i answered but i know one person who wont back out  whos that  corny said i  rectus stood up  cor he exclaimed  ny said i and father and mother they took the only room leftengaged it while i was there  cant we sell our tickets asked rectus  dont know said i but whats the good whos going to be afraid of a girlor a whole family for that matter were in for it now  rectus didnt say anything but his expression saddened  we had studied out this trip the night before and knew just what we had to do we first went from st augustine on the seacoast to tocoi on the st johns river by a railroad fifteen miles long then we took a steamboat up the st johns to pilatka and the next morning left for the oclawaha which runs into the st johns about twentyfive miles above on the other side of the river  we found the corny family at the station all right and corny immediately informed me that she had a fishingline but didnt bring a pole because her father said he could cut her one if it was needed he didnt know whether it was throwout fishing or not on that river  there used to be a wooden railroad here and the cars were pulled by mules it was probably more fun to travel that way but it took longer now they have steel rails and everything that a regular grownup railroad has we knew the engineer for mr cholott had introduced us to him one day on the clubhouse wharf he was a firstrate fellow and let us ride on the engine i didnt believe at first that rectus would do this but there was only one passenger car and after the corny family got into that he didnt hesitate a minute about the engine  we had a splendid ride we went slashing along through the woods the whole way and as neither of us had ever ridden on an engine before we made the best of our time we found out what every crank and handle was for and kept a sharp lookout ahead through the little windows in the cab if we had caught an alligator on the cowcatcher the thing would have been complete the engineer said there used to be alligators along by the road in the swampy places but he guessed the engine had frightened most of them away  the trip didnt take forty minutes so we had scarcely time to learn the whole art of enginedriving but we were very glad to have had the ride  we found the steamboat waiting for us at tocoi which is such a little place that i dont believe either of us noticed it as we hurried aboard the st johns is a splendid river as wide as a young lake but we did not have much time to see it as it grew dark pretty soon and the supperbell rang  we reached pilatka pretty early in the evening and there we had to stay all night mr chipperton told me confidentially that he thought this whole arrangement was a scheme to make money out of travellers the boat we were in ought to have kept on and taken us up the oclawaha but said he i suppose that wouldnt suit the hotelkeepers i expect they divide the profits with the boats  by good luck i thought the corny family and ourselves went to different hotels to spend the night when i congratulated rectus on this fact he only said  it dont matter for one night well catch em all bad enough tomorrow  and he was right when we went down to the wharf the next morning to find the oclawaha boat the first persons we saw were mr chipperton with his wife and daughter they were standing gazing at the steamboat which was to take us on our trip  isnt this a funny boat said corny as soon as she saw us it was a very funny boat it was not much longer than an ordinary tug and quite narrow but was built up as high as a twostory house and the wheel was in the stern rectus compared her to a river wheelbarrow  soon after we were on board she started off and then we had a good chance to see the st johns we had been down to look at the river before for we got up very early and walked about the town it is a pretty sort of a new place with wide streets and some handsome houses the people have orangegroves in their gardens instead of potatopatches as we have up north before we started we hired a rifle we had been told that there was plenty of game on the river and that most gentlemen who took the trip carried guns rectus wanted to get two rifles but i thought one was enough we could take turns and i knew id feel safer if i had nothing to do but to keep my eye on rectus while he had the gun  there were not many passengers on board and indeed there was not room for more than twentyfive or thirty most of them who could find places sat out on a little upper deck in front of the main cabin which was in the top story mrs chipperton however staid in the saloon or diningroom and looked out of the windows she was a quiet woman and had an air as if she had to act as shafthorse for the team and was pretty well used to holding back and i reckon she had a good deal of it to do  one party attracted our attention as soon as we went aboard it was made up of a lady and two gentlemenhunters the lady wasnt a hunter but she was dressed in a suitable costume to go about with fellows who had on huntingclothes the men wore long yellow boots that came ever so far up their legs and they had on all the belts and huntingfixings that the law allows the lady wore yellow gloves to match the mens boots as we were going up the st johns the two men strode about in an easy kind of a way as if they wanted us to understand that this sort of thing was nothing to them they were used to it and could wear that style of boots every day if they wanted to rectus called them the yellowlegged party which wasnt a bad name  after steaming about twentyfive miles up the st johns river we went in close to the western shore and then made a sharp turn into a narrow opening between the tall trees and sailed right into the forest     chapter viii  the steamboat in the forest   we were in a narrow river where the tall trees met overhead while the lower branches and the smaller trees brushed against the little boat as it steamed along this was the oclawaha river and rectus and i thought it was as good as fairyland we stood on the bow of the boat which wasnt two feet above the water and took in everything there was to see  the river wound around in among the great trees so that we seldom could see more than a few hundred yards ahead and every turn we made showed us some new picture of green trees and hanging moss and glimpses into the heart of the forest while everything was reflected in the river which was as quiet as a lookingglass  talk of theatres said rectus  no dont said i  at this moment we both gave a little jump for a gun went off just behind us we turned around quickly and saw that the tall yellowlegs had just fired at a big bird he didnt hit it  hello said rectus wed better get our gun the game is beginning to show itself and off he ran for the rifle  i didnt know that rectus had such a bloodthirsty style of mind but there were a good many things about him that i didnt know when he came back he loaded the rifle which was a little breechloader and began eagerly looking about for game  corny had been on the upper deck but in a minute or two she came running out to us  oh do you know she called out that there are alligators in this river do you think they could crawl up into the boat we go awfully near shore sometimes they sleep on shore i do hope ill see one soon  well keep a sharp lookout and perhaps you may said i  she sat down on a box near the edge of the deck and peered into the water and along the shore as if she had been sent there to watch for breakers ahead every now and then she screamed out  theres one there there there  but it was generally a log or a reflection or something else that was not an alligator  of course we were very near both shores at all times for the river is so narrow that a small boy could throw a ball over it but occasionally the deeper part of the channel flowed so near one shore that we ran right up close to the trees and the branches flapped up against the people on the little forward deck making the ladies especially the lady belonging to the yellowlegged party crouch and scream as if some wooddemon had stuck a hand into the boat and made a grab for their bonnets  this commotion every now and then and the almost continual reports from the guns on board and cornys screams when she thought she saw an alligator made the scene quite lively  rectus and i took a turn every halfhour at the rifle it was really a great deal more agreeable to look out at the beautiful pictures that came up before us every few minutes but as we had the gun we couldnt help keeping up a watch for game besides  there i whispered to rectus see that big bird on that limb take a crack at him  it was a waterturkey and he sat placidly on a limb close to the waters edge and about a boats length ahead of us  rectus took a good aim he slowly turned as the boat approached the bird keeping his aim upon him and then he fired  the waterturkey stuck out his long snakelike neck and said  quee quee quee  and then he ran along the limb quite gayly  bang bang went the guns of the yellowlegs and the turkey actually stopped and looked back then he said  quee quee again and ran in among the thick leaves  i believe i could have hit him with a stone  it dont seem to be any use said mr chipperton who was standing behind us to fire at the birds along this river they know just what to do im almost sure i saw that bird wink it wouldnt surprise me if the fellows that own the rifles are in conspiracy with these birds they let out rifles that wont hit and the birds know it and sit there and laugh at the passengers why i tell you sir if the people who travel up and down this river were all regular shooters there wouldnt be a bird left in six months  at this moment corny saw an alligatora real one it was lying on a log near shore and just ahead of the boat she set up such a yell that it made every one of us jump and her mother came rushing out of the saloon to see if she was dead the alligator who was a goodsized fellow was so scared that he just slid off his log without taking time to get decently awake and before any one but rectus and myself had a chance to see him the ladies were very much annoyed at this and urged corny to scream softly the next time she saw one alligators were pretty scarce this trip for some reason or other for one thing the weather was not very warm and they dont care to come out in the open air unless they can give their cold bodies a good warming up  corny now went up on the upper deck because she thought that she might see alligators farther ahead if she got up higher in five minutes she had her hat taken off by a branch of a tree which swept upon her as she was leaning over the rail she called to the pilot to stop the boat and go back for her hat but the captain who was up in the pilothouse stuck out his head and said he reckoned shed have to wait until they came back the hat would hang there for a day or two corny made no answer to this but disappeared into the saloon  in a little while she came out on the lower deck wearing a sealskin hat she brought a stool with her and put it near the bow of the boat a little in front and on one side of the box on which rectus and i were sitting then she sat quietly down and gazed out ahead the sealskin cap was rather too warm for the day perhaps but she looked very pretty in it  directly she looked around at us  where do you shoot alligators said she  anywhere where you may happen to see them said i laughing on the land in the water or wherever they may be  i mean in what part of their bodies said she  oh in the eye i answered  either eye she asked  yes it dont matter which but how are you going to hit them  ive got a revolver said she  and she turned around like the turret of an ironclad until the muzzle of a big sevenshooter pointed right at us  my conscience i exclaimed where did you get that dont point it this way  oh its fathers he let me have it i am going to shoot the first alligator i see you neednt be afraid of my screaming this time and she revolved back to her former position  one good thing said rectus to me in a low voice her pistol isnt cocked  i had noticed this and i hoped also that it wasnt loaded  which eye do you shut said corny turning suddenly upon us  both said rectus  she did not answer but looked at me and i told her to shut her left eye but to be very particular not to turn around again without lowering her pistol  she resumed her former position and we breathed a little easier although i thought that it might be well for us to go to some other part of the boat until she had finished her sport  i was about to suggest this to rectus when suddenly corny sprang to her feet and began blazing away at something ahead bang bang bang she went seven times  why she didnt stop once to cock it cried rectus and i was amazed to see how she had fired so rapidly but as soon as i had counted seven i stepped up to her and took her pistol she explained to me how it worked it was one of those pistols in which the same pull of the trigger jerks up the hammer and lets it downthe most unsafe things that any one can carry  too bad she exclaimed i believe it was only a log but wont you please load it up again for me here are some cartridges  corny said i how would you like to have our rifle it will be better than a pistol for you  she agreed instantly to this exchange and i showed her how to hold and manage the gun i didnt think it was a very good thing for a girl to have but it was a great deal safer than the pistol for the people on board the latter i put in my pocket  corny made one shot but did no execution the other gunners on board had been firing away for some time at two little birds that kept ahead of us skimming along over the water just out of reach of the shot that was sent scattering after them  i think its a shame said corny to shoot such little birds as that they cant eat em  no said i and they cant hit em either which is a great deal better  but very soon after this the shorter yellowlegged man did hit a bird it was a waterturkey that had been sitting on a tree just as we turned a corner the big bird spread out its wings made a doleful flutter and fell into the underbrush by the shore  wont they stop to get him asked corny with her eyes open as wide as they would go  one of the hands was standing by and he laughed  stop the boat when a man shoots a bird i reckon not and there isnt anybody that would go into all that underbrush and water only for a bird like that anyway  well i think its murder cried corny i thought they ate em here take your gun im much obliged but i dont want to kill things just to see them fall down and die  i took the gun very willinglyalthough i did not think that corny would injure any birds with itbut i asked her what she thought about alligators she certainly had not supposed that they were killed for food  alligators are wild beasts she said give me my pistol i am going to take it back to father  and away she went rectus and i did not keep up our rifle practice much longer we couldnt hit anything and the thought that if we should wound or kill a bird it would be of no earthly good to us or anybody else made us follow cornys example and we put away our gun but the other gunners did not stop as long as daylight lasted a ceaseless banging was kept up  we were sitting on the forward deck looking out at the beautiful scenes through which we were passing and occasionally turning back to see that none of the gunners posted themselves where they might make our positions uncomfortable when corny came back to us  can either of you speak french she asked  rectus couldnt but i told her that i understood the language tolerably well and asked her why she wished to know  its just this she said you see those two men with yellow boots and the lady with them shes one of their wives  how many wives have they got interrupted rectus speaking to corny almost for the first time  i mean she is the wife of one of them of course she answered a little sharply and then she turned herself somewhat more toward me and the whole set try to make out theyre french for they talk it nearly all the time but theyre not french for i heard them talk a good deal better english than they can talk french and every time a branch nearly hits her that lady sings out in regular english and besides i know that their french isnt french french because i can understand a great deal of it and if it was i couldnt do it i can talk french a good deal better than i can understand it anyway the french people jumble everything up so that i cant make head or tail of it father says he dont wonder they have had so many revolutions when they cant speak their own language more distinctly he tried to learn it but didnt keep it up long and so i took lessons for when we go to france one of us ought to know how to talk or we shall be cheated dreadfully well you see over on the little deck up there is that gentleman with his wife and a young lady and theyre all travelling together and these makebelieve french people have been jabbering about them ever so long thinking that nobody else on board understands french but i listened to them i couldnt make out all they said but i could tell that they were saying all sorts of things about those other people and trying to settle which lady the gentleman was married to and they made a big mistake too for they said the small lady was the one  how do you know they were wrong i said  why i went to the gentleman and asked him i guess he ought to know and now if youll come up there id just like to show those people that they cant talk out loud about the other passengers and have nobody know what theyre saying  you want to go there and talk french so as to show them that you understand it said i  yes answered corny thats just it  all right come along said i they may be glad to find out that you know what theyre talking about  and so we all went to the upper deck rectus as willing as anybody to see the fun  corny seated herself on a little stool near the yellowlegged party the men of which had put down their guns for a time rectus and i sat on the forward railing near her directly she cleared her throat and then after looking about her on each side said to me in very distinct tones  voyezz vows cett hommy ett ses ducks femmys seelahb  i came near roaring out laughing but i managed to keep my face straight and said oui  well theni mean bean donk lah peetit femmy nest pah lah femmy due hommy lah oter femmy este sah femmyc  illustration voyezz vows cett hommy ett ses ducks femmys seelah  at this there was no holding in any longer i burst out laughing so that i came near falling off the railing rectus laughed because i did the gentleman with the wife and the young lady laughed madly and mr chipperton who came out of the saloon on hearing the uproar laughed quite cheerfully and asked what it was all about but corny didnt laugh she turned around short to see what effect her speech had had on the yellowlegged party it had a good deal of effect they reddened and looked at us then they drew their chairs closer together and turned their backs to us what they thought we never knew but corny declared to me afterward that they talked no more frenchat least when she was about  the gentleman who had been the subject of cornys french discourse called her over to him and the four had a gay talk together i heard corny tell them that she never could pronounce french in the french way she pronounced it just as it was spelt and her father said that ought to be the rule with every language she had never had a regular teacher but if people laughed so much at the way she talked perhaps her father ought to get her one  i liked corny better the more i knew of her it was easy to see that she had taught herself all that she knew her mother held her back a good deal no doubt but her father seemed more like a boycompanion than anything else and if corny hadnt been a very smart girl she would have been a pretty bad kind of a girl by this time but she wasnt anything of the sort although she did do and say everything that came into her head to say or do rectus did not agree with me about corny he didnt like her  when it grew dark i thought we should stop somewhere for the night for it was hard enough for the boat to twist and squeeze herself along the river in broad daylight she bumped against big trees that stood on the edge of the stream and swashed through bushes that stuck out too far from the banks but she was built for bumping and scratching and didnt mind it sometimes she would turn around a corner and make a short cut through a whole plantation of lilypads and spatterdocksor things like themand she would scrape over a sunken log as easily as a wagonwheel rolls over a stone she drew only two feet of water and was flatbottomed when she made a very short turn the men had to push her stern around with poles indeed there was a man with a pole at the bow a good deal of the time and sometimes he had more pushing off to do than he could manage by himself  when mr chipperton saw what tight places we had to squeeze through he admitted that it was quite proper not to try to bring the big steamboats up here  but the boat didnt stop she kept right on she had to go a hundred and forty miles up that narrow river and if she made the whole trip from pilatka and back in two days she had no time to lose so when it was dark a big iron box was set up on top of the pilothouse and a fire was built in it of pineknots and bits of fat pine this blazed finely and lighted up the river and the trees on each side and sometimes threw out such a light that we could see quite a distance ahead everybody came out to see the wonderful sight it was more like fairyland than ever when the fire died down a little the distant scenery seemed to fade away and become indistinct and shadowy and the great trees stood up like their own ghosts all around us and then when fresh knots were thrown in the fire would blaze up and the whole scene would be lighted up again and every tree and bush and almost every leaf along the waters edge would be tipped with light while everything was reflected in the smooth glittering water  rectus and i could hardly go in to supper and we got through the meal in short order we staid out on deck until after eleven oclock and corny staid with us a good part of the time at last her father came down after her for they were all going to bed  this is a grand sight said mr chipperton i never saw anything to equal it in any transformation scene at a theatre some of our theatre people ought to come down here and study it up so as to get up something of the kind for exhibition in the cities  just before we went into bed our steamwhistle began to sound and away off in the depths of the forest we could hear every now and then another whistle the captain told us that there was a boat coming down the river and that she would soon pass us the river did not look wide enough for two boats but when the other whistle sounded as if it were quite near we ran our boat close into shore among the spatterdocks in a little cove and waited there leaving the channel for the other boat  directly it came around a curve just ahead of us and truly it was a splendid sight the lower part of the boat was all lighted up and the fire was blazing away grandly in its iron box high up in the air  to see such a glowing sparkling apparition as this come sailing out of the depths of the dark forest was grand rectus said he felt like bursting into poetry but he didnt he wasnt much on rhymes he had opportunity enough though to get up a pretty goodsized poem for we were kept awake a long time after we went to bed by the boughs of the trees on shore scratching and tapping against the outside of our stateroom  when we went out on deck the next morning the first person we saw was corny holding on to the flagstaff at the bow and looking over the edge of the deck into the water  what are you looking at said i as we went up to her  see there she cried see that turtle and those two fishes look look  we didnt need to be told twice to look the water was just as clear as crystal and you could see the bottom everywhere even in the deepest places with the great rocks covered with some glittering green substance that looked like emerald slabs and the fish and turtles swimming about as if they thought there was no one looking at them  i couldnt understand how the water had become so clear but i was told that we had left the river proper and were now in a stream that flowed from silver spring which was the end of our voyage into the cypress woods the water in the spring and in this stream was almost transparentvery different from the regular water of the river  about ten oclock we reached silver spring which is like a little lake with some houses on the bank we made fast at a wharf and as we were to stop here some hours everybody got ready to go ashore  corny was the first one ready her mother thought she ought not to go but her father said there was no harm in it  if she does said mrs chipperton shell get herself into some sort of a predicament before she comes back  i found that in such a case as this mrs chipperton was generally right  footnotes  b voyezvous cet homme et ces deux femmes celàdo you see that man and those two women there  c bien donc la petite femme nest pas la femme du homme la autre femme est sa femmewell then the little woman is not the wife of the man the other woman is his wife of course the french in this and the preceding footnote is cornysthe author     chapter ix  the three gray beans   corny went ashore but she did not stay there three minutes from the edge of the wharf we could see that silver spring was better worth looking at than anything we should be likely to see on shore the little lake seemed deeper than a threestory house and yet even from where we stood we could see down to the very bottom  there were two boys with rowboats at the wharf we hired one of the boats right off and corny gave me such a look that i told her to get in after she was in the boat she asked her mother who was standing on the deck of the steamboat if she might go mrs chipperton said she supposed so and away we went when we had rowed out to the middle of the spring i stopped rowing and we looked down into the depths it was almost the same as looking into air far down at the bottom we could see the glittering sand and the green rocks and sometimes a fish as long as my arm would slowly rise and fall and paddle away beneath us we dropped nickels and copper cents down to the bottom and we could plainly see them lying there in some parts of the bottom there were wells or holes about two feet in diameter which seemed to go down indefinitely these we were told were the places where the water came up from below into the spring we could see the weeds and grasses that grew on the edges of these wells although we could not see very far down into them  if i had only known said rectus what sort of a place we were coming to i should have brought something to lower down into these wells i tell you what would have been splendida heavy bottle filled with sweet oil and some phosphorus and a long cord if we shook up the bottle it would shine so that when we lowered it into the wells we could see it go down to the very bottom that is if the cord should be long enough  at this instant corny went overboard rectus made a grab at her but it was too late he sprang to his feet and i thought he was going over after her but i seized him  sit down said i watch her shell come up again lean over and be ready for her  we both leaned over the bow as far as was safe with one hand i gently paddled the boat this way and that so as to keep ourselves directly over corny it would have been of no use to jump in we could see her as plainly as anything  she was going down all in a bunch when i first saw her and the next instant she touched the bottom her feet were under now and i saw her make a little spring she just pushed out her feet  then she began to come right up we saw her slowly rising beneath us her face was turned upward and her eyes were wide open it was a wonderful sight i trembled from head to foot it seemed as if we were floating in the air and corny was coming up to us from the earth  before she quite reached the surface i caught her and had her head out of water in an instant rectus then took hold and with a mighty jerk we pulled her into the boat  corny sat down hard and opened her mouth  there she said i didnt breathe an inch  and then she puffed for about two minutes while the water ran off her into the bottom of the boat i seized the oars to row to shore  how did you fall over said rectus who still shook as if he had had a chill  dont know answered corny i was leaning far over when my hand must have slipped and the first thing i knew i was into it its good i didnt shut my eyes if you get into water with your eyes shut you cant open them again she still puffed a little coming up was the best its the first time i ever saw the bottom of a boat  werent you frightened i asked  hadnt time at first and when i was coming up i saw you reaching out for me  illustration we saw her slowly rising beneath us  did you think wed get you said rectus his face flushing  yes said corny but if youd missed me that time id never have trusted you again  the gentlemanwithawifeandayounglady was in another boat not very far off but it was nearer the upper end of the little lake and none of the party knew of our accident until we were pulling corny out of the water then they rowed toward us as fast as they could but they did not reach us until we were at the wharf no one on shore or on the steamboat seemed to have noticed cornys dive indeed the whole thing was done so quietly and was so soon over that there was not as much of a show as the occasion demanded  i never before was in deep water that seemed so little like real water said corny just before we reached the wharf this was cold and that was the only thing natural about it  then this is not the first time youve been in deep water i asked  no said corny not the very first time and she scrambled up on the wharf where her mother was standing talking to some ladies  why cornelia exclaimed mrs chipperton as soon as she saw the dripping girl have you been in the water again  yes maam said corny drawing her shoulders up to her ears and i must be rubbed down and have dry clothes as quick as lightning  and with this she and her mother hurried on board the steamboat  rectus and i went back on the lake for we had not gone half over it when corny went into it we had rowed about for half an hour or so and were just coming in when corny appeared on the deck of the steamboat with a handkerchief tied around her head  are you going to take a walk on shore she called out  yes we shouted  all right said she if youll let me ill go with you for mother says i must take a good run in the sun i look funny dont i but i havent any more hats  we gave her a good run although it was not altogether in the sun the country hereabout was pretty well wooded but there were roads cut through the woods and there were some open places and everywhere underfoot the sand was about six inches deep rectus took corny by one hand and i took her by the other and we made her trot through that sand in sunshine and shade until she declared she was warm enough to last for a week the yellowlegged party and some of the other passengers were wandering about gathering the long gray mossfrom limbs where they could reach itand cutting great palmetto leaves which grew on low bushes all through the woods and carrying them about as fans or parasols but although corny wanted to join in this fun we would not stop we just trotted her until she was tired and then we ran her on board the boat where her mother was waiting for her  now then said mrs chipperton immediately to bed  the two disappeared and we saw no more of corny until suppertime her mother was certainly good at cure if she didnt have much of a knack at prevention  just as the boat was about to start off on her return trip and after she had blown her whistle two or three times mr chipperton appeared carrying an immense armload of gray moss he puffed and blew as he threw it down on deck when his wife came out and told him of cornys disaster he stopped dusting his clothes and looked up for an instant  i declare said he corny must keep out of the water it seems to me that i can never leave her but she gets into some scrape but im sure our friends here have proved themselves good fellows indeed and he shook hands with both of us  now then my dear said he to his wife ive enough moss here for the parlor and sittingroom and the little backroom upstairs i didnt get any for the diningroom because it might blow about and get into the food  do you mean to take that moss all the way home asked mrs chipperton in surprise why how will you ever carry it  of course i mean to take it home said he i gathered this with my own hands from the top of one of the tallest trees on the banks of this famous silver spring  mr chipperton exclaimed his wife  to be sure the tree was cut down but that makes no difference in the fact it is both an ornament and a trophy of travel if necessary ill buy a trunk for it what did you do with corny after they got her out  our journey home was very much like our trip up the river but there were a few exceptions there was not so much firing for i think the ammunition got pretty low we saw more alligators and the yellowlegged party which had joined us at pilatka went all the way to st augustine with us there was still another difference and that was in rectus he was a good deal liveliermore in the spirit that had hatched out in him in the cemetery at savannah he seemed to be all right with corny now and we had a good time together i was going to say to him once that he had changed his mind about girls but i thought i wouldnt it would be better to let well enough alone and he was a ticklish customer  the day after we returned to st augustine we were walking on the seawall when we met corny she said she had been looking for us her father had gone out fishing with some gentlemen and her mother would not walk in the sun and besides she had something to say to us  so we all walked to the fort and sat down on the wide wall of the waterbattery rectus bestrode one of the cannon that stood pointing out to sea but corny told him she wanted him to get down and sit by her so that she wouldnt have to shout  now then said she after pausing a little as if she wanted to be sure and get it right you two saved my life and i want to give you something to remember me by  we both exclaimed against this  you neednt do that said i for im sure that no one who saw you coming up from the bottom like the fairywomen float up on wires at the theatre could ever forget you well remember you corny without your giving us anything  but that wont do said she the only other time that i was ever really saved was by a ferryman and father gave him some money which was all right for him but wouldnt do for you two you know and another time there wasnt really any danger and im sorry the man got anything but he did  we brought scarcely anything with us because we didnt expect to need things in this way but this is my own and i want to give it to you both one of you cant use it by himself and so it will be more like a present for both of you together than most things would be and she handed me a box of dominoes  i give it to you because youre the oldest but remember its for both of you  of course we took it and corny was much pleased she was a good little girl and somehow or other she seemed to be older and more sensible when she was with us than when she was bouncing around in the bosom of her family  we had a good deal of talk together and after a while she asked how long we were going to stay in st augustine  until next tuesday i said and then we shall start for nassau in the tigris  nassau she exclaimed wheres that  right down there i said pointing out to sea with a crook of my finger to the south its on one of the bahamas and they lie off the lower end of florida you know  no said she i dont remember where they are i always get the bahamas mixed up with the bermudas anyway so does father we talked of going to one of those places when we first thought of travelling for his lung but then they thought florida would be better what is there good about nassau is it any better than this place  well said i its in the west indies and its semitropical and they have cocoanuts and pineapples and bananas there and there are lots of darkeys and the weather is always just what you want  i guess thats a little stretched said corny and rectus agreed with her  and its a new kind of a place i continued an english colony such as our ancestors lived in before the revolution and we ought to see what sort of a thing an english colony is so as to know whether washington and the rest of them should have kicked against it  oh they were all right said corny in a tone which settled that little matter  and so you see i went on rectus and i thought we should like to go out of the country for a while and see how it would feel to live under a queen and a cocoanut tree  good cried corny well go  who i asked  father and mother and i said corny rising ill tell them all about it and id better be going back to the hotel for if the steamer leaves on tuesday well have lots to do  as we were walking homeward on the seawall rectus looked back and suddenly exclaimed  there do you see that crowded owl following us hes been hanging round us all the afternoon hes up to something dont you remember the captain told us he was a badtempered fellow  what did he do asked corny looking back at the indian who now stood in the road a short distance from the wall regarding us very earnestly  well he never did anything much i said he seemed to be angry once because we would not buy some of his things and the captain said hed have him told not to worry us that may have made him madder yet  he dont look mad said corny  dont you trust him said rectus  i believe all these indians are perfectly gentle now said corny and father thinks so too hes been over here a good deal and talked to some of them lets go ask him what he wants perhaps hes only sorry  if he is well never find it out i remarked for he can only speak one word of english  i beckoned to crowded owl and he immediately ran up to the wall and said how in an uncertain tone as if he was not sure how we should take it however corny offered him her hand and rectus and i followed suit after this he put his hand into his pocket and pulled out three seabeans  there said rectus at it again disobeying military orders  but theyre pretty ones said corny taking one of the beans in her hand  they were pretty they were not very large but were beautifully polished and of a delicate gray color the first we had seen of the kind  these must be a rare kind said rectus they are almost always brown lets forgive him this once and buy them  perhaps he wants to make up with you said corny and has brought these as a present  i can soon settle that question said i and i took the three beans and pulled from my pocket three quarterdollars which i offered to the indian  crowded owl took the money grinned gave a bob of his head and went home happy  if he had had any wish to make up with us he had shown it by giving us a chance at a choice lot of goods  now said i reaching out my hand to corny heres one for each of us take your choice  for me said corny no i oughtnt to yes i will too i am ever so much obliged we have lots of seabeans but none like this ill have a ring fastened to it and wear it somehow  thatll do to remember us by said i  yes said rectus and whenever youre in danger just hold up that bean and well come to you  ill do it said corny but how about you what can i do  oh i dont suppose we shall want you to help us much i said  well hold up your beans and well see said corny     chapter x  the queen on the doorstep   we found that corny had not been mistaken about her influence over her family for the next morning before we were done breakfast mr chipperton came around to see us he was full of nassau and had made up his mind to go with us on tuesday he asked us lots of questions but he really knew as much about the place as we did although he had been so much in the habit of mixing his bahamas and his bermudas  my wife is very much pleased at the idea of having you two with us on the trip over said he although to be sure we may have a very smooth and comfortable voyage  i believe that since the silver spring affair he regarded rectus and me as something in the nature of patent girlcatchers to be hung over the side of the vessel in bad weather  we were sorry to leave st augustine but we had thoroughly done up the old place and had seen everything i think except the spring of ponce de leon on the other side of the st sebastian river we didnt care about renewing our youthindeed we should have objected very much to anything of the kindand so we felt no interest in old ponces spring  on tuesday morning the tigris made her appearance on time and mr cholott and our good landlady came down to see us off the yellowlegged party also came down but not to see us off they too were going to nassau  rectus had gone on board and i was just about to follow him when our old minorcan stepped up to me  goin away said he  yes said i were off at last  other feller goin  oh yes i answered we keep together  well now look here said he drawing me a little on one side what made him take sich stock in us minorcans why he thought we used to be slaves what put that in his head id like to know did he reely think we ever was niggers  oh no i exclaimed he had merely heard the early history of the minorcans in this country their troubles and all that and he  but what difference did it make to him interrupted the old man  i couldnt just then explain the peculiarities of rectuss disposition to mr menendez and so i answered that i supposed it was a sort of sympathy  i cant see for the life of me said the old man reflectively what difference it made to him  and he shook hands with me and bade me goodbye i dont believe he has ever found anybody who could give him the answer to this puzzle  the trip over to nassau was a very different thing from our voyage down the coast from new york to savannah the sea was comparatively smooth and although the vessel rolled a good deal in the great swells we did not mind it much the air was delightful and after we had gone down the florida coast and had turned to cross the gulf stream to our islands the weather became positively warm even out here on the sea and we were on deck nearly all the time  mr chipperton was in high spirits he enjoyed the deep blue color of the sea he went into ecstasies over the beautiful little nautiluses that sailed along by the ship he watched with wild delight the porpoises that followed close by our side and fairly shouted when a big fellow would spring into the air or shoot along just under the surface as if he had a steamengine in his tail but when he saw a school of flyingfish rise up out of the sea just a little ahead of us and go skimming along like birds and then drop again into the water he was so surprised and delighted that he scarcely knew how to express his feelings  of course we younger people enjoyed all these things but i was surprised to see that corny was more quiet than usual and spent a good deal of her time in reading although she would spring up and run to the railing whenever her father announced some wonderful discovery mr chipperton would have been a splendid man for columbus to have taken along with him on his first trip to these islands he would have kept up the spirits of the sailors  i asked corny what she was reading and she showed me her book it was a big fat pamphlet about the bahamas and she was studying up for her stay there she was a queer girl she had not been to school very much her mother said for they had been travelling about a good deal of late years but she liked to study up special things in which she took an interest sometimes she was her own teacher and sometimes if they staid in any one place long enough she took regular lessons  i teach her as much as i can said her mother although i would much rather have her go regularly to school but her father is so fond of her that he will not have her away from him and as mr chippertons lung requires him to be moving from place to place we have to go too but i am determined that she shall go to a school next fall  what is the matter with mr chippertons lung i asked  i wish we knew said mrs chipperton earnestly the doctors dont seem to be able to find out the exact trouble and besides it isnt certain which lung it is but the only thing that can be done for it is to travel  he looks very well said i  oh yes said she butand she looked around to see where he washe doesnt like people to tell him so  after a while rectus got interested in cornys book and the two read a good deal together i did not interrupt them for i felt quite sure that neither of them knew too much  the captain and all the officers on the steamer were good sociable men and made the passengers feel at home i had got somewhat acquainted with them on our trip from savannah to st augustine and now the captain let me come into his room and showed me the ships course marked out on a chart and pointed out just where we were besides telling me a good many things about the islands and these waters  i mentioned to corny and rectus when i went aft againthis was the second day outthat we should see one end of the great bahama early in the afternoon  im glad of that said corny but i suppose we shant go near enough for us to see its calcareous formation  its what i exclaimed  its calcareous formation repeated corny and she went on with her reading  oh said i laughing i guess the calcareous part is all covered up with grass and plantsat least it ought to be in a semitropical country but when we get to nassau you can dig down and see what its like  semitropical exclaimed mr chipperton who just came up there is something about that word that puts me all in a glow and he rubbed his hands as if he smelt dinner  each of us wore a gray bean rectus and i had ours fastened to our watchguards and cornys hung to a string of beads she generally wore we formed ourselves into a societycorny suggested itwhich we called the association of the three gray beans the object of which was to save each other from drowning and to perform similar serviceable acts if circumstances should call for them we agreed to be very faithful and if corny had tumbled overboard i am sure that rectus and i would have jumped in after her but i am happy to say that she did nothing of the kind on this trip  early the next morning we reached nassau the largest town in the bahamas on one of the smallest islands and found it semitropical enough to suit even mr chipperton  before we landed we could see the white shining streets and housesjust as calcareous as they could be the black negroes the peagreen water in the harbor the tall cocoanut trees and about five million conchshells lying at the edges of the docks the colored people here live pretty much on the conchfish and when we heard that it accounted for the shells the poorer people on these islands often go by the name of conchs  as we went up through the town we found that the darkeys were nearly as thick as the conchshells but they were much more lively i never saw such jolly dontcarey people as the colored folks that were scattered about everywhere some of the young ones as joyful skippers could have tired out a shrimp  there is one big hotel in the town and pretty nearly all our passengers went there the house is calcareous and as solid as a rock rectus and i liked it very much because it reminded us of pictures we had seen of algiers or portugal or some country where they have arches instead of doors but mr chipperton wasnt at all satisfied when he found that there was not a fireplace in the whole house  this is coming the semitropical a little too strong he said to me but he soon found i think that gathering around the hearthstone could never become a popular amusement in this warm little town  every day for a week mr chipperton hired a onehorse barouche and he and his wife and daughter rode over the island rectus and i walked and we saw a good deal more than they did corny told us this the first walk she took with us we went down a long smooth white road that led between the queer little cottages of the negroes where the cocoanut and orange trees and the bananas and sappadilloes and lots of other trees and bushes stood up around the houses just as proudly as if they were growing on tenthousanddollar lots some of these trees had the most calcareous foundations anybody ever saw they grew almost out of the solid rock this is probably one of the most economical places in the world for garden mould you couldnt sweep up more than a bucketful out of a whole garden and yet the things grow splendidly rectus said he supposed the air was earthy  corny enjoyed this walk because we went right into the houses and talked to the people and bought cocoanuts off the trees and ate the inside custard with a spoon and made the little codgers race for pennies and tried all the different kinds of fruits she said she would like to walk out with us always but her mother said she must not be going about too much with boys  but there are no girls on the island said she at least no white onesas far as i have seen  i suppose there were white children around but they escaped notice in the vast majority of little nigs  the day after this walk the shorter yellowlegs asked me to go out fishing with him he couldnt find anybody else i suppose for his friend didnt like fishing neither did rectus and so we went off together in a fishingsmack with a fisherman to sail the boat and hammer conch for bait we went outside of hog islandwhich lies off nassau very much as anastasia island lies off st augustine only it isnt a quarter as bigand fished in the open sea we caught a lot of curious fish and the yellowlegs whose name was burgan turned out to be a very good sort of a fellow i shouldnt have supposed this of a man who had made such a guy of himself but there are a great many different kinds of outsides to people  when we got back to the hotel along came rectus and corny they had been out walking together and looked hot  oh cried corny as soon as she saw me we have something to talk to you about lets go and sit down i wish there was some kind of an umbrella or straw hat that people could wear under their chins to keep the glare of these white roads out of their eyes lets go up into the silkcotton tree  i proposed that i should go to my room and clean up a little first but corny couldnt wait as her father had said she wasnt good at waiting and so we all went up into the silkcotton tree this was an enormous tree with roots like the partitions between horsestalls it stood at the bottom of the hotel grounds and had a large platform built up among the branches with a flight of steps leading to it there were seats up here and room enough for a dozen people  well said i when we were seated what have you to tell anything wonderful if it isnt youd better let me tell you about my fish  fish exclaimed rectus not very respectfully  fish indeed said corny we have seen a queen  queen of what said i  queen of africa replied corny at least a part of itshe would be i mean if she had stayed there we went over that way out to the very edge of the town and there we found a whole colony of real native africansjust the kind livingstone and stanley discoveredonly they wear clothes like us  oh my exclaimed rectus  i dont mean exactly that said corny but coats and trousers and frocks awfully old and patched and nearly all the grownup people there were born in africa and rescued by an english manofwar from a slaveship that was taking them into slavery and were brought here and set free and here they are and they talk their own languageonly some of them know english for theyve been here over thirty yearsand they all keep together and have a governor of their own with a flagpole before his house and among them is a real queen of royal blood  how did you find out that i asked  oh we heard about the african settlement this morning at the hotel and we went down there right after dinner we went into two or three of the houses and talked to the people and they all told us the same thing and one woman took us to see the queen  in her palace said i  no said corny she dont live in a palace she lives in one of the funniest little huts you ever saw with only two rooms and its too bad they all know shes a queen and yet they dont pay her one bit of honor the african governor knows it but he lives in his house with his flagpole in front of it and rules her people while she sits on a stone in front of her door and sells red peppers and bits of sugarcane  shameful said i you dont mean that  yes she does put in rectus we saw her and bought some sugarcane she didnt think we knew her rank for she put her things away when the women told her in african why we came to see her  what did she say to you i asked beginning to be a good deal interested in this royal colored person  nothing at all said corny she cant talk a word of english if she could she might get along better i suppose her people want somebody over them who can talk english and so theyve just left her to sell peppers and get along as well as she can  its a good deal of a comedown i must say said i i wonder how she likes it  judging from her looks said rectus i dont believe she likes it at all  no indeed added corny she looks woebegone and i dont see why she shouldnt to be taken captive with her peoplemay be she was trying to save themand then to have them almost cut her acquaintance after they all get rescued and settled down  perhaps said i as they are all living under queen victoria they dont want any other queen  thats nothing said corny quickly theres a governor of this whole island and what do they want with another governor if queen victoria and the governor of this island were africans of course they wouldnt want anybody else but as it is they do dont you see  they dont appear to want another queen i said for they wont take one that is right under their noses  corny looked provoked and rectus asked me how i knew that  i tell you said corny it dont make any difference whether they want her or not they havent any right to make a born queen sit on a stone and sell redpeppers do you know what rectus and i have made up our minds to do  what is it i asked  corny looked around to see that no one was standing or walking near the tree and then she leaned toward me and said  we are going to seat her on her throne  you i exclaimed and began to laugh  yes we are said rectus at least were going to try to  you neednt laugh said corny youre to join  in an insurrectiona conspiracy said i i cant go into that business  you must cried corny and rectus almost in a breath  youve made a promise said corny  and are bound to stick to it said rectus looking at corny  then both together as if they had settled it all beforehand they held up their gray seabeans and said in vigorous tones  obey the bean  i didnt hesitate a moment i held up my bean and we clicked beans all around  i became a conspirator     chapter xi  regal projects   the next morning we all went around to see the queen and on the way we tried to arrange our affair i was only sorry that my old schoolfellows were not there to go into the thing with us there couldnt have been better fun for our boys than to get up a revolution and set up a dethroned queen but they were not there and i determined to act as their representative as well as i could  we threecorny rectus and iwere agreed that the reenthronementwe could think of no better word for the businessshould be done as quietly and peacefully as possible it was of no use we thought to make a great fuss about what we were going to do we would see that this african exsovereigness was placed in a suitable regal station and then we would call upon her countrymen to acknowledge her rank  it isnt really necessary for her to do any governing said rectus queens do very little of that look at queen victoria her prime minister and parliament run the country if the african governor here is a good man the queen can take him for a prime minister then he can just go along and do what he always did if she is acknowledged to be the queen thats all she need want  thats so said corny and above all there must be no blood shed  none of yours any way said i and rectus tapped his bean significantly  rectus had been chosen captain of this revolutionary coalition because corny who held the controlling vote said that she was afraid i had not gone into the undertaking heart and soul as rectus had otherwise she would have voted for me as the oldest of the party i did not make any objections and was elected treasurer corny said that the only office she had ever held was that of librarian in a girls society but as we did not expect to need a librarian in this undertaking we made her secretary and manager of restoration which we thought would give her all the work that she could stand under  i suggested that there was one subofficer or employé that we should be sure to need and who should be appointed before we commenced operations this was an emissary proper communications between ourselves and the populace would be difficult unless we obtained the service of some intelligent and wholesouled darkey my fellowrevolutionists agreed with me and after a moment of reflection corny shouted that she had thought of the very person  its a girl she cried and its priscilla  we all knew priscilla it would have been impossible to be at the hotel for a week and not know her after breakfast and after dinner there was always a regular market at the entrance of the hotel under the great arched porch where the boarders sat and made themselves comfortable after meals the dealers were negroes of every agemen women boys and girls and they brought everything they could scrape up that they thought visitors might buyfruit shells sponges flowers straw hats canes and more traps than i can remember some of them had very nice things and others would have closed out their stock for seven cents the liveliest and brightest of all these was a tall slim black elastic smoothtongued young girl named priscilla she nearly always wore shoes which distinguished her from her fellowcountrywomen her eyes sparkled like a firecracker of a dark night and she had a mind as sharp as a fishhook the moment corny mentioned her she was elected emissary  we determined however to be very cautious in disclosing our plans to her we would sound her first and make a regular engagement with her  it will be a firstrate thing for me said corny to have a girl to go about with me for mother said yesterday that it wouldnt do for me to be so much with boys it looked tomboyish she said though she thought you two were very good for boys  are you going to tell your father and mother about this asked rectus  i think ill tell mother said corny because i ought to and i dont believe shell object if i have a girl along with me but i dont think ill say anything to father just yet im afraid hed join  rectus and i agreed that it might be better to postpone saying anything to mr chipperton  it was very true that the queen did not live in a palace her house was nearly large enough to hold an oldfashioned fourposted bedstead such as they have at my aunt sarahs the little room that was cut off from the main apartment was really too small to count the queen was hard at work sitting on her doorstone by the side of her bits of sugarcane and pepperpods there were no customers she was a goodlooking old body about sixty perhaps but tall and straight enough for all queenly purposes  she arose and shook hands with us and then stepped into her doorway and courtesied the effect was very fine  this is dreadful said corny she ought to give up this pepperpod business right away if i could only talk to her id make her understand but i must go get somebody for an interpreter  and she ran off to one of the neighboring huts  if this thing works said rectus we ought to hire a regular interpreter  it wont do to have too many paid officials said i but well see about that  corny soon returned with a pleasantfaced woman who undertook to superintend our conversation with the queen  whats her nameto begin with asked corny of the woman  her african name is poquadilla but here they call her jane henderson when they talk of her she knows that name too we all has to have english names  well we dont want any jane henderson said corny poquadilla thats a good name for a queen but what we first want is to have her stop selling things at the front door well do better for her than that  is you goin to sen her to the sylum asked the woman  the asylum exclaimed corny no indeed youll see shes to live here but shes not to sell pepperpods or anything else  well young missy said the woman you better buy em of her i reckon shell sell out for bout fourpence  this was a sensible proposition and as treasurer i bought the stock the queen having signified her willingness to the treaty by a dignified nod and a courtesy she was very much given to style which encouraged us a good deal  now then said rectus who thought it was about time that the captain should have something to say you must tell her that she isnt to lay in any more stock this is to be the end of her mercantile life  i dont believe the woman translated all of this speech but the queen gave another nod and courtesy and i pocketed the peppers to keep as trophies the other things we kept to give to the children and make ourselves popular  how much do you think it would cost asked corny of me to make this place a little more like a palace  i made a rough sort of a calculation and came to the conclusion that the room could be made a little more like a palace for about eight dollars  thats cheap enough said rectus to me you and i will each give four dollars  no indeed said corny im going to give some how much is three into eight  two and twothirds said i or in this case two dollars sixtysix cents and some sixes over  all right said corny ill ask father for three dollars there ought to be something for extras ill tell mother what i want it for and that will satisfy him he can know afterward i dont think he ought to worry his lung with anything like this  she wont want a throne said rectus turning the conversation from mr chipperton for she has a very good rockingchair which could be fixed up  yes said i it could be cushioned she might do it herself  at this the colored woman made a remark to the queen but what it was we did not know  of course she could said corny queens work queen victoria etches on steel  i dont believe porkermiller can do that said rectus but i guess she can pad her chair  do thrones rock asked corny  some of em do i said there was the throne of france you know  well then that will be all right said corny and how about a crown and sceptre  oh we wont want a sceptre i said that sort of things pretty oldfashioned but we ought to have a crown so as to make a difference between her and the other people  how much are crowns asked corny in a thoughtful tone  various prices i answered but i think we can make one that will do very well for about fifty cents ill undertake to make the brass part if youll cushion it  brass exclaimed corny in astonishment  you dont suppose we can get gold do you i asked laughing  well no she said but not quite satisfied  and there must be a flag and a flagpole said rectus but what sort of a flag are we going to have  the african flag said corny confidently  none of us knew what the african flag was although corny suggested that it was probably black but i told her that if we raised a black flag before the queens palace we should bring down the authorities on us sure theyd think we had started a retail piratical establishment  we now took leave of the queen and enjoined her neighbor to impress on her mind the necessity of not using her capital to lay in a new stock of goods leaving a quarter of a dollar with her for contingent expenses during the day we started for home  ill tell you what it is said i we must settle this matter of revenue pretty soon if she dont sell peppers and sugarcane shell have to be supported in some way and im sure we cant do it  her subjects ought to attend to that said rectus  but she hasnt got any yet i answered  thats a fact said corny we must get her a few to start with  hire em do you mean asked rectus  no call upon them in the name of their country and their queen she replied  i think it would be better at first said i to call upon them in the name of about twopence a head then when we get a nice little body of adherents to begin with the other subjects will fall in of their own accord if we manage the thing right  theres where the emissary will come in said rectus she can collect adherents  we must engage her this very day said corny and now what about the flag we havent settled that yet  i think said i that wed better invent a flag when we get back to the hotel we can each draw some designs and the one we choose can easily be made up we can buy the stuff anywhere  ill sew it said corny  do you think said rectus who had been reflecting that the authorities of this place will object to our setting up a queen  cant tell i said but i hardly think they will they dont object to the black governor and our queen wont interfere with them in any way that i can see she will have nothing to do with anybody but those native africans who keep to themselves anyway  if anybody should trouble us who would it be soldiers or the policemen how many soldiers have they here asked corny  theres only one company now in the barracks said rectus i was down there there are two menofwar in the harbor but one of thems a spanish vessel and im pretty sure she wouldnt bother us  is that all said corny in a tone of relief  i didnt want to dash her spirits but i remarked that there were a good many policemen in the town  and theyre all colored men said corny id hate to have any of them coming after us  the governor of the colony is at the head of the army police and all isnt he said rectus  yes i answered  and i know where he lives put in corny lets go and see him sometime and ask him about it  this was thought to be a good idea and we agreed to consider it at our next meeting  as to revenue said rectus just before we reached the hotel i dont believe these people have much money to give for the support of a queen and so i think they ought to bring in provisions the whole thing might be portioned out she ought to have so many conchs a week so many sticks of sugarcane and so many yams and other stuff this might be fixed so that it wouldnt come hard on anybody  corny said she guessed shed have to get a little book to put these things down so that we could consider them in order  i could not help noticing that there was a good deal of difference between corny and rectus although they were much alike too corny had never learned much but she had a good brain in her head and she could reason out things pretty well when she had anything in the way of a solid fact to start with rectus was better on things hed heard reasoned out he seemed to know a good thing when it came before him and he remembered it and often brought it in very well but he hadnt had much experience in reasoning on his own account although he was getting more in practice every day  corny was just as much in earnest as she was the first day we saw her but she seemed to have grown more thoughtful perhaps this was on account of her having important business on hand her thoughtfulness however did not prevent her from saying some very funny things she spoke first and did her thinking afterward but she was a good girl and i often wished my sister knew her helen was older to be sure but she could have learned a great deal from corny  that afternoon we had a meeting up in the silkcotton tree and priscilla who had sold out her small stock of flowers in the hoteldoor market was requested to be present a varietyshow consisting of about a dozen young darkeys with their baskets and strings of sponges accompanied her up the steps but she was ordered to rout them and she did it in short order when we were alone rectus as captain began to state to her what we desired of her but he was soon interrupted by corny who could do a great deal more talking in a given time than he could and who always felt that she ought to begin early in order to get through in good season  now priscilla said corny in the first place you must promise never to tell what we are going to say to you  priscilla promised in a flash  we want you then continued corny to act as our emissary or general agent or errandgirl if you dont know what the other two things mean  ill do dat missy said priscilla whar you want me to go  nowhere just now said corny we want to engage you by the day to do whatever we tell you  cahnt do dat missy got to sell flowers and roses sell em for de famly missy  but in the afternoon you can come said corny there isnt any selling done then well pay you  how much asked priscilla  this question was referred to me and i offered sixpence a day  the money in this place is english of course as it is an english colony but there are so many visitors from the united states that american currency is as much in use for large sums as the poundsshillingsandpence arrangement but all sums under a quarter are reckoned in english moneypennies halfpennies four six and eightpences and that sort of thing one of our quarters passes for a shilling but a silver dime wont pass in the shops the darkeys will take themor almost anything elseas a gift i didnt have to get our money changed into gold i got a draft on a nassau house and generally drew greenbacks but i saw pretty plainly that i couldnt draw very much for this new monarchical undertaking and stay in nassau as long as we had planned  a whole afternoon exclaimed priscilla for sixpence  why not i asked thats more than you generally make all day  only sixpence said priscilla looking as if her tender spirit had been wounded corny glanced at me with an air that suggested that i ought to make a rise in the price but i had dealt with these darkeys before  thats all i said  all right then boss said priscilla ill do it what you want me to do  the colored people generally gave the name boss to all white men and i was pleased to see that priscilla said boss to me much more frequently than to rectus  we had a talk with her about her duties and each of us had a good deal to say we made her understandat least we hoped sothat she was to be on hand every afternoon to go with corny if necessary whenever we went out on our trips to the african settlement and after giving her an idea of what we intended doing with the queenwhich interested her very much indeed and seemed to set her on pins and needles to see the glories of the new reignwe commissioned her to bring together about twenty sensible and intelligent africans so that we could talk to them and engage them as subjects for the reenthroned queen  whats ole goliah brown goin to say bout dat said priscilla  whos he we asked  hes de afrikin gubner he rule em all  oh said rectus hes all right were going to make him prime minister  i was not at all sure that he was all right and proposed that rectus and i should go to his house in the evening when he was at home and talk to him about it  yes and well all go and see the head governor tomorrow morning said corny  we had our hands completely full of diplomatic business  the meeting of the adherents was appointed for the next afternoon we decided to have it on the queens stairway which is a long flight of steps cut in the solid limestone and leading up out of a deep and shadowy ravine where the people of the town many years ago cut out the calcareous material for their houses there has been no stone cut here for a long time and the walls of the ravine which stand up as straight as the wall of a house are darkened by age and a good deal covered up by vines at the bottom on each side of the pathway which runs through the ravine to the town bushes and plants of various semitropical kinds grow thick and close at the top of the flight of stairs are open fields and an old fort altogether this was considered a quiet and suitable place for a meeting of a band of revolutionists we could not have met in the silkcotton tree for we should have attracted too much attention and besides the hotelclerk would have routed us out     chapter xii  rectus loses rank   after supper rectus and i went to see the african governor goliah brown he was a goodnatured old colored man who lived in a house a trifle better than most of those inhabited by his fellowcountrymen the main room was of a fair size and there was a centretable with some books on it  when we saw this we hesitated could we ask a man who owned books and could probably read to play second fiddle to a woman who could not speak the english language and who for years perhaps had devoted the energies of her soul to the sale of pepperpods  however the office of prime minister was no trifle and many more distinguished and more learned men than goliah brown have been glad to get it besides this we considered that blood is blood and in monarchical countries a queen is a queen this was a colony of a monarchy and we would push forward the claims of poquadilla the first we called her the first because although she may have had a good many ancestors of her name in africa she certainly started the line in the bahamas  goliah proved himself a steadygoing talker he seemed pleased to have us call on him and told us the whole story of the capture of himself and the rest of the africans we had heard pretty much all of it before but of course we had to politely listen to it again  when he finished we asked a few questions about the queen and finding that goliah admitted her claims to royal blood we told him what we proposed to do and boldly asked him to take the position of prime minister in the african community  at first he did not understand and we had to go over the thing two or three times before he saw into it then it was evident that he could not see what business this was of ours and we had to explain our motives which was some trouble because we had not quite straightened them out in our own minds  then he wanted to know which was the head person a queen or a prime minister we set forth the strict truth to him in this matter we told him that although a queen in a wellregulated monarchy actually occupies the highest place that the prime minister is the fellow who does the real governing he thought this might all be so but he did not like the idea of having any one especially jane henderson as he called her in a position higher than his own we did not say anything to him then about giving the queen her english name because we supposed that he had been used to speak of her in that way to white people but we determined to refer to this when matters should be settled  he was so set in his own opinion on this point of position that we were afraid we should be obliged to give the thing up he used very good arguments too he said that he had been elected to his present office by his fellow africans that he had held it a long time that he didnt think the rest of his people wanted him to give it up and he didnt think he wanted to give it up himself a prime minister might be all very well but he didnt know anything about it he knew what it was to be governor and was very well satisfied to leave things as they were  this was dampening just as the old fellow thought he had settled the matter a happy thought struck me we might make the monarchy an independent arrangement perhaps goliah would have no objection to that provided we did not interfere with his governorship if poquadilla should be recognized as a queen and crowned and provided with an income sufficient to keep her out of any retail business it was about all she could expect at her time of life she certainly would not care to do any governing the few subjects that we should enlist would be more like courtiers than anything else  i called rectus to the door and suggested this arrangement to him he thought it would be better than nothing and that it would be well to mention it  we did this and goliah thought a while  ef i lets her be call queen he said an she jist stay at home an min her own business an don run hersef agin me no way how much you spose she able to gib fur dat  illustration all right said goliah with a smile  rectus and i went again to the front door to consult and when we came back we said we thought she would be able to give a dollar  all right said goliah with a smile she kin jist go ahead and be queen only don let her run hersef agin me  this suited us and we paid the dollar and came away  more cash said rectus as we walked home  yes said i but what troubles me is that queens income i dont see now where its to come from for old goliah wont allow his people to be taxed for her thats certain  rectus agreed that things looked a little bluish but he thought we might pay the income ourselves until after the coronation and then we could see what else could be done this wasnt much of a plan but i couldnt think of anything better  the next day about noon we all went to see the real governor of the colony rectus and i didnt care much about doing this but corny insisted on it she was afraid of the policeand probably of the army and navy although she made light of themand so she thought it would be a good thing to see whether or not we should have to combat with all these forces if we should carry out our plans we took priscilla along with us on cornys account it would look respectable for her to have an attendant this being an extra job priscilla earned two sixpences that day  the governor lived in a fine house on the hill back of the town and although we all knew where it was priscilla was of great use to us here for she took us in at a side gate where we could walk right up to the door of the governors office without going to the grand entrance at the front of the house where the english flag was flying there was a redcoated soldier standing just in the doorway and when we saw him we put ourselves on our stiffest behavior we told priscilla to wait outside in the path and try and behave so that people would think there was a pretty hightoned party inside we then went up to the redcoat and asked to see the governor the soldier looked at us a little queerly and went back into the house  he staid a good while but when he came out he told us to follow him and took us through a hall into a room where two gentlemen were sitting at desks one of these jumped up and came to meet us  there is the secretary said the soldier in a low voice to me and then he left us  we now had to ask the secretary if we could see the governor he inquired our business but we didnt seem anxious to tell him  anything private he said with a smile  well sir said i its not exactly private but its not a very easy thing to put straight before anybody and if it dont make any difference wed rather not have to tell it twice  he hesitated for a minute and then he said hed see and went into another room  now look here i whispered to rectus if youre captain youve got to step up and do the talking it isnt my place  the secretary now returned and said the governor could give us a few minutes i think the probability was that he was curious to know what two boys and a girl could want with him  the governors office into which we now were shown was a large room with plenty of bookcases and shelves against the walls and in the middle of the floor a big table which was covered with papers packages of manuscript tied up with tape and every kind of thing necessary to make matters look as if business was brisk in these islands the governor himself was a tall handsome gentleman not old a bit as corny put it afterward and dressed all in white linen which gave him an air of coolness and cleanness that was quite agreeable to us after our walk in the sun he was sitting at one end of the long table and he politely motioned us to seats at one side of him i expect the secretary arranged the chairs before we came in we made our manners and sat down  well said he what can i do for you  if corny hadnt been along i dont believe he would have seen us at all there can be nothing attractive to a governor about two boys but almost any one would take an interest in a girl like corny the secretary was very polite to her  rectus now gave his throat a little clearing and pushed off  our business with you sir is to see about doing something for a poor queen a very good and honest woman  a poor but honest queen interrupted the governor with a smile  oh he dont mean a common queen said corny quickly he means a black queenan africanborn royal but taken prisoner when young and brought here and she lives over there in the african settlements and sells peppers but is just as much a queen as ever you know sir for selling things on a doorstep cant take the royal blood out of a person  oh no indeed said the governor and he looked very much tickled  and this poor woman is old now and has no revenue and has to get along as well as she can which is pretty poorly i know and nobody ever treats her any better than if she had been born a common person and we want to give her a chance of having as many of her rights as she can before she dies  at any rate said rectus who had been waiting for a chance to make a fresh start if we cant give her all her royal rights we want to let her know how it feels to be a queen and to give her a little show among her people  you are talking of an old native african woman said the governor looking at corny i have heard of her it seems to be generally agreed that she belonged to a royal family in one of the african tribes and you want to restore her to her regal station  we cant do that of course said corny but we do think shes been shamefully used and all we want to do is to have her acknowledged by her people she neednt do any ruling well fix her up so that shell look enough like a queen for those dreadfully poor people  yes put in rectus who had been getting warm on the subject they are dreadfully poor but shes the poorest of the lot and its a shame to see how she a regular queen has to live while a governor who wasnt anybody before he got his place lives in the best house with tables and books and everything he wants for all i know and a big flag in front of his door as if he was somebody great and  what said the governor pretty quick and sharp and turning around square on rectus  oh he dont mean you said corny hes talking about the black governor goliah brown  ah indeed said he turning away from rectus as if he didnt like his looks and what does brown think of all this  i thought id better say a word or two now because i didnt know where rectus would fetch us up next if we should give him another chance and so i said to the governor that i knew goliah brown would make no objections to the plan because we had talked it over with him and he had agreed to it  well then what do you want that i should do for you said the governor to corny  oh nothing sir said she but just to make it all safe for us we didnt know exactly what the rules were on this island and so we thought wed come and see you about it we dont want the policemen or the soldiers or sailors or anybody to get after us  there is no rule here against giving a queen her rights said the governor who seemed to be in a good humor as long as he talked to corny and no one shall interfere with you provided you do not commit any disorder and im sure you will not do that  oh no said corny we just intend to have a little coronation and to ask the people to remember that shes a queen and not a pepperpod woman and if you could just give us a paper commission and sign it we shouldat least i shouldfeel a good deal easier  you shall have it said the governor and he took some paper and a pen  it seems a little curious said he to corny as he dipped his pen in the ink that i should serve a queen and have a queen under me at the same time doesnt it  kind o sandwiched remarked rectus who had a face like frozen brass  the governor went on writing and corny and i looked at rectus as if we would singe his hair  you are all from the states i suppose said the governor  i said we were  what are your names he asked looking at corny first  cornelia v chipperton said corny and he wrote that down then he looked at me  william taylor gordon said i when the governor had put that on his paper he just gave his head a little wag toward rectus he didnt look at him  my name is samuel colbert said rectus  corny turned short on him with eyes wide open  samuel she said in a sort of theatrewhisper  now then said the governor this paper will show that you have full permission to carry out your little plans provided that you do nothing that may create any disorder if the womanyour queen i meanhas been in the habit of earning her own livelihood dont make a pauper of her and he gave us a general look as if the time had come to say goodbye so we got up and thanked him and he shook hands with us rectus and all and we came away  we found priscilla sitting crosslegged on the grass outside pitching pennies  that thar redcoat he want to sen me off said she but i tole him my missy and bosses was inside and i boun to wait fur em or git turned off so he le me stay  corny for a wonder did not reprove priscilla for giving the sentinel the idea that her employers hired pennypitchers to follow them around but she walked on in silence until we were out of the grounds then she turned to rectus and said  i thought your name was rectus  it isnt said he its samuel  this was no sort of an answer to give corny and so i explained that rectus was his school name that he was younger than most of us and that we used to call him young rectus but that i had pretty much dropped the young since we had been travelling together it didnt appear to be needed  but why did you call him rectus when his names samuel asked corny  well said i laughing it seemed to suit him  this was all that was said about the matter for priscilla came up and said she must hurry home and that shed like to have her sixpence and that changed the subject for we were out of small money and could only make up eleven halfpence among us but priscilla agreed to trust us until evening for the other hoppenny  corny didnt say much on the way home and she looked as if she was doing some private thinking i suppose among other things she thought that as i considered it all right to call rectus rectus she might as well do it herself for she said  rectus i dont think youre as good at talking as will is i move we have a new election for captain  all right said rectus im agreed  you couldnt make that boy angry we held a meeting just as we got to the hotel and he and corny both voted for me     chapter xiii  the coronation   in the afternoon we had our grand rally at the queens stairway corny couldnt come because her mother said she must not be running around so much so she staid at home and worked on the new flag for the coronation we designed this flag among us it had a black ground with a yellow sun just rising out of the middle of it it didnt cost much and looked more like a yellow cogwheel rolling in deep mud than anything else but we thought it would do very well  rectus and i had barely reached the stairs by the way of the old fort when priscilla made her appearance in the ravine at the head of a crowd of whooping barefooted young rascals who came skipping along as if they expected something to eat  id never be a queen said rectus if i had to have such a lot of subjects as that  dont think you would said i but we mustnt let em come up the stairs they must stay at the bottom so that we can harangue em so we charged down the stairs and made the adherents bunch themselves on the level ground  then we harangued them and they laughed and hurrahed and whistled and jumped while priscilla as an active emissary ran around among them punching them and trying to make them keep still and listen  but as they all promised to stick to us and the royal queen through thick and thin we didnt mind a little disorder  the next day but one was to be coronation day and we impressed it on the minds of the adherents that they must be sure to be on hand about ten in the morning in front of the queens hut we concluded not to call it a palace until after the ceremony  when we had said all we had to say we told the assemblage that it might go home but it didnt seem inclined to do anything of the kind  look a here boss said one of thema stout saucy fellow with the biggest hat and the biggest feet on the islandaint you agoin to give us nothin for comin round here  give you anything cried rectus blazing up suddenly thats a pretty way to talk its the subjects that have to give youll see pretty soon  just here i stopped him if he had gone on a few minutes longer he would have wound up that kingdom with a snap  we didnt bring you here said i to give you anything for it ought to be enough pay to any decent fellow to see a good old person like queen poquadilla get her rights  whos him asked several of the nearest fellows  he means jane henderson said priscilla you keep quiet  jane henderson dats all right don call her no names go ahead boss they cried laughing and shouting i went ahead  we cant pay you any money but if you will all promise again to be on hand before ten oclock day after tomorrow well take you down to the harbor now and give you a small dive  a wild promise rang up the sides of the ravine  a small dive is a ceremony somewhat peculiar to this island a visitorno native white man would ever think of such a thingstands on the edge of a pier or anywhere where the water is quite deep and tosses in a bit of money while the darkey boyswho are sure to be all ready when a visitor is standing on a pierdive for it its a lot of fun to see them do this and rectus and i had already chucked a good deal of small change into the harbor and had seen it come up again some of it before it got to the bottom these dives are called small because the darkeys want to put the thing mildly they couldnt coax anybody down to the water to give them a big dive  you see said i to rectus as we started down the ravine toward the river with the crowd of adherents marching in front weve got to have these fellows at the coronation so it wont do to scare em off now  we went down to a little public square in front of the town where there was a splendid divingplace a good many people were strolling about there but i dont suppose that a single person who saw those darkey fellows with nothing on but their cotton trouserswho stood in a line on the edge of the seawall and plunged in head foremost like a lot of frogs when i threw out a couple of big coppersever supposed that these rascals were diving for monarchical purposes the water was so clear that we could see them down at the bottom swimming and paddling around after the coppers when a fellow found one hed stick it in his mouth and come up as lively as a cricket and all ready for another scramble at the bottom  sometimes i threw in a silver check which is no bigger than a threecent piece but although the water was about fifteen feet deep it was never lost the fellows seemed just as much at home in the water as on land and i suppose they dont know how to get drowned we tried to toss the money in such a way that each one of them would have something but some of them were not smart enough to get down to the bottom in time and when we thought we had circulated enough specie we felt sure that there were two or three and perhaps more who hadnt brought up a penny  so when they all climbed out with their brown shoulders glistening i asked which one of them had come out without getting anything every manjack of them stepped forward and said he hadnt got a copper we picked out three little fellows gave them a few pennies apiece and came home  illustration a family dive  the next day we were all hard at work corny and her mother went down to the queens house and planned what they could get to fit up the place so that it would be a little more comfortable mrs chipperton must have added something to our eight dollars for she and corny came up into the town and bought a lot of things which made poquadillas best room look like another place the rockingchair was fixed up quite royally mrs chipperton turned out to be a better kind of a woman than i thought she was at first  we hired a man to cut a pole and set it up in the queens front yard for the flag and then rectus and i started out to get the crown i had thought that if we could find some sheetbrass i could manage to make a pretty good crown but there didnt seem to be anything of the kind in the place but after a good deal of looking we found a brass saucepan in a store which i thought would do very well for the foundation of a crown we bought this and took it around to a shop where a man mended pots and kettles for a shilling we hired the use of his tools for an hour and then rectus and i went to work we unriveted the handle and then i held the bottom edge of the saucepan to the grindstone while rectus turned and we soon ground the bottom off this left us a deep brass band quite big enough for a crown and as the top edge was rounded off it could be turned over on a persons head so as to sit quite comfortably with a coldchisel i cut long points in what would be the upper part of the crown and when i had filed these up a little the crown looked quite nobby we finished it by punching a lot of holes in the front part making them in the form of stars and circles with something red behind these the effect would be prodigious  at ten oclock sharp the next morning we were all at the queens house mrs chipperton was with us for she wished very much to see the ceremony i think mr chipperton would have been along but a gentleman took him out in his yacht that morning and i must admit that we all breathed a little bit freer without him there was a pretty fair crowd sitting around in the front yard when we reached the house and before long a good many more people came to see what was going on they were all negroes but i dont believe half of them were genuine native africans the queen was sitting inside with a red shawl on although it was a pretty warm day and wearing a new turban  we had arranged on the way to appoint a lot of court officials because there was no use of our being stingy in this respect when it didnt cost anything to do up the thing right so we picked out a good looking man for lord high chancellor and gave him a piece of red ribbon to tie in his buttonhole he hadnt any buttonhole anywhere except in his trousers so he tied it to the string which fastened his shirt together at the collar four old men we appointed to be courtiers and made them button up their coats for a wonder they all had coats we also made a lord high sheriff and a royal beadle and an usher of the white wand an officer mrs chipperton had read about and to whom we gave a whittled stick with strict instructions not to jab anybody with it corny had been reading a german novel and she wanted us to appoint a hofrath who is a german court officer of some kind he was a nice fellow in the novel and so we picked out the bestlooking young darkey we could find for the position  we each had our posts corny was to do the crowning and i was to make the speech rectus had his place by the flag which he was to haul up at the proper moment mrs chipperton undertook to stand by the old ladythat is the queenand give her any support she might happen to need during the ceremony  we intended having the coronation in the house but we found the crowd too large for this so we brought the rockingchair outofdoors and set it in front of the only window in the palace the yard was large enough to accommodate a good many people and those who could not get in had plenty of room out in the road we tried to make poquadilla take off her turban because a crown on a turban seemed to us something entirely out of order but she wouldnt listen to it we had the pleasantfaced neighborwoman as an interpreter and she said that it wasnt any use the queen would almost as soon appear in public without her head as without her turban so we let this pass for we saw very plainly that it wouldnt do to try to force too much on poquadilla for she looked now as if she thought we had come there to perform some operation on herperhaps to cut off her leg  about halfpast ten we led her out and made her sit down in the rockingchair mrs chipperton stood on one side of her holding one of her hands while the neighborwoman stood on the other side and held the other hand this arrangement however did not last long for poquadilla soon jerked her hands away thinking perhaps that if anything was done that hurt it might be better to be free for a jump  corny stood in front a little at one side holding the crown which she had padded and lined with red flannel i took my place just before mrs chipperton facing the crowd rectus was at the flagpole near the front of the yard holding the halyards in his hands ready to haul the hofrath was by him to help if anything got tangled and the four courtiers and the other officials had places in the front row of the spectators while priscilla stood by corny to be on hand should she be needed  when all was ready and corny had felt in her pocket to see that the permission paper was all right i began my speech it was the second regular speech i had ever madethe first one was at a school celebrationand i had studied it out pretty carefully it was intended of course for the negroes but i really addressed the most of it to mrs chipperton because i knew that she could understand a speech better than any one else in the yard when i had shown the matter up as plainly as i knew how and had given all the whys and wherefores i made a little stop for applause but i didnt get any they all stood waiting to see what would happen next as there was nothing more to say i nodded to corny to clap on the crown the moment she felt it on her head the queen stood up as straight as a hoehandle and looked quickly from side to side then i called out in my best voice  africans behold your queen  at this instant rectus ran up the black flag with the yellow cogwheel and we white people gave a cheer as soon as they got a cue the darkeys knew what to do they burst out into a wild yell they waved their hats they laid down on the grass and kicked they jumped and danced and laughed and screamed i was afraid the queen would bolt so i took a quiet hold of her shawl but she stood still until the crowd cooled down a little and then she made a courtesy and sat down  is that all asked the neighborwoman after she had waited a few moments  yes said i you can take her in  when the queen had been led within doors and while the crowd was still in a state of wild commotion i took a heavy bag of coppers from my coatpocketwhere it had been worrying me all through the ceremonyand gave it to priscilla  scatter that among the subjects said i  give em a big scrahmble in the road said she her eyes crackling with delight  yes said i and out she ran followed by the whole kingdom we white folk stood inside to watch the fun priscilla threw out a handful of pennies and the darkeys just piled themselves up in the road on top of the money you could see nothing but madly waving legs the mass heaved and tossed and moved from one side of the road to the other the lord high chancellor was at the bottom of the heap while the hofrath wiggled his bare feet high in the air every fellow who grabbed a penny had ten fellows pulling at him the women and small fry did not get into this mess but they dodged around and made snatches wherever they could get their hands into the pile of boys and men  they all yelled and shouted and tussled and scrambled until priscilla who was dancing around with her bag gave another throw into a different part of the road then every fellow jerked himself loose from the rest and a fresh rush was made and a fresh pile of darkeys arose in a minute  we stood and laughed until our backs ached but as i happened to look around at the house i saw the queen standing on her doorstep looking mournfully at the fun she was alone for even her good neighbor had rushed out to see what she could pick up i was glad to find that the new monarch who still wore her crownwhich no one would have imagined to have ever been a saucepanhad sense enough to keep out of such a scrimmage of the populace and i went back and gave her a shilling her face shone and i could see that she felt that she never could have grabbed that much  when there had been three or four good scrambles priscilla ran up the road a little way and threw out all the pennies that were left in the bag then she made a rush for them and having a good start she got there first and had both hands full of dust and pennies before any one else reached the spot she was not to be counted out of that game  after this last scramble we came away the queen had taken her throne indoors and we went in and shook hands with her telling her we would soon come and see how she was getting along i dont suppose she understood us but it didnt matter when we had gone some distance we looked back and there was still a pile of darkeys rolling and tumbling in the dust     chapter xiv  a hot chase   that afternoon rectus and i went over to the african settlement to see how the kingdom worked it was rather soon perhaps to make a call on the new queen but we were out for a walk and might as well go that way as any other  when we came near the house we heard a tremendous uproar and soon saw that there was a big crowd in the yard we couldnt imagine what was going on unless the queen had changed her shilling and was indulging in the luxury of giving a scramble we ran up quickly but the crowd was so large that we could not get into the yard nor see what all the commotion was about but we went over to the side of the yard andwithout being noticed by any of the people who seemed too much interested to turn aroundwe soon found out what the matter was  priscilla had usurped the throne  the rockingchair had been brought out and placed again in front of the window and there sat priscilla leaning back at her ease with the crown on her head a big fanmade of calfskinin her hand and a general air of superiority pervading her whole being behind her with her hand on the back of the chair stood poquadilla wearing her new turban but without the red shawl she looked as if something had happened  in front of the chair was the lord high chancellor he had evidently gone over to the usurper his red ribbon very dusty and draggled still hung from his shirtcollar the four courtiers sat together on a bench near the house with their coats still buttoned up as high as circumstances would allow they seemed sad and disappointed and probably had been deprived of their rank the hofrath stood in the front of the crowd he did not appear happy indeed he seemed a good deal ruffled both in mind and clothes perhaps he had defended his queen and had been roughly handled  priscilla was talking and fanning herself gracefully and lazily with her calfskin fan i think she had been telling the people what she intended to do and what she intended them to do but almost immediately after our arrival she was interrupted by the hofrath who said something that we did not hear but which put priscilla into a wild passion  she sprang to her feet and stood up in the chair while poor poquadilla held it firmly by the back so that it should not shake i supposed from this that priscilla had been standing up before and that our old friend had been appointed to the office of chairbackholder to the usurper  priscilla waved her fan high in air and then with her right hand she took off the crown held it up for a minute and replaced it on her head  afrikins behole yer queen said she at the top of her voice and leaning back so far that the rightful sovereign had a good deal of trouble to keep the chair from going over  dats me she cried look straight at me an ye see yer queen an how you dar you misribble hopgrog to say i no queen you serve to be killed take hole o him some uv you fellers grab dat hopgrog  at this two or three men seized the poor hofrath while the crowd cheered and laughed  take him an kill him shouted priscilla chop his head off  at this a wild shout of laughter arose and one of the men who held the hofrath declared as soon as he got his breath that they couldnt do thatthey had no hatchet big enough  priscilla stood quiet for a minute she looked over the crowd and then she looked at the poor hofrath who now began to show that he was a little frightened  you hopgrog said she how much money did you grab in dem scrahmbles  the hofrath put his hand in his pocket and pulled out some pennies  five big coppers said he sullenly  gim me dem said she and he brought them to her  now den you kin git out said she pocketing the money then she again raised her crown and replaced it on her head  afrikins behole your queen she cried  this was more than we could stand to see this usurpation and robbery made our blood boil we by ourselves could do nothing but we could get help we slipped away and ran down the road in the direction of the hotel we had not gone far before we saw coming along a crossroad the two yellowleg men we turned hurried up to them and hastily told them of the condition of things and asked if they would help us put down this usurpation they did not understand the matter at first but when we made them see how it stood they were greatly interested and instantly offered to join us  we can go down here to the policestation said i and get some help  no no said the tall yellowleg dont tell those fellows theyll only make a row of it and get somebody into trouble were enough to capture that usurper lets go for her  and we went  when we neared the crowd the shorter yellowleg mr burgan said that he would go first then his friend would come close behind him while rectus and i could push up after them by forming a line we could rush right through the crowd i thought i ought to go first but mr burgan said he was the stoutest and could better stand the pressure if the crowd stood firm  but the crowd didnt stand firm the moment we made our rush and the people saw us they scattered right and left and we pushed right through straight to the house priscilla saw us before we reached her and quick as lightning she made a dive for the door we rushed after her but she got inside and hurling the crown from her head dashed out of a backdoor we followed hotly but she was out of the yard over a wall and into a side lane almost before we knew it  then a good chase began priscilla had a long start of us for we had bungled at the wall but we were bound to catch her  i was a good runner and rectus was light and active although i am not sure that he could keep up the thing very long but the two yellowlegs surprised me they took the lead of us directly and kept it behind us came a lot of darkeys not trying to catch priscilla but anxious i suppose to see what was going to happen  priscilla still kept well ahead she had struck out of the lane into a road which led toward the outskirts of the town i think we were beginning to gain on her when all of a sudden she sat down with a shout we rushed on but before we reached her she had jerked off both her shoesshe didnt wear any stockingsand she sprang to her feet and was off again waving the shoes over her head she jumped and leaped and bounded like an indiarubber goat priscilla barefooted couldnt be caught by any man on the island we soon saw that she flew down the road with the white dust flying behind her until she reached a big limestone quarry where the calcareous buildingmaterial of the town is sawn out in great blocks and there she made a sharp turn and dashed down in among the stones we reached the place just in time to see her run across the quarry slip in between two great blocks that were standing up like statue pedestals on the other side and disappear  we rushed over we searched and looked here and there and everywhere and all the darkeys searched and looked but we found no priscilla she had gone away  puffing and blowing like four steamfireengines we sat down on some stones and wiped our faces  i guess we just ran that upstart queen out of her possessions said the tall yellowlegs dusting his boots with his handkerchief he was satisfied  we walked home by the road at the edge of the harbor the cool air from the water was very pleasant to us when we reached the hotel we found mr and mrs chipperton and corny sitting outside in the entrance court waiting for suppertime a lot of armchairs always stood there so that people might sit and wait for meals or anything else that they expected when corny heard the dreadful news of the fall of our kingdom she was so shocked that she could scarcely speak and as for mrs chipperton i thought she was going to cry corny wanted to rush right down to poquadillas house and see what could be done but we were all against that no harm would come to the old woman that night from the loss of her crown and it was too near suppertime for any attempt at restoration just then  only to think of it said mrs chipperton after all we did for her i dont believe she was queen more than an hour its the shortest reign i ever heard of  and that priscilla cried corny the girl we trusted to do so much and  paid every night said i  yes she continued and gave a pair of mothers shoes to for the coronation and to think that she should deceive us and do the usurping  the shorter yellowlegs who had been standing by with his friend now made a remark he evidently remembered corny on the oclawaha steamboat although he had never become acquainted with her or her family  did your queen talk french he asked with a smile or was not that the language of the court  no it wasnt said corny gravely african was the language of the court but the queen was too polite to use it before us because she knew we did not understand it and couldnt tell what she might be saying about us  good said the tall yellowlegs thats very good indeed burgan you owe her one  one what asked corny  another answer as good as that if i can ever think of it said mr burgan  corny did not reply i doubt if she heard him her soul still ached for her fallen queen  i tell you what it is said mr chipperton who had kept unaccountably quiet so far its a great pity that i did not know about this i should have liked nothing better than to be down there when that usurper girl was standing on that throne or rockingchair or whatever it was  oh my dear said mrs chipperton it would never have done for you to have exposed your lung to such a scene of turmoil and confusion  bother my lung cried mr chipperton who was now growing quite excited i would never have stood tamely by and witnessed such vile injustice  we didnt stand tamely by said i we ran wildly after the unjust one  i would have stood up before that crowd continued mr chipperton and i would have told the people what i thought of them i would have asked them how living in a land like this where the blue sky shines on them for nothing where cocoanut and the orange stand always ready for them to stretch forth their hands and take them where they need but a minimum of clothes and where the very sea around them freely yields up its fish and its conchsor that is to say they can get such things for a trifling sumi would have asked them i say howwhen free citizens of a republic such as we are come from our shores of liberty where kings and queens are despised and any throne that is attempted to be set up over us is crushed to atomsthat when we i say come over here and out of the pure kindness and generosity of our souls raise from the dust a povertystricken and downtrodden queen and place her as nearly as possible on the throne of her ancestors and put upon her head a crowna bauble which in our own land we trample under foot  at this i shuddered remembering the sharp points i had filed in our crown  and grind into the dust continued mr chippertoni would ask them i say how they could think of all this and then deliberately subvert at the behest of a young and giddy colored hireling the structure we had upraised and what could they have said to that i would like to know he asked looking around from one to another of us  give us a small dive boss suggested rectus  thats so said mr chipperton his face beaming into a broad smile i believe they would have said that very thing you have hit it exactly lets go in to supper  the next day rectus and i with corny and mrs chipperton walked down to the queens house to see how she fared and what could be done for her  when we reached poquadillas hut we saw her sitting on her doorstep by her side were several joints of sugarcane and close to them stood the crown neatly filled with scarlet pepperpods which hung very prettily over the peaked points of brass she was very still and her head rested on her breast  asleep whispered corny  yes said mrs chipperton softly and dont lets waken her shes very well off as she is and now that her house is a little more comfortable it would be well to leave her in peace to peddle what she pleases on her doorstep her crown will worry her less where it is than on her head  corny whispered to her mother who nodded and took out her pocketbook in a moment corny with some change in her hand went quietly up to the yard and put the money in the queens lap then we went away and left her still asleep  a day or two after this the tigress came in bringing the mail we saw her from one of the upper porticoes when she was just on the edge of the horizon and we knew her by the way she stood up high in the water and rolled her smokestack from side to side she was the greatest roller that ever floated i reckon but a jolly good ship for all that and we were glad enough to see her  there were a lot of letters for us in her mail i had nine from the boys at home not to count those from the family  we had just about finished reading our letters when corny came up to us to the silkcotton tree where we were sitting and said in a doleful tone  weve got to go home  home we cried out together when  tomorrow said corny on the tigress  all our good news and pleasant letters counted for nothing now  howwhy said i why do you have to go isnt this something new  rectus looked as if he had lost his knife and im sure i had never thought that i should care so much to hear that a girlno relationwas going away the next day  yes it is something new said corny who certainly had been crying although we didnt notice it at first its a horrid old lawsuit father just heard of it in a letter theres one of his houses in new york thats next to a lot and the man that owns the lot says fathers house sticks over four inches on his lot and he has sued him for thatjust think of it four inches only you couldnt do anything with four inches of dirt if you had it and father didnt know it and he isnt going to move his wall back now that he does know it for the people in the house would have to cut all their carpets or fold them under which is just as bad and he says he must go right back to new york and of course weve all got to go too which is the worst of it and mother and i are just awfully put out  whats the good of his going asked rectus cant he get a lawyer to attend to it all  oh you couldnt keep him here now said corny hes just wild to be off the man who sued him is a horrid person and father says that if he dont go right back the next thing hell hear will be that old colbert will be trying to get a foot instead of four inches  old colbert ejaculated rectus i guess that must be my father  if i had been rectus i dont think i should have been so quick to guess anything of that kind about my father but perhaps he had heard things like that before he took it as coolly as he generally took everything  corny was as red as a beet  your father she exclaimed i dont believe it ill go this very minute and see  rectus was right the stingy hankerer after what corny called four inches of dirt was his father mr chipperton came up to us and talked about the matter and it was all as plain as daylight when he found that mr colbert was the father of rectus mr chipperton was very much surprised and he called no more names although i am sure he had been giving old colbert a pretty disagreeable sort of a record but he sat down by rectus and talked to him as if the boy were his own father instead of himself and proved to him by every law of property in english latin or sanscrit that the four inches of ground were legally lawfully and without any manner of doubt his own and that it would have been utterly and absolutely impossible for him to have built his house one inch outside of his own land i whispered to rectus that the house might have swelled but he didnt get a chance to put in the suggestion  rectus had to agree to all mr chipperton saidor at least he couldnt differ with himfor he didnt know anything on earth about the matter and i guess he was glad enough when he got through im sure i was rectus didnt say anything except that he was very sorry that the chipperton family had to go home and then he walked off to his room  in about half an hour when i went upstairs i found rectus had just finished a letter to his father  i guess thatll make it all right he said and he handed me the letter to read it was a strictly business letter no nonsense about the folks at home he said that was the kind of business letter his father liked it ran like this            dear father mr chipperton has told me about your           suing him if he really has set his house over on           four inches of your lot i wish you would let it           stand there i dont care much for him but he has           a nice wife and a pleasant girl and if you go on           suing him the whole lot of them will leave here           tomorrow and theyre about the only people i           know except gordon if you want to you can take           a foot off any one of my three lots and that           ought to make it all right                       your affectionate son samuel colbert  have you three lots i asked a good deal surprised for i didnt know that rectus was a propertyowner  yes said he my grandmother left them to me  are they right next to your fathers lot which chipperton cut into  no theyre nowhere near it said rectus  i burst out laughing  that letter wont do any good i said  youll see said rectus and he went off to mail it  i dont know what kind of a business man mr chipperton was but when rectus told him that he had written a letter to his father which would make the thing all right he was perfectly satisfied and the next day we all went out in a sailboat to the coralreef and had a splendid time and the tigress went off without any chippertons i think mr chipperton put the whole thing down as the result of his lecture to rectus up in the silkcotton tree     chapter xv  a strange thing happens to me   for several days after our hot chase after priscilla we saw nothing of this exemissary indeed we began to be afraid that something had happened to her she was such a regular attendant at the hoteldoormarket that people were talking about missing her black face and her chattering tongue but she turned up one morning as gay and skippy as ever and we saw her leaning against the side of one of the doorways of the court in her favorite easy attitude with her head on one side and one foot crossed over the other which made her look like a bronze figure such as they put under kerosene lamps in one hand she had her big straw hat and in the other a bunch of rosebuds the moment she saw corny she stepped up to her  wont you buy some rosebuds missy she said de puttiest rosebuds i ever brought you yit  corny looked at her with a withering glare but priscilla didnt wither a bit she was a poor hand at withering  please buy em missy i kep em fur you i been akeepin em all de mornin  i dont see how you dare ask me to buy your flowers exclaimed corny go away i never want to see you again after all you did  please missy buy jist this one bunch these is the puttiest redrose buds in dis whole town de red roses nearly all gone  nearly all gone said i what do you mean by telling such a fibi was going to say lie which was nearer the truth if that isnt a bull but there were several ladies about and priscilla herself was a girl you know that there are red roses here all the year  please boss said priscilla rolling her eyes at me like an innocent calf wont you buy dese roses fur missy theys the puttiest roses i ever brought her yit  i guess youve got a calcareous conscience havent you said rectus  priscilla looked at him for a moment as if she thought that he might want to buy something of that kind but as she hadnt it to sell she tried her flowers on him  please boss wont you buy dese roses fur  no said rectus i wont  and we all turned and walked away it was no use to blow her up she wouldnt have minded it but she lost three customers  i said before that i was the only one in our party who liked fishing and for that reason i didnt go often for i dont care about taking trips of that kind by myself but one day mr burgan and the other yellowlegs told me that they were going to fish in lake killarney a lovely little lake in the interior of the island about five miles from the town and that if i liked i might go along i did like and i went  i should have been better pleased if they had gone there in a carriage but this wouldnt have suited these two fellows who had rigged themselves up in their buckskin boots and had all the tramping and fishing rigs that they used in the adirondacks and other sporting places where they told me they had been it was a long and a warm walk and trying to find a good place for fishing after we got to the lake made the work harder yet we didnt find any good place and the few fish we caught didnt pay for the trouble of going there but we walked all over a big pineapple plantation and had a splendid view from the highest hill on the whole island  it was pretty late in the afternoon when we reached home and i made up my mind that the next time i went so far to fish in a semitropical country id go with a party who wore suits that would do for riding  rectus and corny and mrs chipperton were up in the silkcotton tree when i got home and i went there and sat down mrs chipperton lent me her fan  corny and rectus were looking over the permission paper which the english governor had given us  i guess this isnt any more use now said corny as weve done all we can for kings and queens but rectus says that if you agree i can have it for my autograph book i never had a governors signature  certainly you can have it i said and hes a different governor from the common run none of your state governors but a real british governor like those old fellows they set over us in our colonydays  indeed said mrs chipperton smiling you must be able to remember a long way back  well you neednt make fun of this governor said corny for hes a real nice man we met him today riding in the funniest carriage you ever saw in your life its like a big babycarriage for twins only its pulled by a horse and has a man in livery to drive it the tops straw and you get in in the middle and sit both ways  either way my dear said mrs chipperton  yes either way continued corny did you ever see a carriage like that  i surely never did said i  well he was in it and some ladies and they stopped and asked rectus and i how we got along with our queen and when i told them all about it you ought to have heard them laugh and the governor he said that poquadilla shouldnt suffer after we went away even if he had to get all his pepperpods from her now wasnt that good  i admitted that it was but i thought to myself that a good supper and a bed would be better for i was awfully tired and hungry but i didnt say this  i slept as sound as a rock that night and it was pretty broad daylight when i woke up i dont believe that i would have wakened then but i wanted to turn over and couldnt and that is enough to make any fellow wake up  when i opened my eyes i found myself in the worst fix i had ever been in in my life i couldnt move my arms or my legs for my arms were tied fast to my body at the elbows and wrists and my feet and my knees were tied together i was lying flat on my back but i could turn my head over to where rectus bed stoodit was a small one like mineand he wasnt there i sung out  rectus and gave a big heave which made the bed rattle i was scared  in a second rectus was standing by me he had been sitting by the window he was all dressed  dont shout that way again he said in a low voice or ill have to tie this handkerchief over your mouth and he showed me a clean linen handkerchief all folded up ready i wont put it so that it will stop your breathing he said as coolly as if this sort of thing was nothing unusual ill leave your nose free  let me up you little rascal i cried did you do this  at that he deliberately laid the handkerchief over my mouth and fastened it around my head he was careful to leave my nose all right but i was so mad that i could scarcely breathe i knew by the way he acted that he had tied me and i had never had such a trick played on me before but it was no use to be mad i couldnt do anything though i tugged and twisted my very best he had had a good chance to tie me up well for i had slept so soundly i was regularly bandaged  he stood by me for a few minutes watching to see if i needed any more fixing but when he made up his mind that i was done up securely he brought a chair and sat down by the side of the bed and began to talk to me i never saw anything like the audacity of the boy  you neednt think it was mean to tie you when you were so tired and sleepy for i intended to do it this morning any way for you always sleep sound enough in the mornings to let a fellow tie you up as much as he pleases and i suppose youll say it was mean to tie you any way but you know well enough that its no use for me to argue with you for you wouldnt listen but now youve got to listen and i wont let you up till you promise never to call me rectus again  the little rascal i thought to myself i might have made some noise in spite of the handkerchief but i thought it better not for i didnt know what else he might pile on my mouth  it isnt my name and im tired of it he continued i didnt mind it at school and i didnt mind it when we first started out together but ive had enough of it now and ive made up my mind that ill make you promise never to call me by that name again  i vowed to myself that i would call him rectus until his hair was gray id write letters to him wherever he lived and direct them rectus colbert  illustration i wouldnt like it myself  there wasnt any other way to do it and so i did it this way he said im sorry really to have to tie you up so because i wouldnt like it myself and i wouldnt have put that handkerchief over your mouth if you had agreed to keep quiet but i dont want anybody coming in here until youve promised  promise i thought ill never promise you that while the world rolls round  i know you cant say anything with that handkerchief over your mouth but you dont have to speak your toes are loose when youre ready to promise never to call me rectus again just wag your big toe either one  i stiffened my toes as if my feet were cast in brass rectus moved his chair a little around so that he could keep an eye on my toes then he looked at his watch and said  its seven oclock now and thats an hour from breakfast time i dont want to keep you there any longer than i can help youd better wag your toe now and be done with it its no use to wait  wag i thought to myself never  i know what youre thinking he went on you think that if you lie there long enough youll be all right for when the chambermaid comes to do up the room i must let her in or else ill have to say youre sick and then the chippertons will come up  that was exactly what i was thinking  but that wont do you any good said he ive thought of all that  he was a curious boy how such a thing as this should have come into his mind i couldnt imagine he must have read of something of the kind but to think of his trying it on me i ground my teeth  he sat and watched me for some time longer once or twice he fixed the handkerchief over my mouth for he seemed anxious that i should be as comfortable as possible he was awfully kind to be sure  it isnt right that anybody should have such a name sticking to them always he said and if id thought youd have stopped it i wouldnt have done this but i knew you you would just have laughed and kept on  the young scoundrel why didnt he try me  yesterday when the governor met us corny called me rectus and even he said that was a curious name and he didnt remember that i gave it to him when he wrote that paper for us  oh ho that was it was it getting proud and meeting governors young prig  now rectus was quiet a little longer and then he got up  i didnt think youd be so stubborn he said but perhaps you know your own business best im not going to keep you there until breakfast is ready and people want to come in  then he went over to the window and came back directly with a little black paintpot with a brush in it  now said he if you dont promise in five minutes to never call me rectus again im going to paint onehalf of your face black i got this paint yesterday from the caneman on purpose  oilpaint i could smell it  now you may be sure im going to do it he said  oh i was sure when he said hed do a thing i knew hed do it i had no doubts about that he was great on sticking to his word  he had put his watch on the table near by and was stirring up the paint  youve only three minutes more he said this stuff wont wash off in a hurry and youll have to stay up here by yourself and wont need any tying its got stuff mixed with it to make it dry soon so that you neednt lie there very long after ive painted you you mustnt mind if i put my finger on your mouth when i take off the handkerchief ill be careful not to get any in your eyes or on your lips if you hold your head still one minute more will you promise  what a dreadful minute he turned and looked at my feet i gave one big twist in my bandages all held i wagged my toe  good said he i didnt want to paint you but i would have done it sure as shot if you hadnt promised now ill untie you i can trust you to stick to your wordi mean your wag he said with a grin  it took him a long time to undo me the young wretch had actually pinned long strips of muslin around me and he had certainly made a good job of it for they didnt hurt me at all although they held me tight enough he said as he was working at me that he had torn up two old shirts to make these bandages and had sewed some of the strips together the afternoon before he said he had heard of something like this being done at a school a pretty school that must have been  he unfastened my arms firstthat is as soon as he had taken the handkerchief off my mouthand the moment he had taken the bandage from around my ankles he put for the door but i was ready i sprang out of bed made one jump over his bed around which he had to go and caught him just at the door  he forgot that he should have left my ankles for me to untie for myself  i guess the people in the next rooms must have thought there was something of a rumpus in our room when i caught him  there was considerable coolness between colbert and me after that in fact we didnt speak i was not at all anxious to keep this thing up for i was satisfied and was perfectly willing to call it square but for the first time since i had known him colbert was angry i suppose every fellow no matter how goodnatured he may be must have some sort of a limit to what he will stand and colbert seemed to have drawn his line at a good thrashing  it wasnt hard for me to keep my promise to him for i didnt call him anything but i should have kept it all the same if we had been on the old terms  of course corny soon found out that there was something the matter between us two and she set herself to find out what it was  whats the matter with you and rectus she asked me the next day i was standing in the carriageway before the hotel and she ran out to me  you mustnt call him rectus said i he doesnt like it  well then i wont said she but what is it all about did you quarrel about calling him that i hate to see you both going about and not speaking to each other  i had no reason to conceal anything and so i told her the whole affair from the very beginning to the end  i dont wonder hes mad said she if you thrashed him  well and oughtnt i to be mad after the way he treated me i asked  yes she said it makes me sick just to think of being tied up in that wayand the black paint too but then you are so much bigger than he is that it dont seem right for you to thrash him  thats one reason i did it said i i didnt want to fight him as i should have fought a fellow of my own size i wanted to punish him do you think that when a father wants to whip his son he ought to wait until he grows up as big as he is  no said corny very gravely of course not but rectus isnt your son what shall i call him samuel or sam i dont like either of them and i wont say mr colbert i think rectus is a great deal nicer  so do i i said but thats his affair to be sure he isnt my son but hes under my care and if he wasnt it would make no difference id thrash any boy alive who played such a trick on me  unless he was bigger than you are said corny  well then id get you to help me youd do it wouldnt you corny  she laughed  i guess i couldnt help much and i suppose youre both right to be angry at each other but im awful sorry if things are going on this way it didnt seem like the same place yesterday nobody did anything at all  i tell you what it is corny said i youre not angry with either of us are you  no indeed said she and her face warmed up and her eyes shone  thats one comfort said i and i gave her a good handshake  it must have looked funny to see a boy and a girl shaking hands there in front of the hotel and a young darkey took advantage of our goodhumor and stealing out from a shady corner of the court sold us seven little red and black liquoriceseed for fourpencethe worst swindle that had been worked on us yet     chapter xvi  mr chipperton keeps perfectly cool   its of no use to deny the fact that nassau was a pretty dull place just about this time at least corny and i found it so and i dont believe young mr colbert was very happy for he didnt look it its not to be supposed that our quarrel affected the negroes or the sky or the taste of bananas but the darkeys didnt amuse me and my recollection of those days is that they were cloudy and that i wasnt a very good customer down in the markethouse by the harbor where we used to go and buy little figbananas which they didnt have at the hotel but which were mighty good to eat  colbert and i still kept up a frigid reserve toward each other he thought i suppose that i ought to speak first because i was the older and i thought that he ought to speak first because he was the younger  one evening i went up into my room having absolutely nothing else to do and there i found colbert writing i suppose he was writing a letter but there was no need of doing this at night as the mail would not go out for several days and there would be plenty of time to write in the daytime he hadnt done anything but lounge about for two or three days perhaps he came up here to write because he had nothing else to do  there was only one table and i couldnt write if i had wanted to so i opened my trunk and began to put some of my things in order we had arranged before we had fallen out that we should go home on the next steamer and mr and mrs chipperton were going too we had been in nassau nearly a month and had seen about as much as was to be seenin an ordinary way as for me i couldnt afford to stay any longer and that had been the thing that had settled the matter as far as colbert and i were concerned but now he might choose to stay and come home by himself however there was no way of my knowing what he thought and i supposed that i had no real right to make him come with me at any rate if i had i didnt intend to exercise it  while i was looking over the things in my trunk i came across the box of dominoes that corny had given us to remember her by it seemed like a long time ago since we had been sitting together on the waterbattery at st augustine in a few minutes i took the box of dominoes in my hand and went over to colbert as i put them on the table he looked up  what do you say to a game of dominoes i said this is the box corny gave us we havent used it yet  very well said he and he pushed away his paper and emptied the dominoes out on the table then he picked up some of them and looked at them as if they were made in some new kind of a way that he had never noticed before and i picked up some too and examined them then we began to play we did not talk very much but we played as if it was necessary to be very careful to make no mistakes i won the first game and i could not help feeling a little sorry while colbert looked as if he felt rather glad we played until about our ordinary bedtime and then i said  well colbert i guess we might as well stop and he said  very well  but he didnt get ready to go to bed he went to the window and looked out for some time and then he came back to the table and sat down he took his pen and began to print on the lid of the dominobox which was of smooth white wood he could print names and titles of things very neatly a good deal better than i could  when he had finished he got up and began to get ready for bed leaving the box on the table pretty soon i went over to look at it for i must admit i was rather curious to see what he had put on it this was the inscription he had printed on the lid                  given to               will and rectus                     by                   corny           st augustine florida                                       there was a place left for the date which i suppose he had forgotten i made no remark about this inscription for i did not know exactly what remark was needed but the next morning i called him rectus just the same as ever for i knew he had printed our names on the box to show me that he wanted to let me off my promise i guess the one time i called him colbert was enough for him  when we came down stairs to breakfast talking to each other like common people it was better than most shows to see cornys face she was standing at the front door not far from the stairs and it actually seemed as if a candle had been lighted inside of her her face shone  i know i felt firstrate and i think rectus must have felt pretty much the same for his tongue rattled away at a rate that wasnt exactly usual with him there was no mistaking cornys feelings  after breakfast when we all got together to talk over the plans of the daya thing we hadnt done for what seemed to me about a weekwe found outor rather rememberedthat there were a lot of things in nassau that we hadnt seen yet and that we wouldnt miss for anything we had been wasting time terribly lately and the weather was now rather better for going about than it had been since we came to the place  we agreed to go to fort charlotte that morning and see the subterranean rooms and passageways and all the underground dreariness of which we had heard so much the fort was built about a hundred years ago and has no soldiers in it to go around and look at the old forts in this part of the world might make a person believe the millennium had come they seem just about as good as ever they were but theyre all on a peacefooting rectus said they were played out but id rather take my chances in fort charlotte during a bombardment than in some of the newstyle forts that i have seen in the north it is almost altogether underground in the solid calcareous and what could any fellow want better than that the cannonballs and bombs would have to plow up about an acre of pretty solid rock and plow it deep too before they would begin to scratch the roof of the real strongholds of this fort at least thats the way i looked at it  we made up a party and walked over its at the western end of the town and about a mile from the hotel mr and mrs chipperton were with us and a lady from chicago and mr burgan the other yellowlegs went out riding with his wife but i think he wanted to go with us the fort is on the top of a hill and a colored shoemaker is in command he sits and cobbles all day except when visitors come and then he shows them around he lighted a lamp and took us down into the dark quiet rooms and cells that were cut out of the solid rock down deep into the hill and it was almost like being in a coalmine only it was a great deal cleaner and not so deep but it seemed just as much out of the world in some of the rooms there were bats hanging to the ceilings we didnt disturb them one of the rooms was called the governors room there wasnt any governor there of course but it had been made by the jolly old earl who had the place cut outand who was governor here at the timeas a place where he might retire when he wanted to be private it was the most private apartment i ever saw this earl was the same old dunmore we used to study about in our histories he came over here when the revolution threw him out of business in our country he had some good ideas about chiselling rock  this part of the fort was so extremely subterranean and solemn that it wasnt long before mrs chipperton had enough of it and we came up it was fine to get out into the open air and see the blue sky and the bright sparkling water of the harbor just below us and the islands beyond and still beyond them the blue ocean with everything so bright and cheerful in the sunlight if i had been governor of this place i should have had my private room on top of the fort although of course that wouldnt do so well in times of bombardment  but the generalinchief did not let us off yet he said hed show us the most wonderful thing in the whole place and then he took us outofdoors again and led us to a little shed or enclosed doorway just outside of the main part of the fort but inside of the fortifications where he had his bench and tools he moved away the bench and then we saw that it stood on a wooden trapdoor he took hold of a ring and lifted up this door and there was a round hole about as big as the hind wheel of a carriage it was like a well and was as dark as pitch when we held the lamp over it however we could see that there were winding steps leading down into it these steps were cut out of the rock as was the hole and the pillar around which the steps wound it was all one piece the general took his lamp and went down ahead and we all followed one by one those who were most afraid and went last had the worst of it for the lamp wasnt a calcium light by any means and their end of the line was a good deal in the dark but we all got to the bottom of the well at last and there we found a long narrow passage leading under the very foundation or bottom floor of the whole place and then it led outside of the fort under the moat which was dry now but which used to be full of water and so on and on in black darkness to a place in the side of the hill or somewhere where there had been a lookout whether there were any passages opening into this or not i dont know for it was dark in spite of the lamp and we all had to walk in single file so there wasnt much chance for exploring sidewise when we got to the end we were glad enough to turn around and come back it was a good thing to see such a place but there was a feeling that if the walls should cave in a little or a big rock should fall from the top of the passage we should all be hermetically canned in very close quarters when we came out we gave the shoemaker commander some money and came away  isnt it nice said corny that he isnt a queen to be taken care of and we can just pay him and come away and not have to think of him any more  we agreed to that but i said i thought we ought to go and take one more look at our old queen before we left mrs chipperton who was a really sensible woman when she had a chance objected to this because she said it would be better to let the old woman alone now we couldnt do anything for her after we left and it would be better to let her depend on her own exertions now that she had got started again on that track i didnt think that the word exertion was a very good one in poquadillas case but i didnt argue the matter i thought that if some of us dropped around there before we left and gave her a couple of shillings it would not interfere much with her mercantile success in the future  i thought this but corny spoke it right outat least what she said amounted to pretty much the same thing  well said her mother we might go around there once more especially as your father has never seen the queen at all mr chipperton would you like to see the african queen  mr chipperton did not answer and his wife turned around quickly she had been walking ahead with the chicago lady  why where is he she exclaimed we all stopped and looked about but couldnt see him he wasnt there we were part way down the hill but not far from the fort and we stopped and looked back and then corny called him i said that i would run back for him as he had probably stopped to talk with the shoemaker rectus and i both ran back and corny came with us the shoemaker had put his bench in its place over the trapdoor and was again at work but mr chipperton was not talking to him  ill tell you what i believesaid corny gasping  but it was of no use to wait to hear what she believed i believed it myself  hello i cried to the shoemaker before i reached him did a gentleman stay behind here  i didnt see none said the man looking up in surprise as we charged on him  then i cried hes shut down in that well jump up and open the door  the shoemaker did jump up and we helped him move the bench and had the trapdoor open in no time by this the rest of the party had come back and when mrs chipperton saw the well open and no mr chipperton about she turned as white as a sheet we could hardly wait for the man to light his lamp and as soon as he started down the winding stairs rectus and i followed him i called back to mrs chipperton and the others that they need not come we would be back in a minute and let them know but it was of no use they all came we hurried on after the man with the light and passed straight ahead through the narrow passage to the very end of it  there stood mr chipperton holding a lighted match which he had just struck he was looking at something on the wall as we ran in he turned and smiled and was just going to say something when corny threw herself into his arms and his wife squeezing by took him around his neck so suddenly that his hat flew off and bumped on the floor like an empty tin can he always wore a high silk hat he made a grab for his hat and the match burned his fingers  aouch he exclaimed as he dropped the match whats the matter  oh my dear exclaimed his wife how dreadful to leave you here shut up alone in this awful place but to think we have found you  no trouble about that i should say remarked mr chipperton going over to the other side of the den after his hat you havent been gone ten minutes and its a pretty straight road back here  but how did it happen why did you stay werent you frightened did you stay on purpose we all asked him at pretty much one and the same time  i did stay on purpose said he but i did not expect to stay but a minute and had no idea you would go and leave me i stopped to see what in the name of common sense this place was made for i tried my best to make some sort of an observation out of this long narrow loophole but found i could see nothing of importance whatever and so i made up my mind it was money thrown away to cut out such a place as this to so little purpose when i had entirely made up my mind i found on turning around that you had gone and although i called i received no answer  then i knew i was alone in this place but i was perfectly composed no agitation no tremor of the nerves absolute selfcontrol the moment i found myself deserted i knew exactly what to do i did precisely the same thing that i would have done had i been left alone in the mammoth cave or the cave of fingal or any place of the kind  i stood perfectly still  if you will always remember to do that and he looked as well as he could from one to another of us you need never be frightened no matter how dark and lonely a cavern you may be left in strive to reflect that you will soon be missed and that your friends will naturally come back to the place where they saw you last stay there keep that important duty in your mind stay just where you are if you run about to try and find your way out you will be lost you will lose yourself and no one can find you  instances are not uncommon where persons have been left behind in the mammoth cave of kentucky and who were not found by searching parties for a day or two and they were almost invariably discovered in an insane condition they rushed wildly about in the dark got away from the ordinary paths of tourists couldnt be found and went crazya very natural consequence now nothing of the kind happened to me i remained where i was and here you see in less than ten minutes i am rescued  and he looked around with a smile as pleasant as if he had just invented a new sewingmachine  but were you not frightenedawestruck in this dark and horrible place alone inquired mrs chipperton holding on to his arm  no said he it was not very dark just here that slit let in a little light that is all it is good for though why light should be needed here i cannot tell and then i lighted matches and examined the wall i might find some trace of some sensible intention on the part of the people who quarried this passage but i could find nothing what i might have found had i moved about i cannot say i had a whole box of matches in my pocket but i did not move  well said mr burgan i think youd better move now i for one am convinced that this place is of no use to me and i dont like it  i think mr burgan was a little out of temper  we now started on our way out of the passage mrs chipperton holding tight to her husband for fear i suppose that he might be inclined to stop again  i didnt think said she as she clambered up the dark and twisting steps that i should have this thing to do so soon again but no one can ever tell what strange things may happen to them at any time  when fathers along added corny  this was all nuts to the shoemaker for we gave him more money for his second trip down the well i hope this didnt put the idea into his head of shutting people down below and making their friends come after them and pay extra  there are some things about mr chipperton that i like said rectus as we walked home together  yes said i some things  i like the cool way in which he takes bad fixes continued rectus who had a fancy for doing things that way himself dont you remember that time he struck on the sandbank he just sat there in the rain waiting for the tide to rise and made no fuss at all and here he kept just as cool and comfortable down in that dungeon he must have educated his mind a good deal to be able to do that  it may be very well to educate the mind to take things coolly said i but id a great deal rather educate my mind not to get me into such fixes  i suppose that would be better said rectus after thinking a minute  and now we had but little time to see anything more in nassau in two days the tigris would be due and we were going away in her so we found we should have to bounce around in a pretty lively way if we wanted to be able to go home and say we had seen the place     chapter xvii  what boy has done boy may do   there was one place that i wished particularly to visit before i left and that was what the people in nassau called the coralreef there were lots of coralreefs all about the islands but this one was easily visited and for this reason i suppose was chosen as a representative of its class i had been there before and had seen all the wonders of the reef through a waterglasswhich is a wooden box with a pane of glass at one end and open at the other you hold the glass end of this box just under the water and put your face to the open end and then you can see down under the water exactly as if you were looking through the air and on this coralreef where the water was not more than twelve or fourteen feet deep there were lots of beautiful things to see it was like a submarine garden there was coral in every form and shape and of different colors there were seafeathers which stood up like waving purple trees most of them a foot or two high but some a good deal higher there were seafans purple and yellow that spread themselves up from the curious bits of coralrock on the bottom and there were ever so many other things that grew like bushes and vines and of all sorts of colors among all these you could see the fishes swimming about as if they were in a great aquarium some of these fishes were very large with handsome black bands across their backs but the prettiest were some little fellows no bigger than sardines that swam in among the branches of the seafeathers and fans they were colored bright blue and yellow and red some of them with two or three colors apiece rectus called them hummingfishes they did remind me of hummingbirds although they didnt hum  when i came here before i was with a party of ladies and gentlemen we went in a large sailboat and took several divers with us to go down and bring up to us the curious things that we would select as we looked through the waterglass there wasnt anything peculiar about these divers they wore linen breeches for diving dresses and were the same kind of fellows as those who dived for pennies at the town  now what i wanted to do was to go to the coralreef and dive down and get something for myself it would be worth while to take home a seafan or something of that kind and say you brought it up from the bottom of the sea yourself any one could get things that the divers had brought up to be sure the sea wasnt very deep here but it had a bottom all the same i was not so good a swimmer as these darkeys who ducked and dived as if they had been born in the water but i could swim better than most fellows and was particularly good at diving so i determined if i could get a chance to go down after some of those things on the coralreef  i couldnt try this before because there were too many people along but rectus who thought the idea was splendid although he didnt intend to dive himself agreed to hire a sailboat with me and go off to the reef with only the darkey captain  we started as early as we could get off on the morning after we had been at fort charlotte the captain of the yachtthey give themselves and their sailboats big titles herewas a tall colored man named chris and he took two big darkey boys with him although we told him we didnt want any divers but i suppose he thought we might change our minds i didnt tell him i was going to dive he might not have been willing to go in that case  we had a nice sail up the harbor between the large island upon which the town stands and the smaller ones that separate the harbor from the ocean after sailing about five miles we turned out to sea between two islands and pretty soon were anchored over the reef  now then boss said captain chris dont ye want these here boys to do some divin for ye  i told you i wouldnt want them said i im going to dive myself  you dive boss cried all three of the darkeys at once and the two boys began to laugh  ye cant do that boss said the captain ef ye aint used to this here kind o divin ye cant do nothin at all under this water ye better let the boys go for ye  no said i im going myself and i began to take off my clothes  the colored fellows didnt like it much for it seemed like taking their business away from them but they couldnt help it and so they just sat and waited to see how things would turn out  youd better take a look through the glass before you dive said rectus and choose what youre going to get  im not going to be particular i replied i shall get whatever i can  the tides pretty strong said the captain youve got to calkelate fur that  i was obliged for this information which was generous on his part considering the circumstances and i dived from the bow as far out as i could jump down i went but i didnt reach the bottom at all my legs grazed against some branches and things but the tide had me back to the boat in no time and i came up near the stern which i seized and got on board  both the colored boys were grinning and the captain said  ye cant dive thataway boss youll never git to the bottom at all thataway you must go right down ef you go at all  i knew that but i must admit i didnt care much to go all the way down when i made the first dive just as i jumped i thought of the hard sharp things at the bottom and i guess i was a little too careful not to dive into them  but now i made a second dive and i went down beautifully i made a grab at the first thing my hand touched it was a purple knob of coral but it stuck tight to its motherrock and i was ready to go up before it was ready to come loose and so i went up without it  t aint easy to git them things said the captain and the two boys said  no indeed boss ye cahnt git them things dataway  i didnt say anything but in a few minutes i made another dive i determined to look around a little this time and seize something that i could break off or pull up i found that i couldnt stay under water like the darkeys could that required practice and perhaps more fishy lungs  down i went and i came right down on a small seafan which i grabbed instantly that ought to give way easily but as i seized it i brought down my right foot into the middle of a big round sponge i started as if i had had an electric shock the thing seemed colder and wetter than the water it was slimy and sticky and horrid i did not see what it was and it felt as if some great suckerfish with a cold woolly mouth was trying to swallow my foot i let go of everything and came right up and drew myself puffing and blowing on board the boat  how captain chris laughed he had been watching me through the waterglass and saw what had scared me  why boss said he sponges dont eat people that was nice and sof to tread on a sight better than cuttin yer foot on a piece o coral  that was all very well but im sure captain chris jumped the first time he ever put his bare foot into a sponge under water  i spose yere goin to gib it up now boss said the captain  no im not i answered i havent brought up anything yet im going down again  youd better not said rectus three times is all that anybody ever tries to do anything if at first you dont succeed try try again one two three youre not expected to try four times and besides youre tired  ill be rested in a minute said i and then ill try once more im all right you neednt worry  but rectus did worry i must have looked frightened when i came up and i believe he had caught the scare boys will do that the captain tried to keep me from going in again but i knew it was all nonsense to be frightened i was going to bring up something from the bottom if it was only a pebble  so after resting a little while and getting my breath again down i went i was in for anything now and the moment i reached the bottom i swept my arm around and seized the first thing i touched it was a pretty big thing for it was a seafeather over five feet higha regular tree i gave a jerk at it but it held fast i wished most earnestly that i had taken hold of something smaller but i didnt like to let go i might get nothing else i gave another jerk but it was of no use i felt that i couldnt hold my breath much longer and must go up i clutched the stem of the thing with both hands i braced my feet against the bottom i gave a tremendous tug and push and up i came to the top seafeather and all  with both my hands full i couldnt do much swimming and the tide carried me astern of the boat before i knew it  rectus was the first to shout to me  drop it and strike out he yelled but i didnt drop it i took it in one hand and swam with the other but the tide was strong and i didnt make any headway indeed i floated further away from the boat  directly i heard a splash and in a moment afterward it seemed the two darkey divers were swimming up to me  drop dat said one of them an well take ye in  no i wont i spluttered still striking out with my legs and one arm take hold of this and we can all go in together  i thought that if one of them would help me with the seafeather which seemed awfully heavy two of us could certainly swim to the boat with four legs and two arms between us  but neither of them would do it they wanted me to drop my prize and then theyd take hold of me and take me in we were disputing and puffing and floating further and further away when up came captain chris swimming like a shark he had jerked off his clothes and jumped in when he saw what was going on he just put one hand under my right arm in which i held the seafeather and then we struck out together for the boat it was like getting a tow from a tugboat we were alongside in no time captain chris was the strongest and best swimmer i ever saw  illustration we struck out together for the boat  rectus was leaning over ready to help and he caught me by the arm as i reached up for the side of the boat  no said i take this and he seized the seafeather and pulled it in then the captain gave me a hoist and i clambered on board  the captain had some towels under the little forward deck and i gave myself a good rub down and dressed then i went to look at my prize no wonder it was heavy it had a young rock a foot long fast to its root  you spiled one o de puttiest things in that garden down there said the captain i allus anchored near that tall feather and all de vistors used to talk about it i didnt think youd bring it up when i seed you grab it but you must a give a powerful heave to come up with all that stone  i dont think you ought to have tried to do that said rectus who looked as if he hadnt enjoyed himself i didnt know you were so obstinate  well said i the truth of the matter is that i am a fool sometimes and i might as well admit it but now lets see what weve got on this stone  there was a lot of curious things on the piece of rock which had come up with the seafeather there were small shells of different shapes and colors with the living creatures inside of them and there were mosses and seaweed and little sponges and small seaplants tipped with red and yellow and more things of the kind than i can remember it was the handsomest and most interesting piece of coralrock that i had seen yet  as for the big purple seafeather it was a whopper but too big for me to do anything with it when we got home rectus showed it around to the chippertons and some of the people at the hotel and told them that i dived down and brought it up myself but i couldnt take it away with me for it was much too long to go in my trunk so i gave it next day to captain chris to sell if he chose but i believe he took it back and planted it again in the submarine garden so that his passengers could see how tall a seafeather could grow when it tried i chipped off a piece of the rock however to carry home as a memento i was told that the things growing on iti picked off all the shellswould make the clothes in my trunk smell badly but i thought id risk it  after all said rectus that night what was the good of it that little piece of stone dont amount to anything and you might have been drowned  i dont think i could have been drowned said i for i should have dropped the old thing and floated if i had felt myself giving out but the good of it was this it showed me what a disagreeable sort of place a seagarden is when you go down into it to pick things  which you wont do again in a hurry i reckon said rectus  youre right there my boy i answered  the next day the chippertons and ourselves took a twohorse barouche and rode to the caves some six or seven miles from the town we had a long walk through the pineapple fields before we came to the biggest cave and found it wasnt very much of a cave after all though there was a sort of a room on one side which looked like a church with altar pillars and arches there was a little hole on one side of this room about three feet wide which led our negro guide said to a great cave which ran along about a mile until it reached the sea there was no knowing what skeletons and treasures and old halfdecayed boxes of coins hidden by pirates and swords with jewels in the handles and loose jewels and silver plate and other things we might have found in that cave if we had only had a lantern or some candles to light us while we were wandering about in it but we had no candles or lantern and so did not become a pirates heirs it was corny who was most anxious to go in she had read about blackbeard and the other pirates who used to live on this island and she felt sure that some of their treasures were to be found in that cave if she had thought of it she would have brought a candle  the only treasures we got were some long things like thin ropes which hung from the roof to the floor of the cave we were in this cave wasnt dark because nearly all of one side of it was open these ropes were roots or young trunks from banyantrees growing on the ground above and which came through the cracks in the rocks and stretched themselves down so as to root in the floor of the cave and make a lot of underground trunks for the tree above the banyantree is the most enterprising trunkmaker i ever heard of  we pulled down a lot of these banyan ropes some of them more than twenty feet long to take away as curiosities corny thought it would be splendid to have a jumpingrope made of a banyan root or rather trunklet the banyans here are called wild figtrees which they really are wherever they grow there is a big one not far from the town which stands by itself and has a lot of trunks coming down from the branches it would take the conceit out of a hurricane i think if it tried to blow down a banyantree  the next day was sunday and our party went to a negro church to hear a preacher who was quite celebrated as a colored orator he preached a good sensible sermon although he didnt meddle much with grammar the people were poorly dressed and some of the deacons were barefooted but they were all very clean and neat and they appeared to be just as religious as if they had all ridden in carriages to some fifth avenue church in new york     chapter xviii  i wake up mr chipperton   about nine oclock on monday morning the tigris came in when we boarded her which we did almost as soon as the stairs had been put down her side we found that she would make a shorter stay than usual and would go out that evening at high tide so there was no time to lose after the letters had been delivered at the hotel and we had read ours we sent our trunks on board and went around to finish up nassau we rowed over to hog island opposite the town to see once more the surf roll up against the high jagged rocks we ran down among the negro cottages and the negro cabins to get some fruit for the trip and we rushed about to bid goodbye to some of our old friendspoquadilla among them corny went with us this time every darkey knew we were going away and it was amazing to see how many of them came to bid us goodbye and ask for some coppers  after supper we went on board the steamer and about ten oclock she cast loose and as she slowly moved away we heard the old familiar words  give us a small dive boss  they came from a crowd of darkey boys on the wharf but although the moon was shining brightly we didnt think they could see coppers on the bottom that night they might have found a shilling or a halfdollar but we didnt try them  there were a couple of english officers on board from the barracks and we thought that they were going to take a trip to the united states but the purser told us that they had no idea of doing that themselves but were trying to prevent one of the redcoats as the common soldiers were generally called from leaving the island he had been missed at the barracks and it was supposed that he was stowed away somewhere on the vessel the steamer had delayed starting for half an hour so that search might be made for the deserter but she couldnt wait any longer if she wanted to get over the bar that night and so the lieutenants or sergeants or whatever they were had to go along and come back in the pilotboat  when we got outside we lay to with the pilotboat alongside of us and the hold of the vessel was ransacked for the deserter corny openly declared that she hoped they wouldnt find him and im sure i had a pretty strong feeling that way myself but they did find him he was pulled out from behind some barrels in a dark place in the hold and hurried up on deck we saw him as he was forced over the side of the vessel and almost dropped into the pilotboat which was rising and falling on the waves by the side of the ship then the officers scrambled down the side and jumped into the boat the line was cast off the negro oarsmen began to pull away and the poor redcoat took his doleful journey back to nassau he must have felt pretty badly about it i have no doubt that when he hid himself down there in that dark hold just before the vessel started he thought he had made a pretty sure thing of it and that it would not be long before he would be a free man and could go where he pleased and do what he pleased in the wide united states but the case was very different now i suppose it was wrong of course for him to desert and probably he was a mean sort of a fellow to do it but we were all very sorry to see him taken away corny thought that he was very likely a good man who had been imposed upon and that therefore it was right to run away it was quite natural for a girl to think that  the moment the pilotboat left us the tigris started off in good earnest and went steaming along on her course and it was not long before we started off also in good earnest for our berths we were a tired set  the trip back was not so pleasant as our other little voyage when we were coming to the bahamas the next day was cloudy and the sea was rough and choppy the air was mild enough for us to be on deck but there was a high wind which made it uncomfortable rectus thought he could keep on his wide straw hat but he soon found out his mistake and had to get out his scotch cap which made him look like a very different fellow  there were not very many passengers on board as it was scarcely time for the majority of people to leave nassau they generally stay until april i think besides our party of five there were several gentlemen and ladies from the hotel and as we knew them all tolerably well we had a much more sociable time than when we came over still for my part i should have preferred fair weather bright skies and plenty of nautiluses and flyingfish  the yellowlegged party remained at nassau i was a little sorry for this too as i liked the men pretty well now that i knew them better they certainly were good walkers  toward noon the wind began to blow harder and the waves ran very high the tigris rolled from side to side as if she would go over and some of the ladies were a good deal frightened but she always came up again all right no matter how far over she dipped and so in time they got used to it i proved to mrs chipperton that it would be impossible for the vessel to upset as the great weight of ballast freight machinery etc in the lower part of her would always bring her deck up again even if she rolled entirely over on her side which sometimes she seemed as if she was going to do but she always changed her mind just as we thought the thing was going to happen the first mate told me that the reason we rolled so was because we had been obliged to take in all sail and that the mainsail had steadied the vessel very much before the wind got so high this was all very well but i didnt care much to know why the thing was there are some people who think a things all right if they can only tell you the reason for it  before dark we had to go below for the captain said he didnt want any of us to roll overboard and besides the spray from the high waves made the deck very wet and unpleasant none of us liked it below there was no place to sit but in the long saloon where the diningtables were and after supper we all sat there and read mr chipperton had a lot of novels and we each took one but it wasnt much fun i couldnt get interested in my storyat least not in the beginning of it i think that people who want to use up time when they are travelling ought to take what rectus called a begun novel along with them he had got on pretty well in his book while he was in nassau and so just took it up now and went right along  the lamps swung so far backward and forward above the table that we thought they would certainly spill the oil over us in one of their wild pitches the settees by the table slid under us as the ship rolled so that there was no comfort and any one who tried to walk from one place to another had to hang on to whatever he could get hold of or be tumbled up against the tables or the wall some folks got seasick and went to bed but we tried to stick it out as long as we could  the storm grew worse and worse sometimes a big wave would strike the side of the steamer just behind us with a tremendous shock the ladies were always sure she had struck something when this happened but when they found it was only water that she had struck they were better satisfied at last things grew to be so bad that we thought we should have to go to bed and spend the night holding on to the handles at the back of our berths when all of a sudden there was a great change the rolling stopped and the vessel seemed to be steaming along almost on an even keel she pitched somewhat forward and aftthat is her bow and her stern went up and down by turnsbut we didnt mind that as it was so very much better than the wild rolling that had been kept up so long  i wonder what this means said mr chipperton actually standing up without holding on to anything can they have got into a current of smooth water  i didnt think this was possible but i didnt stop to make any conjectures about it rectus and i ran up on the forward deck to see how this agreeable change had come about the moment we got outside we found the wind blowing fearfully and the waves dashing as high as ever but they were not plunging against our sides we carefully worked our way along to the pilothouse and looked in the captain was inside and when he saw us he opened the door and came out he was going to his own room just back of the pilothouse and he told us to come with him  he looked tired and wet and he told us that the storm had grown so bad that he didnt think it would be right to keep on our course any longer we were going to the northwest and the storm was coming from the northeast and the waves and the wind dashed fair against the side of the vessel making her roll and careen so that it began to be unsafe so he had put her around with her head to the wind and now she took the storm on her bow where she could stand it a great deal better he put all this in a good deal of sealanguage but i tell it as i got the sense of it  did you think she would go over captain asked rectus  oh no said he but something might have been carried away  he was a very pleasant man and talked a good deal to us  its all very well to lie to this way he went on for the comfort and safety of the passengers and the ship but i dont like it for were not keeping on to our port which is what i want to be doing  are we stopping here i asked  pretty much said the captain all that the engines are working for is just to keep her head to the wind  i felt the greatest respect for the captain instead of telling us why the ship rolled he just stopped her rolling i liked that way of doing things and i was sure that every one on board that i had talked to would be glad to have the vessel lie to and make herself comfortable until the storm was over  we did not stay very long with the captain for he wanted to take a nap and when we went out we stood a little while by the railing to see the storm the wind nearly took our heads off and the waves dashed right up over the bow of the ship so that if any one had been out there i suppose they would have been soaked in a few minutes if not knocked down but we saw two men at the wheel in the pilothouse steadily holding her head to the wind and we felt that it was all right so we ran below and reported and then we all went to bed  although there was not much of the rolling that had been so unpleasant before the vessel pitched and tossed enough to make our berths especially mine which was the upper one rather shaky places to rest in and i did not sleep very soundly sometime in the night i was awakened by a sound of heavy and rapid footfalls on the deck above my head i lay and listened for a moment and felt glad that the deck was steady enough for them to walk on there soon seemed to be a good deal more running and as they began to drag things about i thought that it would be a good idea to get up and find out what was going on if it was anything extraordinary i wanted to see it of course i woke up rectus and we put on our clothes there was now a good deal of noise on deck  perhaps we have run into some vessel and sunk her said rectus opening the door with his coat over his arm he was in an awful hurry to see  hold up here i said dont you go on deck in this storm without an overcoat if there has been a collision you cant do any good and you neednt hurry so button up warm  we both did that and then we went up on deck there was no one aft just then but we could see in the moonlight which was pretty strong although the sky was cloudy that there was quite a crowd of men forward we made our way in that direction as fast as we could in the face of the wind and when we reached the deck just in front of the pilothouse we looked down to the big hatchway where the freight and baggage were lowered down into the hold and there we saw what was the matter  the ship was on fire  the hatchway was not open but smoke was coming up thick and fast all around it a halfdozen men were around a donkeyengine that stood a little forward of the hatch and others were pulling at hose the captain was rushing here and there giving orders i did not hear anything he said no one said anything to us rectus asked one of the men something as he ran past him but the man did not stop to answer  but there is no need to ask any questions there was the smoke coming up thicker and blacker from the edges of the hatch  come said i clutching rectus by the arm lets wake them up  dont you think they can put it out he asked as we ran back  cant tell i answered but we must get readythats what weve got to do  i am sure i did not know how we were to get ready or what we were to do but my main idea was that no time was to be lost in doing something the first thing was to awaken our friends  we found the steward in the saloon there was only one lamp burning there and the place looked dismal but there was light enough to see that he was very pale  dont you intend to wake up the people i said to him  whats the good he said theyll put it out  they may and they maynt i answered and it wont hurt the passengers to be awake  with this i hurried to the chippertons stateroomthey had a double room in the centre of the vesseland knocked loudly on the door i saw the steward going to other doors knocking at some and opening others and speaking to the people inside  mr chipperton jumped right up and opened the door when he saw rectus and me standing there he must have seen in our faces that something was the matter for he instantly asked  what is it a wreck  i told him of the fire and said that it might not be much but that we thought wed better waken him  thats right he said well be with you directly keep perfectly cool remain just where you are youll see us all in five minutes and he shut the door  illustration keep perfectly cool said mr chipperton  but i did not intend to stand there a good many men were already rushing from their rooms and hurrying up the steep stairs that led from the rear of the saloon to the deck and i could hear ladies calling out from their rooms as if they were hurrying to get ready to come out the stewardess a tall colored woman was just going to one of these ladies who had her head out of the door i told rectus to run up on deck see how things were going on and then to come back to the chippertons door then i ran to our room jerked the cork lifepreservers from under the pillows and came out into the saloon with them this seemed to frighten several persons who saw me as i came from our room and they rushed back for their lifepreservers generally getting into the wrong room i think i did not want to help to make a fuss and confusion but i thought it would be a good deal better for us to get the lifepreservers now than to wait if we didnt need them no harm would be done some one had turned up several lamps in the saloon so that we could see better but no one stopped to look much everybody ladies and allthere were not many of thesehurried on deck the chippertons were the last to make their appearance just as their door opened rectus ran up to me  its worse than ever he said  here said i take this lifepreserver have you lifepreservers in your room i asked quickly of mr chipperton  all right said he we have them on keep all together and come on deckand remember to be perfectly cool  he went ahead with mrs chipperton and rectus and i followed one on each side of corny neither she nor her mother had yet spoken to us but while we were going up the stairs corny turned to me as i came up behind her and said  is it a real fire  oh yes i answered but they may put it out     chapter xix  the liferaft   when we came out on deck we saw in a moment that the fire was thought to be a serious affair men were actually at work at the boats which hung from their davits on each side of the deck not far from the stern they were getting them ready to be lowered i must confess that this seemed frightful to me was there really need of it  i left our party and ran forward for a moment to see for myself how matters were going people were hard at work i could hear the pumps going and there was a great deal of smoke which was driven back by the wind when i reached the pilothouse and looked down on the hatchway i saw not only smoke coming up but every now and then a tongue of flame the hatch was burning away at the edges there must be a great fire under it i thought  just then the captain came rushing up from below i caught hold of him  is there danger i said whats to be done  he stopped for a moment  we must all save ourselves he said hurriedly i am going to the passengers we cant save the ship shes all afire below and then he ran on  when i got back to our group i told them what the captain had said and we all instantly moved toward the boat nearest to us rectus told me to put on my lifepreserver and he helped me fasten it i had forgotten that i had it under my arm most of the passengers were at our boat but the captain took some of them over to the other side of the deck  illustration rectus helped me to fasten the lifepreserver  when our boat was ready there was a great scramble and rush for it most of the ladies were to get into this boat and some of the officers held back the men who were crowding forward among the others held back were rectus and i and as corny was between us she was pushed back too i do not know how the boat got to the water nor when she started down the vessel pitched and tossed we could not see well for the smoke came in thick puffs over us and i did not know that the boat was really afloat until a wave lifted it up by the side of the vessel where we stood and i heard mr chipperton call for corny i could see him in the stern of the boat which was full of people  here she is i yelled  here i am father cried corny and she ran from us to the railing  lower her down said mr chipperton from below he did not seem flurried at all but i saw that no time was to be lost for a man was trying to cut or untie a rope which still held the boat to the steamer then she would be off there was a light line on the deck near mei had caught my foot in it a minute before it was strong enough to hold corny i got hold of one end of it and tied it around her under her arms she had a great shawl as well as a lifepreserver tied around her and looked dreadfully bundled up  she did not say a word but let rectus and me do as we chose and we got her over the railing in no time i braced myself against the seat that ran around the deck and lowered rectus leaned over and directed holding on to the line as well i felt strong enough to hold two of her with the rope running over the rail i let her go down pretty fast for i was afraid the boat would be off but directly rectus called to me to stop  the boat isnt under her he cried theyve pushed off haul up a little a wave nearly took her just then  with that we hauled her up a little and almost at the same moment i saw the boat rising on a wave by that time it was an oars length from the ship  they say they cant pull back shouted mr chipperton dont let her down any further  all right i roared back at him well bring her in another boat and i began to pull up with all my might  rectus took hold of the rope with me and we soon had corny on deck she ran to the stern and held out her arms to the boat  oh father she cried wait for me  i saw mr chipperton violently addressing the men in the boat but they had put out their oars and were beginning to pull away i knew they would not come back especially as they knew of course that there were other boats on board then mr chipperton stood up again put his hands to his mouth and shouted back to us  bring herright after us if we getpartedmeetat savannah  he was certainly one of the coolest men in the world to thinkat such a timeof appointing a place to meet and yet it was a good idea i believe he expected the men in his boat to row directly to the florida coast where they would find quick dispatch to savannah  poor corny was disconsolate and cried bitterly i think i heard her mother call back to her but i am not sure about it there was so much to see and hear and yet i had been so busy with what i had had to do that i had seen comparatively little of what was going on around me  one thing however i had noticed and it impressed me deeply even at the time there was none of the wailing and screaming and praying that i had supposed was always to be seen and heard at such dreadful times as this people seemed to know that there were certain things that they had to do if they wanted to save themselves and they went right to work and did them and the principal thing was to get off that ship without any loss of time of course it was not pleasant to be in a small boat pitching about on those great waves but almost anywhere was a better place than a ship on fire i heard a lady scream once or twice but i dont think there was much of that sort of thing however there might have been more of it than i thought i was driving away at my own business  the moment i heard the last word from mr chipperton i rushed to the other side of the deck dragging corny along with me but the boat was gone from there  i could see them pulling away some distance from the ship it was easy to see things now for the fire was blazing up in front i think the vessel had been put around for she rolled a good deal and the smoke was not coming back over us  i untied the line from corny and stood for a moment looking about me there seemed to be no one aft but us three we had missed both boats mr chipperton had helped his wife into the boat and had expected to turn round and take corny no doubt he had told the men to be perfectly cool and not to hurry and while we were shouting to him and lowering corny the other boat had put off  there was a little crowd of men amidships hard at work at something we ran there they were launching the liferaft the captain was among them  are there no more boats i shouted  he turned his head  what a girl left he cried no the fire has cut off the other boats we must all get on the raft stand by with the girl and ill see you safe  the liferaft was a big affair that rectus and i had often examined it had two long airtight cylinders of iron i suppose kept apart by a wide framework on this framework between the cylinders canvas was stretched and on this the passengers were to sit of course it would be impossible to sink a thing like this  in a very short time the raft was lifted to the side of the vessel and pushed overboard it was bound to come right side up and as soon as it was afloat the men began to drop down on it the captain had hold of a line that was fastened to it and i think one of the mates had another line  get down get down cried the captain to us  i told rectus to jump first as the vessel rolled that way and he landed all right and stood up as well as he could to catch corny over she went at the next roll with a good send from me and i came right after her i heard the captain shout  all hands aboard the raft and then in a minute he jumped himself some of the men pushed her off with a pole it was almost like floating right on the surface of the water but i felt it was perfectly safe nothing could make those great cylinders sink we floated away from the ship and we were all glad enough of it for the air was getting hot the whole front part of the vessel was blazing away like a house on fire i dont remember whether the engines were still working or not but at any rate we drifted astern and were soon at quite a little distance from the steamer  it was safe enough perhaps on the raft but it was not in the least comfortable we were all crowded together crouching on the canvas and the water just swashed about us as if we were floating boards we went up and down on the waves with a motion that wouldnt have been so bad had we not thought we might be shuffled off if a big wave turned us over a little too much but there were lots of things to hold on to and we all stuck close together we three were in the middle the captain told us to get there there is no way of telling how glad i was that the captain was with us i was well satisfied anyway to be with the party on the raft i might have liked it better in a boat but i think most of the men in the boats were waiters or stewards or passengersfellows who were in a hurry to get off the officers and sailors who remained behind to do their best for the ship and the passengers were the men on the raft and these i felt we could trust i think there were ten of them besides the captain making fourteen of us in all  there we all sat while the ship blazed and crackled away before us she drifted faster than we did and so got farther and farther away from us the fire lighted up the sea for a good distance and every time we rose on the top of a wave some of us looked about to see if we could see anything of the other boats but we saw nothing of them once i caught sight of a black spot on a high wave at quite a distance which i thought might be a boat but no one else saw it and it was gone in an instant the captain said it made no real difference to us whether we saw the other boats or not they could not help us all the help we had to expect was from some passing ship which might see us and pick us up he was very encouraging though about this for he said we were right in the track of vessels bound north which all sought the gulf stream and besides a burning ship at night would attract the attention of vessels at a great distance and some of them would be sure to make for us  well see a sail in the morning said he make up your minds to that all weve got to do is to stick together on the raft and were almost sure to be picked up  i think he said things like this to give courage to us three but i dont believe we needed it particularly rectus was very quiet but i think that if he could have kept himself dry he would have been pretty well satisfied to float until daylight for he had full faith in the captain and was sure we should be picked up i was pretty much of the same mind but poor corny was in a sad way it was no comfort to her to tell her that we should be picked up unless she could be assured that the same ship would pick up her father and mother but we could say nothing positive about this of course although we did all that we could in a general way to make her feel that everything would turn out all right she sat wrapped up in her shawl and seldom said a word but her eyes were wandering all over the waves looking for a boat  the ship was now quite a long way off still burning and lighting up the tops of the waves and the sky just before daybreak her light suddenly went out  shes gone down said the captain and then he said no more for a long time i felt very sorry for him even if he should be saved he had lost his shiphad seen it burn up and sink before his eyes such a thing must be pretty hard on a captain even i felt as if i had lost a friend the old tigris seemed so well known to us  it was now more dismal than ever it was darker and although the burning ship could do us no good we were sorry to have her leave us nobody said much but we all began to feel pretty badly morning came slowly and we were wet and cold and getting stiff besides we were all very thirsty and i for one was hungry but there was no good reason for that for it was not yet breakfasttime fortunately after a while corny went to sleep we were very glad of it though how she managed to sleep while the raft was rising and falling and sliding and sloshing from one wave to another i cant tell but she didnt have much holding on to do we did that for her  at last daylight came and then we began to look about in good earnest we saw a topsail off on the horizon but it was too far for our raft to be seen from it and it might be coming our way or it might not when we were down in the trough of the waves we could see nothing and no one could have seen us it was of no use to put up a signal the captain said until we saw a vessel near enough to see it  we waited and we waited and waited until it was well on in the morning and still we saw no other sail the one we had seen had disappeared entirely  we all began to feel miserable now we were weak and cold and wretched there wasnt a thing to eat or drink on the raft the fire had given no time to get anything some of the men began to grumble it would have been better they said to have started off as soon as they found out the fire and have had time to put something to eat and drink on the raft it was all wasted time to try to save the ship it did no good after all the captain said nothing to this he knew that he had done his duty in trying to put out the fire and he just kept his mouth shut and looked out for a sail there was one man with usa redfaced yellowhaired manwith a curly beard and little gold rings in his ears he looked more like a sailor than any other of the men and rectus and i always put him down for the sailor who had been longer at sea and knew more about ships and sailing than any other of the crew but this man was the worst grumbler of the lot now and we altered our opinion about him  corny woke up every now and then but she soon went to sleep again when she found there was no boat or sail in sight at least i thought she went to sleep but she might have been thinking and crying she was so crouched up that we could not see whether she was awake or not     chapter xx  the russian bark   we soon began to think the captain was mistaken in saying there would be lots of ships coming this way but then we couldnt see very far ships may have passed within a few miles of us without our knowing anything about it it was very different from being high up on a ships deck or in her rigging sometimes though we seemed high enough up when we got on the top of a wave  it was fully noon before we saw another sail and when we saw this one for the second or third time for we only caught a glimpse of it every now and then a big man who had been sitting on the edge of the raft and hardly ever saying a word sung out  i believe thats a russian bark  and after he had had two or three more sights at her he said  yes i know she is  thats so said the captain and shes bearing down on us  now how in the world they knew what sort of a ship that was and which way it was sailing i couldnt tell for the life of me to me it was a little squarish spot on the lower edge of the sky and i have always thought that i could see well enough but these sailors have eyes like spyglasses  now then we were all alive and began to get ready to put up a signal fortunately the pole was on the rafti believe the captain had it fastened on thinking we might want itand now all we had to do was to make a flag we three got out our handkerchiefs which were wet but white enough yet and the captain took out his we tied them together by the corners and made a long pennant of them when we tied one end of this to the pole it made quite a show the wind soon dried it after the pole was hoisted and held up and then our flag fluttered finely  the sun had now come out quite bright and warm which was a good thing for us for it dried us off somewhat and made us more comfortable the wind had also gone down a good deal if it had not been for these two things i dont know how we could have stood it but the waves were still very high  every time we saw the ship she seemed to look bigger and bigger and we knew that the captain was right and that she was making for us but she was a long time coming even after she got so near that we could plainly see her hull and masts and sails she did not seem to be sailing directly toward us indeed sometimes i thought she didnt notice us she would go far off one way and then off the other way  oh why dont she come right to us cried corny beating her hands on her knees she isnt as near now as she was half an hour ago  this was the first time that corny had let herself out in this way but i dont wonder she did it the captain explained that the ship couldnt sail right to us because the wind was not in the proper direction for that she had to tack if she had been a steamer the case would have been different we all sat and waited and waved our flag  she came nearer and nearer and it was soon plain enough that she saw us the captain told us that it was all right nowall we had to do was to keep up our courage and wed soon be on board the bark but when the men who were holding the pole let it down he told them to put it up again he wanted to make sure they should see us  at last the bark came so near that we could see the people on board but still she went past us this was the hardest to bear of all for she seemed so near but when she tacked and came back she sailed right down to us we could see her all the time now whether we were up or down  shell take us this time said the captain  i supposed that when the ship came near us she would stop and lower a boat but there seemed to be no intention of the kind a group of men stood in her bow and i saw that one of them held a round lifepreserver in his handit was one of the indiarubber kind filled with air and to it a line was attached when the ship was just opposite to us this man shouted something which i did not hear and threw the lifepreserver it fell close to the raft i thought indeed it was coming right into the midst of us the redfaced man with the gold earrings was nearest to it he made a grab at it and missed it on went the ship and on went the lifepreserver skipping and dancing over the waves they let out lots of line but still the lifepreserver was towed away  a regular howl went up from our raft i thought some of the men would jump into the sea and swim after the ship which was now rapidly leaving us we heard a shout from the vessel but what it meant i did not know on she went and on as if she was never coming back  shell come back said the captain shell tack again  but it was hard to believe him i dont know whether he believed himself corny was wildly crying now and rectus was as white as a sheet no one seemed to have any hope or selfcontrol except the captain some of the men looked as if they did not care whether the ship ever came back or not  the sea is too high said one of them shed swamp a boat if shed put it out  just you wait said the captain  the bark sailed away so far that i shut my eyes i could not look after her any more then as we rose on the top of a wave i heard a rumble of words among the men and i looked out and saw she was tacking before long she was sailing straight back to us and the most dreadful moments of my life were ended i had really not believed that she would ever return to us  again she came plowing along before us the same group on her bow again the lifepreserver was thrown and this time the captain seized it  in a moment the line was made fast to the raft but there was no sudden tug the men on the bark knew better than that they let out some two or three hundred feet of line and lay to with their sails fluttering in the wind  then they began to haul us in i dont remember much more of what happened just about this time it was all a daze of high black hull and tossing waves and men overhead and ropes coming down and seeing corny hauled up into the air after a while i was hauled up and rectus went before me i was told afterward that some of the stoutest men could scarcely help themselves they were so cramped and stiff and had to be hoisted on board like sheep  i know that when i put my feet on the deck my knees were so stiff that i could not stand two women had corny between them and were carrying her below i was so delighted to see that there were women on board rectus and i were carried below too and three or four rough looking fellows who didnt speak a word that we could understand set to work at us and took off our clothes and rubbed us with warm stuff and gave us some hot tea and gruel and i dont know what else and put us into hammocks and stuffed blankets around us and made me feel warmer and happier and more grateful and sleepy than i thought it was in me to feel i expect rectus felt the same in about five minutes i was fast asleep  i dont know how long it was before i woke up when i opened my eyes i just lay and looked about me i did not care for times and seasons i knew i was all right i wondered when they would come around again with gruel i had an idea they lived on gruel in that ship and i remembered that it was very good after a while a man did come around and he looked into my hammock i think from his cap that he was an officerprobably a doctor when he saw that i was awake he said something to me i had seen some russian words in print and the letters all seemed upside down or lying sideways on the page and that was about the way he spoke but he went and got me a cup of tea and some soup and some bread and i understood his food very well  after a while our captain came around to my hammock he looked a great deal better than when i saw him last and said he had had a good sleep he told me that corny was all right and was sleeping again and that the mates wife had her in charge rectus was in a hammock near me and i could hear him snore as if he were perfectly happy the captain said that these russian people were just as kind as they could be that the master of the bark who could speak english had put his vessel under hisour captainscommand and told him to cruise around wherever he chose in search of the two boats  and did you find them i asked  no said he we have been on the search now for twentyfour hours and can see nothing of them but i feel quite sure they have been picked up they could row and they could get further into the course of vessels than we were well find them when we get ashore  the captain was a hopeful man but i could not feel as cheerfully as he spoke all that i could say was poor corny  he did not answer me but went away and soon in spite of all my doubts and fears i fell asleep  the next time i woke up i got out of my hammock and found i was pretty much all right my clothes had been dried and ironed i reckon and were lying on a chest all ready for me while rectus and i were dressing for he got up at the same time that i did our captain came to us and brought me a little package of greenbacks  the master of the bark gave me these said the captain and said they were pinned in your watchpocket he has had them dried and pressed out for you  there it was all the money belonging to rectus and myself which according to old mr colberts advice i had carefully pinned in the watchpocket of my trousers before leaving nassau i asked the captain if we should not pay something for our accommodations on this vessel but he said we must not mention anything of the kind the people on the ship would not listen to it even our watches seemed to have suffered no damage from the soaking they had had in our wet clothes  as soon as we were ready we went up on deck and there we saw corny she was sitting by herself near the stern and looked like a different kind of a girl from what she had been two or three days before she seemed several years older  do you really think the other boats were picked up she said the moment she saw us  poor thing she began to cry as soon as she began to speak of course we sat down and talked to her and said everything we could think of to reassure her and in about half an hour she began to be much more cheerful and to look as if the world might have something satisfactory in it after all  our captain and the master of the bark now came to us the russian master was a pleasant man and talked pretty good english i think he was glad to see us but what we said in the way of thanks embarrassed him a good deal i suppose he had never done much at rescuing people  he and our captain both told us that they felt quite sure that the boats had either reached the florida coast or been picked up for we had cruised very thoroughly over the course they must have taken we were a little north of cape canaveral when the tigris took fire  about sundown that day we reached the mouth of the savannah river and went on board a tug to go up to the city while our bark would proceed on her voyage there were fourteen grateful people who went down the side of that russian bark to the little tug that we had signalled and some of us i know were sorry we could not speak russian so we could tell our rescuers more plainly what we thought of them  when we reached savannah we went directly to the hotel where rectus and i had stopped on our former visit and there we found ourselves the objects of great attentioni dont mean we three particularly but the captain and all of us we brought the news of the burning of the tigris and so we immediately knew that nothing had been heard of the two boats corny was taken in charge by some of the ladies in the hotel and rectus and i told the story of the burning and the raft twenty or thirty times the news created a great sensation and was telegraphed to all parts of the country the united states government sent a revenue cutter from charleston and one from st augustine to cruise along the coast and endeavor to find some traces of the survivors if there were any  but two days passed and no news came we thought corny would go crazy  i know theyre dead she said if they were alive anywhere wed hear from them  but we would not admit that and tried in every way to prove that the people in the boats might have landed somewhere where they could not communicate with us or might have been picked up by a vessel which had carried them to south america or europe or some other distant place  well why dont we go look for them then if theres any chance of their being on some desert island its dreadful to sit here and wait and wait and do nothing  now i began to see the good of being rich rectus came to me soon after corny had been talking about going to look for her father and mother and he said  look here willhe had begun to call me will of late probably because corny called me soi think it is too bad that we should just sit here and do nothing i spoke to mr parker about it and he says we can get a tugboat he thinks and go out and do what looking we can if it eases our minds he says theres no objection to it so im going to telegraph to father to let me hire a tugboat  i thought this was a firstclass idea and we went to see messrs parker and darrell who were merchants in the city and the owners of the tigris they had been very kind to us and told us now that they did not suppose it would do any real good for us to go out in a tugboat and search along the coast but that if we thought it would help the poor girl to bear her trouble they were in favor of the plan they were really afraid she would lose her reason if she did not do something  corny was now staying at mr darrells house his wife who was a tiptop lady insisted that she should come there when we went around to talk to corny about making a search she said that that was exactly what she wanted to do if we would take her out to look for her father and mother and we couldnt find them after we had looked all we could she would come back and ask nothing more  then we determined to go we hadnt thought of taking corny along but mr darrell and the others thought it would be best and mrs darrell said her own colored woman named celia should go with her and take care of her i could not do anything but agree to things but rectus telegraphed to his father and got authority to hire a tug and mr parker attended to the business himself and the tug was to be ready early the next morning we thought this was a long time to wait but it couldnt be helped  i forgot to say that rectus and i had telegraphed home to our parents as soon as we reached savannah and had answers back which were very long ones for telegrams we had also written home but we did not say anything to corny about all this it would have broken her heart if she had thought about any one writing to his father and mother and hearing from them     chapter xxi  the trip of the tug   the tugboat was a little thing and not very clean but she was strong and seaworthy we were told and therefore we were satisfied there was a small deck aft on which corny and rectus and i sat with celia the colored woman and there were some dingy little sleepingplaces which were given up for our benefit the captain of the tug was a white man but all the rest engineer fireman and handsthere were five or six in allwere negroes  we steamed down the savannah river in pretty good style but i was glad when we got out of it for i was tired of that river our plan was to go down the coast and try to find tidings of the boats they might have reached land at points where the revenue cutters would never have heard from them when we got out to sea the water was quite smooth although there was a swell that rolled us a great deal the captain said that if it had been rough he would not have come out at all this sounded rather badly for us because he might give up the search if a little storm came on and besides if he was afraid of high waves in his tug what chance could those boats have had  toward noon we got into water that was quite smooth and we could see land on the ocean side of us i couldnt understand this and went to ask the captain about it he said it was all right we were going to take the inside passage which is formed by the islands that lie along nearly all the coast of georgia the strips of seawater between these islands and the mainland make a smooth and convenient passage for the smaller vessels that sail or steam along this coast indeed some quite goodsized steamers go this way he said  i objected pretty strongly to our taking this passage because i said we could never hear anything of the boats while we were in here but he was positive that if they had managed to land on the outside of any of these islands we could hear of them better from the inside than from the ocean side and besides we could get along a great deal better inside he seemed to think more of that than anything else  we had a pretty dull time on that tug there wasnt a great deal of talking but there was lots of thinking and not a very pleasant kind of thinking either we stopped quite often and hailed small boats and the captain talked to people whenever he had a chance but he never heard anything about any boats having run ashore on any of the islands or having come into the inside passage between any of them we met a few sailing vessels and toward the close of the afternoon we met a big steamer something like northern river steamers the captain said she ran between the st johns river and savannah and always took the inside passage as far as she could he said this as if it showed him to be in the right in taking the same passage but i couldnt see that it proved anything we were on a different business  about nine oclock we went to bed the captain promising to call us if anything turned up but i couldnt sleep wellmy bunk was too close and hot and so i pretty soon got up and went up to the pilothouse where i found the captain he and one of the hands were hard at work putting the boat around  hello said he i thought you were sound asleep  hello said i what are you turning round for  it was bright starlight and i could see that we were making a complete circuit in the smooth water  well said he were going back  back i cried whats the meaning of that we havent made half a search i dont believe weve gone a hundred miles we want to search the whole coast i tell you to the lower end of florida  you cant do it in this boat he said shes too small  why didnt you say so when we took her  well there wasnt any other in the first place and besides it wouldnt be no good to go no further its more n four days now since them boats set out theres no chance fur anybody on em to be livin  thats not for you to decide i said and i was very angry we want to find our friends dead or alive or find some news of them and we want to cruise until we know theres no further chance of doing so  well said he ringing the bell to go ahead sharp im not decidin anything i had my orders i was to be gone twentyfour hours an itll be more n that by the time i get back  who gave you those orders  parker and darrell said he  then this is all a swindle i cried and weve been cheated into taking this trip for nothing at all  no it isnt a swindle he answered rather warmly they told me all about it they knew an i knew that it wasnt no use to go looking for two boats that had been lowered in a big storm four days ago way down on the florida coast but they could see that this here girl would never give in till shed had a chance of doin what she thought she was called on to do and so they agreed to give it to her but they told me on no account to keep her out more n twentyfour hours that would be long enough to satisfy her and longer than that wouldnt be right i tell you they know what theyre about  well it wont be enough to satisfy her i said and then i went down to the little deck i couldnt make the man turn back i thought the tug had been hired to go wherever we chose to take her but i had been mistaken i felt that we had been deceived but there was no use in saying anything more on the subject until we reached the city  i did not wake rectus to tell him the news it would not do any good and i was afraid corny might hear us i wanted her to sleep as long as she could and indeed i dreaded the moment when she should awake and find that all had been given up  we steamed along very fast now there was no stopping anywhere i sat on the deck and thought a little and dozed a little and by the time it was morning i found we were in the savannah river i now hated this river worse than ever  everything was quiet on the water and everything except the engine was just as quiet on the tug rectus and corny and celia were still asleep and nobody else seemed stirring though of course some of the men were at their posts i dont think the captain wanted to be about when corny came out on deck and found that we had given up the search i intended to be with her when she first learned this terrible fact which i knew would put an end to all hope in her heart but i was in no hurry for her to wake up i very much hoped she would sleep until we reached the city and then we could take her directly to her kind friends  and she did sleep until we reached the city it was about seven oclock in the morning i think when we began to steam slowly by the wharves and piers i now wished the city were twenty miles further on i knew that when we stopped i should have to wake up poor corny  the city looked doleful although it was not very early in the morning there were very few people about some men could be seen on the decks of the vessels at the wharves and a big steamer for one of the northern ports was getting up steam i could not help thinking how happy the people must be who were going away in her on one of the piers near where we were going to stopwe were coming in nowwere a few darkey boys sitting on a wharflog and dangling their bare feet over the water i wondered how they dared laugh and be so jolly in a few minutes corny must be wakened on a post near these boys a lounger sat fishing with a long poleactually fishing away as if there were no sorrows and deaths or shipwrecked or brokenhearted people in the world i was particularly angry at this manand i was so nervous that all sorts of things made me angrybecause he was old enough to know better and because he looked like such a fool he had on green trousers dirty canvas shoes and no stockings a striped linen coat and an old straw hat which lopped down over his nose one of the men called to him to catch the line which he was about to throw on the wharf but he paid no attention and a negro boy came and caught the line the man actually had a bite and couldnt take his eyes from the cork i wished the line had hit him and knocked him off the post  the tide was high and the tug was not much below the wharf when we hauled up just as we touched the pier the man who was a little astern of us caught his fish he jerked it up and jumped off his post and as he looked up in delight at his little fish which was swinging in the air i saw he was mr chipperton  i made one dash for cornys little cubbyhole i banged at the door i shouted  corny heres your father  she was out in an instant she had slept in her clothes she had no bonnet on she ran out on deck and looked about dazed the sight of the wharves and the ships seemed to stun her  where she cried  i took her by the arm and pointed out her father who still stood holding the fishingpole in one hand while endeavoring to clutch the swinging fish with the other  the plank had just been thrown out from the little deck corny made one bound i think she struck the plank in the middle like an indiarubber ball and then she was on the wharf and before he could bring his eyes down to the earth her arms were around her fathers neck and she was wildly kissing and hugging him  mr chipperton was considerably startled but when he saw who it was who had him he threw his arms around corny and hugged and kissed her as if he had gone mad  rectus was out by this time and as he and i stood on the tug we could not help laughing although we were so happy that we could have cried there stood that ridiculous figure mr chipperton in his short green trousers and his thin striped coat with his arms around his daughter and the fishingpole tightly clasped to her back while the poor little fish dangled and bobbed at every fresh hug  everybody on board was looking at them and one of the little black boys who didnt appear to appreciate sentiment made a dash for the fish unhooked it and put like a good fellow this rather broke the spell that was on us all and rectus and i ran on shore  we did not ask any questions we were too glad to see him after he had put corny on one side and had shaken our hands wildly with his left hand for his right still held the pole and had tried to talk and found he couldnt we called a carriage that had just come up and hustled him and corny into it i took the pole from his hand and asked him where he would go to he called out the name of the hotel where we were staying and i shut the door and sent them off i did not ask a word about cornys mother for i knew mr chipperton would not be sitting on a post and fishing if his wife was dead  i threw the pole and line away and then rectus and i walked up to the hotel we forgot all about celia who was left to go home when she chose  it was some hours before we saw the chippertons and then we were called into their room where there was a talking and a telling things such as i never heard before  it was some time before i could get mr and mrs chippertons story straight but this was about the amount of it they were picked up sooner than we werejust after daybreak when they left the ship they rowed as hard as they could for several hours and so got a good distance from us it was well they met with a vessel as soon as they did for all the women who had been on the steamer were in this boat and they had a hard time of it the water dashed over them very often and mr chipperton thought that some of them could not have held out much longer i wondered what they would have done on our raft  the vessel that picked them up was a coasting schooner bound to one of the florida keys and she wouldnt put back with them for she was under some sort of a contract and kept right straight on her way when they got down there they chartered a vessel which brought them up to fernandina where they took the steamer for savannah they were on the very steamer we passed in the inside passage if we had only known that  they telegraphed the moment they reached fernandina and proposed stopping at st augustine but it was thought they could make better time by keeping right on to fernandina the telegram reached savannah after we had left on the tug  mr chipperton said he got his fancy clothes on board the schooner he bought them of a mana passenger i believewho had an extra suit  i think said mr chipperton he was the only man on that mean little vessel who had two suits of clothes i dont know whether these were his weekday or his sunday clothes as for my own they were so wet that i took them off the moment i got on board the schooner and i never saw them again i dont know what became of them and to tell the truth i havent thought of em i was too glad to get started for savannah where i knew wed meet corny if she was alive you see i trusted in you boys  just here mrs chipperton kissed us both again this made several times that she had done it we didnt care so much as there was no one there but ourselves and the chippertons  when we got here and found you had gone to look for us i wanted to get another tug and go right after you but my wife was a good deal shaken up and i did not want to leave her and parker and darrell said they had given positive orders to have you brought back this morning so i waited i was only too glad to know you were all safe i got up early in the morning and went down to watch for you you must have been surprised to see me fishing but i had nothing else to do and so i hired a pole and line of a boy it helped very much to pass the time away  yes said rectus you didnt notice us at all you were so much interested  well you see said mr chipperton i had a bite just at that minute and besides i really did not look for you on such a little boat i had an idea you would come on something more respectable than that  as if we should ever think of respectability at such a time said mrs chipperton with tears in her eyes  as for you boys said mr chipperton getting up and taking us each by the hand i dont know what to say to you  i thought for my part that they had all said enough already they had praised and thanked us for things we had never thought of  i almost wish you were orphans he continued so that i might adopt you but a boy cant have more than one father however i tell you a boy can have as many uncles as he pleases ill be an uncle to each of you as long as i live ever after this call me uncle chipperton do you hear that  we heard and said wed do it  soon after this lots of people came in and the whole thing was gone over again and again i am sorry to say that at one or two places in the story mrs chipperton kissed us both again  before we went down to dinner i asked uncle chipperton how his lung had stood it through all this exposure  oh bother the lung he said i tell you boys ive lost faith in that lungat least in there being anything the matter with it i shall travel for it no more     chapter xxii  looking ahead   we have made up our minds said uncle chipperton that afternoon to go home and settle down and let corny go to school i hate to send her away from us but it will be for her good but that wont be until next fall well keep her until then and now ill tell you what i think wed all better do its too soon to go north yet no one should go from the soft climate of the semitropics to the northern or middle states until mild weather has fairly set in there and that will not happen for a month yet  now this is my plan let us all take a leisurely trip homeward by the way of mobile and new orleans and the mississippi river this will be just the season and we shall be just the party what do you say  everybody but me said it would be splendid i had exactly the same idea about it but i didnt say so for there was no use in it i couldnt go on a trip like that i had been counting up my money that morning and found i would have to shave pretty closely to get home by railand i wanted very much to go that wayalthough it would be cheaper to return by seafor i had a great desire to go through north and south carolina and virginia and see washington it would have seemed like a shame to go back by sea and miss all this but as i said i had barely enough money for this trip and to make it i must start the next day and there was no use writing home for money i knew there was none there to spare and i wouldnt have asked for it if there had been if there was any travelling money some of the others ought to have it i had had my share  it was very different with rectus and the chippertons they could afford to take this trip and there was no reason why they shouldnt take it  when i told them this uncle chipperton flashed up in a minute and said that that was all stuff and nonsensethe trip shouldnt cost me a cent what was the sense he said of thinking of a few dollars when such pleasure was in view he would see that i had no moneytroubles and if that was all i could go just as well as not didnt he owe me thousands of dollars  all this was very kind but it didnt suit me i knew that he did not owe me a cent for if i had done anything for him i made no charge for it and even if i had been willing to let him pay my expenseswhich i wasntmy father would never have listened to it  so i thanked him but told him the thing couldnt be worked in that way and i said it over and over again until at last he believed it then he offered to lend me the money necessary but this offer i had to decline too as i had no way of paying it back i might as well have taken it as a gift there wasnt anything he could offer after this except to get me a free pass and as he had no way of doing that he gave up the job and we all went down to supper that evening as i was putting a few things into a small valise which i had boughtas our trunks were lost on the tigris i had very little trouble in packing upi said to rectus that by the time he started off he could lay in a new stock of clothes i had made out our accounts and had his money ready to hand over to him but i knew that his father had arranged for him to draw on a savannah bank both for the tugboat money and for money for himself i think that mr colbert would have authorized me to do this drawing if rectus had not taken the matter into his own hands when he telegraphed but it didnt matter and there wasnt any tugboat money to pay any way for uncle chipperton paid that he said it had all been done for his daughter and he put his foot down hard and wouldnt let rectus hand over a cent  i wont have any more time than you will have replied rectus for im going tomorrow  i didnt suppose theyd start so soon i said im sure theres no need of any hurry  im not going with them said rectus putting a lonely shirt into a trunk that he had bought im going home with you  i was so surprised at this that i just stared at him  what do you mean said i  mean said he why just what i say do you suppose id go off with them and let you straggle up home by yourself not any for me thank you and besides i thought you were to take charge of me how would you look going back and saying youd turned me over to another party  illustration youre a regular young trump  you thought i was to take charge of you did you i cried well youre a long time saying so you never admitted that before  i had better sense than that said rectus with a grin but i dont mind saying so now as were pretty near through with our travels but father told me expressly that i was to consider myself in your charge  you young rascal said i and he thought that you understood it so well that there was no need of saying much to me about it all that he said expressly to me was about taking care of your money but i tell you what it is rectus youre a regular young trump to give up that trip and go along with me  and i gave him a good slap on the back  he winced at this and let drive a pillow at me so hard that it nearly knocked me over a chair  the next morning after an early breakfast we went to bid the chippertons goodbye we intended to walk to the dépôt and so wanted to start early i was now cutting down all extra expenses  ready so soon cried uncle chipperton appearing at the door of his room why we havent had our breakfast yet  we have to make an early start if we go by the morning train said i and we wanted to see you all before we started  glad to see you at any hour of the night or dayalways very glad to see you but i think we had better be getting our breakfast if the train goes so early  are you going to start today i asked in surprise  certainly said he why shouldnt we i bought a new suit of clothes yesterday and my wife and corny look well enough for travelling purposes we can start as well as not and id go in my green trousers if i hadnt any others my dear he said looking into the room you and corny must come right down to breakfast  but perhaps you need not hurry i said i dont know when the train for mobile starts  mobile he cried whos going to mobile do you suppose that we are not a bit of it when i proposed that trip i didnt propose it for mrs chipperton or corny or myself or you or rectus or tom or dick or harry i proposed it for all of us if all of us cannot go none of us can if you must go north this morning so must we weve nothing to pack and thats a comfort nine oclock did you say you may go on to the dépôt if you like and well eat our breakfasts take a carriage and be there in time  they were there in time and we all went north together  we had a jolly trip we saw charleston and richmond and washington and baltimore and philadelphia and at last we saw jersey city and our folks waiting for us in the great dépôt of the pennsylvania railroad  when i saw my father and mother and my sister helen standing there on the stone footwalk as the cars rolled in i was amazed i hadnt expected them it was all right enough for rectus to expect his father and mother for they lived in new york but i had supposed that i should meet my folks at the station in willisville but it was a capital idea in them to come to new york they said they couldnt wait at home and besides they wanted to see and know the chippertons for we all seemed so bound together now  well it wasnt hard to know the chippertons before we reached the hotel where my folks were staying and where we all went to take luncheon together any one would have thought that uncle chipperton was really a born brother to father and old mr colbert how he did talk how everybody talked except helen she just sat and listened and looked at cornya girl who had been shipwrecked and had been on a little raft in the midst of the stormy billows my mother and the two other ladies cried a good deal but it was a sunshiny sort of crying and wouldnt have happened so often i think if mrs chipperton had not been so ready to lead off  after luncheon we sat for two or three hours in one of the parlors and talked and talked and talked it was a sort of family congress everybody told everybody else what he or she was going to do and took information of the same kind in trade i was to go to college in the fall but as that had been pretty much settled long ago it couldnt be considered as news i looked well enough my father said to do all the hard studying that was needed and the professor was anxiously waiting to put me through a course of training for the happy lot of freshman  but hes not going to begin his studies as soon as he gets home said my mother were going to have him to ourselves for a while and i did not doubt that i hadnt been gone very long to be sure but then a ship had been burned from under me and that counted for about a years absence  cornys fate had been settled too in a general way but the discussion that went on about a good boardingschool for her showed that a particular settlement might take some time uncle chipperton wanted her to go to some school near his place on the hudson river so that he could drive over and see her every day or two and mrs colbert said she thought that that wouldnt do because no girl could study as she ought to if her father was coming to see her all the time and uncle chipperton wanted to know what possible injury she thought he would do his daughter by going to see her and mrs colbert said none at all of course she didnt mean that and mrs chipperton said that corny and her father ought really to go to the same school and then we all laughed and my father put in quickly and asked about rectus it was easy to see that it would take all summer to get a school for corny  well said mr colbert ive got a place for sammy right in my office hes to be a man of business you know he never took much to schooling i sent him travelling so that he could see the world and get himself in trim for dealing with it and thats what we have to do in our business deal with the world  i didnt like this and i dont think rectus did either he walked over to one of the windows and looked out into the street  ill tell you what i think sir said i rectusi mean your son samuel only i shall never call him sohas seen enough of the world to make him so wide awake that he sees more in schooling than he used to thats my opinion  i knew that rectus rather envied my going to college for he had said as much on the trip home and i knew that he had hoped his father would let him make a fresh start with the professor at our old school  sammy cried out mrs colbertsammy my son do you want to go to school and finish up your education or go into your fathers office and learn to be a merchant  rectus turned around from the window  theres no hurry about the merchant he said i want to go to school and college first  and thats just where youre going said his mother with her face reddening up a little more than common  mr colbert grinned a little but said nothing i suppose he thought it would be of no use and i had an idea too that he was very glad to have rectus determine on a college career i know the rest of us were and we didnt hold back from saying so either  uncle chipperton now began to praise rectus and he told what obligations the boy had put him under in nassau when he wrote to his father and had that suit about the property stopped and so relieved himuncle chippertonfrom cutting short his semitropical trip and hurrying home to new york in the middle of winter  but the suit isnt stopped said mr colbert you dont suppose i would pay any attention to a note like the one sammy sent me do you i just let the suit go on of course it has not been decided yet but i expect to gain it  at this uncle chipperton grew very angry indeed it was astonishing to see how quickly he blazed up he had supposed the whole thing settled and now to find that the terrible injusticeas he considered itwas still going on was too much for him  do you sit there and tell me that sir he exclaimed jumping up and skipping over to mr colbert do you call yourself  father cried corny keep perfectly cool remain just where you are  uncle chipperton stopped as if he had run against a fence his favorite advice went straight home to him  very good my child said he turning to corny thats just what ill do  and he said no more about it  now everybody began to talk about all sorts of things so as to seem as if they hadnt noticed this little rumpus and we agreed that we must all see each other again the next day father said he should remain in the city for a few days now that we were all here and uncle chipperton did not intend to go to his countryplace until the weather was warmer we were speaking of several things that would be pleasant to do together when uncle chipperton broke in with a proposition  ill tell you what i am going to do i am going to give a dinner to this party i cant invite you to my house but i shall engage a parlor in a restaurant where i have given dinners before we always come to new york when i want to give dinnersits so much easier for us to come to the city than for a lot of people to come out to our place and there i shall give you a dinner tomorrow evening nobody need say anything against this ive settled it and i cant be moved  as he couldnt be moved no one tried to move him  i tell you what it is said rectus privately to me if uncle chipperton is going to give a dinner according to his own ideas of things in general it will be a curious kind of a meal  it often happened that rectus was as nearly right as most people     chapter xxiii  uncle chippertons dinner   the next day was a busy one for father and mother and myself all the morning we were out laying in a small stock of baggage to take the place of what i had lost on the tigris but i was very sorry especially on my sister helens account that i had lost so many things in my trunk which i could not replace without going back myself to nassau i could buy curiosities from those regions that were ever so much better than any that i had collected but i could not buy shells that i myself had gathered nor great seedpods like beanpods two feet long which i had picked from the trees nor pieces of rock that i myself had brought up from a coralreef  but these were all gone and i pacified helen by assuring her that i would tell her such long stories about these things that she could almost see them in her minds eye but i think by the way she smiled that she had only a secondrate degree of belief in my power of description she was a smart little thing and she believed that corny was the queen of girls  while i am speaking of the tigris and our losses i will just say that the second boat which left the burning steamer was never heard from  we reached our hotel about noon pretty tired for we had been rushing things as it was necessary for father to go home early the next day on the front steps we found uncle chipperton who had been waiting for us he particularly wanted to see me he lunched with us and then he took me off to the place where he was to have his dinner at six oclock that evening he wanted to consult with me about the arrangements of the table where each person should sit and all that sort of thing i couldnt see the use in this because it was only a kind of family party and we should all be sure to get seated if there were chairs and places enough but uncle chipperton wanted to plan and arrange everything until he was sure it was just right that was his way  after he had settled these important matters and the headwaiter and the proprietor had become convinced that i was a person of much consequence who had to be carefully consulted before anything could be done we went down stairs and at the streetdoor uncle chipperton suddenly stopped me  see here said he i want to tell you something im not coming to this dinner  notcoming i exclaimed in amazement  no said he ive been thinking it over and have fully made up my mind about it you see this is intended as a friendly reunionan occasion of good feeling and fellowship among people who are bound together in a very peculiar manner  yes i interrupted and that seems to me sir the very reason why you should be there  the very reason why i should not be there he said you see i couldnt sit down with that most perverse and obstinate man colbert and feel sure that something or other would not occur which would make an outbreak between us or at any rate bad feeling in fact i know i could not take pleasure in seeing him enjoy food this may be wrong but i cant help it its in me and i wont be the means of casting a shadow over the happy company which will meet here tonight no one but your folks need know im not coming the rest will not know why i am detained and i shall drop in toward the close of the meal just before you break up i want you to ask your father to take the head of the table he is just the man for such a place and he ought to have it too for another reason you ought to know that this dinner is really given to you in your honor to be sure rectus is a good fellowsplendidand does everything that he knows how but my wife and i know that we owe all our present happiness to your exertions and good sense  he went on in this way for some time and although i tried to stop him i couldnt do it  therefore he continued i want your father to preside and all of you to be happy without a suspicion of a cloud about you at any rate i shall be no cloud come around here early and see that everything is all right now i must be off  and away he went  i did not like this state of affairs at all i would have much preferred to have no dinner it was not necessary any way if i had had the authority i would have stopped the whole thing but it was uncle chippertons affair he paid for it and i had no right to interfere with it  my father liked the matter even less than i did he said it was a strange and unwarrantable performance on the part of chipperton and he did not understand it and he certainly did not want to sit at the head of the table in another mans place i could not say anything to him to make him feel better about it i made him feel worse indeed when i told him that uncle chipperton did not want his absence explained or alluded to any more than could be helped my father hated to have to keep a secret of this kind  in the afternoon i went around to the hotel where the chippertons always staid when they were in new york to see corny and her mother i found them rather blue uncle chipperton had not been able to keep his plan from them and they thought it was dreadful i could not help letting them see that i did not like it and so we didnt have as lively a time as we ought to have had  i supposed that if i went to see rectus and told him about the matter i should make him blue too but as i had no right to tell him and also felt a pretty strong desire that some of the folks should come with good spirits and appetites i kept away from him he would have been sure to see that something was the matter  i was the first person to appear in the diningroom of the restaurant where the dinnertable was spread for us it was a prettily furnished parlor in the second story of the house and the table was very tastefully arranged and decorated with flowers i went early by myself so as to be sure that everything was exactly right before the guests arrived all seemed perfectly correct the name of each member of the party was on a card by a plate even little helen had her plate and her card it would be her first appearance at a regular dinnerparty  the guests were not punctual at ten minutes past six even my father who was the most particular of men in such things had not made his appearance i waited five ten fifteen twenty minutes more and became exceedingly nervous  the headwaiter came in and asked if my friends understood the time that had been set the dinner would be spoiled if it were kept much longer i said that i was sure they knew all about the time set and that there was nothing to be done but to wait it was most unaccountable that they should all be late  i stood before the fireplace and waited and thought i ran down to the door and looked up and down the street i called a waiter and told him to look into all the rooms in the house they might have gone into the wrong place but they were not to be seen anywhere  then i went back to the fireplace and did some more thinking there was no sense in supposing that they had made a mistake they all knew this restaurant and they all knew the time in a moment i said to myself  i know how it is father has made up his mind that he will not be mixed up in any affair of this kind where a quarrel keeps the host of the party from occupying his proper place especially as hemy fatheris expected to occupy that place himself so he and mother and helen have just quietly staid in their rooms at the hotel mrs chipperton and corny wont come without uncle chipperton they might ride right to the door of course but they are ashamed and dont want to have to make explanations and it is ridiculous to suppose that they wont have to be made as for rectus and his people they could not have heard anything buti have it old colbert got his back up too and wouldnt come either for fear a quarrel would be picked or because he could take no pleasure in seeing uncle chipperton enjoying food and rectus and his mother wouldnt come without him  it turned out when i heard from all the parties that i had got the matter exactly right  we shall have to make fresh preparations sir if we wait any longer said the headwaiter coming in with an air of great mental disturbance  dont wait said i bring in the dinner at least enough for me i dont believe any one else will be here  the waiter looked bewildered but he obeyed i took my seat at the place where my card lay at the middle of one side of the table and spread my napkin in my lap the headwaiter waited on me himself and one or two other waiters came in to stand around and take away dishes and try to find something to do  it was a capital dinner and i went carefully through all the courses i was hungry i had been saving up some extra appetite for this dinner and my regular appetite was a very good one  i had raw oysters  and soup  and fish with delicious sauce  and roast duck  and croquettes made of something extraordinarily nice  and beef à la mode  and all sorts of vegetables in their proper places  and readymade salad  and orange pie  and winejelly  and icecream  and bananas oranges and white grapes  and raisins and almonds and nuts  and a cup of coffee  i let some of these things off pretty easy toward the last but i did not swerve from my line of duty i went through all the courses quietly and deliberately it was a dinner in my honor and i did all the honor i could to it  i was leaning back in my chair with a satisfied soul and nibbling at some raisins while i slowly drank my coffee when the outer door opened and uncle chipperton entered  he looked at me in astonishment then he looked at the table with the clean plates and glasses at every place but one then he took it all in or at least i supposed he did for he sat down on a chair near the door and burst out into the wildest fit of laughing the waiters came running into the room to see what was the matter but for several minutes uncle chipperton could not speak he laughed until i thought hed crack something i laughed too but not so much  i see it all he gasped at last i see it all i see just how it happened  and when we compared our ideas of the matter we found that they were just the same  i wanted him to sit down and eat something but he would not do it he said he wouldnt spoil such a unique performance for anything it was one of the most comical meals he had ever heard of  i was glad he enjoyed it so much for he paid for the whole dinner for ten which had been prepared at his order  when we reached the street uncle chipperton put on a graver look  this is all truly very funny he said but after all there is something about it which makes me feel ashamed of myself would you object to take a ride it is only about eight oclock i want to go up to see old colbert  i agreed to go and we got into a streetcar the colberts lived in one of the uptown streets and uncle chipperton had been at their house on business  i never went to see them in a friendly way before he said  it was comforting to hear that this was to be a friendly visit  when we reached the house we found the family of three in the parlor they had probably had all the dinner they wanted but they did not look exactly satisfied with the world or themselves  look here colbert said uncle chipperton after shaking hands with mrs colbert why didnt you go to my dinner  well said mr colbert looking him straight in the face i thought id better stay where i was i didnt want to make any trouble or pick any quarrels i didnt intend to keep my wife and son away but they wouldnt go without me  no indeed said mrs colbert  oh well said uncle chipperton you neednt feel bad about it i didnt go myself  at this they all opened their eyes as wide as the law allowed  no he continued i didnt want to make any disturbance or illfeeling and so i didnt go and my wife and daughter didnt want to go without me and so they didnt go and i expect wills father and mother didnt care to be on hand at a time when bad feeling might be shown and so they didnt go there was no one there but will he ate all of the dinner that was eaten he went straight through it from one end to the other and there was no illfeeling no discord no cloud of any kind all perfectly harmonious wasnt it will  perfectly said i  i just wish i had known about it said rectus a little sadly  and now mr colbert said uncle chipperton i dont want this to happen again there may be other reunions of this kind and we may want to go and there ought to be such reunions between families whose sons and daughter have been cast away together on a liferaft in the middle of the ocean  thats so said mrs colbert warmly  i thought they were saved on a liferaft said old colbert dryly and i didnt know it was in the middle of the ocean  well fix that as you please said uncle chipperton what i want to propose is this let us settle our quarrel lets split our difference will you agree to divide that four inches of ground and call it square ill pay for two inches  do you mean youll pay half the damages ive laid asked old colbert  thats what i mean said uncle chipperton  all right said mr colbert ill agree and they shook hands on it  now then said uncle chipperton who seemed unusually lively i must go see the gordons and explain matters to them wont you come along rectus and rectus came  on the way to our hotel we stopped for corny and her mother we might as well have a party uncle chipperton said  we had a gay time at our rooms my father and mother were greatly amused at the way the thing had turned out and very much pleased that mr colbert and uncle chipperton had become reconciled to each other  i thought he had a good heart said my mother softly to me looking over to uncle chipperton who was telling my father for the second time just how i looked as i sat alone at the long table  little helen had not gone to bed yet and she was sorry about the dinner in the same way that rectus was so was corny but she was too glad that the quarrel between her father and mr colbert was over to care much for the loss of the dinner she was always very much disturbed by quarrels between friends or friends fathers     chapter xxiv  the story ends   three letters came to me the next morning i was rather surprised at this because i did not expect to get letters after i found myself at home or at least with my family the first of these was handed to me by rectus it was from his father this is the letter            my dear boy this opening seemed a little           curious to me for i did not suppose the old           gentleman thought of me in that way i shall not           be able to see you again before you leave for           willisville so i write this note just to tell you           how entirely i am satisfied with the way in which           you performed the very difficult business i           intrusted to youthat of taking charge of my son           in his recent travels the trip was not a very           long one but i am sure it has been of great           service to him and i also believe that a great           deal of the benefit he has received has been due           to you i stopped here and tried to think what           i had done for the boy besides the thrashing i           gave him in nassau i could not think of           anything i have been talking a great deal with           sammy in the last day or two about his doings           while he was away and although i cannot exactly           fix my mind on any particular action on your           part which proves what i say he was in the same           predicament here in which i was myself yet i           feel positively assured that your companionship           and influence have been of the greatest service to           him among other things he really wants to go to           college i am delighted at this it was with much           sorrow that i gave up the idea of making him a           scholar but though he was a good boy i saw that           it was useless to keep him at the academy at           willisville and so made up my mind to take him           into my office but i know you put this college           idea into his head though how i cannot say and           i am sure that it does not matter sammy tells me           that you never understood that he was to be           entirely in your charge but since you brought him           out so well without knowing this it does you more           credit i am very grateful to you if i find a           chance to do you a real service i will do it                         yours very truly                                      samuel colbert sr  the second letter was handed to me by corny and was from her mother i shall not copy that here for it is much worse than mr colberts it praised me for doing a lot of things which i never did at all but i excused mrs chipperton for a good deal she said for she had passed through so much anxiety and trouble and was now going to settle down for good with corny at school that i didnt wonder she felt happy enough to write a little wildly but there was one queer resemblance between her letter and old mr colberts she said two or three timesit was an awfully long letterthat there was not any particular thing that she alluded to when she spoke of my actions that was the funny part of it they couldnt put their fingers on anything really worth mentioning after all  my third letter had come by mail and was a little old my mother gave it to me and told me that it had come to the postoffice at willisville about a week before and that she had brought it down to give it to me but had totally forgotten it until that morning it was from st augustine and this is an exact copy of it            my good friend big little man i love you my           name maidens heart you much pious you buy           beans pay good me wants one speckled shirt           crowded owl want one speckled shirt too you send

the morning most of our party met to bid each other goodbye corny rectus and i were standing together having our little windingup talk when rectus asked corny if she had kept her gray bean the insignia of our society  to be sure i have she said pulling it out from under her cloak i have it on this little chain which i wear around my neck ive worn it ever since i got it and i see you each have kept yours on your watchguards  yes i said and theyre the only things of the kind we saved from the burning tigris going to keep yours  yes indeed said corny warmly  so shall i said i  and i too said rectus  and then we shook hands and parted   the end     scribners new books for young people  1901 and 1902   by the author of wild animals i have known  lives of the hunted            by ernest
