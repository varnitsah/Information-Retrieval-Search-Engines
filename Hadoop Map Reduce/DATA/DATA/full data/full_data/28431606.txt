28431606	ships company  by ww jacobs    the bequest  r robert clarkson sat by his fire smoking thoughtfully  his lifelong neighbour and successful rival in love had passed away a few days before and mr clarkson fresh from the obsequies sat musing on the fragility of man and the inconvenience that sometimes attended his departure  his meditations were disturbed by a low knocking on the front door which opened on to the street  in response to his invitation it opened slowly and a small middleaged man of doleful aspect entered softly and closed it behind him  evening bob he said in stricken accents  i thought id just step round to see how you was bearing up  fancy pore old phipps  why id amost as soon it had been me  amost  mr clarkson nodded  here today and gone tomorrow continued mr smithson taking a seat well well  so youll have her at lastpore thing  that was his wish said mr clarkson in a dull voice  and very generous of him too said mr smithson  everybody is saying so  certainly he couldnt take her away with him  how long is it since you was both of you courting her  thirty years come june replied the other  shows what waiting does and patience commented mr smithson  if youd been like some chaps and gone abroad where would you have been now  where would have been the reward of your faithful heart  mr clarkson whose pipe had gone out took a coal from the fire and lit it again  i cant understand him dying at his age he said darkly  he ought to have lived to ninety if hed been taken care of  well hes gone pore chap said his friend  what a blessing it must ha been to him in his last moments to think that he had made provision for his wife  provision  exclaimed mr clarkson  why hes left her nothing but the furniture and fifty pounds insurance moneynothing in the world  mr smithson fidgeted  i mean you he said staring  oh said the other  oh yesyes of course  and he doesnt want you to eat your heart out in waiting said mr smithson  never mind about me he said to her you go and make bob happy  wonderful pretty girl she used to be didnt she  mr clarkson assented  and ive no doubt she looks the same to you as ever she did pursued the sentimental mr smithson  thats the extraordinary part of it  mr clarkson turned and eyed him removed the pipe from his mouth and after hesitating a moment replaced it with a jerk  she says shed rather be faithful to his memory continued the persevering mr smithson but his wishes are her law  she said so to my missis only yesterday  still she ought to be considered said mr clarkson shaking his head i think that somebody ought to put it to her  she has got her feelings poor thing and if she would rather not marry again she oughtnt to be compelled to  just what my missis did say to her said the other but she didnt pay much attention  she said it was henrys wish and she didnt care what happened to her now hes gone  besides if you come to think of it what else is she to do  dont you worry bob you wont lose her again  mr clarkson staring at the fire mused darkly  for thirty years he had played the congenial part of the disappointed admirer but faithful friend  he had intended to play it for at least fifty or sixty  he wished that he had had the strength of mind to refuse the bequest when the late mr phipps first mentioned it or taken a firmer line over the congratulations of his friends  as it was little molton quite understood that after thirty years waiting the faithful heart was to be rewarded at last  public opinion seemed to be that the late mr phipps had behaved with extraordinary generosity  its rather late in life for me to begin said mr clarkson at last  better late than never said the cheerful mr smithson  and something seems to tell me that i aint long for this world continued mr clarkson eyeing him with some disfavour  stuff and nonsense said mr smithson  youll lose all them ideas as soon as youre married  youll have somebody to look after you and help you spend your money  mr clarkson emitted a dismal groan and clapping his hand over his mouth strove to make it pass muster as a yawn  it was evident that the malicious mr smithson was deriving considerable pleasure from his discomfiturethe pleasure natural to the father of seven over the troubles of a comfortable bachelor  mr clarkson anxious to share his troubles with somebody came to a sudden and malicious determination to share them with mr smithson  i dont want anybody to help me spend my money he said slowly first and last ive saved a tidy bit  ive got this house those three cottages in turners lane and pretty near six hundred pounds in the bank  mr smithsons eyes glistened  i had thoughtit had occurred to me said mr clarkson trying to keep as near the truth as possible to leave my property to a friend o mine a hardworking man with a large family  however its no use talking about that now  its too late  whowho was it  inquired his friend trying to keep his voice steady  mr clarkson shook his head  its no good talking about that now george he said eyeing him with sly enjoyment  i shall have to leave everything to my wife now  after all perhaps it does more harm than good to leave money to people  rubbish  said mr smithson sharply  who was it  you george said mr clarkson softly  me  said the other with a gasp  me  he jumped up from his chair and seizing the others hand shook it fervently  i oughtnt to have told you george said mr clarkson with great satisfaction  itll only make you miserable  its just one o the might ha beens  mr smithson with his back to the fire and his hands twisted behind him stood with his eyes fixed in thought  its rather cool of phipps he said after a long silence rather cool i think to go out of the world and just leave his wife to you to look after  some men wouldnt stand it  youre too easygoing bob thats whats the matter with you  mr clarkson sighed  and get took advantage of added his friend  its all very well to talk said mr clarkson but what can i do  i ought to have spoke up at the time  its too late now  if i was you said his friend very earnestly and didnt want to marry her i should tell her so  say what you like it aint fair to her you know  it aint fair to the pore woman  shed never forgive you if she found it out  everybodys taking it for granted said the other  let everybody look after their own business said mr smithson tartly now look here bob suppose i get you out of this business how am i to be sure youll leave your property to menot that i want it  suppose you altered your will  if you get me out of it every penny i leave will go to you said mr clarkson fervently  i havent got any relations and it dont matter in the slightest to me who has it after im gone  as true as you stand there  demanded the other eyeing him fixedly  as true as i stand here said mr clarkson smiting his chest and shook hands again  long after his visitor had gone he sat gazing in a brooding fashion at the fire  as a single man his wants were few and he could live on his savings as the husband of mrs phipps he would be compelled to resume the work he thought he had dropped for good three years before moreover mrs phipps possessed a strength of character that had many times caused him to congratulate himself upon her choice of a husband  slowly but surely his fetters were made secure  two days later the widow departed to spend six weeks with a sister but any joy that he might have felt over the circumstance was marred by the fact that he had to carry her bags down to the railway station and see her off  the key of her house was left with him with strict injunctions to go in and water her geraniums every day while two canaries and a bullfinch had to be removed to his own house in order that they might have constant attention and company  shes doing it on purpose said mr smithson fiercely shes binding you hand and foot  mr clarkson assented gloomily  im trusting to you george he remarked  howd it be to forget to water the geraniums and let the birds die because they missed her so much  suggested mr smithson after prolonged thought  mr clarkson shivered  it would be a hint said his friend  mr clarkson took some letters from the mantelpiece and held them up she writes about them every day he said briefly and i have to answer them  sheshe dont refer to your getting married i suppose  said his friend anxiously  mr clarkson said no  but her sister does he added  ive had two letters from her  mr smithson got up and paced restlessly up and down the room  thats women all over he said bitterly  they never ask for things straight out but they always get em in roundabout ways  she cant do it herself so she gets her sister to do it  mr clarkson groaned  and her sister is hinting that she cant leave the house where she spent so many happy years he said and says what a pleasant surprise it would be for mrs phipps if she was to come home and find it done up  that means youve got to live there when youre married said his friend solemnly  mr clarkson glanced round his comfortable room and groaned again  she asked me to get an estimate from digson he said dully  she knows as well as i do her sister hasnt got any money  i wrote to say that it had better be left till she comes home as i might not know what was wanted  mr smithson nodded approval  and mrs phipps wrote herself and thanked me for being so considerate continued his friend grimly and says that when she comes back we must go over the house together and see what wants doing  mr smithson got up and walked round the room again  you never promised to marry her  he said stopping suddenly  no said the other  its all been arranged for me  i never said a word  i couldnt tell phipps i wouldnt have her with them all standing round and him thinking he was doing me the greatest favour in the world  well she cant name the day unless you ask her said the other  all youve got to do is to keep quiet and not commit yourself  be as cool as you can and just before she comes home you go off to london on business and stay there as long as possible  mr clarkson carried out his instructions to the letter and mrs phipps returning home at the end of her visit learned that he had left for london three days before leaving the geraniums and birds to the care of mr smithson  from the hands of that unjust steward she received two empty birdcages together with a detailed account of the manner in which the occupants had effected their escape and a bullfinch that seemed to be suffering from torpid liver  the condition of the geraniums was ascribed to worms in the pots frost and premature decay  they go like it sometimes said mr smithson and when they do nothing will save em  mrs phipps thanked him  its very kind of you to take so much trouble she said quietly some people would have lost the cages too while they were about it  i did my best said mr smithson in a surly voice  i know you did said mrs phipps thoughtfully and i am sure i am much obliged to you  if there is anything of yours i can look after at any time i shall be only too pleased  when did you say mr clarkson was coming back  he dont know said mr smithson promptly  he might be away a month and then again he might be away six  it all depends  you know what business is  its very thoughtful of him said mrs phipps  very  thoughtful  repeated mr smithson  he has gone away for a time out of consideration for me said the widow  as things are it is a little bit awkward for us to meet much at present  i dont think hes gone away for that at all said the other bluntly  mrs phipps shook her head  ah you dont know him as well as i do she said fondly  he has gone away on my account i feel sure  mr smithson screwed his lips together and remained silent  when he feels that it is right and proper for him to come back pursued mrs phipps turning her eyes upwards he will come  he has left his comfortable home just for my sake and i shall not forget it  mr smithson cougheda short dry cough meant to convey incredulity  i shall not do anything to this house till he comes back said mrs phipps  i expect he would like to have a voice in it  he always used to admire it and say how comfortable it was  well well we never know what is before us  mr smithson repeated the substance of the interview to mr clarkson by letter and in the lengthy correspondence that followed kept him posted as to the movements of mrs phipps  by dint of warnings and entreaties he kept the bridegroomelect in london for three months  by that time little molton was beginning to talk  theyre beginning to see how the land lays said mr smithson on the evening of his friends return and if you keep quiet and do as i tell you shell begin to see it too  as i said before she cant name the day till you ask her  mr clarkson agreed and the following morning when he called upon mrs phipps at her request his manner was so distant that she attributed it to illhealth following business worries and the atmosphere of london in the front parlour mr digson a small builder and contractor was busy whitewashing  i thought we might as well get on with that said mrs phipps there is only one way of doing whitewashing and the room has got to be done tomorrow mr digson will bring up some papers and if youll come round you can help me choose  mr clarkson hesitated  why not choose em yourself  he said at last  just what i told her said mr digson stroking his black beard whatll please you will be sure to please him i says and if it dont it ought to  mr clarkson started  perhaps you could help her choose he said sharply  mr digson came down from his perch  just what i said he replied if mrs phipps will let me advise her ill make this house so she wont know it before ive done with it  mr digson has been very kind said mrs phipps reproachfully  not at all maam said the builder softly  anything i can do to make you happy or comfortable will be a pleasure to me  mr clarkson started again and an odd idea sent his blood dancing digson was a widower mrs phipps was a widow  could anything be more suitable or desirable  better let him choose he said  after all he ought to be a good judge  mrs phipps after a faint protest gave way and mr digson smiling broadly mounted his perch again  mr clarksons first idea was to consult mr smithson then he resolved to wait upon events  the idea was fantastic to begin with but if things did take such a satisfactory turn he could not help reflecting that it would not be due to any efforts on the part of mr smithson and he would no longer be under any testamentary obligations to that enterprising gentleman  by the end of a week he was jubilant  a child could have told mr digsons intentionsand mrs phipps was anything but a child  mr clarkson admitted cheerfully that mr digson was a younger and better looking man than himselfa more suitable match in every way  and so far as he could judge mrs phipps seemed to think so  at any rate she had ceased to make the faintest allusion to any tie between them  he left her one day painting a door while the attentive digson guided the brush and walked homewards smiling  morning  said a voice behind him  morning bignell said mr clarkson  whenwhen is it to be inquired his friend walking beside him  mr clarkson frowned  when is what to be he demanded disagreeably  mr bignell lowered his voice  youll lose her if you aint careful he said  mark my words  cant you see digsons little game  mr clarkson shrugged his shoulders  hes after her money said the other with a cautious glance around  money  said the other with an astonished laugh  why she hasnt got any   illustration shell be riding in her carriage and pair in six months   oh all right said mr bignell  you know best of course  i was just giving you the tip but if you know betterwhy theres nothing more to be said  shell be riding in her carriage and pair in six months anyhow the richest woman in little molton  mr clarkson stopped short and eyed him in perplexity  digson got a bit sprung one night and told me said mr bignell  she dont know it herself yetuncle on her mothers side in america  she might know at any moment  butbut how did digson know  inquired the astonished mr clarkson  he wouldnt tell me was the reply  but its good enough for him what do you think hes after  her  and mind dont let on to a soul that i told you  he walked on leaving mr clarkson standing in a dazed condition in the centre of the footpath  recovering himself by an effort he walked slowly away and after prowling about for some time in an aimless fashion made his way back to mrs phippss house  he emerged an hour later an engaged man with the date of the wedding fixed  with jaunty steps he walked round and put up the banns and then with the air of a man who has completed a successful stroke of business walked homewards  little molton is a small town and news travels fast but it did not travel faster than mr smithson as soon as he had heard it  he burst into mr clarksons room like the proverbial hurricane and gasping for breath leaned against the table and pointed at him an incriminating finger  you youve been running said mr clarkson uneasily  whatwhatwhat do youmean by it gasped mr smithson  after all my trouble  after ourbargain  i altered my mind said mr clarkson with dignity  pah  said the other  just in time said mr clarkson speaking rapidly  another day and i believe i should ha been too late  it took me pretty near an hour to talk her over  said id been neglecting her and all that sort of thing said that she was beginning to think i didnt want her  as hard a job as ever i had in my life  but you didnt want her said the amazed mr smithson  you told me so  you misunderstood me said mr clarkson coughing  you jump at conclusions  mr smithson sat staring at him  i heard he said at last with an effort  i heard that digson was paying her attentions  mr clarkson spoke without thought  ha he was only after her money he said severely  good heavens  whats the matter  mr smithson who had sprung to his feet made no reply but stood for some time incapable of speech  whatisthematter  repeated mr clarkson  aint you well  mr smithson swayed a little and sank slowly back into his chair again  rooms too hot said his astonished host  mr smithson staring straight before him nodded  as i was saying resumed mr clarkson in the low tones of confidence digson was after her money  of course her money dont make any difference to me although perhaps i may be able to do something for friends like you  its from an uncle in america on her mothers  mr smithson made a strange moaning noise and snatching his hat from the table clapped it on his head and made for the door  mr clarkson flung his arms around him and dragged him back by main force  what are you carrying on like that for he demanded  what do you mean by it  fancy  returned mr smithson with intense bitterness  i thought digson was the biggest fool in the place and i find ive made  a mistake  so have you  goodnight  he opened the door and dashed out  mr clarkson with a strange sinking at his heart watched him up the road
