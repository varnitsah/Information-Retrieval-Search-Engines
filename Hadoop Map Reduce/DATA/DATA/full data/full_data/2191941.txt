of her dancingcard did not help them out  a lively matron of as youthful a temperament as the lively girls she brought in her train burst upon them  she shook her head and said nobody has been here except  no burglar could have missed me if he had wanted an easy mark  you shall not say that  she glared at editha what you got that black on for     i  a sleep and a forgetting   i  matthew lanfear had stopped off between genoa and nice at san remo in the interest of a friend who had come over on the steamer with him and who wished him to test the air before settling there for the winter with an invalid wife she was one of those neurasthenics who really carry their climatealways a bad onewith them but she had set her mind on san remo and lanfear was willing to pass a few days in the place making the observations which he felt pretty sure would be adverse  his train was rather late and the sunset was fading from the french sky beyond the italian shore when he got out of his car and looked round for a porter to take his valise his roving eye lighted on the anxious figure which as fully as the anxious face of a short stout elderly man expressed a sort of distraction as he stood loaded down with umbrellas bags bundles and wraps and seemed unable to arrest the movements of a tall young girl with a travellingshawl trailing from her arm who had the effect of escaping from him towards a bench beside the door of the waitingroom when she reached it in spite of his appeals she sat down with an absent air and looked as far withdrawn from the bustle of the platform and from the snuffling train as if on some quiet garden seat along with her own thoughts  in his fat frenzy which lanfear felt to be pathetic the old gentleman glanced at him and then abruptly demanded are you an american  we knew each other abroad in some mystical way and lanfear did not try to deny the fact  oh well then the stranger said as if the fact made everything right will you kindly tell my daughter on that bench by the door yonderhe pointed with a bag and dropped a roll of rugs from under his armthat ill be with her as soon as ive looked after the trunks tell her not to move till i come heigh here take hold of these will you he caught the sleeve of a facchino who came wandering by and heaped him with his burdens and then pushed ahead of the man in the direction of the baggageroom with a sort of mastery of the situation which struck lanfear as springing from desperation rather than experience  lanfear stood a moment hesitating then a glance at the girl on the bench drooping a little forward in freeing her face from the veil that hung from her pretty hat together with a sense of something quaintly charming in the confidence shown him on such purely compatriotic grounds decided him to do just what he had been asked the girl had got her veil up by this time and as he came near she turned from looking at the sunset over the stretch of wall beyond the halting train and met his dubious face with a smile  it is beautiful isnt it she said i know i shall get well here if they have such sunsets every day  there was something so convincingly normal in her expression that lanfear dismissed a painful conjecture i beg your pardon he said i am afraid theres some mistake i havent the pleasureyou must excuse me but your father wished me to ask you to wait here for him till he had got his baggage  my father the girl stopped him with a sort of a frowning perplexity in the stare she gave him my father isnt here  i beg your pardon lanfear said i must have misunderstood a gentleman who got out of the train with youa short stout gentleman with gray hairi understood him to say you were his daughterrequested me to bring this message  the girl shook her head i dont know him it must be a mistake  the mistake is mine no doubt it may have been some one else whom he pointed out and i have blundered im very sorry if i seem to have intruded  what place is this the girl asked without noticing his excuses  san remo lanfear answered if you didnt intend to stop here your train will be leaving in a moment  i meant to get off i suppose she said i dont believe im going any farther she leaned back against the bars of the bench and put up one of her slim arms along the top  there was something wrong lanfear now felt that in spite of her perfect tranquillity and selfpossession perhaps because of it he had no business to stay there talking with her but he had not quite the right to leave her though practically he had got his dismissal and apparently she was quite capable of taking care of herself or could have been so in a country where any womans defencelessness was not any mans advantage he could not go away without some effort to be of use  i beg your pardon he said can i help you in calling a carriage or looking after your handbaggageit will be getting darkperhaps your maid  my maid the girl frowned again with a measure of the amazement which she showed when he mentioned her father i have no maid  lanfear blurted desperately out you are alone you cameyou are going to stay herealone  quite alone she said with a passivity in which there was no resentment and no feeling unless it were a certain color of dignity almost at the same time with a glance beside and beyond him she called out joyfully ah there you are and lanfear turned and saw scuffling and heard puffing towards them the short stout elderly gentleman who had sent him to her i knew you would come before long  well i thought it was pretty long myself the gentleman said and then he courteously referred himself to lanfear im afraid this gentleman has found it rather long too but i couldnt manage it a moment sooner  lanfear said not at all i wish i could have been of any use to  my daughtermiss gerald mr  lanfeardr lanfear he said accepting the introduction and the girl bowed  oh doctor eh the father said with a certain impression going to stop here  a few days lanfear answered making way for the forward movement which the others began  well well im very much obliged to you very much indeed and im sure my daughter is  the girl said oh yes indeed rather indifferently and then as they passed him while he stood lifting his hat she turned radiantly on him thank you ever so much she said with the gentle voice which he had already thought charming  the father called back i hope we shall meet again we are going to the sardegna  lanfear had been going to the sardegna himself but while he bowed he now decided upon another hotel  the mystery whatever it was that the brave little fat father was carrying off so bluffly had clearly the morbid quality of unhealth in it and lanfear could not give himself freely to a young pleasure in the girls dark beauty of eyes and hair her pale irregular piquant face her slender figure and flowing walk he was in the presence of something else something that appealed to his scientific side to that which was humane more than that which was human in him and abashed him in the other feeling unless she was out of her mind there was no way of accounting for her behavior except by some caprice which was itself scarcely short of insanity she must have thought she knew him when he approached and when she addressed him those first words but when he had tried to set her right she had not changed and why had she denied her father and then hailed him with joy when he came back to her she had known that she intended to stop at san remo but she had not known where she had stopped when she asked what place it was she was consciously an invalid of some sort for she spoke of getting well under sunsets like that which had now waned but what sort of invalid was she   ii  lanfears question persisted through the night and it helped with the coughing in the next room to make a bad night for him none of the hotels in san remo receive consumptive patients but none are without somewhere a bronchial cough if it is in the room next yours it keeps you awake but it is not pulmonary you may comfort yourself in your vigils with that fact lanfear however fancied he had got a poor dinner and in the morning he did not like his coffee he thought he had let a foolish scruple keep him from the grand hotel sardegna and he walked down towards it along the palmflanked promenade in the gay morning light with the tideless sea on the other hand lapping the rough beach beyond the lines of the railroad which borders it on his way he met files of the beautiful ligurian women moving straight under the burdens balanced on their heads or bestriding the donkeys laden with winecasks in the roadway or following beside the carts which the donkeys drew ladies of all nations in the summer fashions of london berlin st petersburg paris and new york thronged the path the sky was of a blue so deep so liquid that it seemed to him he could scoop it in his hand and pour it out again like water seaward he glanced at the fishingboats lying motionless in the offing and the coastwise steamer that runs between nice and genoa trailing a thin plume of smoke between him and their white sails with the more definite purpose of making sure of the grand hotel sardegna he scanned the different villa slopes that showed their level lines of white and yellow and dull pink through the gray tropical greenery on the different levels of the hills he was duly rewarded by the sight of the bold legend topping its cornice and when he let his eye descend the garden to a little pavilion on the wall overlooking the road he saw his acquaintances of the evening before making a belated breakfast the father recognized lanfear first and spoke to his daughter who looked up from her coffee and down towards him where he wavered lifting his hat and bowed smiling to him he had no reason to cross the roadway towards the white stairway which climbed from it to the hotel grounds but he did so the father leaned out over the wall and called down to him wont you come up and join us doctor  why yes lanfear consented and in another moment he was shaking hands with the girl to whom he noticed her father named him again he had in his glad sense of her white morning dress and her hat of greenleafed lace a feeling that she was somehow meeting him as a friend of indefinite date in an intimacy unconditioned by any past or future time her pleasure in his being there was as frank as her fathers and there was a pretty trust of him in every word and tone which forbade misinterpretation  i was just talking about you doctor the father began and saying what a pity you hadnt come to our hotel its a capital place  ive been thinking it was a pity i went to mine lanfear returned though im in san remo for such a short time its scarcely worth while to change  well perhaps if you came here you might stay longer i guess were booked for the winter nannie he referred the question to his daughter who asked lanfear if he would not have some coffee  i was going to say i had had my coffee but im not sure it was coffee lanfear began and he consented with some demur banal enough about the trouble  well thats right then and no trouble at all mr gerald broke in upon him here comes a fellow looking for a chance to bring you some and he called to a waiter wandering distractedly about with a heigh that might have been offensive from a less obviously inoffensive man can you get our friend here a cup and saucer and some of this good coffee he asked as the waiter approached  yes certainly sir the man answered in careful english is it not perhaps mr and misses gerald he smilingly insinuated offering some cards  miss gerald the father corrected him as he took the cards why hello nannie here are the bells where are they he demanded of the waiter bring them here and a lot more cups and saucers or hold on id better go myself nannie hadnt i of course you get the crockery waiter where did you say they were he bustled up from his chair without waiting for a distinct reply and apologized to lanfear in hurrying away youll excuse me doctor ill be back in half a minute friends of ours that came over on the same boat i must see them of course but i dont believe theyll stay nannie dont let dr lanfear get away i want to have some talk with him you tell him hed better come to the sardegna here  lanfear and miss gerald sat a moment in the silence which is apt to follow with young people when they are unexpectedly left to themselves she kept absently pushing the cards her father had given her up and down on the table between her thumb and forefinger and lanfear noted the translucence of her long thin hand in the sunshine striking across the painted iron surface of the garden movable the translucence had a pathos for his intelligence which the pensive tilt of her head enhanced she stopped toying with the cards and looked at the addresses on them  what strange things names are she said as if musing on the fact with a sigh which he thought disproportioned to the depth of her remark  they seem rather irrelevant at times he admitted with a smile theyre mere tags labels which can be attached to one as well as another they seem to belong equally to anybody  that is what i always say to myself she agreed with more interest than he found explicable  but finally he returned theyre all thats left us if theyre left themselves they are the only signs to the few who knew us that we ever existed they stand for our characters our personality our mind our soul  she said that is very true and then she suddenly gave him the cards do you know these people  i i thought they were friends of yours he replied astonished  illustration a lively matron of as youthful a temperament as the lively girls she brought in her train burst upon them  that is what papa thinks miss gerald said and while she sat dreamily absent a rustle of skirts and a flutter of voices pierced from the surrounding shrubbery and then a lively matron of as youthful a temperament as the lively girls she brought in her train burst upon them and miss gerald was passed from one embrace to another until all four had kissed her she returned their greeting and shared in her quieter way their raptures at their encounter  such a hunt as weve had for you the matron shouted weve been upstairs and downstairs and in my ladys chamber all over the hotel wheres your father ah they did get our cards to you and by that token lanfear knew that these ladies were the bells he had stood up in a sort of expectancy but miss gerald did not introduce him and a shadow of embarrassment passed over the party which she seemed to feel least though he fancied a sort of entreaty in the glance that she let pass over him  i suppose hes gone to look for us mrs bell saved the situation with a protecting laugh miss gerald colored intelligently and lanfear could not let mrs bells implication pass  if it is mrs bell he said i can answer that he has i met you at magnolia some years ago mrs bell dr lanfear  oh i beg your pardon dr lanfear miss gerald said i couldnt think  of my tag my label he laughed back it isnt very distinctly lettered  mrs bell was not much minding them jointly she was singling lanfear out for the expression of her pleasure in seeing him again and recalling the incidents of her summer at magnolia before it seemed any of her girls were out she presented them collectively and the eldest of them charmingly reminded lanfear that he had once had the magnanimity to dance with her when she sat in a little girls forlorn despair of being danced with at one of those desolate hops of the good old osprey house  yes and now her mother followed we cant wait a moment longer if were to get our train for monte carlo girls were not going to play doctor she made time to explain but we are going to look on will you tell your father dear she said taking the girls hands caressingly in hers and drawing her to her motherly bosom that we found you and did our best to find him we cant wait nowour carriage is champing the bit at the foot of the stairsbut were coming back in a week and then well do our best to look you up again she included lanfear in her goodbye and all her girls said goodbye in the same way and with a whisking of skirts and twitter of voices they vanished through the shrubbery and faded into the general silence and general sound like a bevy of birds which had swept near and passed by  miss gerald sank quietly into her place and sat as if nothing had happened except that she looked a little paler to lanfear who remained on foot trying to piece together their interrupted têteàtête but not succeeding when her father reappeared red and breathless and wiping his forehead have they been here nannie he asked ive been following them all over the place and the portier told me just now that he had seen a party of ladies coming down this way  he got it all out not so clearly as those women had got everything in lanfear reflected but unmistakably enough as to the fact and he looked at his daughter as he repeated havent the bells been here  illustration she shook her head and said nobody has been here except  she shook her head and said with her delicate quiet nobody has been here except she glanced at lanfear who smiled but saw no opening for himself in the strange situation then she said i think i will go and lie down a while now papa im rather tired goodbye she said giving lanfear her hand it felt limp and cold and then she turned to her father again dont you come papa i can get back perfectly well by myself stay with  i will go with you her father said and if dr lanfear doesnt mind coming  certainly i will come lanfear said and he passed to the girls right she had taken her fathers arm but he wished to offer more support if it were needed when they had climbed to the open flowery space before the hotel she seemed aware of the groups of people about she took her hand from her fathers arm as if unwilling to attract their notice by seeming to need its help and swept up the gravelled path between him and lanfear with her flowing walk  her father fell back as they entered the hotel door and murmured to lanfear will you wait till i come down  i wanted to tell you about my daughter he explained when he came back after the quarter of an hour which lanfear had found rather intense its useless to pretend you wouldnt have noticedhad nobody been with you after i left you down there he twisted his head in the direction of the pavilion where they had been breakfasting  yes mrs bell and her daughters lanfear answered simply  of course why do you suppose my daughter denied it mr gerald asked  i suppose shehad her reasons lanfear answered lamely enough  no reason im afraid mr gerald said and he broke out hopelessly she has her mind sound enough but notnot her memory she had forgotten that they were there are you going to stay in san remo he asked with an effect of interrupting himself as if in the wish to put off something or to make the ground sure before he went on  why lanfear said i hadnt thought of it i stoppedi was going to niceto test the air for a friend who wishes to bring his invalid wife here if i approvebut i have just been asking myself why i should go to nice when i could stay at san remo the place takes my fancy im something of an invalid myselfat least im on my vacationand i find a charm in it if nothing better perhaps a charm is enough it used to be in primitive medicine  he was talking to what he felt was not an undivided attention in mr gerald who said im glad of it and then added i should like to consult you professionally i know your reputation in new yorkthough im not a newyorker myselfand i dont know any of the doctors here i suppose ive done rather a wild thing in coming off the way i have with my daughter but i felt that i must do something and i hopedi felt as if it were getting away from our trouble its most fortunate my meeting you if you can look into the case and help me out with a nurse if shes needed and all that to a certain hesitation in lanfears face he added of course im asking your professional help my name is abner geraldabner l geraldperhaps you know my standing and that im able to  oh it isnt a question of that i shall be glad to do anything i can lanfear said with a little pang which he tried to keep silent in orienting himself anew towards the girl whose loveliness he had felt before he had felt her piteousness  but before you go further i ought to say that you must have been thinking of my uncle the first matthew lanfear when you spoke of my reputation i havent got any yet ive only got my uncles name  oh mr gerald said disappointedly but after a blank moment he apparently took courage youre in the same line though  if you mean the psychopathic line without being exactly an alienist well yes lanfear admitted  thats exactly what i mean the elder said with renewed hopefulness im quite willing to risk myself with a man of the same name as dr lanfear i should like he said hurrying on as if to override any further reluctance of lanfears to tell you her story and then  by all means lanfear consented and he put on an air of professional deference while the older man began with a face set for the task  its a long story or its a short story as you choose to make it well make it long if necessary later but now ill make it short five months ago my wife was killed before my daughters eyes  he stopped lanfear breathed a gentle oh and gerald blurted out  accidentgrade crossingdont he winced at the kindness in lanfears eyes and panted on thats over what happened to herto my daughterwas that she fainted from the shock when she wokeit was more like a sleep than a swoonshe didnt remember what had happened lanfear nodded with a gravely interested face she didnt remember anything that had ever happened before she knew me because i was there with her but she didnt know that she ever had a mother because she was not there with her you see  i can imagine lanfear assented  the whole of her life before theaccident was wiped out as to the facts as completely as if it had never been and now every day every hour every minute as it passes goes with that past but her faculties  yes lanfear prompted in the pause which mr gerald made  her intellectthe working powers of her mind apart from anything like remembering are as perfect as if she were in full possession of her memory i believe the father said with a pride that had its pathos no one can talk with her and not feel that she has a beautiful mind that she can think better than most girls of her age she reads or she lets me read to her and until it has time to fade she appreciates it all more fully than i do at genoa where i took her to the palaces for the pictures i saw that she had kept her feeling for art when she playsyou will hear her playit is like composing the music for herself she does not seem to remember the pieces she seems to improvise them you understand  lanfear said that he understood for he could not disappoint the expectation of the fathers boastful love all that was left him of the ambitions he must once have had for his child  the poor little stout unpicturesque elderly man got up and began to walk to and fro in the room which he had turned into with lanfear and to say more to himself than to lanfear as if balancing one thing against another the merciful thing is that she has been saved from the horror and the sorrow she knows no more of either than she knows of her mothers love for her they were very much alike in looks and mind and they were always together more like persons of the same agesisters or girl friends but she has lost all knowledge of that as of other things and then there is the question whether she wont some time sooner or later come into both the horror and the sorrow he stopped and looked at lanfear she has these sudden fits of drowsiness when she must sleep and i never see her wake from them without being afraid that she has wakened to everythingthat she has got back into her full self and taken up the terrible burden that my old shoulders are used to what do you think  lanfear felt the appeal so keenly that in the effort to answer faithfully he was aware of being harsher than he meant that is a chance we cant forecast but it is a chance the fact that the drowsiness recurs periodically  it doesnt the father pleaded we dont know when it will come on  it scarcely matters the periodicity wouldnt affect the possible result which you dread i dont say that it is probable but its one of the possibilities it has lanfear added its logic  ah its logic  its logic yes my business of course would be to restore her to health at any risk so far as her mind is affected  her mind is not affected the father retorted  i beg your pardonher memoryit might be restored with her physical health you understand that it is a chance it might or it might not happen  the father was apparently facing a risk which he had not squarely faced before i suppose so he faltered after a moment he added with more courage you must do the best you can at any risk  lanfear rose too he said with returning kindness in his tones if not his words i should like to study the case mr gerald its very interesting andandif youll forgive mevery touching  thank you  if you decide to stay in san remo i willdo you suppose i could get a room in this hotel i dont like mine  why i havent any doubt you can shall we ask   iii  it was from the hotel sardegna that lanfear satisfied his conscience by pushing his search for climate on behalf of his friends neurasthenic wife he decided that ospedaletti with a milder air and more sheltered seat in its valley of palms would be better for her than san remo he wrote his friend to that effect and then there was no preoccupation to hinder him in his devotion to the case of miss gerald he put the case first in the order of interest rather purposely and even with a sense of effort though he could not deny to himself that a like case related to a different personality might have been less absorbing but he tried to keep his scientific duty to it pure of that certain painful pleasure which as a young man not much over thirty he must feel in the strange affliction of a young and beautiful girl  though there was no present question of medicine he could be installed near her as the friend that her father insisted upon making him without contravention of the social formalities his care of her hardly differed from that of her father except that it involved a closer and more premeditated study they did not try to keep her from the sort of association which in a large hotel of the type of the sardegna entails no sort of obligation to intimacy they sat together at the long table midway of the diningroom which maintained the tradition of the old tabledhôte against the small tables ranged along the walls gerald had an amiable old mans liking for talk and lanfear saw that he willingly escaped among their changing companions from the pressure of his anxieties he left his daughter very much to lanfear during these excursions but lanfear was far from meaning to keep her to himself he thought it better that she should follow her father in his forays among their neighbors and he encouraged her to continue such talk with them as she might be brought into he tried to guard her future encounters with them so that she should not show more than a young girls usual diffidence at a second meeting and in the frequent substitution of one presence for another across the table she was fairly safe  a natural lightheartedness of which he had glimpses from the first returned to her one night at the dance given by some of the guests to some others she went through the gayety in joyous triumph she danced mostly with lanfear but she had other partners and she won a pleasing popularity by the american quality of her waltzing lanfear had already noted that her forgetfulness was not always so constant or so inclusive as her father had taught him to expect mr geralds statement had been the large general fact from which there was sometimes a shrinking in the particulars while the warmth of an agreeable experience lasted her mind kept record of it slight or full if the experience were unpleasant the memory was more apt to fade at once after that dance she repeated to her father the little compliments paid her and told him laughing they were to reward him for sitting up so late as her chaperon emotions persisted in her consciousness as the tremor lasts in a smitten cord but events left little trace she retained a sense of personalities she was lastingly sensible of temperaments but names were nothing to her she could not tell her father who had said the nice things to her and their joint study of her dancingcard did not help them out  her relation to lanfear though it might be a subject of international scrutiny was hardly a subject of censure he was known as dr lanfear but he was not at first known as her physician he was conjectured her cousin or something like that he might even be her betrothed in the peculiar american arrangement of such affairs personally people saw in him a seriouslooking young man better dressed and better mannered than they thought most americans and unquestionably handsomer with his spanish skin and eyes and his brown beard of the vandyke cut which was then already beginning to be rather belated  other americans in the hotel were few and transitory and if the english had any mind about miss gerald different from their mind about other girls it would be perhaps to the effect that she was quite mad by this they would mean that she was a little odd but for the rest they had apparently no mind about her with the help of one of the english ladies her father had replaced the homesick irish maid whom he had sent back to new york from genoa with an italian and in the shelter of her gay affection and ignorant sympathy miss gerald had a security supplemented by the easy social environment if she did not look very well she did not differ from most other american women in that and if she seemed to confide herself more severely to the safekeeping of her physician that was the way of all women patients  whether the bells found the spectacle of depravity at monte carlo more attractive than the smiling face of nature at san remo or not they did not return but sent for their baggage from their hotel and were not seen again by the geralds lanfears friend with the invalid wife wrote from ospedaletti with apologies which inculpated him for the disappointment that she had found the air impossible in a single day and they were off for cannes lanfear and the geralds therefore continued together in the hotel without fear or obligation to others and in an immunity in which their right to breakfast exclusively in that pavilion on the garden wall was almost explicitly conceded no one after a few mornings of tacit possession would have disputed their claim and there day after day in the mild monotony of the december sunshine they sat and drank their coffee and talked of the sights which the peasants in the street and the tourists in the promenade beyond it afforded the rows of stumpy palms which separated the road from the walk were not so high but that they had the whole lift of the sea to the horizon where it lost itself in a sky that curved blue as turquoise to the zenith overhead the sun rose from its morning bath on the left and sank to its evening bath on the right and in making its climb of the spacious arc between shed a heat as great as that of summer but not the heat of summer on the pretty world of villas and hotels towered over by the olivegray slopes of the pineclad heights behind and above them from these tops a fine keen cold fell with the waning afternoon which sharpened through the sunset till the dusk but in the morning the change was from the chill to the glow and they could sit in their pavilion under the willowy droop of the eucalyptustrees which have brought the southern pacific to the riviera with increasing comfort  in the restlessness of an elderly man gerald sometimes left the young people to their intolerable delays over their coffee and walked off into the little stone and stucco city below or went and sat with his cigar on one of the benches under the palmlined promenade which the pale northern consumptives shared with the swarthy peasant girls resting from their burdens and the wrinkled grandmothers of their race passively or actively begging from the strangers  while she kept her father in sight it seemed that miss gerald could maintain her hold of his identity and one morning she said with the tender fondness for him which touched lanfear when he sits there among those sick people and poor people then he knows they are in the world  she turned with a question graver in her look than usual and he said yes we might help them oftener if we could remember that their misery was going on all the time like some great natural process day or dark heat or cold which seems to stop when we stop thinking of it nothing for us at least exists unless it is recalled to us  yes she said in her turn i have noticed that but dont you sometimessometimesshe knit her forehead as if to keep her thought from escapinghave a feeling as if what you were doing or saying or seeing had all happened before just as it is now  oh yes that occurs to every one  but dont youdont you have hints of things of ideas as if you had known them in some previous existence  she stopped and lanfear recognized with a kind of impatience the experience which young people make much of when they have it and sometimes pretend to when they have merely heard of it but there could be no pose or pretence in her he smilingly suggested      for something is or something seems       like glimpses of forgotten dreams  these weird impressions are no more than that probably  ah i dont believe it the girl said they are too real for that they come too often and they make me feel as if they would come more fully some time if there was a life before thisdo you believe there wasthey may be things that happened there or they may be things that will happen in a life after this you believe in that dont you  in a life after this or their happening in it  well both  lanfear evaded her partly they could be premonitions prophecies of a future life as easily as fragmentary records of a past life i suppose we do not begin to be immortal merely after death  no she lingered out the word in dreamy absence as if what they had been saying had already passed from her thought  but miss gerald lanfear ventured have these impressions of yours grown more definitefuller as you sayof late  my impressions she frowned at him as if the look of interest more intense than usual in his eyes annoyed her i dont know what you mean  lanfear felt bound to follow up her lead whether she wished it or not a good third of our lives here is passed in sleep im not always sure that we are right in treating the mentalfor certainly they are mentalexperiences of that time as altogether trivial or insignificant  she seemed to understand now and she protested but i dont mean dreams i mean things that really happened or that really will happen  like something you can give me an instance of are they painful things or pleasant mostly  she hesitated they are things that you know happen to other people but you cant believe would ever happen to you  do they come when you are just drowsing or just waking from a drowse  they are not dreams she said almost with vexation  yes yes i understand he hesitated to retrieve himself but i have had floating illusions just before i fell asleep or when i was sensible of not being quite awake which seemed to differ from dreams they were not so dramatic but they were more pictorial they were more visual than the things in dreams  yes she assented they are something like that but i should not call them illusions  no and they represent scenes events  you said yourself they were not dramatic  i meant represent pictorially  no they are like the landscape that flies back from your train or towards it i cant explain it she ended rising with what he felt a displeasure in his pursuit   iv  he reported what had passed to her father when mr gerald came back from his stroll into the town with his hands full of english papers gerald had even found a new york paper at the newsstand and he listened with an apparent postponement of interest  i think lanfear said that she has some shadowy recollection or rather that the facts come to her in a jarred confused waythe elements of pictures not pictures but i am afraid that my inquiry has offended her  i guess not gerald said dryly as if annoyed what makes you think so  merely her manner and i dont know that anything is to be gained by such an inquiry  perhaps not gerald allowed with an inattention which vexed lanfear in his turn  the elderly man looked up from where he sat provisionally in the hotel veranda into lanfears face lanfear had remained standing i dont believe shes offended or she wont be long one thing shell forget it  he was right enough apparently miss gerald came out of the hotel door towards them smiling equally for both with the indefinable difference between cognition and recognition habitual in her look she was dressed for a walk and she seemed to expect them to go with her she beamed gently upon lanfear there was no trace of umbrage in her sunny gayety her face had as always its lurking pathos but in its appeal to lanfear now there were only trust and the wish of pleasing him  they started side by side for their walk while her father drove beside them in one of the little public carriages mounting to the berigo road through a street of the older san remo and issuing on a bare little piazza looking towards the walls and roofs of the mediaeval city clustered together like cliffdwellings and down on the gardens that fell from the villas and the hotels a parapet kept the path on the roadside nearest the declivities and from point to point benches were put for the convenient enjoyment of the prospect mr gerald preferred to take his pleasure from the greater elevation of the seat in his victoria his daughter and lanfear leaned on the wall and looked up to the sky and out to the sea both of the same blue  the palms and eucalyptustrees darkened about the villas the bits of vineyard in their lingering crimson or lingering gold and the orchards of peaches and persimmons enriched with the varying reds of their ripening leaves and fruits the enchanting color scheme the rose and geranium hedges were in bloom the feathery green of the peppertrees was warmed by the redpurple of their grapelike clusters of blossoms the perfume of lemon flowers wandered vaguely upwards from some point which they could not fix  nothing of all the beauty seemed lost upon the girl so bereft that she could enjoy no part of it from association lanfear observed that she was not fatigued by any such effort as he was always helplessly making to match what he saw with something he had seen before now when this effort betrayed itself she said smiling how strange it is that you see things for what they are like and not for what they are  yes its a defect im afraid sometimes perhaps  perhaps what she prompted him in the pause he made  nothing i was wondering whether in some other possible life our consciousness would not be more independent of what we have been than it seems to be here she looked askingly at him i mean whether there shall not be something absolute in our existence whether it shall not realize itself more in each experience of the moment and not be always seeking to verify itself from the past  isnt that what you think is the way with me already she turned upon him smiling and he perceived that in her new york version of a parisian costume with her lace hat of summer make and texture and the vivid parasol she twirled upon her shoulder she was not only a very pretty girl but a fashionable one there was something touching in the fact and a little bewildering to the pretty girl the fashionable girl he could have answered with a joke but the stricken intelligence had a claim to his seriousness now especially he noted what had from time to time urged itself upon his perception if the broken ties which once bound her to the past were beginning to knit again her recovery otherwise was not apparent as she stood there her beauty had signally the distinction of fragility the delicacy of shattered nerves in which there was yet no visible return to strength a feeling which had intimated itself before a sense as of being in the presence of a disembodied spirit possessed him and brought in its contradiction of an accepted theory a suggestion that was destined to become conviction he had always said to himself that there could be no persistence of personality of character of identity of consciousness except through memory yet here to the last implication of temperament they all persisted the soul that was passing in its integrity through time without the helps the crutches of remembrance by which his own personality supported itself why should not it pass so through eternity without that loss of identity which was equivalent to annihilation  her waiting eyes recalled him from his inquiry and with an effort he answered yes i think you do have your being here and now miss gerald to an unusual degree  and you dont think that is wrong  wrong why how  oh i dont know she looked round and her eye fell upon her father waiting for them in his carriage beside the walk the sight supplied her with the notion which lanfear perceived would not have occurred otherwise then why doesnt papa want me to remember things  i dont know lanfear temporized doesnt he  i cant always tell shouldshould you wish me to remember more than i do  i  she looked at him with entreaty do you think it would make my father happier if i did  that i cant say lanfear answered people are often the sadder for what they remember if i were your fatherexcuse me i dont mean anything so absurd but in his place  he stopped and she said as if she were satisfied with his broken reply it is very curious when i look at himwhen i am with himi know him but when he is away i dont remember him she seemed rather interested in the fact than distressed by it she even smiled  and me he ventured is it the same with regard to me  she did not say she asked smiling do you remember me when i am away  yes he answered as perfectly as if you were with me i can see you hear you feel the touch of your hand your dressgood heavens he added to himself under his breath what am i saying to this poor child  in the instinct of escaping from himself he started forward and she moved with him mr geralds watchful driver followed them with the carriage  that is very strange she said lightly is it so with you about everyone  no he replied briefly almost harshly he asked abruptly miss gerald are there any times when you know people in their absence  just after i wake from a napyes but it doesnt last that is it seems to me it doesnt im not sure  as they followed the winding of the pleasant way with the villas on the slopes above and on the slopes below she began to talk of them and to come into that knowledge of each which formed her remembrance of them from former knowledge of them but which he knew would fade when she passed them  the next morning when she came down unwontedly late to breakfast in their pavilion she called gayly  dr lanfear it is dr lanfear  i should be sorry if it were not since you seem to expect it miss gerald  oh i just wanted to be sure hasnt my father been here yet it was the first time she had shown herself aware of her father except in his presence as it was the first time she had named lanfear to his face  he suppressed a remote stir of anxiety and answered he went to get his newspapers he wished you not to wait i hope you slept well  splendidly but i was very tired last night i dont know why exactly  we had rather a long walk  did we have a walk yesterday  yes  then it was so i thought i had dreamed it i was beginning to remember something and my father asked me what it was and then i couldnt remember do you believe i shall keep on remembering  i dont see why you shouldnt  should you wish me to she asked in evident however unconscious recurrence to their talk of the day before  why not  she sighed i dont know if its like some of those dreams or gleams is remembering pleasant  lanfear thought for a moment then he said in the honesty he thought best to use with her for the most part i should say it was painful life is tolerable enough while it passes but when it is past what remains seems mostly to hurt and humiliate i dont know why we should remember so insistently the foolish things and wrong things we do and not recall the times when we acted without an effort wisely and rightly he thought he had gone too far and he hedged a little i dont mean that we cant recall those times we can and do to console and encourage ourselves but they dont recur without our willing as the others do  she had poured herself a cup of coffee and she played with the spoon in her saucer while she seemed to listen but she could not have been listening for when she put down her spoon and leaned back in her chair she said in those dreams the things come from such a very far way back and they dont belong to a life that is like this they belong to a life like what you hear the life after this is we are the same as we are here but the things are different we havent the same rules the same wishesi cant explain  you mean that we are differently conditioned  yes and if you can understand i feel as if i remembered long back of this and long forward of this but one cant remember forward  that wouldnt be remembrance no it would be prescience and your consciousness here as you were saying yesterday is through knowing not remembering  she stared at him was that yesterday i thought it wastomorrow she rubbed her hand across her forehead as people do when they wish to clear their minds then she sighed deeply it tires me so and yet i cant help trying a light broke over her face at the sound of a step on the gravel walk near by and she said laughing without looking round that is papa i knew it was his step   v  such return of memory as she now had was like memory in what we call the lower lives it increased fluctuantly with an ebb in which it almost disappeared but with a flow that in its advance carried it beyond its last floodtide mark after the first triumph in which she could address lanfear by his name and could greet her father as her father there were lapses in which she knew them as before without naming them except mechanically to repeat the names of other people when reminded of them she did not pass beyond cognition to recognition events still left no trace upon her or if they did she was not sure whether they were things she had dreamed or experienced but her memory grew stronger in the region where the bird knows its way home to the nest or the bee to the hive she had an unerring instinct for places where she had once been and she found her way to them again without the help from the association which sometimes failed lanfear their walks were always taken with her fathers company in his carriage but they sometimes left him at a point of the berigo road and after a long détour among the vineyards and olive orchards of the heights above rejoined him at another point they had agreed upon with him one afternoon when lanfear had climbed the rough pave of the footways with her to one of the summits they stopped to rest on the wall of a terrace where they sat watching the changing light on the sea through a break in the trees the shadows surprised them on their height and they had to make their way among them over the farm paths and by the dry beds of the torrents to the carriage road far below they had been that walk only once before and lanfear failed of his reckoning except the downward course which must bring them out on the highroad at last but miss geralds instinct saved them where his reason failed she did not remember but she knew the way and she led him on as if she were inventing it or as if it had been indelibly traced upon her mind and she had only to follow the mystical lines within to be sure of her course she confessed to being very tired and each step must have increased her fatigue but each step seemed to clear her perception of the next to be taken  suddenly when lanfear was blaming himself for bringing all this upon her and then for trusting to her guidance he recognized a certain peasants house and in a few moments they had descended the oliveorchard terraces to a broken cistern in the clear twilight beyond the dusk she suddenly halted him there there it happened thennowthis instant  what  that feeling of being here before there is the curb of the old cistern and the place where the terrace wall is broken and the path up to the vineyarddont you feel it too she demanded with a joyousness which had no pleasure for him  yes certainly we were here last week we went up the path to the farmhouse to get some water  yes now i am rememberingremembering she stood with eagerly parted lips and glancing quickly round with glowing eyes whose light faded in the same instant no she said mournfully its gone  a sound of wheels in the road ceased and her fathers voice called dont you want to take my place and let me walk awhile nannie  no you come to me papa something very strange has happened something you will be surprised at hurry she seemed to be joking as he was while she beckoned him impatiently towards her  he had left his carriage and he came up with a heavy mans quickened pace well what is the wonderful thing he panted out  she stared blankly at him without replying and they silently made their way to mr geralds carriage  i lost the way and miss gerald found it lanfear explained as he helped her to the place beside her father  she said nothing and almost with sinking into the seat she sank into that deep slumber which from time to time overtook her  i didnt know we had gone so faror rather that we had waited so long before we started down the hills lanfear apologized in an involuntary whisper  oh its all right her father said trying to adjust the girls fallen head to his shoulder get in and help me  lanfear obeyed and lent a physicians skilled aid which left the cumbrous efforts of her father to the blame he freely bestowed on them youll have to come here on the other side he said theres room enough for all three or hold on let me take your place he took the place in front and left her to lanfears care with the trust which was the physicians right and with a sense of the girls dependence in which she was still a child to him  they did not speak till well on the way home then the father leaned forward and whispered huskily do you think shes as strong as she was  lanfear waited as if thinking the facts over he murmured back no shes better shes not so strong  yes the father murmured i understand  what gerald understood by lanfears words might not have been their meaning but what lanfear meant was that there was now an interfusion of the past and present in her daily experience she still did not remember but she had moments in which she hovered upon such knowledge of what had happened as she had of actual events when she was stronger she seemed farther from this knowledge when she was weaker she was nearer it so it seemed to him in that region where he could be sure of his own duty when he looked upon it singly as concern for her health no inquiry for the psychological possibilities must be suffered to divide his effort for her physical recovery though there might come with this a cessation of the timeless dreamstate in which she had her being and she might sharply realize the past as the anaesthete realizes his return to agony from insensibility the quality of her mind was as different from the thing called culture as her manner from convention a simplicity beyond the simplicity of childhood was one with a poetic color in her absolute ideas but this must cease with her restoration to the strength in which she could alone come into full and clear selfconsciousness so far as lanfear could give reality to his occupation with her disability he was ministering to a mind diseased not to rase out its written trouble but if possible to restore the obliterated record and enable her to spell its tragic characters if he could he would have shrunk from this office but all the more because he specially had to do with the mystical side of medicine he always tried to keep his relation to her free from personal feeling and his aim single and matteroffact  it was hard to do this and there was a glamour in the very topographical and meteorological environment the autumn was a long delight in which the constant sea the constant sky knew almost as little variance as the unchanging alps the days passed in a procession of sunny splendor neither hot nor cold nor of the temper of any determinate season unless it were an abiding springtime the flowers bloomed and the grass kept green in a reverie of may but one afternoon of january while lanfear was going about in a thin coat and panama hat a soft fresh wind began to blow from the east it increased till sunset and then fell in the morning he looked out on a world in which the spring had stiffened overnight into winter a thick frost painted the leaves and flowers icicles hung from pipes and vents the frozen streams flashed back from their arrested flow the sun as it shone from the cold heaven and blighted and blackened the hedges of geranium and rose the borders of heliotrope the fields of pinks the leaves of the bananas hung limp about their stems the palms rattled like skeletons in the wind when it began to blow again over the shrunken landscape   vi  the caprice of a climate which vaunted itself perpetual summer was a godsend to all the strangers strong enough to bear it without suffering for the sick an indoor life of huddling about the ineffectual fires of the south began and lasted for the fortnight that elapsed before the riviera got back its advertised temperature miss gerald had drooped in the milder weather but the cold braced and lifted her and with its help she now pushed her walks farther and was eager every day for some excursion to the little towns that whitened along the shores or the villages that glimmered from the oliveorchards of the hills once she said to lanfear when they were climbing through the brisk clear air it seems to me as if i had been here before have i  no this is the first time  she said no more but seemed disappointed in his answer and he suggested perhaps it is the cold that reminds you of our winters at home and makes you feel that the scene is familiar  yes that is it she returned joyously was there snow there like that on the mountains yonder  a good deal more i fancy that will be gone in a few days and at home you know our snow lasts for weeks  then that is what i was thinking of she said and she ran strongly and lightly forward come  when the harsh weather passed and the mild climate returned there was no lapse of her strength a bloom palely pink as the flowers that began to flush the almondtrees came upon her delicate beauty a light like that of the lengthening days dawned in her eyes she had an instinct for the earliest violets among the grass under the olives she was first to hear the blackcaps singing in the gardentops and nothing that was novel in her experience seemed alien to it this was the sum of what lanfear got by the questioning which he needlessly tried to keep indirect she knew that she was his patient and in what manner and she had let him divine that her loss of memory was suffering as well as deprivation she had not merely the fatigue which we all undergo from the effort to recall things and which sometimes reaches exhaustion but there was apparently in the void of her oblivion a perpetual rumor of events names sensations likelanfear felt that he inadequately conjecturedthe subjective noises which are always in the ears of the deaf sometimes in the distress of it she turned to him for help and when he was able to guess what she was striving for a radiant relief and gratitude transfigured her face but this could not last and he learned to note how soon the stress and tension of her effort returned his compassion for her at such times involved a temptation or rather a question which he had to silence by a direct effort of his will would it be worse would it be greater anguish for her to know at once the past that now tormented her consciousness with its broken and meaningless reverberations then he realized that it was impossible to help her even through the hazard of telling her what had befallen that no such effect as was to be desired could be anticipated from the outside  if he turned to her father for counsel or instruction or even a participation in his responsibility he was met by an optimistic patience which exasperated him if it did not complicate the case once when lanfear forbearingly tried to share with him his anxiety for the effect of a successful event he was formed to be outright and remind him in so many words that the girls restoration might be through anguish which he could not measure  gerald faltered aghast then he said it mustnt come to that you mustnt let it  how do you expect me to prevent it lanfear demanded in his vexation  gerald caught his breath if she gets well she will remember  i dont say that it seems probable do you wish her being to remain bereft of onehalf its powers  oh how do i know what i want the poor man groaned i only know that i trust you entirely doctor lanfear whatever you think best will be best and wisest no matter what the outcome is  he got away from lanfear with these hopeless words and again lanfear perceived that the case was left wholly to him his consolation was the charm of the girls companionship the delight of a nature knowing itself from moment to moment as if newly created for her as nearly as he could put the fact into words the actual moment contained the past and the future as well as the present when he saw in her the persistence of an exquisite personality independent of the means by which he realized his own continuous identity he sometimes felt as if in the presence of some angel so long freed from earthly allegiance that it had left all record behind as we leave here the records of our first years if an echo of the past reached her it was apt to be trivial and insignificant like those unimportant experiences of our remotest childhood which remain to us from a world outlived  it was not an insipid perfection of character which reported itself in these celestial terms and lanfear conjectured that angelic immortality if such a thing were could not imply perfection except at the cost of onehalf of human character when the girl wore a dress that she saw pleased him more than another there was a responsive pleasure in her eyes which he could have called vanity if he would and she had at times a wilfulness which he could have accused of being obstinacy she showed a certain jealousy of any experiences of his apart from her own not because they included others but because they excluded her he was aware of an involuntary vigilance in her which could not leave his motives any more than his actions unsearched but in her conditioning she could not repent she could only offer him at some other time the unconscious reparation of her obedience the selfcriticism which the child has not learned she had forgotten but in her oblivion the wish to please existed as perfectly as in the ignorance of childhood  this so far as he could ever put into words was the interior of the world where he dwelt apart with her its exterior continued very like that of other worlds where two young people have their being now and then a more transitory guest at the grand hotel sardegna perhaps fancied it the iridescent orb which takes the color of the morning sky and is destined in the course of nature to the danger of collapse in which planetary space abounds some rumor of this could not fail to reach lanfear but he ignored it as best he could in always speaking gravely of miss gerald as his patient and authoritatively treating her as such he convinced some of these witnesses against their senses for the others he felt that it mattered little what they thought since if it reached her it could not pierce her isolation for more than the instant in which the impression from absent things remained to her  a more positive embarrassment of a kind lanfear was not prepared for beset him in an incident which would have been more touching if he had been less singly concerned for the girl a pretty english boy with the dawn of a peachy bloom on his young cheeks and an impulsiveness commoner with english youth than our own talked with miss gerald one evening and the next day sent her an armful of flowers with his card he followed this attention with a call at her fathers apartment and after miss gerald seemed to know him and they had as he told lanfear a delightful time together she took up his card from the table where it was lying and asked him if he could tell her who that gentleman was the poor fellows inference was that she was making fun of him and he came to lanfear as an obvious friend of the family for an explanation he reported the incident with indignant tears standing in his eyes what did she mean by it if she took my flowers she must have known thatthattheyand to pretend to forget my name oh i say its too bad she could have got rid of me without that girls have ways enough you know  yes yes lanfear assented slowly to gain time i can assure you that miss gerald didnt mean anything that could wound you she isnt very wellshes rather odd  do you mean that shes out of her mind she can talk as well as any onebetter  no not that but shes often in paingreatly in pain when she cant recall a name and ive no doubt she was trying to recall yours with the help of your card she would be the last in the world to be indifferent to your feelings i imagine she scarcely knew what she was doing at the moment  then do you thinkdo you supposeit would be any good my trying to see her again if she wouldnt be indifferent to my feelings do you think there would be any hopereally you know i would give anything to believe that my feelings wouldnt offend her you understand me  perhaps i do  ive never met a more charming girl andshe isnt engaged is she she isnt engaged to you i dont mean to press the question but its a question of life and death with me you know  lanfear thought he saw his way out of the coil i can tell you quite as frankly as you ask that miss gerald isnt engaged to me  then its somebody elsesomebody in america well i hope shell be happy i never shall he offered his hand to lanfear im off  oh heres the doctor now a voice said behind them where they stood by the garden wall and they turned to confront gerald with his daughter  why are you going she said to the englishman and she put out her hand to him  yes mr evers is going lanfear came to the rescue  oh im sorry the girl said and the youth responded  thats very good of you igoodby i hope youll be very happyi he turned abruptly away and ran into the hotel  what has he been crying for miss gerald asked turning from a long look after him  lanfear did not know quite what to say but he hazarded saying he was hurt that you had forgotten him when he came to see you this afternoon  did he come to see me she asked and lanfear exchanged looks of anxiety pain and reassurance with her father i am so sorry shall i go after him and tell him  no i explained hes all right lanfear said  you want to be careful nannie her father added about peoples feelings when you meet them and afterwards seem not to know them  but i do know them papa she remonstrated  you want to be careful her father repeated  i willi will indeed her lips quivered and the tears came which lanfear had to keep from flowing by what quick turn he could give to something else  an obscure sense of the painful incident must have lingered with her after its memory had perished one afternoon when lanfear and her father went with her to the military concert in the sycamoreplanted piazza near the vacherie suisse where they often came for a cup of tea she startled them by bowing gayly to a young lieutenant of engineers standing there with some other officers and making the most of the prospect of pretty foreigners which the place afforded the lieutenant returned the bow with interest and his eyes did not leave their party as long as they remained within the bounds of deference for her it was evident that his comrades were joking about the honor done him by this charming girl when the geralds started homeward lanfear was aware of a trio of officers following them not conspicuously but unmistakably and after that he could not start on his walks with miss gerald and her father without the sense that the young lieutenant was hovering somewhere in their path waiting in the hopes of another bow from her the officer was apparently not discouraged by his failure to win recognition from her and what was amounting to annoyance for lanfear reached the point where he felt he must share it with her father he had nearly as much trouble in imparting it to him as he might have had with miss gerald herself he managed but when he required her father to put a stop to it he perceived that gerald was as helpless as she would have been he first wished to verify the fact from its beginning with her but this was not easy  nannie he said why did you bow to that officer the other day  what officer papa when  you know there by the bandstand at the swiss dairy  she stared blankly at him and it was clear that it was all as if it had not been with her he insisted and then she said perhaps i thought i knew him and was afraid i should hurt his feelings if i didnt recognize him but i dont remember it at all the curves of her mouth drooped and her eyes grieved so that her father had not the heart to say more she left them and when he was alone with lanfear he said  you see how it is  yes i saw how it was before but what do you wish to do  do you mean that he will keep it up  decidedly hell keep it up he has every right to from his point of view  oh well then my dear fellow you must stop it somehow youll know how to do it  i said lanfear indignantly but his vexation was not so great that he did not feel a certain pleasure in fulfilling this strangest part of his professional duty when at the beginning of their next excursion he put miss gerald into the victoria with her father and fell back to the point at which he had seen the lieutenant waiting to haunt their farther progress he put himself plumply in front of the officer and demanded in very blunt italian what do you want  the lieutenant stared him over with potential offence in which his delicately pencilled mustache took the shape of a light sneer and demanded in his turn in english much better than lanfears italian what right have you to ask  the right of miss geralds physician she is an invalid in my charge  a change quite indefinable except as the visible transition from coxcomb to gentleman passed over the young lieutenants comely face an invalid he faltered  yes lanfear began and then with a rush of confidence which the change in the officers face justified one very strangely very tragically afflicted since she saw her mother killed in an accident a year ago she remembers nothing she bowed to you because she saw you looking at her and supposed you must be an acquaintance may i assure you that you are altogether mistaken  the lieutenant brought his heels together and bent low i beg her pardon with all my heart i am very very sorry i will do anything i can i would like to stop that may i bring my mother to call on miss gerald  he offered his hand and lanfear wrung it hard a lump of gratitude in his throat choking any particular utterance while a fine shame for his late hostile intention covered him  when the lieutenant came with all possible circumstance bringing the countess his mother mr gerald overwhelmed them with hospitality of every form the italian lady responded effusively and more sincerely cooed and murmured her compassionate interest in his daughter then all parted the best of friends but when it was over miss gerald did not know what it had been about she had not remembered the lieutenant or her fathers vexation or any phase of the incident which was now closed nothing remained of it but the lieutenants right which he gravely exercised of saluting them respectfully whenever he met them   vii  earlier lanfear had never allowed himself to be far out of call from miss geralds father especially during the daytime slumbers into which she fell and from which they both always dreaded her awakening but as the days went on and the event continued the same he allowed himself greater range formerly the three went their walks or drives together but now he sometimes went alone in these absences he found relief from the stress of his constant vigilance he was able to cast off the bond which enslaves the physician to his patient and which he must ignore at times for mere selfpreservations sake but there was always a lurking anxiety which though he refused to let it define itself to him shortened the time and space he tried to put between them  one afternoon in april when he left her sleeping he was aware of somewhat recklessly placing himself out of reach in a lonely excursion to a village demolished by the earthquake of 1887 and abandoned himself in the impressions and incidents of his visit to the ruin to a luxury of impersonal melancholy which the physician cannot often allow himself at last his care found him and drove him home full of a sharper fear than he had yet felt since the first days but mr gerald was tranquilly smoking under a palm in the hotel garden and met him with an easy smile she woke once and said she had had such a pleasant dream now shes off again do you think wed better wake her for dinner i suppose shes getting up her strength in this way her sleeping so much is a good symptom isnt it  lanfear smiled forlornly neither of them in view of the possible eventualities could have said what result they wished the symptoms to favor but he said decidedly i wouldnt wake her and he spent a night of restless sleep penetrated by a nervous expectation which the morning when it came rather mockingly defeated  miss gerald appeared promptly at breakfast in their pavilion with a fresher and gayer look than usual and to her fathers well nannie you have had a nap this time she answered smiling  have i it isnt afternoon is it  no its morning youve napped it all night  she said i cant tell whether ive been asleep or not sometimes but now i know i have been and i feel so rested where are we going today  she turned to lanfear while her father answered i guess the doctor wont want to go very far today after his expedition yesterday afternoon  ah she said i knew you had been somewhere was it very far are you too tired  it was rather far but im not tired i shouldnt advise possana though  possana she repeated what is possana  he told her and then at a jealous look in her eyes he added an account of his excursion he heightened if anything its difficulties in making light of them as no difficulties for him and at the end she said gently shall we go this morning  let the doctor rest this morning nannie her father interrupted whimsically but with what lanfear knew to be an inner yielding to her will or if you wont let him let me i dont want to go anywhere this morning  lanfear thought that he did not wish her to go at all and hoped that by the afternoon she would have forgotten possana she sighed but in her sigh there was no concession then with the chance of a returning drowse to save him from openly thwarting her will he merely suggested theres plenty of time in the afternoon the days are so long now and we can get the sunset from the hills  yes that will be nice she said but he perceived that she did not assent willingly and there was an effect of resolution in the readiness with which she appeared dressed for the expedition after luncheon she clearly did not know where they were going but when she turned to lanfear with her look of entreaty he had not the heart to join her father in any conspiracy against her he beckoned the carriage which had become conscious in its eager driver from the moment she showed herself at the hotel door and they set out  when they had left the higher level of the hotel and began their clatter through the long street of the town lanfear noted that she seemed to feel as much as himself the quaintness of the little city rising on one hand with its narrow alleys under successive arches between the high dark houses to the hills and dropping on the other to sea from the commonplace of the principal thoroughfare with its pink and white and saffron hotels and shops beyond the town their course lay under villa walls covered with vines and topped by pavilions and opening finally along a stretch of the old cornice road  but this she said at a certain point is where we were yesterday  this is where the doctor was yesterday her father said behind his cigar  and wasnt i with you she asked lanfear  he said playfully today you are i mustnt be selfish and have you every day  ah you are laughing at me but i know i was here yesterday  her father set his lips in patience and lanfear did not insist  they had halted at this point because across a wide valley on the shoulder of an approaching height the ruined village of possana showed and lower down and nearer the seat the new town which its people had built when they escaped from the destruction of their worldold home  worldold it all was with reference to the human life of it but the springtime was immortally young in the landscape over the expanses of green and brown fields and hovering about the gray and white cottages was a mist of peach and cherry blossoms above these the hoar olives thickened and the vines climbed from terrace to terrace the valley narrowed inland and ceased in the embrace of the hills drawing mysteriously together in the distances  i think weve got the best part of it here miss gerald lanfear broke the common silence by saying you couldnt see much more of possana after you got there  besides her father ventured a pleasantry which jarred on the younger man if you were there with the doctor yesterday you wont want to make the climb again today give it up nannie  oh no she said i cant give it up  well then we must go on i suppose where do we begin our climb  lanfear explained that he had been obliged to leave his carriage at the foot of the hill and climb to possana nuova by the donkeypaths of the peasants he had then walked to the ruins of possana vecchia but he suggested that they might find donkeys to carry them on from the new town  well i hope so mr gerald grumbled but at possana nuova no saddledonkeys were to be had and he announced at the café where they stopped for the negotiation that he would wait for the young people to go on to possana vecchia and tell him about it when they got back in the meantime he would watch the game of ball which in the piazza before the café appeared to have engaged the energies of the male population lanfear was still inwardly demurring when a stalwart peasant girl came in and announced that she had one donkey which they could have with her own services driving it she had no saddle but there was a pad on which the young lady could ride  oh well take it for nannie mr gerald directed only dont be gone too long  they set out with miss gerald reclining in the kind of litter which the donkey proved to be equipped with lanfear went beside her the peasant girl came behind and at times ran forward to instruct them in the points they seemed to be looking at for the most part the landscape opened beneath them but in the azure distances it climbed into alpine heights which the recent snows had now left to the gloom of their pines on the slopes of the nearer hills little towns clung here and there closer yet farmhouses showed themselves among the vines and olives  it was very simple as the life in it must always have been and lanfear wondered if the elemental charm of the scene made itself felt by his companion as they climbed the angles of the inclines in a silence broken only by the picking of the donkeys hoofs on the rude mosaic of the pavement and the panting of the peasant girl at its heels on the top of the last upward stretch they stopped for the view and miss gerald asked abruptly why were you so sad  when was i sad he asked in turn  i dont know werent you sad  when i was here yesterday you mean she smiled on his fortunate guess and he said oh i dont know it might have begun with thinking      of old unhappy faroff things      and battles long ago  you know the pirates used to come sailing over the peaceful sea yonder from africa to harry these coasts and carry off as many as they could capture into slavery in tunis and algiers it was a long dumb kind of misery that scarcely made an echo in history but it haunted my fancy yesterday and i saw these valleys full of the flight and the pursuit which used to fill them up to the walls of the villages perched on the heights where men could have built only for safety then i got to thinking of other things  and thinking of things in the past always makes you sad she said in pensive reflection if it were not for the wearying of always trying to remember i dont believe i should want my memory back and of course to be like other people she ended with a sigh  it was on his tongue to say that he would not have her so but he checked himself and said lamely enough perhaps you will be like them sometime  she startled him by answering irrelevantly you know my mother is dead she died a long while ago i suppose i must have been very little  she spoke as if the fact scarcely concerned her and lanfear drew a breath of relief in his surprise he asked at another tangent what made you think i was sad yesterday  oh i knew somehow i think that i always know when you are sad i cant tell you how but i feel it  then i must cheer up lanfear said if i could only see you strong and well miss gerald like this girl  they both looked at the peasant and she laughed in sympathy with their smiling and beat the donkey a little for pleasure it did not mind  but you will beyou will be we must hurry on now or your father will be getting anxious  they pushed forward on the road which was now level and wider than it had been as they drew near the town whose ruin began more and more to reveal itself in the roofless walls and windowless casements they saw a man coming towards them at whose approach lanfear instinctively put himself forward the man did not look at them but passed frowning darkly and muttering and gesticulating  miss gerald turned in her litter and followed him with a long gaze the peasant girl said gayly in italian he is mad the earthquake made him mad and urged the donkey forward  lanfear in the interest of science habitually forbade himself the luxury of anything like foreboding but now with the passing of the madman he felt distinctively a lift from his spirit he no longer experienced the vague dread which had followed him towards possana and made him glad of any delay that kept them from it  they entered the crooked narrow street leading abruptly from the open country without any suburban hesitation into the heart of the ruin which kept a vivid image of uninterrupted mediaeval life there till within the actual generation people had dwelt winter and summer as they had dwelt from the beginning of christian times with nothing to intimate a domestic or civic advance this street must have been the main thoroughfare for stonepaved lanes still narrower wound from it here and there while it kept a fairly direct course to the little piazza on a height in the midst of the town two churches and a simple town house partly enclosed it with their seamed and shattered façades the dwellings here were more ruinous than on the thoroughfare and some were tumbled in heaps but lanfear pushed open the door of one of the churches and found himself in an interior which except that it was roofless could not have been greatly changed since the people had flocked into it to pray for safety from the earthquake the high altar stood unshaken around the frieze a succession of stucco cherubs perched under the open sky in celestial security  he had learned to look for the unexpected in miss gerald and he could not have said that it was with surprise he now found her as capable of the emotions which the place inspired as himself he made sure of saying the earthquake you know and she responded with compassion  oh yes and perhaps that poor man was here praying with the rest when it happened how strange it must all have seemed to them here where they lived so safely always they thought such a dreadful thing could happen to others but not to them that is the way  it seemed to lanfear once more that she was on the verge of the knowledge so long kept from her but she went confidently on like a sleepwalker who saves himself from dangers that would be death to him in waking she spoke of the earthquake as if she had been reading or hearing of it but he doubted if with her broken memory this could be so it was rather as if she was exploring his own mind in the way of which he had more than once been sensible and making use of his memory from time to time she spoke of remembering but he knew that this was as the blind speak of seeing  he was anxious to get away and at last they came out to where they had left the peasant girl waiting beside her donkey she was not there and after trying this way and that in the tangle of alleys lanfear decided to take the thoroughfare which they had come up by and trust to the chance of finding her at its foot but he failed even of his search for the street he came out again and again at the point he had started from  what is the matter she asked at the annoyance he could not keep out of his face  he laughed oh merely that were lost but we will wait here till that girl chooses to come back for us only its getting late and mr gerald  why i know the way down she said and started quickly in a direction which as they kept it he recognized as the route by which he had emerged from the town the day before he had once more the sense of his memory being used by her as if being blind she had taken his hand for guidance or as if being herself disabled from writing she had directed a pen in his grasp to form the words she desired to put down in some mystical sort the effect was hers but the means was his  they found the girl waiting with the donkey by the roadside beyond the last house she explained that not being able to follow them into the church with her donkey she had decided to come where they found her and wait for them there  does no one at all live here lanfear asked carelessly  among the owls and the spectres i would not pass a night here for a lemonade my mother she went on with a natural pride in the event was lost in the earthquake they found her with me before her breast and her arms stretched out keeping the stones away she vividly dramatized the fact i was alive but she was dead  tell her miss gerald said that my mother is dead too  ah poor little thing the girl said when the message was delivered and she put her beast in motion chattering gayly to miss gerald in the bond of their common orphanhood  the return was downhill and they went back in half the time it had taken them to come but even with this speed they were late and the twilight was deepening when the last turn of their road brought them in sight of the new village there a wild noise of cries for help burst upon the air mixed with the shrill sound of maniac gibbering they saw a boy running towards the town and nearer them a man struggling with another whom he had caught about the middle and was dragging towards the side of the road where it dropped hundreds of feet into the gorge below  the donkeygirl called out oh the madman he is killing the signor  lanfear shouted the madman flung gerald to the ground and fled shrieking miss gerald had leaped from her seat and followed lanfear as he ran forward to the prostrate form she did not look at it but within a few paces she clutched her hands in her hair and screamed out oh my mother is killed and sank as if sinking down into the earth in a swoon  no no its all right nannie look after her lanfear im not hurt i let myself go in that fellows hands and i fell softly it was a good thing he didnt drop me over the edge gerald gathered himself up nimbly enough and lent lanfear his help with the girl the situation explained itself almost without his incoherent additions to the effect that he had become anxious and had started out with the boy for a guide to meet them and had met the lunatic who suddenly attacked him while he talked lanfear was feeling the girls pulse and now and then putting his ear to her heart with a glance at her father youre bleeding mr gerald he said  so i am the old man answered smiling as he wiped a red stream from his face with his handkerchief but i am not hurt  better let me tie it up lanfear said taking the handkerchief from him he felt the unselfish quality in a man whom he had not always thought heroic and he bound the gash above his forehead with a reverence mingling with his professional gentleness the donkeygirl had not ceased to cry out and bless herself but suddenly as her care was needed in getting miss gerald back to the litter she became a part of the silence in which the procession made its way slowly into possana nuova lanfear going on one side and mr gerald on the other to support his daughter in her place there was a sort of muted outcry of the whole population awaiting them at the door of the locanda where they had halted before and which now had the distinction of offering them shelter in a room especially devoted to the poor young lady who still remained in her swoon  when the landlord could prevail with his fellowtownsmen and townswomen to disperse in her interest and had imposed silence upon his customers indoors lanfear began his vigil beside his patient in as great quiet as he could anywhere have had once during the evening the public physician of the district looked in but he agreed with lanfear that nothing was to be done which he was not doing in his greater experience of the case from time to time gerald had suggested sending for some san remo physician in consultation lanfear had always approved and then gerald had not persisted he was strongly excited and anxious not so much for his daughters recovery from her swoon which he did not doubt as for the effect upon her when she should have come to herself  it was this which he wished to discuss sitting fallen back into his chair or walking up and down the room with his head bound with a bloody handkerchief and looking with a sort of alien picturesqueness like a kindly brigand  lanfear did not leave his place beside the bed where the girl lay white and still as if dead an inexpressible compassion for the poor man filled his heart whatever the event should be it would be tragical for him go to sleep mr gerald he said your waking can do no good i will keep watch and if need be ill call you try to make yourself easy on that couch  i shall not sleep the old man answered how could i nevertheless he adjusted himself to the hard pillows of the lounge where he had been sitting and drowsed among them he woke just before dawn with a start i thought she had come to and knew everything what a nightmare did i groan is there any change  lanfear sitting by the bed in the light of the wasting candle which threw a grotesque shadow of him on the wall shook his head after a moment he asked how long did you tell me her swoon had lasted after the accident to her mother  i dont think she recovered consciousness for two days and then she remembered nothing what do you think are the chances of her remembering now  i dont know but theres a kind of psychopathic logicif she lost her memory through one great shock she might find it through another  yes yes the father said rising and walking to and fro in his anguish that was what i thoughtwhat i was afraid of if i could die myself and save her from living through iti dont know what im saying but ifbut ifif she could somehow be kept from it a little longer but she cant she cant she must know it now when she wakes  lanfear had put up his hand and taken the girls slim wrist quietly between his thumb and finger holding it so while her father talked on  i suppose its been a sort of weaknessa sort of wickednessin me to wish to keep it from her but i have wished that doctor you must have seen it and i cant deny it we ought to bear what is sent us in this world and if we escape we must pay for our escape it has cost her half her being i know it but it hasnt cost her her reason and im afraid for that if she comes into her memory now still you must dobut no one can do anything either to hinder or to help  he was talking in a husky undertone and brokenly incoherently he made an appeal which lanfear seemed not to hear where he remained immovable with his hand on the girls pulse  do you think i am to blame for wishing her never to know it though without it she must remain deprived of one whole side of life do you think my wishing that can have had anything to do with keeping herbut this faint may pass and she may wake from it just as she has been it is logical that she should remember but is it certain that she will  a murmur so very faint as to be almost no sound at all came like a response from the girls lips and she all but imperceptibly stirred her father neither heard nor saw but lanfear started forward he made a sudden clutch at the girls wrist with the hand that had not left it and then remained motionless she will never remember nowhere  he fell on his knees beside the bed and began to sob oh my dearest my poor girl my love still keeping her wrist in his hand and laying his head tenderly on her arm suddenly he started with a shout the pulse and fell forward crushing his ear against her heart and listened with bursts of its beating she isnt dead shes alive then he lifted her in his arms and it was in his embrace that she opened her eyes and while she clung to him entreated  my father where is he  a dread fell upon both the men blighting the joy with which they welcomed her back to life she took her fathers head between her hands and kissed his bruised face i thought you were dead and i thought that mamma she stopped and they waited breathless but that was long ago wasnt it  yes her father eagerly assented very long ago  i remember she sighed i thought that i was killed too was it all a dream her father and lanfear looked at each other which should speak this is doctor lanfear isnt it she asked with a dim smile and im not dreaming now am i he had released her from his arms but she held his hand fast i know it is you and papa and yes i remember everything that terrible pain of forgetting is gone its beautiful but did he hurt you badly papa i saw him and i wanted to call to you but mamma  however the change from the oblivion of the past had been operated it had been mercifully wrought as far as lanfear could note it in the rapture of the new revelation to her which it scarcely needed words to establish the process was a gradual return from actual facts to the things of yesterday and then to the things of the day before and so back to the tragedy in which she had been stricken there was no sudden burst of remembrance but a slow unveiling of the reality in which her spirit was mystically fortified against it at times it seemed to him that the effect was accomplished in her by supernatural agencies such as he remembered once somewhere reading attend the souls of those lately dead and explore their minds till every thought and deed of their earthly lives from the last to the first is revealed to them out of an inner memory which can never any jot or tittle perish it was as if this had remained in her intact from the blow that shattered her outer remembrance when the final longdreaded horror was reached it was already a sorrow of the past suffered and accepted with the resignation which is the close of grief as of every other passion  love had come to her help in the time of her need but not love alone helped her live back to the hour of that supreme experience and beyond it in the absorbing interest of her own renascence the shock more than the injury which her father had undergone was ignored if not neglected lanfear had not indeed neglected it but he could not help ignoring it in his happiness as he remembered afterwards in the selfreproach which he would not let the girl share with him nothing he realized could have availed if everything had been done which he did not do but it remained a pang with him that he had so dimly felt his duty to the gentle old man even while he did it gerald lived to witness his daughters perfect recovery of the self so long lost to her he lived with a joy more explicit than their own to see her the wife of the man to whom she was dearer than love alone could have made her he lived beyond that time rejoicing if it may be so said in the fond memories of her mother which he had been so long forbidden by her affliction to recall then after the spring of the riviera had whitened into summer and san remo hid as well as it could its sunny glare behind its pines and palms gerald suffered one long afternoon through the heat till the breathless evening and went early to bed he had been full of plans for spending the rest of the summer at the little place in new england where his daughter knew that her mother lay in the morning he did not wake  he gave his life that i might have mine she lamented in the first wild grief  no dont say that nannie her husband protested calling her by the pet name which her father always used he is dead but if we owe each other to his loss it is because he was given not because he gave himself  oh i know i know she wailed but he would gladly have given himself for me  that perhaps lanfear could not have denied and he had no wish to do so he had a prescience of happiness for her which the future did not belie and he divined that a woman must not be forbidden the extremes within which she means to rest her soul     ii  the eidolons of brooks alford   i should like to give the story of alfords experiences just as wanhope told it sitting with us before the glowing hearth in the turkish room one night after the other diners at our club had gone away to digest their dinners at the theatre or in their bachelor apartments uptown or on the late trains which they were taking north south and west or had hurried back to their offices to spend the time stolen from rest in overwork for which their famished nerves would duly revenge themselves it was undoubtedly overwork which preceded alfords experiences if it did not cause them for he was pretty well broken from it when he took himself off in the early summer to put the pieces together as best he could by the seaside but this was a fact which wanhope was not obliged to note to us and there were certain other commonplaces of our knowledge of alford which he could omit without omitting anything essential to our understanding of the facts which he dealt with so delicately so electly almost affectionately coaxing each point into the fittest light and then lifting his phrase from it and letting it stand alone in our consciousness i remember particularly how he touched upon the loveaffair which was supposed to have so much to do with alfords breakup and how he dismissed it to its proper place in the story as he talked on with scarcely an interruption either from the eager credulity of rulledge or the doubt of minver i heard with a sensuous comforti can use no other wordthe faroff click of the dishes in the club kitchen putting away till next day with the musical murmur of a smitten glass or the jingle of a dropped spoon but if i should try to render his words i should spoil their impression in the vain attempt and i feel that it is best to give the story as best i can in words of my own so far from responsive to the requisitions of the occult incident  the first intimation alford had of the strange effect which from first to last was rather an obsession than a possession of his was after a morning of idle satisfaction spent in watching the target practice from the fort in the neighborhood of the little fishingvillage where he was spending the summer the target was two or three miles out in the open water beyond the harbor and he found his pleasure in watching the smoke of the gun for that discrete interval before the report reached him and then for that somewhat longer interval before he saw the magnificent splash of the shot which as it plunged into the sea sent a fanshaped fountain thirty or forty feet into the air he did not know and he did not care whether the target was ever hit or not that fact was no part of his concern his affair was to watch the burst of smoke from the fort and then to watch the upward gush of water almost as light and vaporous to the eye where the ball struck he did not miss one of the shots fired during the forenoon and when he met the other people who sat down with him at the midday dinner in the hotel his talk with them was naturally of the mornings practice they one and all declared it a great nuisance and said that it had shattered their nerves terribly which was not perhaps so strange since they were all women but when they asked him in his quality of nervous wreck whether he had not suffered from the prolonged and repeated explosions too he found himself able to say no that he had enjoyed every moment of the firing he added that he did not believe he had even noticed the noise after the first shot he was so wholly taken with the beauty of the fountainburst from the sea which followed and as he spoke the fanlike spray rose and expanded itself before his eyes quite blotting out the visage of a young widow across the table in his swift recognition of the fact and his reflection upon it he realized that the effect was quite as if he had been looking at some intense light almost as if he had been looking at the sun and that the illusion which had blotted out the agreeable reality opposite was of the quality of those flying shapes which repeat themselves here there and everywhere that one looks after lifting the gaze from a dazzling object when his consciousness had duly registered this perception there instantly followed a recognition of the fact that the eidolon now filling his vision was not the effect of the dazzled eyes but of a mental process of thinking how the thing which it reported had looked  by the time alford had coordinated this reflection with the other the eidolon had faded from the ladys face which again presented itself in uninterrupted loveliness with the added attraction of a distinct pout  well mr alford she bantered him  oh i beg your pardon i was thinking  not of what i was saying she broke in laughingly forgivingly  no i certainly wasnt he assented with such a sense of approaching creepiness in his experience that when she challenged him to say what he was thinking of he could not or would not she professed to believe that he would not  in the joking that followed he soon lost the sense of approaching creepiness and began to be proud of what had happened to him as out of the ordinary as a species of psychological ecstasy almost of spiritual value from time to time he tried by thinking of the splash and upward gush from the cannonshots plunge in the sea to recall the vision but it would not come again and at the end of an afternoon somewhat distraughtly spent he decided to put the matter away as one of the odd things of no significance which happen in life and must be dealt with as mysteries none the less trifling because they are inexplicable  well youve got over it the widow joked him as he drew up towards her smiling from her rocker on the veranda after supper at first all the women in the hotel had petted him but with their own cares and ailments to reclaim them they let the invalid fall to the peculiar charge of the childless widow who had nothing else to do and was so well and strong that she could look after the invalid professor of archaeology at the champlain university without the fatigues they must feel  yes ive got over it he said  and what was it she boldly pursued  he was about to say and then he could not  you wont tell  not yet he answered he added after a moment i dont believe i can  because its confidential  no not exactly that because its impossible  oh thats simple enough i understand exactly what you mean well if ever it becomes less difficult remember that i should always like to know it seemed a littlepersonal  how in the world  well when one is stared at in that way  did i stare  dont you always stare but in this case you stared as if there was something wrong with my hair  there wasnt alford protested simpleheartedly then he recollected his sophistication to say unless its being of that particular shade between brown and red was wrong  oh thank you mr alford after that i must believe you  they talked on the veranda till the night fell and then they came in among the lamps in the parlor and she sat down with a certain provisionality putting herself sideways on a light chair by a window and as she chatted and laughed with one cheek towards him she now and then beat the back of her chair with her open hand the other people were reading or severely playing cards and they too kept their tones down to a respectful level while she lingered and when she rose and said goodnight he went out and took some turns on the veranda before going up to bed she was certainly he realized a very pretty woman and very graceful and very amusing and though she probably knew all about it she was the franker and honester for her knowledge  he had arrived at this conclusion just as he turned the switch of the electric light inside his door and in the first flash of the carbon film he saw her sitting beside the window in such a chair as she had taken and in the very pose which she had kept in the parlor her halfaverted face was lit as from laughing and she had her hand lifted as if to beat the back of her chair  good heavens mrs yarrow he said in a sort of whispered shout while he mechanically closed the door behind him as if to keep the fact to himself what in the world are you doing here  then she was not there nothing was there not even a chair beside the window  alford dropped weakly into the only chair in the room which stood next the door by the head of his bed and abandoned himself a helpless prey to the logic of the events  it was at this point which i have been able to give in wanhopes exact words that in the ensuing pause rulledge asked as if he thought some detail might be denied him and what was the logic of the events  minver gave a fleering laugh dont be premature rulledge if you have the logic now you will spoil everything you cant have the moral until youve had the whole story go on wanhope youre so much more interesting than usual that i wont ask how you got hold of all these compromising minutiae  of course wanhope returned theyre not for the general ear i go rather further for the sake of the curious fact than i should be warranted in doing if i did not know my audience so well  we joined in a murmur of gratification and he went on to say that alfords first coherent thought was that he was dreaming one of those unwarranted dreams in which we make our acquaintance privy to all sorts of strange incidents then he knew that he was not dreaming and that his eye had merely externated a mental vision as in the case of the cannonshot splash of which he had seen the phantom as soon as it was mentioned he remembered afterwards asking himself in a sort of terror how far it was going to go with him how far his thought was going to report itself objectively hereafter and what were the reasonable implications of his abnormal experiences he did not know just how long he sat by his bedside trying to think only to have his conclusions whir away like a flock of startled birds when he approached them he went to bed because he was exhausted rather than because he was sleepy but he could not recall a moment of wakefulness after his head touched the pillow  he woke surprisingly refreshed but at the belated breakfast where he found mrs yarrow still lingering he thought her looking not well she confessed listlessly that she had not rested well she was not sure she said whether the sea air agreed with her she might try the mountains a little later she was not inclined to talk and that day he scarcely spoke with her except in commonplaces at the table they had no return to the little mystery they had mocked together the day before  more days passed and alford had no recurrence of his visions his acquaintance with mrs yarrow made no further advance there was no one else in the hotel who interested him and he bored himself at the same time his recovery seemed retarded he lost tone and after a fortnight he ran up to talk himself over with his doctor in boston he rather thought he would mention his eidolons and ask if they were at all related to the condition of his nerves it was a keen disappointment but it ought not to have been a surprise for him to find that his doctor was off on his summer vacation the caretaker who opened the door to alford named a young physician in the same block of marlborough street who had his doctors practice for the summer but alford had not the heart to go to this alternate  he started down to his hotel on a late afternoon train that would bring him to the station after dusk and before he reached it the lamps had been lighted in his car alford sat in a sparsely peopled smoker where he had found a place away from the crowd in the other coaches and looked out of the window into the reflected interior of his car which now and then thinned away and let him see the weeds and gravel of the railroad banks with the bushes that topped them and the woods that backed them the train at one point stopped rather suddenly and then went on for no reason that he ever cared to inquire but as it slowly moved forward again he was reminded of something he had seen one night in going to new york just before the train drew into springfield it had then made such another apparently reasonless stop but before it resumed its course alford saw from his window a group of trainmen and his own pullman conductor with his lantern on his arm bending over the figure of a man defined in his dark clothing against the snow of the bank where he lay propped his face was waxen white and alford noted how particularly black the mustache looked traversing the pallid visage he never knew whether the man was killed or merely stunned you learn nothing with certainty of such things on trains but now as he thought of the incident its eidolon showed itself outside of his mind and followed him in every detail even to a snowy stretch of the embankment until the increasing speed of the train seemed to sweep it back out of sight  alford turned his eyes to the interior of the smoker which except for two or three dozing commuters and a noisy euchreparty had been empty of everything but the fumes and stale odors of tobacco and found it swarming with visions the eidolons of everything he remembered from his past life whatever had once strongly impressed itself upon his nerves was reported there again as instantly as he thought of it it was largely a whirling chaos a kaleidoscopic jumble of facts but from time to time some more memorable and important experience visualized itself alone such was the deathbed of the little sister whom he had been wakened a child to see going to heaven as they told him such was the pathetic foolish face of the girl whom long ago he had made believe he cared for and then had abruptly broken with he saw again with heartache her silly tender amaze when he said he was going away such was the look of mute astonishment of gentle reproach in the eyes of the friend now long dead whom in a moment of insensate fury he had struck on the mouth and who put his hand to his bleeding lips as he bent that gaze of wonder and bewilderment upon him but it was not alone the dreadful impressions that reported themselves there were others as vivid which came back in the original joyousness the face of his mother looking up at him from the crowd on a day of college triumph when he was delivering the valedictory of his class the collective gayety of the whole table on a particularly delightful evening at his diningclub his own image in the glass as he caught sight of it on coming home accepted by the woman who afterwards jilted him the transport which lighted up his fathers visage when he stepped ashore from the vessel which had been rumored lost and he could be verified by the senses as still alive the comical bashful ecstasy of the good fellow his ancient chum in telling him he had had a son born the night before and the mother was doing well and how he laughed and danced and skipped into the air  the smoker was full of these eidolons and of others which came and went with constant vicissitude but what was of a greater weirdness than seeing them within it was seeing them without in that reflection of the interior which travelled with it through the summer night and repeated it now dimly now brilliantly in every detail alford sat in a daze with a smile which he was aware of fixed and stiff as if in plaster on his face and with his gaze bent on this or that eidolon and then on all of them together he was not so much afraid of them as of being noticed by the other passengers in the smoker to whom he knew he might look very queer he said to himself that he was making the whole thing but the very subjectivity was what filled him with a deep and hopeless dread at last the train ceased its long leaping through the dark and with its coming to a stand the whole illusion vanished he heard a gay voice which he knew bidding some one goodbye who was getting into the car just back of the smoker and as he descended to the platform he almost walked into the arms of mrs yarrow  why mr alford we had given you up we thought you wouldnt come back till tomorrowor perhaps ever what in the world will you do for supper the kitchen fires were out ages ago  in the light of the station electrics she beamed upon him and he felt glad at heart as if he had been saved from something a mortal danger or a threatened shame but he could not speak at once his teeth closed with tetanic force upon each other later as they walked to the hotel through the warm soft night in which the south wind was roaming the starless heavens for rain he found his voice and although he felt that he was speaking unnaturally he made out to answer the lively questions with which she pelted him too thickly to expect them to be answered severally she told him all the news of the day and when she began on yesterdays news she checked herself with a laugh and said she had forgotten that he had only been gone since morning but now she said you see how youve been missedhow any man must be missed in a hotel full of women  she took charge of him when they got to the house and said if he would go boldly into the diningroom where they detected as they approached one lamp scantly shining from the else darkened windows she would beard the lioness in her den by which she meant the cook in the kitchen and see what she could get him for supper apparently she could get nothing warm for when a reluctant waitress appeared it was with such a chilly refection on her tray that alford though he was not very hungry returned from interrogating the obscurity for eidolons and shivered at it at the same time the swingdoor of the long dim room opened to admit a gush of the outer radiance on which mrs yarrow drifted in with a chafingdish in one hand and a teabasket in the other she floated tiltingly towards him like he thought a pretty little ship and sent a cheery hail before  ive been trying to get somebody to join you at a premature welshrarebit and a belated cup of tea but i cant tear one of the tabbies from their cards or the kittens from their gambols in the amusementhall in the basement do you mind so very much having it alone because youll have to whether you do or not unless you call me company when im merely cook  she put her utensils on the table beside the forbidding tray the waitress had left and helped lift herself by pressing one hand on the top of a chair towards the electric which she flashed up to keep the dismal lamp in countenance alford let her do it he durst not he felt stir from his place lest any movement should summon back the eidolons and now in the sudden glare of light he shyly slyly searched the room for them not one fair or foul showed itself and slowly he felt a great weight lifting from his heart in its place there sprang up a joyous gratitude towards mrs yarrow who had saved him from them from himself an inexpressible tenderness filled his breast the tears rose to his eyes a soft glow enveloped his whole being a warmth of hope a freshness of life renewed encompassed him he wished to take her in his arms to tell her how he loved her and as she bustled about lighting the lamp of her chafingdish and kindling the little spiritstove she had brought with her to make tea he let his gaze dwell upon every pose every motion of her with a glad hunger in which no smallest detail was lost he now believed that without her he must die without her he could not wish to live  jove rulledge broke in at this point of wanhopes story which i am telling again so badly i think alford was in luck  minver gave a harsh cackle the only thing rulledge finds fault with in this club is the lack of womans nursing and the lack of womans tears nothing is wanting to his enjoyment of his victuals but the fact that they are not served by a neathanded phyllis like alfords  rulledge glanced towards wanhope and innocently inquired was that her first name  minver burst into a scream and rulledge looked red and silly for having given himself away but he made an excursion to the buffet outside and returned with a sandwich with which he supported himself stolidly under minvers derision until wanhope came to his relief by resuming his story or rather his study of alfords strange experience  mrs yarrow first gave alford his tea as being of a prompter brew than the rarebit but she was very quick and apt with that too and pretty soon she leaned forward and in the glow from the lamp under the chafingdish which spiritualized her charming face with its thin radiance puffed the flame out with her pouted lips and drew back with a longsighed there that will make you see your grandmother if anything will  my grandmother alford repeated  yes wouldnt you like to mrs yarrow asked pouring the thick composition over the toast rescued stonecold from the frigid tray on alfords plate im sure i should like to see minedear old gran not that i ever saw hereither of heror should know how she looked did you ever see yourseither of her she pursued impulsively  oh yes alford answered looking intently at her but with so little speculation in the eyes he glared so with that he knew her to be uneasy under them  she laughed a little and stayed her hand on the bail of the teapot which of her  oh both  andanddid she look so much like me she said with an added laugh that he perceived had an hysterical note in it youre letting your rarebit get cold  he laughed himself now a great laugh of relaxation of relief not the least in the world she was not exactly a phantom of delight  oh thank you mr alford now its your teas getting cold  they laughed together and he gave himself to his victual with a relish that she visibly enjoyed when that question of his grandmother had been pushed he thought of an awful experience of his childhood which left on his infant mind an indelible impression a scar to remain from the original wound forever he had been caught in a lie the first he could remember but by no means the last by many immemorable thousands his poor little wickedness had impugned the veracity of both these terrible old ladies who habitually at odds with each other now united for once against him he could always see himself a mean little blubberingfaced rascal stealing guilty looks of imploring at their faces set unmercifully against him one in sorrow and one in anger requiring his mother to whip him and insisting till he was led loudly roaring into the parlor and there made a liar of for all time so far as fear could do it  when mrs yarrow asked if he had ever seen his grandmother he expected instantly to see her in duplicate and as a sole refuge but with little hope that it would save him he kept his eyes fast on hers and to his unspeakable joy it did avail no other face of sorrow or of anger rose between them for the time his thought was quit of its consequence no eidolon outwardly repeated his inward vision a warm gush of gratitude seemed to burst from his heart and to bathe his whole being and then to flow in a tide of ineffable tenderness towards mrs yarrow and involve her and bear them together heavenward it was not passion it was not love he perceived well enough it was the utterance of a vital conviction that she had saved him from an overwhelming subjective horror and that in her sweet objectivity there was a security and peace to be found nowhere else  he greedily ate every atom of his rarebit he absorbed every drop of the moisture in the teapot so that when she shook it and shook it and then tried to pour something from it there was no slightest dribble at the spout but they lingered talking and laughing and perhaps they might never have left the place if the hard handmaiden who had brought the teatray had not first tried putting her head in at the swingdoor from the kitchen and then later come boldly in and taken the tray away  mrs yarrow waited selfrespectfully for her disappearance and then she said im afraid that was a hint mr alford  it seemed like one he owned  they went out together gayly chatting but she would not encourage the movement he made towards the veranda she remained firmly attached to the newelpost of the stairs and at the first chance he gave her she said goodnight and bounded lightly upward at the turn of the stairs she stopped and looked laughing down at him over the rail i hope you wont see your grandmother  oh not a bit of it he called back he felt that he failed to give his reply the quality of epigram but he was not unhappy in his failure  many lighthearted days followed this joyous evening no eidolons haunted alfords horizon perhaps because mrs yarrow filled his whole heaven she was very constantly with him guiding his wavering steps up the hill of recovery which he climbed with more and more activity and keeping him company in those valleys of relapse into which he now and then fell back from the difficult steeps it came to be tacitly or at least passively conceded by the other ladies that she had somehow earned the exclusive right to what had once been the common charge or that if one of their number had a claim to keep mr alford from killing himself by all sorts of imprudences which in his case amounted to impieties it was certainly mrs yarrow they did not put this in terms but they felt it and acted it  she was all the safer guardian for a delicate invalid because she loathed manly sports so entirely that she did not even pretend to like them as most women poor things think themselves obliged to do in her hands there was no danger that he would be tempted to excesses in golf she was really afraid of all boats but she was willing to go out with him in the sailboat of a superannuated skipper because to sit talking in the stern and stoop for the vagaries of the boom in tacking was such good exercise she would join him in fishing from the rotting pier but with no certainty which was a cunner and which was a sculpin when she caught it and with an equal horror of both the nasty wriggling things when they went a walk together her notion of a healthful tramp was to find a nice place among the sweetfern or the pineneedles and sit down in it and talk or make a lap to which he could bring the berries he gathered for her to arrange in the shallow leaftrays she pinned together with twigs she really preferred a rockingchair on the veranda to anything else but if he wished to go to those other excesses she would go with him to keep him out of mischief  there could be only one credible reading of the situation but alford let the summer pass in this pleasant dreaming without waking up till too late to the pleasanter reality it will seem strange enough but it is true that it was no part of his dream to fancy that mrs yarrow was in love with him he knew very well long before the end that he was in love with her but remaining in the dark otherwise he considered only himself in forbearing verbally to make love to her  well rulledge snarled at this point he was a chump  wanhope at the moment opposed nothing directly to the censure but said that something pathetically reproachful in mrs yarrows smiling looks penetrated to alford as she nodded gayly from the car window to him in the little group which had assembled to see her off at the station when she left by no means the first of their happy hotel circle to go  somebody rulledge burst out again ought to have kicked him  whats become minver asked of all the dear maids and widows that youve failed to marry at the end of each summer rulledge  the satire involved flattery so sweet that rulledge could not perhaps wish to make any retort he frowned sternly and said with a face averted from minver go on wanhope  wanhope here permitted himself a philosophical excursion in which i will not accompany him it was apparently to prepare us for the dramatic fact which followed and which i suppose he was trying rather to work away from than work up to it included some facts which he had failed to touch on before and which led to a discussion very interesting in itself but of a range too great for the limits i am trying to keep here it seems that alford had been stayed from declaring his love not only because he doubted of its nature but also because he questioned whether a man in his broken health had any right to offer himself to a woman and because from a yet finer scruple he hesitated in his poverty to ask the hand of a rich woman on the first point we were pretty well agreed but on the second we divided again especially rulledge and minver who held the one that his hesitation did alford honor and quite relieved him from the imputation of being a chump and the other that he was an ass to keep quiet for any such silly reason minver contended that every woman had a right whether rich or poor to the man who loved her and moreover there were now so many rich women that if they were not allowed to marry poor men their chances of marriage were indefinitely reduced what better could a widow do with the money she had inherited from a husband she probably did not love than give it to a man like alfordor to an ass like alford minver corrected himself  his reductio ad absurdum allowed wanhope to resume with a laugh and say that alford waited at the station in the singleness to which the tactful dispersion of the others had left him and watched the train rapidly dwindle in the perspective till an abrupt turn of the road carried it out of sight then he lifted his eyes with a long sigh and looked round everywhere he saw mrs yarrows smiling face with that inner pathos it swarmed upon him from all points and wherever he turned it repeated itself in the distances like that succession of faces you see when you stand between two mirrors  it was not merely a lapse from his lately hopeful state with alford it was a collapse the man withered and dwindled away till he felt that he must audibly rattle in his clothes as he walked by people he did not walk much mostly he remained shrunken in the armchair where he used to sit beside mrs yarrows rocker and the ladies the older and the olderfashioned who were sticking it out at the hotel till it should close on the 15th of september observed him some compassionately some censoriously but all in the same conviction  its plain to be seen what ails mr alford now  well i guess it is  i guess so  i guess it is  seems kind of heartless her going and leaving him so  like a sick kitten  well i should say as much  your eyes bother you mr alford one of them chanted breaking from their discussion of him to appeal directly to him he was rubbing his eyes to relieve himself for the moment from the intolerable affliction of those swarming eidolons which whenever he thought of this thing or that thickened about him they now no longer displaced one another but those which came first remained fadedly beside or behind the fresher appearances like the earlier rainbow which loses depth and color when a later arch defines itself  yes he said glad of the subterfuge they annoy me a good deal of late  you want to get fitted for a good pair of glasses i kept letting it go when i first began to get oldsighted  another lady came to alfords rescue i guess mr alford has no need to get fitted for old sight yet a while you got little spidery thingsspecks and dotsin your eyes  yesmultitudes he said hopelessly  well ill tell you what you want to build up that was the way with me and the oculist said it was from getting all run down i built up and the first thing i knew my sight was as clear as a bell you want to build up  you want to go to the mountains a third interposed thats where mrs yarrows gone and i guess itll do her more good than sticking it out here would ever have done  alford would have been glad enough to go to the mountains but with those illusions hovering closer and closer about him he had no longer the courage the strength he had barely enough of either to get away to boston he found his doctor this time after winning and losing the wager he made himself that he would not have returned to town yet and the goodfortune was almost too much for his shaken nerves the cordial of his friends greetingthey had been chums at harvardcompleted his overthrow as he sank upon the professional sofa where so many other cases had been diagnosticated he broke into tears hello old fellow the doctor said encouragingly and more tenderly than he would have dealt with some women whats up  jim alford found voice to say im afraid im losing my mind  the doctor smiled provisionally well thats one of the signs youre not can you say how  oh yes in a minute alford sobbed and when he had got the better of himself he told his friend the whole story in the direct examination he suppressed mrs yarrows part but when the doctor who had listened with smiling seriousness began to crossexamine him with the question and you dont remember that any outside influence affected the recurrence of the illusions or did anything to prevent it alford answered promptly oh yes there was a woman who did  a woman what sort of a woman  alford told  that is very curious the doctor said i know a man who used to have a distressing dream he broke it up by telling his wife about it every morning after he had dreamt it  unluckily she isnt my wife alford said gloomily  but when she was with you you got rid of the illusions  at first i used to see hers then i stopped seeing any  did you ever tell her of them  no i didnt  never tell anybody  no one but you  and do you see them now  no  do you think because youve told me of them  it seems so  the doctor was silent for a marked space then he asked smiling well why not  why not what  tell your wife  how my wife  by marriage  alford looked dazed do you mean mrs yarrow  if thats her name and shes a widow  and do you think it would be the fair thing for a man on the verge of insanitya physical and mental wreckto ask a woman to marry him  in your case yes in the first place youre not so bad as all that you need nothing but rest for your body and change for your mind i believe youll get rid of your illusions as soon as you form the habit of speaking of them promptly when they begin to trouble you you ought to speak of them to some one you cant always have me around and mrs yarrow would be the next best thing  shes rich and you know what i am ill have to borrow the money to rest on im so poor  not if you marry it  alford rose somewhat more vigorously than he had sat down but that day he did not go beyond ascertaining that mrs yarrow was in town he found out the fact from the maid at her door who said that she was nearly always at home after dinner and without waiting for the evening of another day alford went to call upon her  she said coming down to him in a rather oldfashioned impersonal drawingroom which looked distinctly as if it had been left to her i was so glad to get your card when did you leave woodbeach  mrs yarrow he returned as if that were the answer i think i owe you an explanation  pay it she bantered putting out her hand  im so povertystricken that i dont know whether i can did you ever notice anything odd about me  his directness seemed to have a right to directness from her i noticed that you stared a good dealor used to but people do stare  i stared because i saw things  saw things  i saw whatever i thought of whatever came into my mind was externated in a vision  she smiled he could not make out whether uneasily or not it sounds rather creepy doesnt it but its very interesting  thats what the doctor said ive been to see him this morning may i tell you about my visions theyre not so creepy as they sound i believe and i dont think theyll keep you awake  yes do she said i should like of all things to hear about them perhaps ive been one of them  you have  oh isnt that rather personal  i hope not offensively  he went on to tell her with even greater fulness than he had told the doctor she listened with the interest women take in anything weird and with a compassion for him which she did not conceal so perfectly but that he saw it at the end he said you may wonder that i come to you with all this which must sound like the ravings of a madman  nono she hesitated  i came because i wished you to know everything about me beforebeforei wouldnt have come youll believe me if i hadnt had the doctors assurance that my trouble was merely a part of my being physically out of kilter and had nothing to do with my sanitygood heavens what am i saying but the thought has tormented me so and in the midst of it ive allowed myself tomrs yarrow i love you dont you know that  alford may have had a divided mind in this declaration but after that one word mrs yarrow had no mind for anything else he went on  im not only sickso sick that i shant be able to do any work for a year at leastbut im poor so poor that i cant afford to be sick  she lifted her eyes and looked at him where she sat oddly aloof from those possessions of hers to which she seemed so little related and said with a smile quivering at the corners of her pretty mouth i dont see what that has to do with it  what do you mean he stared at her hard  am i in duplicate or triplicate this time  no youre only one and theres none like you i could never see any one else while i looked at you he cried only half aware of his poetry and meaning what he said very literally  but she took only the poetry i shouldnt wish you to she said and she laughed  he could not believe yet in his goodfortune his countenance fell im afraid i dont understand or that you dont it doesnt seem as if i could get to the end of my unworthiness which isnt voluntary it seems altogether too base i cant let you say what you do if you mean it till you know that i come to you in despair as well as in love you saved me from the fear i was in again and again and i believe that without you i shallah it seems very base but the doctorif i could always tell some oneif i could tell you when these things were obsessing mehaunting methey would cease  mrs yarrow rose with rather a piteous smile then i am a prescription she hoped womanlike that she was solely a passion but is any woman worth having ever solely a passion  dont alford implored rising too dont in mercy take it that way its only that i wish you to know everything thats in me to know how utterly helpless and worthless i am you neednt have a pang in throwing such a thing away  she put out her hand to him but at armslength i shant throw you awayat least not tonight i want to think it was a way of saying she wished him to go and he had no desire to stay he asked if he might come again and she said oh yes  tomorrow  not tomorrow perhaps when i send was it young doctor enderby  they had rather a sad dry parting and when her door closed upon him he felt that it had shut him out forever his shame and his defeat were so great that he did not think of his eidolons and they did not come to trouble him he woke in the morning asking himself bitterly if he were cured already his humiliation was such that he closed his eyes to the light and wished he might never again open them to it  the question that mrs yarrow had to ask dr enderby was not the question he had instantly forecast for her when she put aside her veil in his office and told him who she was she did not seem anxious to be assured of alfords mental condition or as to any risks in marrying him her inquiry was much more psychological it was almost impersonal and yet dr enderby thought she looked as if she had been crying  she had a difficulty in formulating her question and when it came it was almost a speculation  women she said a little hoarsely have no right i suppose to expect the ideal in life the best they can do seems to be to make the real look like it  dr enderby reflected well yes but i dont know that i ever put it to myself in just those terms  then she remarked as if that were the next thing youve known mr alford a long time  we were at school together and we shared the same rooms in harvard  he is very sincere she added as if this were relevant  hes a man who likes to have a little worse than the worst known about him one might say he was excessively sincere enderby divined that alford had been bungling the matter and he was willing to help him out if he could  mrs yarrow fixed dimly beautiful eyes upon him i dont know she said why it wouldnt be idealas much ideal as anythingto give ones self absolutely totoa dutyor not duty exactly i dont mean that especially she added showing a light through the mist if one wanted to do it  then he knew she had made up her mind and though on some accounts he would have liked to laugh with her on other accounts he felt that he owed it to her to be serious  if women could not fulfil the ideal in that wayif they did not constantly do itthere would be no marriages for love  do you think so she asked with a shaking voice but menmen are ideal too  not as women areexcept now and then some fool like alford now indeed he laughed and he began to praise alford from his heart so delicately so tenderly so reverently that mrs yarrow laughed too before he was done and cried a little and when she rose to leave she could not speak but clung to his hand on turning away and so flung it from behind her with a gesture that enderby thought pretty  at this point wanhope stopped as if that were the end  and did she let alford come to see her again rulledge at once romantic and literal demanded  oh yes at any rate they were married that fall they arei believe hes pursuing his archaeological studies thereliving in athens  together minver smoothly inquired  at this expression of cynicism rulledge gave him a look that would have incinerated another wanhope went out with minver and then after a moments daze rulledge exclaimed jove i forgot to ask him whether its stopped alfords illusions     iii  a memory that worked overtime   minvers brother took down from the top of the low bookshelf a small painting on panel which he first studied in the obverse and then turned and contemplated on the back with the same dreamy smile i dont see how that got here he said absently  well minver returned you dont expect me to tell you except on the principle that any one would naturally know more about anything of yours than you would he took it from his brother and looked at the front of it it isnt bad its pretty good he turned it round why its one of old blakeys how did you come by it  stole it probably minvers brother said still thoughtfully then with an effect of recollecting no come to think of it he added blakey gave it to me the minvers played these little comedies together quite as much to satisfy their tenderness for each other as to give their friends pleasure think youre the only painter that gets me to take his truck as a gift he gave it to me lets see about ten years ago when he was trying to make a die of it and failed i thought he would succeed but its been in my wifes room nearly ever since and what i cant understand is what shes doing with it down here  probably to make trouble for you somehow minver suggested  no i dont think its that quite his brother returned with a false air of scrupulosity which was part of their game with each other he looked some more at the picture and then he glanced from it at me theres a very curious story connected with that sketch  oh well tell it minver said tell it i suppose i can stand it again actons never heard it i believe but you neednt make a show of sparing him i couldnt stand that  i certainly havent heard the story i said and if i had i would be too polite to own it  minvers brother looked towards the open door over his shoulder and minver interpreted for him shes not coming ill give you due warning  it was before we were married but not much before and the picture was a sort of wedding present for my wife though blakey made a show of giving it to me said he had painted it for me because he had a prophetic soul and felt in his bones that i was going to want a picture of the place where i first met her you see its the little villa her mother had taken that winter on the viale petrarca just outside of florence it was the first place i met her but not the last  dont be obvious minver ordered  his brother did not mind him i thought it was mighty nice of blakey he was barking away all the time he was talking and when he wasnt coughing he was so hoarse he could hardly speak above a whisper but he kept talking on and wishing me happy and fending off my gratitude while he was finding a piece of manila paper to wrap the sketch in and then hunting for a piece of string to tie it when he handed it to me at last he gasped out i dont mind her knowing that i partly meant it as the place where she first met you too im not ashamed of it as a bit of color anyway i shant live to do anything better  oh yes you will i came back in that lying way we think is kind with dying people i suppose it is anyway it turned out all right with blakey as hell testify if you look him up when you go to florence by the way he lives in that villa now  no i said how charming  minvers brother went on i made up my mind to be awfully careful of that picture and not let it out of my hand till i left it with her mother to be put among the other wedding presents that were accumulating at their house in exeter street so i held it on my lap going in by train from lexington where blakey lived and when i got out at the old lowell depotnorth station nowand got into the little tinkletankle horsecar that took me up to where i was to get the back bay carthose were the prehistoric times before trolleys and there were odds in horsecars we considered the bluepainted back bay cars very swell you remember them he asked minver  not when i can help it minver answered when i broke with boston and went to new york i burnt my horsecars behind me and never wanted to know what they looked like one from another  well as i was saying minvers brother went on without regarding his impatriotism when i got into the horsecar at the depot i rushed for a corner seat and i put the picture with its face next the carend between me and the wall and kept my hand on it and when i changed to the back bay car i did the same thing there was a florists just there and i couldnt resist some mayflowers in the window i was in that condition you know when flowers seemed to be made for her and i had to take her own to her wherever i found them i put the bunch between my knees and kept one hand on it while i kept my other hand on the picture at my side i was feeling firstrate and when general filbert got in after we started and stood before me hanging by a strap and talking down to me i had the decency to propose giving him my seat as he was about ten years older  sure minver asked  well say fifteen i dont pretend to be a chicken and never did but he wouldnt hear of it said i had a bundle and winked at the bunch of mayflowers we had such a jolly talk that i let the car carry me a block by and had to get out at gloucester and run back to exeter i rang and when the maid came to the door there i stood with nothing but the mayflowers in my hand  good coup de théâtre minver jeered curtain  his brother disdained reply or was too much absorbed in his tale to think of any when the girl opened the door and i discovered my fix i burst out good lord and i stuck the bunch of flowers at her and turned and ran i suppose i must have had some notion of overtaking the car with my picture in it but the best i could do was to let the next one overtake me several blocks down marlborough street and carry me to the little jumpingoff station on westchester park as we used to call it in those days at the end of the back bay line  as i pushed into the railroad office i bet myself that the picture would not be there and sure enough i won  you were always a lucky dog minver said  but the man in charge was very encouraging and said it was sure to be turned in and he asked me what time the car had passed the corner of gloucester street i happened to know and then he said oh yes that conductor was a substitute and he wouldnt be on again till morning then he would be certain to bring the picture with him i was not to worry for it would be all right nothing left in the back bay cars was ever lost the character of the abutters was guarantee for that and they were practically the only passengers the conductors and the drivers were as honest as the passengers and i could consider myself in the hands of friends  he was so reassuring that i went away smiling at my fears and promising to be round bright and early as soon the official suggestedthe morrow being sundayas soon as the men and horses had had their baked beans  still after dinner i had a lurking anxiety which i turned into a friendly impulse to go and call on mrs filbert whom i really owed a breadandbutter visit and who i knew would not mind my coming in the evening the general she said had been telling her of our pleasant chat in the car and would be glad to smoke his afterdinner cigar with me and why wouldnt i come into the library  we were so very jolly together all three that i made light of my misadventure about the picture the general inquired about the flowers first he remembered the flowers perfectly and hoped they were acceptable he thought he remembered the picture too now i mentioned it but he would not have noticed it so much there by my side with my hand on it i would be sure to get it he gave several instances personal to him and his friends of recoveries of lost articles it was really astonishing how careful the horsecar people were especially on the back bay line i would find my picture all right at the westchester park station in the morning never fear  i feared so little that i slept well and even overslept and i went to get my picture quite confidently and i could hardly believe it had not been turned in yet though the stationmaster told me so the substitute conductor had not seen it but more than likely it was at the stables where the cleaners would have found it in the car and turned it in he was as robustly cheerful about it as ever and offered to send an inquiry by the next car but i said why shouldnt i go myself and he said that was a good idea so i went and it was well i did for my picture was not there and i had saved time by going it was not there but the head man said i need not worry a mite about it i was certain to get it sooner or later it would be turned in to a dead certainty we became rather confidential and i went so far as to explain about wanting to make my inquiries very quietly on blakeys account he would be annoyed if he heard of its loss and it might react unfavorably on his health  the head man said that was so and he would tell me what i wanted to do i wanted to go to the companys general offices in milk street and tell them about it that was where everything went as a last resort and he would bet any money that i would see my picture there the first thing i got inside the door i thanked him with the fervor i thought he merited and said i would go at once  well he said you dont want to go today you know the offices are not open sunday and tomorrows a holiday but youre all right youll find your picture there dont you have any doubts about it  that was my next to last sunday supper with my wife before she became my wife at her mothers house and i went to the feast with as little gayety as i suppose any young man ever carried to a supper of the kind i was told afterwards that my behavior up to a certain point was so suggestive either of secret crime or of secret regret that the only question was whether they should have in the police or i should be given back my engagement ring and advised to go luckily i ceased to bear my anguish just in time  the fact is i could not stand it any longer and as soon as i was alone with her i made a clean breast of it partially clean that is i suppose a fellow never tells all to a girl if he truly loves her minvers brother glanced round at us and gathered the harvest of our approving smiles i said to her ive been having a wedding present well she said youve come as near having no use for a wedding present as anybody i know was having a wedding present what made you so gloomy at supper who gave it to you anyway old blakey a painting yesa sketch what of this was where i qualified i said oh just one of those sorrento things of his you see if i told her that it was the villa where we first met and then said i had left it in the horsecar she would take it as proof positive that i did not really care anything about her or i never could have forgotten it  you were wise as far as you went minver said go on  well i told her the whole story circumstantially how i had kept the sketch religiously in my lap in the train and then held it down with my hand all the while beside me in the first horsecar and did the same thing in the back bay car i changed to and felt of it the whole time i was talking with general filbert and then left it there when i got out to leave the flowers at her door when the awful fact came over me like a flash yes she said norah said you poked the flowers at her without a word and she had to guess they were for me  i had got my story pretty glib by this time i had reeled it off with increasing particulars to the westchester park stationmaster and the head man at the stables and general filbert and i was so letterperfect that i had a vision of the whole thing especially of my talking with the general while i kept my hand on the pictureand then all was dark  at the end she said we must advertise for the picture i said it would kill blakey if he saw it and she said no matter let it kill him it would show him that we valued his gift and were moving heaven and earth to find it and at any rate it would kill me if i kept myself in suspense i said i should not care for that but with her sympathy i guessed i could live through the night and i was sure i should find the thing at the milk street office in the morning  why said she tomorrow itll be shut and then i didnt really know what to say and i agreed to drawing up an advertisement then and there so as not to lose an instants time after i had been at the milk street office on tuesday and found the picture had not been turned in she said i could dictate the advertisement and she would write it down and she asked which one of his sorrento things was it you must describe it exactly you know that made me feel awfully and i said i was not going to have my nexttolast sunday evening with her spoiled by writing advertisements and i got away somehow with all sorts of comforting reassurances from her i could see that she was feigning them to encourage me  the next morning i simply could not keep away from the milk street office and my unreasonable impatience was rewarded by finding it at least ajar if not open there was the nicest kind of a young fellow there and he said he was not officially present but what could he do for me then i told him the whole story with details i had not thought of before and he was just as enthusiastic about my getting my picture as the westchester park stationmaster or the head man of the stables it was morally certain to be turned in the first thing in the morning but he would take a description of it and send out inquiries to all the conductors and drivers and carcleaners and make a special thing of it he entered into the spirit of the affair and i felt that i had such a friend in him that i confided a little more and hinted at the double interest i had in the picture i didnt pretend that it was one of blakeys sorrento things but i gave him a full and true description of it with its length breadth and thickness in exact measure  here minvers brother stopped and lost himself in contemplation of the sketch as he held it at armslength  well did you get your picture i prompted after a moment  oh yes he said with a quick turn towards me this is it a district messenger brought it round the first thing tuesday morning he brought it minvers brother added with a certain effectiveness from the florists where i had stopped to get those mayflowers i had left it there  youve told it very well this time joe minver said but acton here is waiting for the psychology poor old wanhope ought to be here he added to me he looked about for a match to light his pipe and his brother jerked his head in the direction of the chimney  box on the mantel yes he sighed that was really something very curious you see i had invented the whole history of the case from the time i got into the back bay car with my flowers absolutely nothing had happened of all i had remembered till i got out of the car i did not put the picture beside me at the end of the car i did not keep my hand on it while i talked with general filbert i did not leave it behind me when i left the car nothing of the kind happened i had already left it at the florists and that whole passage of experience which was so vividly and circumstantially stamped in my memory that i related it four or five times over and would have made oath to every detail of it was pure invention or rather it was something less positive the reflex of the first half of my horsecar experience when i really did put the picture in the corner next me and did keep my hand on it  very strange i was beginning but just then the door opened and mrs minver came in and i was presented  she gave me a distracted hand as she said to her husband have you been telling the story about that picture again he was still holding it silly  she was a mighty pretty woman but full of vim and fun and sense  its one of the most curious freaks of memory i ever heard of mrs minver i said  then she showed that she was proud of it though she had called him silly have you told she demanded of her husband how oddly your memory behaved about the subject of the picture too  i have again eaten that particular piece of humblepie minvers brother replied  well she said to me i think he was simply so possessed with the awfulness of having lost the picture that all the rest took place prophetically but unconsciously  by a species of inverted presentiment i suggested  yes she assented slowly as if the formulation were new to her but not unacceptable something of that kind i never heard of anybody else having it  minver had got his pipe alight and was enjoying it i think joe was simply off his nut for the time being     iv  a case of metaphantasmia   the stranger was a guest of halsons and halson himself was a comparative stranger for he was of recent election to our diningclub and was better known to minver than to the rest of our little group though one could not be sure that he was very well known to minver the stranger had been dining with halson and we had found the two smoking together with their cups of black coffee at their elbows before the smouldering fire in the turkish room when we came in from dinnermy friend wanhope the psychologist rulledge the sentimentalist minver the painter and myself it struck me for the first time that a fire on the hearth was out of keeping with a turkish room but i felt that the cups of black coffee restored the lost balance in some measure  before we had settled into our wonted placesin fact almost as we enteredhalson looked over his shoulder and said mr wanhope i want you to hear this story of my friends go on newtonor rather go back and begin againand ill introduce you afterwards  the stranger made a becoming show of deprecation he said he did not think the story would bear immediate repetition or was even worth telling once but if we had nothing better to do perhaps we might do worse than hear it the most he could say for it was that the thing really happened he wore a large drooping gray mustache which with the imperial below it quite hid his mouth and gave him somehow a martial effect besides accurately dating him of the period between the latest sixties and earliest seventies when his beard would have been black i liked his mustache not being stubbed in the modern manner but allowed to fall heavily over his lips and then branch away from the corners of his mouth as far as it would he lighted the cigar which halson gave him and blowing the bittenoff tip towards the fire began  it was about that time when we first had a tenoclock night train from boston to new york train used to start at nine and lag along round by springfield and get into the old twentysixth street station here at six in the morning where they let you sleep as long as you liked they call you up now at halfpast five and if you dont turn out they haul you back to mott haven or new haven im not sure which i used to go into boston and turn in at the old worcester depot as we called it then just about the time the train began to move and i usually got a fine nights rest in the course of the nine or ten hours we were on the way to new york it didnt seem quite the same after we began saying albany depot shortened up the run somehow  illustration no burglar could have missed me if he had wanted an easy mark  but that night i wasnt very sleepy and the porter had got the place so piping hot with the big stoves one at each end of the car to keep the good oldfashioned christmas cold out that i thought i should be more comfortable with a smoke before i went to bed and anyhow i could get away from the heat better in the smokingroom i hated to be leaving home on christmas eve for i never had done that before and i hated to be leaving my wife alone with the children and the two girls in our little house in cambridge before i started in on the old horsecar for boston i had helped her to tuck the young ones in and to fill the stockings hung along the wall over the registerthe nearest we could come to a fireplaceand i thought those stockings looked very weird five of them dangling lumpily down and i kept seeing them and her sitting up sewing in front of them and afraid to go to bed on account of burglars i suppose she was shyer of burglars than any woman ever was that had never seen a sign of them she was always calling me up to go downstairs and put them out and i used to wander all over the house from attic to cellar in my nighty with a lamp in one hand and a poker in the other so that no burglar could have missed me if he had wanted an easy mark i always kept a lamp and a poker handy  the stranger heaved a sigh as of fond reminiscence and looked round for the sympathy which in our company of bachelors he failed of even the sympathetic rulledge failed of the necessary experience to move him in compassionate response  well the stranger went on a little damped perhaps by his failure but supported apparently by the interest of the fact in hand i had the smokingroom to myself for a while and then a fellow put his head in that i thought i knew after i had thought i didnt know him he dawned on me more and more and i had to acknowledge to myself by and by that it was a man named melford whom i used to room with in holworthy at harvard that is we had an apartment of two bedrooms and a study and i suppose there were never two fellows knew less of each other than we did at the end of our four years together i cant say what melford knew of me but the most i knew of melford was his particular brand of nightmare  wanhope gave the first sign of his interest in the matter he took his cigar from his lips and softly emitted an ah  rulledge went further and interrogatively repeated the word nightmare  nightmare the stranger continued firmly the curious thing about it was that i never exactly knew the subject of his nightmare and a more curious thing yet was melford himself never knew it when i woke him up he said he couldnt make out anything but a kind of scraping in a doorlock his theory was that in his childhood it had been a much completer thing but that the circumstances had broken down in a sort of decadence and now there was nothing left of it but that scraping in the doorlock like somebody trying to turn a misfit key i used to throw things at his door and once i tried a coldwater douche from the pitcher when he was very hard to waken but that was rather brutal and after a while i used to let him roar himself awake he would always do it if i trusted to nature and before our junior year was out i got so that i could sleep through pretty calmly i would just say to myself when he fetched me to the surface with a yell thats melford dreaming and doze off sweetly  jove rulledge said i dont see how you could stand it  theres everything in habit rulledge minver put in perhaps our friend only dreamt that he heard a dream  thats quite possible the stranger owned politely but the case is superficially as i state it however it was all past long ago when i recognized melford in the smokingroom that night it must have been ten or a dozen years i was wearing a full beard then and so was he we wore as much beard as we could in those days i had been through the war since college and he had been in california most of the time and as he told me he had been up north in alaska just after we bought it and hurt his eyeshad snowblindnessand he wore spectacles in fact i had to do most of the recognizing but after we found out who we were we were rather comfortable and i liked him better than i remembered to have liked him in our college days i dont suppose there was ever much harm in him it was only my grudge about his nightmare we talked along and smoked along for about an hour and i could hear the porter outside making up the berths and the train rumbled away towards framingham and then towards worcester and i began to be sleepy and to think i would go to bed myself and just then the door of the smokingroom opened and a young girl put in her face a moment and said oh i beg your pardon i thought it was the stateroom and then she shut the door and i realized that she looked like a girl i used to know  the stranger stopped and i fancied from a note in his voice that this girl was perhaps like an early love we silently waited for him to resume how and when he would he sighed and after an appreciable interval he began again it is curious how things are related to one another my wife had never seen her and yet somehow this girl that looked like the one i mean brought my mind back to my wife with a quick turn after i had forgotten her in my talk with melford for the time being i thought how lonely she was in that little house of ours in cambridge on rather an outlying street and i knew she was thinking of me and hating to have me away on christmas eve which isnt such a lively time after youre grown up and begin to look back on a good many other christmas eves when you were a child yourself in fact i dont know a dismaler night in the whole year i stepped out on the platform before i began to turn in for a mouthful of the night air and i found it was spitting snowa regular christmas eve of the true pattern and i didnt believe from the business feel of those hard little pellets that it was going to stop in a hurry and i thought if we got into new york on time we should be lucky the snow made me think of a night when my wife was sure there were burglars in the house and in fact i heard their tramping on the stairs myselfthump thump thump and then a stop and then down again of course it was the slide and thud of the snow from the roof of the main part of the house to the roof of the kitchen which was in an l a story lower but it was as good an imitation of burglars as i want to hear at one oclock in the morning and the recollection of it made me more anxious about my wife not because i believed she was in danger but because i knew how frightened she must be  when i went back into the car that girl passed me on the way to her stateroom and i concluded that she was the only woman on board and her friends had taken the stateroom for her so that she neednt feel strange i usually go to bed in a sleeper as i do in my own house but that night i somehow couldnt i got to thinking of accidents and i thought how disagreeable it would be to turn out into the snow in my nighty i ended by turning in with my clothes on all except my coat and in spite of the redhot stoves i wasnt any too warm i had a berth in the middle of the car and just as i was parting my curtains to lie down old melford came to take the lower berth opposite it made me laugh a little and i was glad of the relief why hello melford said i this is like the old holworthy times yes isnt it said he and then i asked something that i had kept myself from asking all through our talk in the smokingroom because i knew he was rather sensitive about it or used to be do you ever have that regulation nightmare of yours nowadays melford he gave a laugh and said i havent had it i suppose once in ten years what made you think of it i said oh i dont know it just came into my mind well goodnight old fellow i hope youll rest well and suddenly i began to feel lighthearted again and i went to sleep as gayly as ever i did in my life  the stranger paused again and wanhope said those swift transitions of mood are very interesting of course they occur in that remote region of the mind where all incidents and sensations are of one quality and things of the most opposite character unite in a common origin no one that i remember has attempted to trace such effects to their causes and then back again from their causes which would be much more important  yes i dare say minver put in but if they all amount to the same thing in the end what difference would it make  it would perhaps establish the identity of good and evil wanhope suggested  oh the sinners are convinced of that already minver said while rulledge glanced quickly from one to the other  the stranger looked rather dazed and rulledge said well i dont suppose that was the conclusion of the whole matter  oh no the stranger answered that was only the beginning of the conclusion i didnt go to sleep at once though i felt so much at peace in fact melford beat me and i could hear him far in advance steaming and whistling away in a style that i recalled as characteristic over a space of intervening years that i hadnt definitely summed up yet it made me think of a night near narragansett bay where two friends of mine and i had had a mighty good dinner at a sort of wild clubhouse and had hurried into our bunks each one so as to get the start of the others for the fellows that were left behind knew they had no chance of sleep after the first began to get in his work i laughed and i suppose i must have gone to sleep almost simultaneously for i dont recollect anything afterwards till i was wakened by a kind of muffled bellow that i remembered only too well it was the unfailing sign of melfords nightmare  i was ready to swear and i was ashamed for the fellow who had no more selfcontrol than that when a fellow snores or has a nightmare you always think first off that he neednt have had it if he had tried as usual i knew melford didnt know what his nightmare was about and that made me madder still to have him bellowing into the air like that with no particular aim all at once there came a piercing scream from the stateroom and then i knew that the girl there had heard melford and been scared out of a years growth  the stranger made a little break and wanhope asked could you make out what she screamed or was it quite inarticulate  it was plain enough and it gave me a clew somehow to what melfords nightmare was about she was calling out help help help burglars till i thought she would raise the roof of the car  and did she wake anybody rulledge inquired  that was the strange part of it not a soul stirred and after the first burst the girl seemed to quiet down again and yield the floor to melford who kept bellowing steadily away i was so furious that i reached out across the aisle to shake him but the attempt was too much for me i lost my balance and fell out of my berth onto the floor you may imagine the state of mind i was in i gathered myself up and pulled melfords curtains open and was just going to fall on him tooth and nail when i was nearly taken off my feet again by an apparition well it looked like an apparition but it was a tall fellow in his nightyfor it was twenty years before pajamasand he had a small dark lantern in his hand such as we used to carry in those days so as to read in our berths when we couldnt sleep he was gritting his teeth and growling between them out o this out o this im going to shoot to kill you blasted thieves i could see by the strange look in his eyes that he was sleepwalking and i didnt wait to see if he had a pistol i popped in behind the curtains and found myself on top of another fellow for i had popped into the wrong berth in my confusion the man started up and yelled oh dont kill me theres my watch on the stand and all the money in the house is in my pantaloons pocket the silvers in the sideboard downstairs and its plated anyway then i understood what his complaint was and i rolled onto the floor again by that time every man in the car was out of his berth too except melford who was devoting himself strictly to business and every man was grabbing some other and shouting police or burglars or help or murder just as the fancy took him  most extraordinary wanhope commented as the stranger paused for breath  in the intensity of our interest we had crowded close upon him except minver who sat with his head thrown back and that cynical cast in his eye which always exasperated rulledge and halson who stood smiling proudly as if the strangers story did him as his sponsor credit personally  yes the stranger owned but i dont know that there wasnt something more extraordinary still from time to time the girl in the stateroom kept piping up with a shriek for help she had got past the burglar stage but she wanted to be saved anyhow from some danger which she didnt specify it went through me that it was very strange nobody called the porter and i set up a shout of porter on my own account i decided that if there were burglars the porter was the man to put them out and that if there were no burglars the porter could relieve our groundless fears sure enough he came rushing in as soon as i called for him from the little corner by the smokingroom where he was blacking boots between dozes he was wide enough awake if having his eyes open meant that and he had a shoe on one hand and a shoebrush in the other but he merely joined in the general uproar and shouted for the police  excuse me wanhope interposed i wish to be clear as to the facts you had reasoned it out that the porter could quiet the tumult  never reasoned anything out so clearly in my life  but what was your theory of the situation that your friend mr melford had a nightmare in which he was dreaming of burglars  i hadnt a doubt of it  and that by a species of dreamtransference the nightmare was communicated to the young lady in the stateroom  wellyes  and that her call for help and her cry of burglars acted as a sort of hypnotic suggestion with the other sleepers and they began to be afflicted with the same nightmare  i dont know that i ever put it to myself so distinctly but it appears to me now that i must have reached some such conclusion  that is very interesting very interesting indeed i beg your pardon please go on wanhope courteously entreated  i dont remember just where i was the stranger faltered  rulledge returned with an accuracy which obliged us all the porter merely joined in the general uproar and shouted for the police  oh yes the stranger assented then i didnt know what to do for a minute the porter was a pretty thickheaded darky but he was lionhearted and his idea was to lay hold of a burglar wherever he could find him there were plenty of burglars in the aisle there or people that were afraid of burglars and they seemed to think the porter had a good idea they had hold of one another already and now began to pull up and down the aisles in a way that reminded me of the oldfashioned mesmeric lecturers when they told their subjects that they were this or that and set them to acting the part i remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were at a horserace and his subjects all got astride of their chairs and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths i thought of that now and although it was rather a serious business for i didnt know what minute they would come to blows i couldnt help laughing the sight was weird enough every one looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled the young lady in the stateroom was doing her full share she was screaming wont somebody let me out and hammering on the door i guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the conductor at last or maybe he just came round in the course of nature to take up the tickets it was before the time when they took the tickets at the gate and you used to stick them into a little slot at the side of your berth and the conductor came along and took them in the night somewhere between worcester and springfield i should say  i remember rulledge assented but very carefully so as not to interrupt the flow of the narrative used to wake up everybody in the car  exactly the stranger said but this time they were all wide awake to receive him or fast asleep and dreaming their roles he came along with the wire of his lantern over his arm the way the oldtime conductors did and calling out tickets just as if it was broad day and he believed every man was trying to beat his way to new york the oddest thing about it was that the sleepwalkers all stopped their pulling and hauling a moment and each man reached down to the little slot alongside of his berth and handed over his ticket then they took hold and began pulling and hauling again i suppose the conductor asked what the matter was but i couldnt hear him and i couldnt make out exactly what he did say but the passengers understood and they all shouted burglars and that girl in the stateroom gave a shriek that you could have heard from one end of the train to the other and hammered on the door and wanted to be let out  it seemed to take the conductor by surprise and he faced towards the stateroom and let the lantern slip off his arm and it dropped onto the floor and went out i remember thinking what a good thing it didnt set the car on fire but there in the darkfor the car lamps went out at the same time with the lanterni could hear those fellows pulling and hauling up and down the aisle and scuffling over the floor and through all melford bellowing away like an orchestral accompaniment to a combat in wagner opera but getting quieter and quieter till his bellow died away altogether at the same time the row in the aisle of the car stopped and there was perfect silence and i could hear the snow rattling against my window then i went off into a sound sleep and never woke till we got into new york  the stranger seemed to have reached the end of his story or at least to have exhausted the interest it had for him and he smoked on holding his knee between his hands and looking thoughtfully into the fire  he had left us rather breathless or better said blank and each looked at the other for some initiative then we united in looking at wanhope that is rulledge and i did minver rose and stretched himself with what i must describe as a sardonic yawn halson had stolen away before the end as one to whom the end was known wanhope seemed by no means averse to the inquiry delegated to him but only to be formulating its terms at last he said  i dont remember hearing of any case of this kind before thoughttransference is a sufficiently ascertained phenomenonthe insistence of a conscious mind upon a certain fact until it penetrates the unconscious mind of another and is adopted as its own but in the dream state the mind seems passive and becomes the prey of this or that selfsuggestion without the power of imparting it to another dreaming mind yet here we have positive proof of such an effect it appears that the victim of a particularly terrific nightmare was able to share its horrorsor rather unable not to share themwith a whole sleepingcar full of people whose brains helplessly took up the same theme and dreamed it as we may say to the same conclusions i said proof but of course we cant accept a single instance as establishing a scientific certainty i dont question the veracity of mr  newton the stranger suggested  newtons experience wanhope continued but we must wait for a good many cases of the kind before we can accept what i may call metaphantasmia as being equally established with thoughttransference if we could it would throw light upon a whole series of most curious phenomena as for instance the privity of a person dreamed about to the incident created by the dreamer  that would be rather dreadful wouldnt it i ventured we do dream such scandalous such compromising things about people  all that wanhope gently insisted could have nothing to do with the fact that alone is to be considered in an inquiry of the kind one is never obliged to tell ones dreams i wonderhe turned to the stranger who sat absently staring into the fireif you happened to speak to your friend about his nightmare in the morning and whether he was by any chance aware of the participation of the others in it  i certainly spoke to him pretty plainly when we got into new york  and what did he say  he said he had never slept better in his life and he couldnt remember having a trace of nightmare he said he heard me groaning at one time but i stopped just as he woke and so he didnt rouse me as he thought of doing it was at hartford and he went to sleep again and slept through without a break  and what was your conclusion from that wanhope asked  that he was lying i should say rulledge replied for the stranger  wanhope still waited and the stranger said i suppose one conclusion might be that i had dreamed the whole thing myself  then you wish me to infer the psychologist pursued that the entire incident was a figment of your sleeping brain that there was no sort of sleeping thoughttransference no metaphantasmia noexcuse me do you remember verifying your impression of being between worcester and springfield when the affair occurred by looking at your watch for instance  the stranger suddenly pulled out his watch at the word good heavens he called out its twenty minutes of eleven and i have to take the elevenoclock train to boston i must bid you goodevening gentlemen ive just time to get it if i can catch a cab goodnight goodnight i hope if you come to bostonehgoodnight sometimes he called over his shoulder ive thought it might have been that girl in the stateroom that started the dreaming  he had wrung our hands one after another and now he ran out of the room  rulledge said in appeal to wanhope i dont see how his being the dreamer invalidates the case if his dreams affected the others  well wanhope answered thoughtfully that depends  and what do you think of its being the girl in the stateroom  that would be very interesting     v  editha   the air was thick with the war feeling like the electricity of a storm which has not yet burst editha sat looking out into the hot spring afternoon with her lips parted and panting with the intensity of the question whether she could let him go she had decided that she could not let him stay when she saw him at the end of the still leafless avenue making slowly up towards the house with his head down and his figure relaxed she ran impatiently out on the veranda to the edge of the steps and imperatively demanded greater haste of him with her will before she called aloud to him george  he had quickened his pace in mystical response to her mystical urgence before he could have heard her now he looked up and answered well  oh how united we are she exulted and then she swooped down the steps to him what is it she cried  its war he said and he pulled her up to him and kissed her  she kissed him back intensely but irrelevantly as to their passion and uttered from deep in her throat how glorious  its war he repeated without consenting to her sense of it and she did not know just what to think at first she never knew what to think of him that made his mystery his charm all through their courtship which was contemporaneous with the growth of the war feeling she had been puzzled by his want of seriousness about it he seemed to despise it even more than he abhorred it she could have understood his abhorring any sort of bloodshed that would have been a survival of his old life when he thought he would be a minister and before he changed and took up the law but making light of a cause so high and noble seemed to show a want of earnestness at the core of his being not but that she felt herself able to cope with a congenital defect of that sort and make his love for her save him from himself now perhaps the miracle was already wrought in him in the presence of the tremendous fact that he announced all triviality seemed to have gone out of him she began to feel that he sank down on the top step and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief while she poured out upon him her question of the origin and authenticity of his news  all the while in her duplex emotioning she was aware that now at the very beginning she must put a guard upon herself against urging him by any word or act to take the part that her whole soul willed him to take for the completion of her ideal of him he was very nearly perfect as he was and he must be allowed to perfect himself but he was peculiar and he might very well be reasoned out of his peculiarity before her reasoning went her emotioning her nature pulling upon his nature her womanhood upon his manhood without her knowing the means she was using to the end she was willing she had always supposed that the man who won her would have done something to win her she did not know what but something george gearson had simply asked her for her love on the way home from a concert and she gave her love to him without as it were thinking but now it flashed upon her if he could do something worthy to have won herbe a hero her heroit would be even better than if he had done it before asking her it would be grander besides she had believed in the war from the beginning  but dont you see dearest she said that it wouldnt have come to this if it hadnt been in the order of providence and i call any war glorious that is for the liberation of people who have been struggling for years against the cruelest oppression dont you think so too  i suppose so he returned languidly but war is it glorious to break the peace of the world  that ignoble peace it was no peace at all with that crime and shame at our very gates she was conscious of parroting the current phrases of the newspapers but it was no time to pick and choose her words she must sacrifice anything to the high ideal she had for him and after a good deal of rapid argument she ended with the climax but now it doesnt matter about the how or why since the war has come all that is gone there are no two sides any more there is nothing now but our country  he sat with his eyes closed and his head leant back against the veranda and he remarked with a vague smile as if musing aloud our countryright or wrong  yes right or wrong she returned fervidly ill go and get you some lemonade she rose rustling and whisked away when she came back with two tall glasses of clouded liquid on a tray and the ice clucking in them he still sat as she had left him and she said as if there had been no interruption but there is no question of wrong in this case i call it a sacred war a war for liberty and humanity if ever there was one and i know you will see it just as i do yet  he took half the lemonade at a gulp and he answered as he set the glass down i know you always have the highest ideal when i differ from you i ought to doubt myself  a generous sob rose in edithas throat for the humility of a man so very nearly perfect who was willing to put himself below her  besides she felt more subliminally that he was never so near slipping through her fingers as when he took that meek way  you shall not say that only for once i happen to be right she seized his hand in her two hands and poured her soul from her eyes into his dont you think so she entreated him  illustration you shall not say that  he released his hand and drank the rest of his lemonade and she added have mine too but he shook his head in answering ive no business to think so unless i act so too  her heart stopped a beat before it pulsed on with leaps that she felt in her neck she had noticed that strange thing in men they seemed to feel bound to do what they believed and not think a thing was finished when they said it as girls did she knew what was in his mind but she pretended not and she said oh i am not sure and then faltered  he went on as if to himself without apparently heeding her theres only one way of proving ones faith in a thing like this  she could not say that she understood but she did understand  he went on again if i believedif i felt as you do about this wardo you wish me to feel as you do  now she was really not sure so she said george i dont know what you mean  he seemed to muse away from her as before  there is a sort of fascination in it i suppose that at the bottom of his heart every man would like at times to have his courage tested to see how he would act  how can you talk in that ghastly way  it is rather morbid still thats what it comes to unless youre swept away by ambition or driven by conviction i havent the conviction or the ambition and the other thing is what it comes to with me i ought to have been a preacher after all then i couldnt have asked it of myself as i must now im a lawyer and you believe its a holy war editha he suddenly addressed her oh i know you do but you wish me to believe so too  she hardly knew whether he was mocking or not in the ironical way he always had with her plainer mind but the only thing was to be outspoken with him  george i wish you to believe whatever you think is true at any and every cost if ive tried to talk you into anything i take it all back  oh i know that editha i know how sincere you are and howi wish i had your undoubting spirit ill think it over id like to believe as you do but i dont now i dont indeed it isnt this war alone though this seems peculiarly wanton and needless but its every warso stupid it makes me sick why shouldnt this thing have been settled reasonably  because she said very throatily again god meant it to be war  you think it was god yes i suppose that is what people will say  do you suppose it would have been war if god hadnt meant it  i dont know sometimes it seems as if god had put this world into mens keeping to work it as they pleased  now george that is blasphemy  well i wont blaspheme ill try to believe in your pocket providence he said and then he rose to go  why dont you stay to dinner dinner at balcoms works was at one oclock  ill come back to supper if youll let me perhaps i shall bring you a convert  well you may come back on that condition  all right if i dont come youll understand  he went away without kissing her and she felt it a suspension of their engagement it all interested her intensely she was undergoing a tremendous experience and she was being equal to it while she stood looking after him her mother came out through one of the long windows onto the veranda with a catlike softness and vagueness  why didnt he stay to dinner  becausebecausewar has been declared editha pronounced without turning  her mother said oh my and then said nothing more until she had sat down in one of the large shaker chairs and rocked herself for some time then she closed whatever tacit passage of thought there had been in her mind with the spoken words well i hope he wont go  and i hope he will the girl said and confronted her mother with a stormy exaltation that would have frightened any creature less unimpressionable than a cat  her mother rocked herself again for an interval of cogitation what she arrived at in speech was well i guess youve done a wicked thing editha balcom  the girl said as she passed indoors through the same window her mother had come out by i havent done anythingyet                                       in her room she put together all her letters and gifts from gearson down to the withered petals of the first flower he had offered with that timidity of his veiled in that irony of his in the heart of the packet she enshrined her engagement ring which she had restored to the pretty box he had brought it her in then she sat down if not calmly yet strongly and wrote       georgei understood when you left me but i think we had better      emphasize your meaning that if we cannot be one in everything we      had better be one in nothing so i am sending these things for your      keeping till you have made up your mind       i shall always love you and therefore i shall never marry any one      else but the man i marry must love his country first of all and      be able to say to me           i could not love thee dear so much            loved i not honor more       there is no honor above america with me in this great hour there      is no other honor       your heart will make my words clear to you i had never expected      to say so much but it has come upon me that i must say the utmost       editha  she thought she had worded her letter well worded it in a way that could not be bettered all had been implied and nothing expressed  she had it ready to send with the packet she had tied with red white and blue ribbon when it occurred to her that she was not just to him that she was not giving him a fair chance he had said he would go and think it over and she was not waiting she was pushing threatening compelling that was not a womans part she must leave him free free free she could not accept for her country or herself a forced sacrifice  in writing her letter she had satisfied the impulse from which it sprang she could well afford to wait till he had thought it over she put the packet and the letter by and rested serene in the consciousness of having done what was laid upon her by her love itself to do and yet used patience mercy justice  she had her reward gearson did not come to tea but she had given him till morning when late at night there came up from the village the sound of a fife and drum with a tumult of voices in shouting singing and laughing the noise drew nearer and nearer it reached the street end of the avenue there it silenced itself and one voice the voice she knew best rose over the silence it fell the air was filled with cheers the fife and drum struck up with the shouting singing and laughing again but now retreating and a single figure came hurrying up the avenue  she ran down to meet her lover and clung to him he was very gay and he put his arm round her with a boisterous laugh well you must call me captain now or cap if you prefer thats what the boys call me yes weve had a meeting at the townhall and everybody has volunteered and they selected me for captain and im going to the war the big war the glorious war the holy war ordained by the pocket providence that blesses butchery come along lets tell the whole family about it call them from their downy beds father mother aunt hitty and all the folks  but when they mounted the veranda steps he did not wait for a larger audience he poured the story out upon editha alone  there was a lot of speaking and then some of the fools set up a shout for me it was all going one way and i thought it would be a good joke to sprinkle a little cold water on them but you cant do that with a crowd that adores you the first thing i knew i was sprinkling hellfire on them cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war that was the style now that it had come to the fight there were no two parties there was one country and the thing was to fight to a finish as quick as possible i suggested volunteering then and there and i wrote my name first of all on the roster then they elected methats all i wish i had some icewater  she left him walking up and down the veranda while she ran for the icepitcher and a goblet and when she came back he was still walking up and down shouting the story he had told her to her father and mother who had come out more sketchily dressed than they commonly were by day he drank goblet after goblet of the icewater without noticing who was giving it and kept on talking and laughing through his talk wildly its astonishing he said how well the worse reason looks when you try to make it appear the better why i believe i was the first convert to the war in that crowd tonight i never thought i should like to kill a man but now i shouldnt care and the smokeless powder lets you see the man drop that you kill its all for the country what a thing it is to have a country that cant be wrong but if it is is right anyway  editha had a great vital thought an inspiration she set down the icepitcher on the veranda floor and ran upstairs and got the letter she had written him when at last he noisily bade her father and mother well goodnight i forgot i woke you up i shant want any sleep myself she followed him down the avenue to the gate there after the whirling words that seemed to fly away from her thoughts and refuse to serve them she made a last effort to solemnize the moment that seemed so crazy and pressed the letter she had written upon him  whats this he said want me to mail it  no no its for you i wrote it after you went this morning keep itkeep itand read it sometime she thought and then her inspiration came read it if ever you doubt what youve done or fear that i regret your having done it read it after youve started  they strained each other in embraces that seemed as ineffective as their words and he kissed her face with quick hot breaths that were so unlike him that made her feel as if she had lost her old lover and found a stranger in his place the stranger said what a gorgeous flower you are with your red hair and your blue eyes that look black now and your face with the color painted out by the white moonshine let me hold you under the chin to see whether i love blood you tigerlily then he laughed gearsons laugh and released her scared and giddy within her wilfulness she had been frightened by a sense of subtler force in him and mystically mastered as she had never been before  she ran all the way back to the house and mounted the steps panting her mother and father were talking of the great affair her mother said want mr gearson in rather of an excited state of mind didnt you think he acted curious  well not for a man whod just been elected captain and had set em up for the whole of company a her father chuckled back  what in the world do you mean mr balcom oh theres editha she offered to follow the girl indoors  dont come mother editha called vanishing  mrs balcom remained to reproach her husband i dont see much of anything to laugh at  well its catching caught it from gearson i guess it wont be much of a war and i guess gearson dont think so either the other fellows will back down as soon as they see we mean it i wouldnt lose any sleep over it im going back to bed myself                                       gearson came again next afternoon looking pale and rather sick but quite himself even to his languid irony i guess id better tell you editha that i consecrated myself to your god of battles last night by pouring too many libations to him down my own throat but im all right now one has to carry off the excitement somehow  promise me she commanded that youll never touch it again  what not let the cannikin clink not let the soldier drink well i promise  you dont belong to yourself now you dont even belong to me you belong to your country and you have a sacred charge to keep yourself strong and well for your countrys sake i have been thinking thinking all night and all day long  you look as if you had been crying a little too he said with his queer smile  thats all past ive been thinking and worshipping you dont you suppose i know all that youve been through to come to this ive followed you every step from your old theories and opinions  well youve had a long row to hoe  and i know youve done this from the highest motives  oh there wont be much pettifogging to do till this cruel war is  and you havent simply done it for my sake i couldnt respect you if you had  well then well say i havent a man that hasnt got his own respect intact wants the respect of all the other people he can corner but we wont go into that im in for the thing now and weve got to face our future my idea is that this isnt going to be a very protracted struggle we shall just scare the enemy to death before it comes to a fight at all but we must provide for contingencies editha if anything happens to me  oh george she clung to him sobbing  i dont want you to feel foolishly bound to my memory i should hate that wherever i happened to be  i am yours for time and eternitytime and eternity she liked the words they satisfied her famine for phrases  well say eternity thats all right but times another thing and im talking about time but there is something my mother if anything happens  she winced and he laughed youre not the bold soldiergirl of yesterday then he sobered if anything happens i want you to help my mother out she wont like my doing this thing she brought me up to think war a fool thing as well as a bad thing my father was in the civil war all through it lost his arm in it she thrilled with the sense of the arm round her what if that should be lost he laughed as if divining her oh it doesnt run in the family as far as i know then he added gravely he came home with misgivings about war and they grew on him i guess he and mother agreed between them that i was to be brought up in his final mind about it but that was before my time i only knew him from my mothers report of him and his opinions i dont know whether they were hers first but they were hers last this will be a blow to her i shall have to write and tell her  he stopped and she asked would you like me to write too george  i dont believe that would do no ill do the writing shell understand a little if i say that i thought the way to minimize it was to make war on the largest possible scale at oncethat i felt i must have been helping on the war somehow if i hadnt helped keep it from coming and i knew i hadnt when it came i had no right to stay out of it  whether his sophistries satisfied him or not they satisfied her she clung to his breast and whispered with closed eyes and quivering lips yes yes yes  but if anything should happen you might go to her and see what you could do for her you know its rather far off she cant leave her chair  oh ill go if its the ends of the earth but nothing will happen nothing can i  she felt herself lifted with his rising and gearson was saying with his arm still round her to her father well were off at once mr balcom were to be formally accepted at the capital and then bunched up with the rest somehow and sent into camp somewhere and got to the front as soon as possible we all want to be in the van of course were the first company to report to the governor i came to tell editha but i hadnt got round to it                                       she saw him again for a moment at the capital in the station just before the train started southward with his regiment he looked well in his uniform and very soldierly but somehow girlish too with his cleanshaven face and slim figure the manly eyes and the strong voice satisfied her and his preoccupation with some unexpected details of duty flattered her other girls were weeping and bemoaning themselves but she felt a sort of noble distinction in the abstraction the almost unconsciousness with which they parted only at the last moment he said dont forget my mother it maynt be such a walkover as i supposed and he laughed at the notion  he waved his hand to her as the train moved offshe knew it among a score of hands that were waved to other girls from the platform of the car for it held a letter which she knew was hers then he went inside the car to read it doubtless and she did not see him again but she felt safe for him through the strength of what she called her love what she called her god always speaking the name in a deep voice and with the implication of a mutual understanding would watch over him and keep him and bring him back to her if with an empty sleeve then he should have three arms instead of two for both of hers should be his for life she did not see though why she should always be thinking of the arm his father had lost  there were not many letters from him but they were such as she could have wished and she put her whole strength into making hers such as she imagined he could have wished glorifying and supporting him she wrote to his mother glorifying him as their hero but the brief answer she got was merely to the effect that mrs gearson was not well enough to write herself and thanking her for her letter by the hand of some one who called herself yrs truly mrs wj andrews  editha determined not to be hurt but to write again quite as if the answer had been all she expected before it seemed as if she could have written there came news of the first skirmish and in the list of the killed which was telegraphed as a trifling loss on our side was gearsons name there was a frantic time of trying to make out that it might be must be some other gearson but the name and the company and the regiment and the state were too definitely given  then there was a lapse into depths out of which it seemed as if she never could rise again then a lift into clouds far above all grief black clouds that blotted out the sun but where she soared with him with georgegeorge she had the fever that she expected of herself but she did not die in it she was not even delirious and it did not last long when she was well enough to leave her bed her one thought was of georges mother of his strangely worded wish that she should go to her and see what she could do for her in the exaltation of the duty laid upon herit buoyed her up instead of burdening hershe rapidly recovered  her father went with her on the long railroad journey from northern new york to western iowa he had business out at davenport and he said he could just as well go then as any other time and he went with her to the little country town where georges mother lived in a little house on the edge of the illimitable cornfields under trees pushed to a top of the rolling prairie georges father had settled there after the civil war as so many other old soldiers had done but they were eastern people and editha fancied touches of the east in the june rose overhanging the front door and the garden with early summer flowers stretching from the gate of the paling fence  it was very low inside the house and so dim with the closed blinds that they could scarcely see one another editha tall and black in her crapes which filled the air with the smell of their dyes her father standing decorously apart with his hat on his forearm as at funerals a woman rested in a deep armchair and the woman who had let the strangers in stood behind the chair  the seated woman turned her head round and up and asked the woman behind her chair who did you say  editha if she had done what she expected of herself would have gone down on her knees at the feet of the seated figure and said i am georges editha for answer  but instead of her own voice she heard that other womans voice saying well i dont know as i did get the name just right i guess ill have to make a little more light in here and she went and pushed two of the shutters ajar  then edithas father said in his public willnowaddressafewremarks tone my name is balcom maamjunius h balcom of balcoms works new york my daughter  oh the seated woman broke in with a powerful voice the voice that always surprised editha from gearsons slender frame let me see you stand round where the light can strike on your face and editha dumbly obeyed so youre editha balcom she sighed  yes editha said more like a culprit than a comforter  what did you come for mrs gearson asked  edithas face quivered and her knees shook i camebecausebecause george she could go no further  yes the mother said he told me he had asked you to come if he got killed you didnt expect that i suppose when you sent him  i would rather have died myself than done it editha said with more truth in her deep voice than she ordinarily found in it i tried to leave him free  yes that letter of yours that came back with his other things left him free  editha saw now where georges irony came from  it was not to be read beforeunlessuntili told him so she faltered  of course he wouldnt read a letter of yours under the circumstances till he thought you wanted him to been sick the woman abruptly demanded  very sick editha said with selfpity  daughters life her father interposed was almost despaired of at one time  mrs gearson gave him no heed i suppose you would have been glad to die such a brave person as you i dont believe he was glad to die he was always a timid boy that way he was afraid of a good many things but if he was afraid he did what he made up his mind to i suppose he made up his mind to go but i knew what it cost him by what it cost me when i heard of it i had been through one war before when you sent him you didnt expect he would get killed  the voice seemed to compassionate editha and it was time no she huskily murmured  no girls dont women dont when they give their men up to their country they think theyll come marching back somehow just as gay as they went or if its an empty sleeve or even an empty pantaloon its all the more glory and theyre so much the prouder of them poor things  the tears began to run down edithas face she had not wept till then but it was now such a relief to be understood that the tears came  no you didnt expect him to get killed mrs gearson repeated in a voice which was startlingly like georges again you just expected him to kill some one else some of those foreigners that werent there because they had any say about it but because they had to be there poor wretchesconscripts or whatever they call em you thought it would be all right for my george your george to kill the sons of those miserable mothers and the husbands of those girls that you would never see the faces of the woman lifted her powerful voice in a psalmlike note i thank my god he didnt live to do it i thank my god they killed him first and that he aint livin with their blood on his hands she dropped her eyes which she had raised with her voice and glared at editha what you got that black on for she lifted herself by her powerful arms so high that her helpless body seemed to hang limp its full length take it off take it off before i tear it from your back  illustration she glared at editha what you got that black on for                                       the lady who was passing the summer near balcoms works was sketching edithas beauty which lent itself wonderfully to the effects of a colorist it had come to that confidence which is rather apt to grow between artist and sitter and editha had told her everything  to think of your having such a tragedy in your life the lady said she added i suppose there are people who feel that way about war but when you consider the good this war has donehow much it has done for the country i cant understand such people for my part and when you had come all the way out there to console hergot up out of a sickbed well  i think editha said magnanimously she wasnt quite in her right mind and so did papa  yes the lady said looking at edithas lips in nature and then at her lips in art and giving an empirical touch to them in the picture but how dreadful of her how perfectlyexcuse mehow vulgar  a light broke upon editha in the darkness which she felt had been without a gleam of brightness for weeks and months the mystery that had bewildered her was solved by the word and from that moment she rose from grovelling in shame and selfpity and began to live again in the ideal     vi  braybridges offer   we had ordered our dinners and were sitting in the turkish room at the club waiting to be called each in his turn to the diningroom it was always a cosey place whether you found yourself in it with cigars and coffee after dinner or with whatever liquid or solid appetizer you preferred in the halfhour or more that must pass before dinner after you had made out your menu it intimated an exclusive possession in the three or four who happened first to find themselves together in it and it invited the philosophic mind to contemplation more than any other spot in the club  our rather limited little downtown diningclub was almost a celibate community at most times a few husbands and fathers joined us at lunch but at dinner we were nearly always a company of bachelors dropping in an hour or so before we wished to dine and ordering from a bill of fare what we liked some dozed away in the intervening time some read the evening papers or played chess i preferred the chance society of the turkish room i could be pretty sure of finding wanhope there in these sympathetic moments and where wanhope was there would probably be rulledge passively willing to listen and agree and minver ready to interrupt and dispute i myself liked to look in and linger for either the reasoning or the bickering as it happened and now seeing the three there together i took a provisional seat behind the painter who made no sign of knowing i was present rulledge was eating a caviar sandwich which he had brought from the afternoon teatable near by and he greedily incited wanhope to go on in the polite pause which the psychologist had let follow on my appearance with what he was saying i was not surprised to find that his talk related to a fact just then intensely interesting to the few rapidly becoming the many who were privy to it though wanhope had the air of stooping to it from a higher range of thinking  i shouldnt have supposed somehow he said with a knot of deprecation between his fine eyes that he would have had the pluck  perhaps he hadnt minver suggested  wanhope waited for a thoughtful moment of censure eventuating in toleration you mean that she  i dont see why you say that minver rulledge interposed chivalrously with his mouth full of sandwich  i didnt say it minver contradicted  you implied it and i dont think its fair its easy enough to build up a report of that kind on the halfknowledge of rumor which is all that any outsider can have in the case  so far minver said with unbroken tranquillity as any such edifice has been erected you are the architect rulledge i shouldnt think you would like to go round insinuating that sort of thing here is acton and he now acknowledged my presence with a backward twist of his head on the alert for material already you ought to be more careful where acton is rulledge  it would be great copy if it were true i owned  wanhope regarded us all three in this play of our qualities with the scientific impartiality of a bacteriologist in the study of a culture offering some peculiar incidents he took up a point as remote as might be from the personal appeal it is curious how little we know of such matters after all the lovemaking and marrying in life and all the inquiry of the poets and novelists he addressed himself in this turn of his thought half playful half earnest to me as if i united with the functions of both a responsibility for their shortcomings  yes minver said facing about towards me how do you excuse yourself for your ignorance in matters where youre always professionally making such a bluff of knowledge after all the marriages you have brought about in literature can you say positively and specifically how they are brought about in life  no i cant i admitted i might say that a writer of fiction is a good deal like a minister who continually marries people without knowing why  no you couldnt my dear fellow the painter retorted its part of your swindle to assume that you do know why you ought to find out  wanhope interposed concretely or as concretely as he could the important thing would always be to find which of the lovers the confession tacit or explicit began with  acton ought to go round and collect human documents bearing on the question he ought to have got together thousands of specimens from nature he ought to have gone to all the married couples he knew and asked them just how their passion was confessed he ought to have sent out printed circulars with tabulated questions why dont you do it acton  i returned as seriously as could have been expected  perhaps it would be thought rather intimate people dont like to talk of such things  theyre ashamed minver declared the lovers dont either of them in a given case like to let others know how much the woman had to do with making the offer and how little the man  minvers point provoked both wanhope and myself to begin a remark at the same time we begged each others pardon and wanhope insisted that i should go on  oh merely this i said i dont think theyre so much ashamed as that they have forgotten the different stages you were going to say  very much what you said its astonishing how people forget the vital things and remember trifles or perhaps as we advance from stage to stage what once seemed the vital things turn to trifles nothing can be more vital in the history of a man and a woman than how they became husband and wife and yet not merely the details but the main fact would seem to escape record if not recollection the next generations knows nothing of it  that appears to let acton out minver said but how do you know what you were saying wanhope  ive ventured to make some inquiries in that region at one time not directly of course at second and third hand it isnt inconceivable if we conceive of a life after this that a man should forget in its more important interests and occupations just how he quitted this world or at least the particulars of the article of death of course we must suppose a good portion of eternity to have elapsed wanhope continued dreamily with a deep breath almost equivalent to something so unscientific as a sigh women are charming and in nothing more than the perpetual challenge they form for us they are born defying us to match ourselves with them  do you mean that miss hazelwood rulledge began but minvers laugh arrested him  nothing so concrete im afraid wanhope gently returned i mean to match them in graciousness in loveliness in all the agile contests of spirit and plays of fancy its pathetic to see them caught up into something more serious in that other game which they are so good at  they seem rather to like it though some of them if you mean the game of love minver said especially when theyre not in earnest about it  oh there are plenty of spoiled women wanhope admitted but i dont mean flirting i suppose that the average unspoiled woman is rather frightened than otherwise when she knows that a man is in love with her  do you suppose she always knows it first rulledge asked  you may be sure minver answered for wanhope that if she didnt know it he never would then wanhope answered for himself  i think that generally she sees it coming in that sort of wireless telegraphy that reaching out of two natures through space towards each other her more sensitive apparatus probably feels the appeal of his before he is conscious of having made any appeal  and her first impulse is to escape the appeal i suggested  yes wanhope admitted after a thoughtful reluctance  even when she is half aware of having invited it  if she is not spoiled she is never aware of having invited it take the case in point we wont mention any names she is sailing through time through youthful space with her electrical lures the natural equipment of every charming woman all out and suddenly somewhere from the unknown she feels the shock of a response in the gulfs of air where there had been no life before but she cant be said to have knowingly searched the void for any presence  oh im not sure about that professor minver put in go a little slower if you expect me to follow you  its all a mystery the most beautiful mystery of life wanhope resumed i dont believe i could make out the case as i feel it to be  braybridges part of the case is rather plain isnt it i invited him  im not sure of that no mans part of any case is plain if you look at it carefully the most that you can say of braybridge is that he is rather a simple nature but nothing the psychologist added with one of his deep breaths is so complex as a simple nature  well minver contended braybridge is plain if his case isnt  plain is he plain wanhope asked as if asking himself  my dear fellow you agnostics doubt everything  i should have said picturesque picturesque with the sort of unbeautifulness that takes the fancy of women more than greek proportion i think it would require a girl peculiarly feminine to feel the attraction of such a manthe fascination of his being grizzled and slovenly and rugged she would have to be rather a wild shy girl to do that and it would have to be through her fear of him that she would divine his fear of her but what i have heard is that they met under rather exceptional circumstances it was at a house in the adirondacks where braybridge was somewhat in the quality of a bull in a chinashop he was lugged in by the host as an old friend and was suffered by the hostess as a friend quite too old for her at any rate as i heard and i dont vouch for the facts all of them braybridge found himself at odds with the gay young people who made up the hostesss end of the party and was watching for a chance to  wanhope cast about for the word and minver supplied itpull out  yes but when he had found it miss hazelwood took it from him  i dont understand rulledge said  when he came in to breakfast the third morning prepared with an excuse for cutting his week down to the dimensions it had reached he saw her sitting alone at the table she had risen early as a consequence of having arrived late the night before and when braybridge found himself in for it he forgot that he meant to go away and said goodmorning as if they knew each other their hostess found them talking over the length of the table in a sort of mutual fright and introduced them but its rather difficult reporting a lady verbatim at second hand i really had the facts from welkin who had them from his wife the sum of her impressions was that braybridge and miss hazelwood were getting a kind of comfort out of their mutual terror because one was as badly frightened as the other it was a novel experience for both ever seen her  we looked at one another minver said i never wanted to paint any one so much it was at the spring show of the american artists there was a jam of people but this girlive understood it was shelooked as much alone as if there were nobody else there she might have been a startled doe in the north woods suddenly coming out on a twentythousanddollar camp with a lot of twentymilliondollar people on the veranda  and you wanted to do her as the startled doe i said good selling name  dont reduce it to the vulgarity of fiction i admit it would be a selling name  go on wanhope rulledge puffed impatiently though i dont see how there could be another soul in the universe as constitutionally scared of men as braybridge is of women  in the universe nothing is wasted i suppose everything has its complement its response for every bashful man there must be a bashful woman wanhope returned  or a bold one minver suggested  no the response must be in kind to be truly complemental through the sense of their reciprocal timidity they divine that they neednt be afraid  oh thats the way you get out of it  well rulledge urged  im afraid wanhope modestly confessed that from this point i shall have to be largely conjectural welkin wasnt able to be very definite except as to moments and he had his data almost altogether from his wife braybridge had told him overnight that he thought of going and he had said he mustnt think of it but he supposed braybridge had spoken of it to mrs welkin and he began by saying to his wife that he hoped she had refused to hear of braybridges going she said she hadnt heard of it but now she would refuse without hearing and she didnt give braybridge any chance to protest if people went in the middle of their week what would become of other people she was not going to have the equilibrium of her party disturbed and that was all about it welkin thought it was odd that braybridge didnt insist and he made a long story of it but the grain of wheat in his bushel of chaff was that miss hazelwood seemed to be fascinated by braybridge from the first when mrs welkin scared him into saying that he would stay his week out the business practically was done they went picnicking that day in each others charge and after braybridge left he wrote back to her as mrs welkin knew from the letters that passed through her hands andwell their engagement has come out and wanhope paused with an air that was at first indefinite and then definitive  you dont mean rulledge burst out in a note of deep wrong that thats all you know about it  yes thats all i know wanhope confessed as if somewhat surprised himself at the fact  well  wanhope tried to offer the only reparation in his power i can conjecturewe can all conjecture  he hesitated then well go on with your conjecture rulledge said forgivingly  why wanhope began again but at that moment a man who had been elected the year before and then gone off on a long absence put his head in between the dullred hangings of the doorway it was halson whom i did not know very well but liked better than i knew his eyes were dancing with what seemed the inextinguishable gayety of his temperament rather than any present occasion and his smile carried his little mustache well away from his handsome teeth private  come in come in minver called to him thought you were in japan  my dear fellow halson answered you must brush up your contemporary history its more than a fortnight since i was in japan he shook hands with me and i introduced him to rulledge and wanhope he said at once well what is it question of braybridges engagement its humiliating to a man to come back from the antipodes and find the nation absorbed in a parochial problem like that everybody ive met here tonight has asked me the first thing if id heard of it and if i knew how it could have happened  and do you rulledge asked  i can give a pretty good guess halson said running his merry eyes over our faces  anybody can give a good guess rulledge said wanhope is doing it now  dont let me interrupt halson turned to him politely  not at all id rather hear your guess if you know braybridge better than i wanhope said  well halson compromised perhaps ive known him longer he asked with an effect of coming to business where were you  tell him rulledge minver ordered and rulledge apparently asked nothing better he told him in detail all we knew from any source down to the moment of wanhopes arrested conjecture  he did leave you at an anxious point didnt he halson smiled to the rest of us at rulledges expense and then said well i think i can help you out a little any of you know the lady  by sight minver does rulledge answered for us wants to paint her  of course halson said with intelligence but i doubt if hed find her as paintable as she looks at first shes beautiful but her charm is spiritual  sometimes we try for that the painter interposed  and sometimes you get it but youll allow its difficult thats all i meant ive known herlet me seefor twelve years at least ever since i first went west she was about eleven then and her father was bringing her up on the ranch her aunt came along by and by and took her to europemother dead before hazelwood went out there but the girl was always homesick for the ranch she pined for it and after they had kept her in germany three or four years they let her come back and run wild againwild as a flower does or a vine not a domesticated animal  go slow halson this is getting too much for the romantic rulledge  rulledge can bear up against the facts i guess minver halson said almost austerely her father died two years ago and then she had to come east for her aunt simply wouldnt live on the ranch she brought her on here and brought her out i was at the comingout tea but the girl didnt take to the new york thing at all i could see it from the start she wanted to get away from it with me and talk about the ranch  she felt that she was with the only genuine person among those conventional people  halson laughed at minvers thrust and went on amiably i dont suppose that till she met braybridge she was ever quite at her ease with any manor woman for that matter i imagine as youve done that it was his fear of her that gave her courage she met him on equal terms isnt that it  wanhope assented to the question referred to him with a nod  and when they got lost from the rest of the party at that picnic  lost rulledge demanded  why yes didnt you know but i ought to go back they said there never was anything prettier than the way she unconsciously went for braybridge the whole day she wanted him and she was a child who wanted things frankly when she did want them then his being ten or fifteen years older than she was and so large and simple made it natural for a shy girl like her to assort herself with him when all the rest were assorting themselves as people do at such things the consensus of testimony is that she did it with the most transparent unconsciousness and  who are your authorities minver asked rulledge threw himself back on the divan and beat the cushions with impatience  is it essential to give them  oh no i merely wondered go on  the authorities are all right she had disappeared with him before the others noticed it was a thing that happened there was no design in it that would have been out of character they had got to the end of the woodroad and into the thick of the trees where there wasnt even a trail and they walked round looking for a way out till they were turned completely they decided that the only way was to keep walking and by and by they heard the sound of chopping it was some canucks clearing a piece of the woods and when she spoke to them in french they gave them full directions and braybridge soon found the path again  halson paused and i said but that isnt all  oh no he continued thoughtfully silent for a little while before he resumed the amazing thing is that they got lost again and that when they tried going back to the canucks they couldnt find the way  why didnt they follow the sound of the chopping i asked  the canucks had stopped for the time being besides braybridge was rather ashamed and he thought if they went straight on they would be sure to come out somewhere but that was where he made a mistake they couldnt go on straight they went round and round and came on their own footstepsor hers which he recognized from the narrow tread and the dint of the little heels in the damp places  wanhope roused himself with a kindling eye that is very interesting the movement in a circle of people who have lost their way it has often been observed but i dont know that it has ever been explained sometimes the circle is smaller sometimes it is larger but i believe it is always a circle  isnt it i queried like any other error in life we go round and round and commit the old sins over again  that is very interesting wanhope allowed  but do lost people really always walk in a vicious circle minver asked  rulledge would not let wanhope answer go on halson he said  halson roused himself from the revery in which he was sitting with glazed eyes well what made it a little more anxious was that he had heard of bears on that mountain and the green afternoon light among the trees was perceptibly paling he suggested shouting but she wouldnt let him she said it would be ridiculous if the others heard them and useless if they didnt so they tramped on tilltill the accident happened  the accident rulledge exclaimed in the voice of our joint emotion  he stepped on a loose stone and turned his foot halson explained it wasnt a sprain luckily but it hurt enough he turned so white that she noticed it and asked him what was the matter of course that shut his mouth the closer but it morally doubled his motive and he kept himself from crying out till the sudden pain of the wrench was over he said merely that he thought he had heard something and he had an awful ringing in his ears but he didnt mean that and he started on again the worst was trying to walk without limping and to talk cheerfully and encouragingly with that agony tearing at him but he managed somehow and he was congratulating himself on his success when he tumbled down in a dead faint  oh come now minver protested  it is like an oldfashioned story where things are operated by accident instead of motive isnt it halson smiled with radiant recognition  fact will always imitate fiction if you give her time enough i said  had they got back to the other picnickers rulledge asked with a tense voice  in sound but not in sight of them she wasnt going to bring him into camp in that state besides she couldnt she got some water out of the troutbrook theyd been fishingmore water than trout in itand sprinkled his face and he came to and got on his legs just in time to pull on to the others who were organizing a searchparty to go after them from that point on she dropped braybridge like a hot coal and as there was nothing of the flirt in her she simply kept with the women the older girls and the tabbies and left braybridge to worry along with the secret of his turned ankle he doesnt know how he ever got home alive but he did somehow manage to reach the wagons that had brought them to the edge of the woods and then he was all right till they got to the house but still she said nothing about his accident and he couldnt and he pleaded an early start for town the next morning and got off to bed as soon as he could  i shouldnt have thought he could have stirred in the morning rulledge employed halsons pause to say  well this beaver had to halson said he was not the only early riser he found miss hazelwood at the station before him  what rulledge shouted i confess the fact rather roused me too and wanhopes eyes kindled with a scientific pleasure  she came right towards him mr braybridge says she i couldnt let you go without explaining my very strange behavior i didnt choose to have these people laughing at the notion of my having played the part of your preserver it was bad enough being lost with you i couldnt bring you into ridicule with them by the disproportion theyd have felt in my efforts for you after you turned your foot so i simply had to ignore the incident dont you see braybridge glanced at her and he had never felt so big and bulky before or seen her so slender and little he said it would have seemed rather absurd and he broke out and laughed while she broke down and cried and asked him to forgive her and whether it had hurt him very much and said she knew he could bear to keep it from the others by the way he had kept it from her till he fainted she implied that he was morally as well as physically gigantic and it was as much as he could do to keep from taking her in his arms on the spot  it would have been edifying to the groom that had driven her to the station minver cynically suggested  groom nothing halson returned with spirit she paddled herself across the lake and walked from the boatlanding to the station  jove rulledge exploded in uncontrollable enthusiasm  she turned round as soon as she had got through with her hymn of praiseit made braybridge feel awfully flatand ran back through the bushes to the boatlanding andthat was the last he saw of her till he met her in town this fall  and whenand whendid he offer himself rulledge entreated breathlessly how  yes thats the point halson minver interposed your story is all very well as far as it goes but rulledge here has been insinuating that it was miss hazelwood who made the offer and he wants you to bear him out  rulledge winced at the outrage but he would not stay halsons answer even for the sake of righting himself  i have heard minver went on that braybridge insisted on paddling the canoe back to the other shore for her and that it was on the way that he offered himself we others stared at minver in astonishment halson glanced covertly towards him with his gay eyes then that wasnt true  how did you hear it halson asked  oh never mind is it true  well i know theres that version halson said evasively the engagement is only just out as you know as to the offerthe when and the howi dont know that im exactly at liberty to say  i dont see why minver urged you might stretch a point for rulledges sake  halson looked down and then he glanced at minver after a furtive passage of his eye over rulledges intense face there was something rather nice happened afterbut really now  oh go on minver called out in contempt of his scruple  i havent the rightwell i suppose im on safe ground here it wont go any further of course and it was so pretty after she had pushed off in her canoe you know braybridgehed followed her down to the shore of the lakefound her handkerchief in a bush where it had caught and he held it up and called out to her she looked round and saw it and called back never mind i cant return for it now then braybridge plucked up his courage and asked if he might keep it and she said yes over her shoulder and then she stopped paddling and said no no you mustnt you mustnt you can send it to me he asked where and she said in new yorkin the fallat the walholland braybridge never knew how he dared but he shouted after hershe was paddling on againmay i bring it and she called over her shoulder again without fully facing him but her profile was enough if you cant get any one to bring it for you the words barely reached him but hed have caught them if theyd been whispered and he watched her across the lake and into the bushes and then broke for his train he was just in time  halson beamed for pleasure upon us and even minver said yes thats rather nice after a moment he added rulledge thinks she put it there  youre too bad minver halson protested the charm of the whole thing was her perfect innocence she isnt capable of the slightest finesse ive known her from a child and i know what i say  that innocence of girlhood wanhope said is very interesting its astonishing how much experience it survives some women carry it into old age with them its never been scientifically studied  yes minver allowed there would be a fortune for the novelist who could work a type of innocence for all it was worth heres acton always dealing with the most rancid flirtatiousness and missing the sweetness and beauty of a girlhood which does the cheekiest things without knowing what its about and fetches down its game whenever it shuts its eyes and fires at nothing but i dont see how all this touches the point that rulledge makes or decides which finally made the offer  well hadnt the offer already been made  but how  oh in the usual way  what is the usual way  i thought everybody knew that of course it was from braybridge finally but i suppose its always six of one and half a dozen of the other in these cases isnt it i dare say he couldnt get any one to take her the handkerchief my dinner halson looked up at the silent waiter who had stolen upon us and was bowing towards him  look here halson minver detained him how is it none of the rest of us have heard all those details  i dont know where youve been minver everybody knows the main facts halson said escaping  wanhope observed musingly i suppose hes quite right about the reciprocality of the offer as we call it theres probably in ninetynine cases out of a hundred a perfect understanding before theres an explanation in many cases the offer and the acceptance must really be tacit  yes i ventured and i dont know why were so severe with women when they seem to take the initiative its merely after all the call of the maiden bird and theres nothing lovelier or more endearing in nature than that  maiden bird is good acton minver approved why dont you institute a class of fiction where the lovemaking is all done by the maiden birds as you call themor the widow birds it would be tremendously popular with both sexes it would lift an immense responsibility off the birds whove been expected to shoulder it heretofore if it could be introduced into real life  rulledge fetched a long simplehearted sigh well its a charming story how well he told it  the waiter came again and this time signalled to minver  yes he said as he rose what a pity you cant believe a word halson says  do you mean we began simultaneously  that he built the whole thing from the ground up with the start that we had given him why you poor things who could have told him how it all happened braybridge or the girl as wanhope began by saying people dont speak of their lovemaking even when they distinctly remember it  yes but see here minver rulledge said with a dazed look if its all a fake of his how came you to have heard of braybridge paddling the canoe back for her  that was the fake that tested the fake when he adopted it i knew he was lying because i was lying myself and then the cheapness of the whole thing i wonder that didnt strike you its the stuff that a thousand summergirl stories have been spun out of acton might have thought he was writing it  he went away leaving us to a blank silence till wanhope managed to say that inventive habit of mind is very curious it would be interesting to know just how far it imposes on the inventor himselfhow much he believes of his own fiction  i dont see rulledge said gloomily why theyre so long with my dinner then he burst out i believe every word halson said if theres any fake in the thing its the fake that minver owned to     vii  the chick of the easter egg   the old fellow who told that story of dreamtransference on a sleepingcar at christmastime was again at the club on easter eve halson had put him up for the winter under the easy rule we had and he had taken very naturally to the turkish room for his afterdinner coffee and cigar we all rather liked him though it was minvers pose to be critical of the simple friendliness with which he made himself at home among us and to feign a wish that there were fewer trains between boston and new york so that old newton that was his name could have a better chance of staying away but we noticed that minver was always a willing listener to newtons talk and that he sometimes hospitably offered to share his tobacco with the bostonian when brought to book for his inconsistency by rulledge he said he was merely welcoming the new blood if not young blood that newton was infusing into our body which had grown anaemic on wanhopes psychology and rulledges romance or anyway it was a change  newton now began by saying abruptly in a fashion he had we used to hear a good deal in boston about your easter parade here in new york do you still keep it up  no one else answering minver replied presently i believe it is still going on i understand that its composed mostly of milliners out to see one anothers new hats and generous jewesses who are willing to contribute the dark and bright of the beauty in which they walk to the observance of an alien faith its rather astonishing how the synagogue takes to the feasts of the church if it were not for that i dont know what would become of christmas  what do you mean by their walking in beauty rulledge asked over his shoulder  i shall never have the measure of your ignorance rulledge you dont even know byrons lines on hebrew loveliness      she walks in beauty like the night         of cloudless climes and starry skies       and all thats best of dark and bright         meets in her aspect and her eyes  pretty good rulledge assented and they are splendid sometimes but what has the easter parade got to do with it he asked newton  oh only what everything has with everything else i was thinking of eastertime long ago and far away and naturally i thought of easter now and here i saw your parade once and it seemed to me one of the great social spectacles but you cant keep anything in new york if its good if its bad you can  you come from boston i think you said mr newton minver breathed blandly through his smoke  oh im not a real bostonian our guest replied im not abusing you on behalf of a city that im a native proprietor of if i were i shouldnt perhaps make your decadent easter parade my point of attack though i think its a pity to let it spoil i came from a part of the country where we used to make a great deal of easter when we were boys at least so far as eggs went i dont know whether the grown people observed the day then and i dont know whether the boys keep it now i havent been back at eastertime for several generations but when i was a boy it was a serious thing in that soft southwestern latitude the grass had pretty well greened up by easter even when it came in march and grass colors eggs a very nice yellow it used to worry me that it didnt color them green when the grass hadnt got along far enough winter wheat would do as well i dont remember what color onion husks would give but we used onion husks too some mothers would let the boys get logwood from the drugstore and that made the eggs a fine bold purplish black but the greatest egg of all was a calico egg that you got by coaxing your grandmother your mothers mother or your aunt your mothers sister to sew up in a tight cover of brilliant calico when that was boiled long enough the colors came off in a perfect pattern on the egg very few boys could get such eggs when they did they put them away in bureau drawers till they ripened and the mothers smelt them and threw them out of the window as quickly as possible always after breakfast easter morning we came out on the street and fought eggs we pitted the little ends of the eggs against one another and the fellow whose egg cracked the other fellows egg won it and he carried it off i remember grass and wheat colored eggs in such trials of strength and onion and logwood colored eggs but never calico eggs they were too precious to be risked it would have seemed wicked  i dont know the boston man went musingly on why i should remember these things so relentlessly ive forgotten all the important things that happened to me then but perhaps these were the important things who knows i only know ive always had a soft spot in my heart for easter not so much because of the calico eggs perhaps as because of the grandmothers and the aunts i suppose the simple life is full of such aunts and grandmothers still but you dont find them in hotel apartments or even in flats consisting of seven large light rooms and bath we all recognized the language of the advertisements and laughed in sympathy with our guest who perhaps laughed out of proportion with a pleasantry of that size  when he had subdued his mirth he resumed at a point apparently very remote from that where he had started  there was one of those winters in cambridge where i lived then that seemed tougher than any other we could remember and they were all pretty tough winters there in those times there were forty snowfalls between thanksgiving and fast dayyou dont know what fast day is in new york and we didnt either as far as the fasting wentand the cold kept on and on till we couldnt or said we couldnt stand it any longer so along about the middle of march somewhere we picked up the children and started south in those days new york seemed pretty far south to us and when we got here we found everything on wheels that we had left on runners in boston but the next day it began to snow and we said we must go a little farther to meet the spring i dont know exactly what it was made us pitch on bethlehem pennsylvania but we had a notion we should find it interesting and at any rate a total change from our old environment we had been reading something about the moravians and we knew that it was the capital of moravianism with the largest moravian congregation in the world i think it was longfellows hymn of the moravian nuns that set us to reading about the sect and we had somehow heard that the sun inn at bethlehem was the finest oldfashioned public house anywhere at any rate we had the faith of our youthful years and we put out for bethlehem  we arrived just at dusk but not so late that we couldnt see the hospitable figure of a man coming out of the sun to meet us at the omnibus door and to shake hands with each of us it was the very pleasantest and sweetest welcome we ever had at a public house and though we found the sun a large modern hotel we easily accepted the landlords assurance that the old inn was built up inside of the hotel just as it was when washington stayed in it and after a mighty good supper we went to our rooms which were piping warm from two good baseburner stoves it was not exactly the vernal air we had expected of bethlehem when we left new york but you cant have everything in this world and with the snowbanks along the streets outside we were very glad to have the baseburners  we went to bed pretty early and i fell into one of those exemplary sleeps that begin with no margin of waking after your head touches the pillow or before that even and i woke from a dream of heavenly music that translated itself into the earthly notes of bugles it made me sit up with the instant realization that we had arrived in bethlehem on easter eve and that this was easter morning we had read of the beautiful observance of the feast by the moravians and while i was hurrying on my clothes beside my faithful baseburner i kept quite superfluously wondering at myself for not having thought of it and so made sure of being called i had waked just in time though i hadnt deserved to do so and ought by right to have missed it all i tried to make my wife come with me but after the family is of a certain size a woman if she is a real woman thinks her husband can see things for her and generally sends him out to reconnoitre and report besides my wife couldnt have left the children without waking them to tell them she was going and then all five of them would have wanted to come with us including the baby and we should have had no end of a time convincing them of the impossibility we were a good deal bound up in the children and we hated to lie to them when we could possibly avoid it so i went alone  i asked the night porter who was still on duty the way i wanted to take but there were so many people in the streets going the same direction that i couldnt have missed it anyhow and pretty soon we came to the old moravian cemetery which was in the heart of the town and there we found most of the moravian congregation drawn up on three sides of the square waiting and facing the east which was beginning to redden of all the cemeteries i have seen that was the most beautiful because it was the simplest and humblest generally a cemetery is a dreadful place with headstones and footstones and shafts and tombs scattered about and looking like a field full of granite and marble stumps from the clearing of a petrified forest but here all the memorial tablets lay flat with the earth none of the dead were assumed to be worthier of remembrance than another they all rested at regular intervals with their tablets on their breasts like shields in their sleep after the battle of life i was thinking how right and wise this was and feeling the purity of the conception like a quality of the keen clear air of the morning which seemed to be breathing straight from the sky when suddenly the sun blazed up from the horizon like a fire and the instant it appeared the horns of the band began to blow and the people burst into a hymna thousand voices for all i know it was the sublimest thing i ever heard and i dont know that theres anything to match it for dignity and solemnity in any religious rite it made the tears come for i thought how those people were of a church of missionaries and martyrs from the beginning and i felt as if i were standing in sight and hearing of the first christians after christ it was as if he were risen there in the midst of them  rulledge looked round on the rest of us with an air of acquiring merit from the bostonians poetry but minvers gravity was proof against the chance of mocking rulledge and i think we all felt alike wanhope seemed especially interested though he said nothing  when i went home i told my wife about it as well as i could but though she entered into the spirit of it she was rather preoccupied the children had all wakened as they did sometimes in a body and were storming joyfully around the rooms as if it were christmas and she was trying to get them dressed do tell them what easter is like theyve never seen it kept before she said and i tried to do so while i took a hand as a young father will and tried to get them into their clothes i dont think i dwelt much on the religious observance of the day but i dug up some of my profane associations with it in early life and told them about coloring eggs and fighting them and all that there in new england in those days they had never seen or heard of such a thing as an easter egg  i dont think my reminiscences quieted them much they were all on firethe oldest hoy and girl and the twins and even the twoyearold that we called the babyto go out and buy some eggs and get the landlord to let them color them in the hotel kitchen i had a deal of ado to make them wait till after breakfast but i managed somehow and when we had finishedit was a mighty good pennsylvania breakfast such as we could eat with impunity in those halcyon days rich coffee steak sausage eggs applebutter buckwheat cakes and maple syrupwe got their outdoor togs on them while they were all stamping and shouting round and had to be caught and overcoated and furcapped and hooded simultaneously and managed to get them into the street together ever been in bethlehem  we all had to own our neglect of this piece of travel and newton after a moment of silent forgiveness said  well i dont know how it is now but twentyfive or thirty years ago it was the most interesting town in america it wasnt the old moravian community that it had been twentyfive years before that when none but moravians could buy property there but it was like the sun hotel and just as that had grown round and over the old sun inn the prosperous manufacturing town with its ironfoundries and zincfoundries and all the rest of it had grown round and over the original moravian village if you wanted a breath of perfect strangeness with an american quality in it at the same time you couldnt have gone to any place where you could have had it on such terms as you could in bethlehem i cant begin to go into details but one thing was hearing german spoken everywhere in the street not the german of germany but the pennsylvania german with its broad vowels and brokendown grammatical forms and its english vocables and interjections which you caught in the sentences which came to you like av coorse and yes and no for ja and nein there were stores where they spoke no english and others where they made a specialty of it and i suppose when we sallied out that bright sunday morning with the baby holding onto a hand of each of us between us and the twins going in front with their brother and sister we were almost as foreign as we should have been in a village on the rhine or the elbe  we got a little acquainted with the people after awhile and i heard some stories of the country folks that i thought were pretty good one was about an old german farmer on whose land a prospecting metallurgist found zinc ore the scientific man brought him the bright yellow button by which the zinc proved its existence in its union with copper and the old fellow asked in an awestricken whisper is it a goldmine no no guess again then its a brassmine but before they began to find zinc there in the lovely lehigh valleyyou can stand by an open zincmine and look down into it where the rock and earth are left standing and you seem to be looking down into a range of sharp mountain peaks and pinnaclesit was the richest farming region in the whole fat state of pennsylvania and there was a young farmer who owned a vast tract of it and who went to fetch home a young wife from philadelphia way somewhere he drove there and back in his own buggy and when he reached the top overlooking the valley with his bride he stopped his horse and pointed with his whip there he said as far as the sky is blue its all ours i thought that was fine  fine i couldnt help bursting out its a stroke of poetry  minver cut in the thrifty acton making a note of it for future use in literature  eh newton queried oh i dont mind youre welcome to it mr acton its a pity somebody shouldnt use it and of course i cant  acton will send you a copy with the usual fortypercent discount and ten off for cash the painter said  they had their little laugh at my expense and then newton took up his tale again well as i was sayingby the way what was i saying  the storyloving rulledge remembered you went out with your wife and children for easter eggs  oh yes thank you well of course in a town geographically american the shops were all shut on sunday and we couldnt buy even an easter egg on easter sunday but one of the stores had the shade of its showwindow up and the children simply glued themselves to it in such a fascination that we could hardly unstick them that window was full of all kinds of easter thingsi dont remember what all but there were easter eggs in every imaginable color and pattern and besides these there were whole troops of toy rabbits i had forgotten that the natural offspring of easter eggs is rabbits but i took a brace and remembered the fact and announced it to the children they immediately demanded an explanation with all sorts of scientific particulars which i gave them as reckless of the truth as i thought my wife would suffer without contradicting me i had to say that while easter eggs mostly hatched rabbits there were instances in which they hatched other things as for instance handfuls of eagles and halfeagles and doubleeagles especially in the case of the golden eggs that the goose laid they knew all about that goose but i had to tell them what those unfamiliar pieces of american coinage were and promise to give them one each when they grew up if they were good that only partially satisfied them and they wanted to know specifically what other kinds of things easter eggs would hatch if properly treated each one had a preference the baby always preferred what the last one said and she wanted an ostrich the same as her big brother he was seven then  i dont really know how we lived through the day i mean the children for my wife and i went to the moravian church and had a good long sunday nap in the afternoon while the children were pining for monday morning when they could buy eggs and begin to color them so that they could hatch just the right kind of easter things when i woke up i had to fall in with a theory they had agreed to between them that any kind of twolegged or fourlegged chick that hatched from an easter egg would wear the same color or the same kind of spots or stripes that the egg had  i found that they had arranged to have calico eggs and they were going to have their mother cover them with the same sort of cotton prints that i had said my grandmother and aunts used and they meant to buy the calico in the morning at the same time that they bought the eggs we had some tin vessels of water on our stoves to take the dryness out of the hot air and they had decided that they would boil their eggs in these and not trouble the landlord for the use of his kitchen  there was nothing in this scheme wanting but their mothers consenti agreed to it on the spotbut when she understood that they each expected to have two eggs apiece with one apiece for us she said she never could cover a dozen eggs in the world and that the only way would be for them to go in the morning with us and choose each the handsomest egg they could out of the eggs in that shopwindow they met this proposition rather blankly at first but on reflection the big brother said it would be a shame to spoil mammas easter by making her work all day and besides it would keep till that night anyway before they could begin to have any fun with their eggs and then the rest all said the same thing ending with the baby and accepted the inevitable with joy and set about living through the day as well as they could  they had us up pretty early the next morningthat is they had me up their mother said that i had brought it on myself and richly deserved it for exciting their imaginations and i had to go out with the two oldest and the twins to choose the eggs we got off from the baby by promising to let her have two and she didnt understand very well anyway and was awfully sleepy we were a pretty long time choosing the six eggs and i dont remember now just what they were but they were certainly joyous eggs andby the way i dont know why im boring a brand of hardened bachelors like you with all these domestic details  oh dont mind us minver responded to his general appeal we may not understand the feelings of a father but we are all mothers at heart especially rulledge go on its very exciting he urged not very ironically and newton went on  well i dont believe i could say just how the havoc began they put away their eggs very carefully after they had made their mother admire them and shown the baby how hers were the prettiest and they each said in succession that they must be very precious of them for if you shook an egg or anything it wouldnt hatch and it was their plan to take these home and set an unemployed pullet belonging to the big brother to hatching them in the coop that he had built of laths for her in the back yard with his own hands but long before the afternoon was over the evil one had entered eden and tempted the boy to try fighting eggs with these treasured specimens as i had told we boys used to fight eggs in my town in the southwest he held a conquering course through the encounter with three eggs but met his waterloo with a regular blücher belonging to the baby then he instantly changed sides and smashed his blücher against the last egg left by that time all the other children were in tears the baby roaring powerfully in ignorant sympathy and the victor steeped in silent gloom his mother made him gather up the ruins from the floor and put them in the stove and she took possession of the victorious egg and said she would keep it till we got back to cambridge herself and not let one of them touch it i can tell you it was a tragical time i wanted to go out and buy them another set of eggs and spring them for a surprise on them in the morning after they had suffered enough that night but she said that if i dared to dream of such a thingwhich would be the ruin of the childrens character by taking away the consequences of their follyshe should do she did not know what to me of course she was right and i gave in and helped the children forget all about it so that by the time we got back to cambridge i had forgotten about it myself  i dont know what it was reminded the boy of that remaining easter egg unless it was the sight of the unemployed pullet in her coop which he visited the first thing and i dont know how he managed to wheedle his mother out of it but the first night after i came home from businessit was rather late and the children had gone to bedshe told me that ridiculous boy as she called him in selfexculpation had actually put the egg under his pullet and all the children were wild to see what it would hatch and now she said severely what are you going to do you have filled their heads with those ideas and i suppose you will have to invent some nonsense or other to fool them and make them believe that it has hatched a giraffe or an elephant or something they wont be satisfied with anything less i said we should have to try something smaller for i didnt think we could manage a chick of that size on our lot and that i should trust in providence then she said it was all very well to laugh and that i couldnt get out of it that way and i neednt think it  i didnt much but the children understood that it took three weeks for an egg to hatch and anyway the pullet was so intermittent in her attentions to the easter egg only sitting on it at night or when held down by hand in the day that there was plenty of time one evening when i came out from boston i was met by a doleful deputation at the front gate with the news that when the coop was visited that morning after breakfastthey visited the coop every morning before they went to schoolthe pullet was found perched on a crossbar in a high state of nerves and the shell of the easter egg broken and entirely eaten out probably a rat had got in and done it or more hopefully a mink such as used to attack eggs in the town where i was a boy we went out and viewed the wreck as a first step towards a better situation and suddenly a thought struck me children i said what did you really expect that egg to hatch anyway they looked askance at one another and at last the boy said well you know papa an egg thats been cooked and then we all laughed together and i knew they had been making believe as much as i had and no more expected the impossible of a boiled egg than i did  that was charming wanhope broke out there is nothing more interesting than the way children join in hypnotizing themselves with the illusions which their parents think they have created without their help in fact it is very doubtful whether at any age we have any illusions except those of our own creation we  let him go on wanhope minver dictated and newton continued  it was rather nice i asked them if their mother knew about the egg and they said that of course they couldnt help telling her and i said well then ill tell you what we must make her believe that the chick hatched out and got away the boy stopped me do you think that would be exactly true papa well not exactly true but its only for the time being we can tell her the exact truth afterwards and then i laid my plan before them they said it was perfectly splendid and would be the greatest kind of joke on mamma and one that she would like as much as anybody the thing was to keep it from her till it was done and they all promised that they wouldnt tell but i could see that they were bursting with the secret the whole evening  the next day was saturday when i always went home early and i had the two oldest children come in with the secondgirl who left them to take lunch with me they had chocolate and icecream and after lunch we went around to a milliners shop in west street where my wife and i had stopped a long five minutes the week before we went to bethlehem adoring an easter bonnet that we saw in the window i wanted her to buy it but she said no if we were going that expensive journey we couldnt afford it and she must do without that spring i showed it to them and now children i said what do you think of that for the chick that your easter egg hatched and they said it was the most beautiful bonnet they had ever seen and it would just exactly suit mamma but i saw they were holding something back and i said sharply well and they both guiltily faltered out the bird you know papa and i remembered that they belonged to the society of bird defenders who in that day were pledged against the decorative use of dead birds or killing them for anything but food why confound it i said the bird is the very thing that makes it an easteregg chick but i saw that their honest little hearts were troubled and i said again confound it lets go in and hear what the milliner has to say well the long and short of it was that the milliner tried a bunch of forgetmenots over the bluebird that we all agreed was a thousand times better and that if it were substituted would only cost three dollars more and we took our easteregg chick home in a blaze of glory the children carrying the bandbox by the string between them  of course we had a great time opening it and their mother acted her part so well that i knew she was acting and after the little ones were in bed i taxed her with it know of course i knew she said did you think they would let you deceive me theyre true newenglanders and they told me all about it last night when i was saying their prayers with them well i said they let you deceive me they must be true westerners too for they didnt tell me a word of your knowing i rather had her there but she said oh you goose we were young people in those days and goose meant everything but really im ashamed of getting off all this to you hardened bachelors as i said before  if you tell many more such stories in this club minver said severely you wont leave a bachelor in it and rulledge will be the first to get married     the end
