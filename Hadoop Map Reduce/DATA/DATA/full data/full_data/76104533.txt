                                   lyrical poems                                           they told me   they told me pan was dead but i   oft marvelled who it was that sang down the green valleys languidly   where the grey elderthickets hang  sometimes i thought it was a bird   my soul had charged with sorcery sometimes it seemed my own heart heard   inland the sorrow of the sea  but even where the primrose sets   the seal of her pale loveliness i found amid the violets   tears of an antique bitterness     sorcery   what voice is that i hear   crying across the pool it is the voice of pan you hear crying his sorceries shrill and clear   in the twilight dim and cool   what song is it he sings   echoing from afar while the sweet swallow bends her wings filling the air with twitterings   beneath the brightening star  the woodman answered me   his faggot on his back seek not the face of pan to see flee from his clear note summoning thee   to darkness deep and black   he dwells in thickest shade   piping his notes forlorn of sorrow never to be allayed turn from his coverts sad   of twilight unto morn  the woodman passed away   along the forest path his ax shone keen and grey in the last beams of day   and all was still as death  only pan singing sweet   out of earths fragrant shade i dreamed his eyes to meet and found but shadow laid   before my tired feet  comes no more dawn to me   nor bird of open skies only his woods deep gloom i see   till at the end of all shall rise afar and tranquilly deaths stretching sea     the children of stare     winter is fallen early   on the house of stare birds in reverberating flocks   haunt its ancestral box   bright are the plenteous berries   in clusters in the air    still is the fountains music   the dark pool icy still whereupon a small and sanguine sun   floats in a mirror on   into a west of crimson   from a south of daffodil    tis strange to see young children   in such a wintry house like rabbits on the frozen snow   their telltale footprints go   their laughter rings like timbrels   neath evening ominous    their small and heightened faces   like winered winter buds their frolic bodies gentle as   flakes in the air that pass   frail as the twirling petal   from the briar of the woods    above them silence lours   still as an arctic sea light fails night falls the wintry moon   glitters the crocus soon   will ope grey and distracted   on earths austerity    thick mystery wild peril   law like an iron rod yet sport they on in springs attire   each with his tiny fire   blown to a core of ardour   by the awful breath of god     age   this ugly old crone every beauty she had when a maid when a maid her beautiful eyes too youthful too wise seemed ever to come to so lightless a home cold and dull as a stone and her cheekswho would guess cheeks cadaverous as this once with colours were gay as the flower on its spray who would ever believe aught could bring one to grieve so much as to make lips bent for loves sake so thin and so grey o youth come away as she asks in her lone this old desolate crone she loves us no more she is too old to care for the charms that of yore made her body so fair past repining past care she lives but to bear one or two fleeting years earths indifference her tears have lost now their heat her hands and her feet now shake but to be shed as leaves from a tree and her poor heart beats on like a seathe storm gone     the glimpse   art thou asleep or have thy wings wearied of my unchanging skies or haply is it fading dreams     are in my eyes  not even an echo in my heart tells me the courts thy feet trod last bare as a leafless wood it is     the summer past  my inmost mind is like a book the reader dulls with lassitude wherein the same old lovely words     sound poor and rude  yet through this vapid surface i seem to see oldtime deeps i see past the dark painting of the hour     lifes ecstasy  only a moment as when day is set and in the shade of night through all the clouds that compassed her     stoops into sight  pale changeless everlasting dian gleams on the prone endymion troubles the dulness of his dreams     and then is gone     remembrance   the sky was like a waterdrop   in shadow of a thorn clear tranquil beautiful   dark forlorn  lightning along its margin ran   a rumour of the sea rose in profundity and sank   into infinity  lofty and few the elms the stars   in the vast boughs most bright i stood a dreamer in a dream   in the unstirring night  not wonder worship not even peace   seemed in my heart to be only the memory of one   of all most dead to me     treachery   she had amid her ringlets bound green leaves to rival their dark hue how could such locks with beauty bound       dry up their dew     wither them through and through  she had within her dark eyes lit sweet fires to burn all doubt away yet did those fires in darkness lit       burn but a day     not even till twilight stay  she had within a dusk of words a vow in simple splendour set how in the memory of such words       could she forget     that vowthe soul of it     in vain   i knocked upon thy door ajar while yet the woods with buds were grey nought but a little child i heard     warbling at break of day  i knocked when june had lured her rose to mask the sharpness of its thorn knocked yet again heard only yet     thee singing of the morn  the frail convolvulus had wreathed its cup but the faint flush of eve lingered upon thy western wall     thou hadst no word to give  once yet i came the winter stars above thy house wheeled wildly bright footsore i stood before thy door     wide open into night     the miracle   who beckons the green ivy up   its solitary tower of stone what spirit lures the bindweeds cup       unfaltering on calls even the starry lichen to climb by agelong inches endless time  who bids the hollyhock uplift   her rod of fastsealed buds on high fling wide her petalssilent swift       lovely to the sky since as she kindled so she will fade flower above flower in squalor laid  ever the heavy billow rears   all its sealength in green hushed wall but totters as the shore it nears       foams to its fall where was its mark on what vain quest rose that great water from its rest  so creeps ambition on so climb   mans vaunting thoughts he set on high forgets his birth small space brief time       that he shall die dreams blindly in his dark still air consumes his strength strips himself bare  rejects delight ease pleasure hope   seeking in vain but seeking yet past earthly promise earthly scope       on one aim set as if like chaucers child he thought all but o alma nought     keep innocency   like an old battle youth is wild with bugle and spear and counter cry fanfare and drummery yet a child dreaming of that sweet chivalry the piercing terror cannot see  he with a mild and serious eye along the azure of the years sees the sweet pomp sweep hurtling by but he sees not deaths blood and tears sees not the plunging of the spears  and all the strident horror of horse and rider in red defeat is only music fine enough to lull him into slumber sweet in fields where ewe and lambkin bleat  o if with such simplicity himself take arms and suffer war with beams his targe shall gilded be though in the thickening gloom be far the steadfast light of any star  though hoarse wars eagle on him perch quickened with guilty lightningsthere it shall in vain for terror search where a childs eyes beneath bloody hair gaze purely through the dingy air  and when the wheeling rout is spent though in the heaps of slain he lie or lonely in his last content quenchless shall burn in secrecy the flame death knows his victors by     the phantom   wilt thou never come again beauteous one yet the woods are green and dim yet the birds deluding cry echoes in the hollow sky yet the falling waters brim the clear pool which thou wast fain to paint thy lovely cheek upon     beauteous one  i may see the thorny rose     stir and wake the dark dewdrop on her gold but thy secret will she keep halfdivulgedyet all untold since a childs heart woke from sleep  the faltering sunbeam fades and goes the nightbird whistles in the brake     the willows quake utter darkness walls the wind     sighs no more yet it seems the silence yearns but to catch thy fleeting foot yet the wandering glowworm burns lest her lamp should light thee not thee whom i shall never find though thy shadow lean before thou thyself returnst no more     never more  all the worlds woods tree oer tree     come to nought birds flowers beasts how transient they angels of a flying day love is quenched dreams drown in sleep ruin nods along the deep only thou immortally     hauntest on this poor earth in times flux caught hauntest on pursued unwon phantom child of memory     beauteous one     voices   who is it calling by the darkened river   where the moss lies smooth and deep and the dark trees lean unmoving arms   silent and vague in sleep and the brightheeled constellations pass   in splendour through the gloom who is it calling oer the darkened river       in music come  who is it wandering in the summer meadows   where the children stoop and play in the green faintscented flowers spinning   the guileless hours away who touches their bright hair who puts   a windshell to each cheek whispering betwixt its breathing silences       seek seek  who is it watching in the gathering twilight   when the curfew bird hath flown on eager wings from song to silence   to its darkened nest alone who takes for brightening eyes the stars   for locks the still moonbeam sighs through the dews of evening peacefully       falling dream     thule   if thou art sweet as they are sad   who on the shores of times salt sea watch on the dim horizon fade   ships bearing love to night and thee  if past all beacons hope hath lit   in the dark wanderings of the deep they who unwilling traverse it   dream not till dawn unseal their sleep  ah cease not in thy winds to mock   us who yet wake but cannot see thy distant shores who at each shock   of the waves onset faint for thee     the birthnight to f   dearest it was a night that in its darkness rocked orions stars a sighing wind ran faintly white along the willows and the cedar boughs laid their wide hands in stealthy peace across the starry silence of their antique moss no sound save rushing air cold yet all sweet with spring and in thy mothers arms couched weeping there     thou lovely thing     the deathdream   who now put dreams into thy slumbering mind who with bright fears lean taper crossed a hand athwart its beam and stooping truth maligned spake so thy spirit speech should understand and with a dread hes dead awaked a peal of frenzied bells along the vacant ways of thy poor earthly heart waked thee to steal like dawn distraught upon unhappy days to prove nought nothing was it times large voice out of the inscrutable future whispered so or but the horror of a little noise earth wakes at dead of night or does love know when his sweet wings weary and droop and even in sleep cries audibly a shrill remorse or haply was it i who out of dream stole but a little where shadows course called back to thee across the eternal stream     where is thy victory   none none can tell where i shall be when the unclean earth covers me only in surety if thou cry where my perplexed ashes lie know tis but deaths necessity that keeps my tongue from answering thee  even if no more my shadow may lean for a moment in thy day no more the whole earth lighten as if thou near it had nought else to give surely tis but heavens strategy to prove death immortality  yet should i sleepand no more dream sad would the last awakening seem if my cold heart with love once hot had thee in sleep remembered not how could i wake to find that i had slept alone yet easefully  or should in sleep glad visions come sick in an alien land for home would be my eyes in their bright beam awake we know tis not a dream asleep some devil in the mind might truest thoughts with false enwind  life is a mockery if death have the least power men say it hath as to a hound that mewing waits death opens and shuts to his gates else even dry bones might rise and say tis ye are dead and laid away  innocent children out of nought build up a universe of thought and out of silence fashion heaven so dear is this poor dying even seeing thou shall be touched heard seen better than when dust stood between     foreboding   thou canst not see him standing by timewith a poppied hand stealing thy youths simplicity even as falls unceasingly     his waning sand  he will pluck thy childish roses as     summer from her bush strips all the loveliness that was even to the silence evening has     thy laughter hush  thy locks too faint for earthly gold     the meekness of thine eyes he will darken and dim and to his fold drive gainst the night thy stainless old     innocencies  thy simple words confuse and mar     thy tenderest thoughts delude draw a long cloud athwart thy star still with loud timbrels heavens far     faint interlude  thou canst not see i see dearest     o then yet patient be though love refuse thy heart all rest though even love wax angry lest     love should lose thee     vain finding   ever before my face there went   betwixt earths buds and me a beauty beyond earths content   a hopehalf memory till in the woods one evening   ah eyes as dark as they fastened on mine unwontedly   grey and dear heart how grey     napoleon   what is the world o soldiers it is i i this incessant snow   this northern sky soldiers this solitude   through which we go       is i     england   no lovelier hills than thine have laid   my tired thoughts to rest no peace of lovelier valleys made   like peace within my breast  thine are the woods whereto my soul   out of the noontide beam flees for a refuge green and cool   and tranquil as a dream  thy breaking seas like trumpets peal   thy cloudshow oft have i watched their bright towers of silence steal   into infinity  my heart within me faults to roam   in thought even far from thee thine be the grave whereto i come   and thine my darkness be     truce   far inland here deaths pinions mocked the roar     of english seas we sleep to wake no more     hushed and at ease till sound a trump shore on to echoing shore rouse from a peace unwonted then to war     us and our enemies     evening   when twilight darkens and one by one the sweet birds to their nests have gone when to green banks the glowworms bring pale lamps to brighten evening then stirs in his thick sleep the owl through the dewy air to prowl  hawking the meadows swiftly he flits while the small mouse atrembling sits with tiny eye of fear upcast until his brooding shape be past hiding her where the moonbeams beat casting black shadows in the wheat  now all is still the fieldman is lapped deep in slumbering silentness not a leaf stirs but clouds on high pass in dim flocks across the sky puffed by a breeze too light to move aught but these wakeful sheep above  o what an arch of light now spans these fields by night no longer mans their ancient master is abroad walking beneath the moonlight cold his presence is the stillness he fills earth with wonder and mystery     night   all from the light of the sweet moon     tired men lie now abed actionless full of visions soon     vanishing soon sped  the starry night aflock with beams     of crystal light scarce stirs only its birdsthe cocks the streams     call neath heavens wanderers  all silent all hearts still     love cunning fire fallen low when faint morn straying on the hill     sighs and his soft airs flow     the universe   i heard a little child beneath the stars     talk as he ran along to some sweet riddle in his mind that seemed     atiptoe into song  in his dark eyes lay a wild universe     wild forests peaks and crests angels and fairies giants wolves and he     were that worlds only guests  elsewhere was home and mother his warm bed     now only god alone could armed with all his power and wisdom make     earths richer than his own  o manthy dreams thy passions hopes desires     he in his pity keep a homely bed where love may lull a childs     fond universe asleep     gloria mundi   upon a bank easeless with knobs of gold   beneath a canopy of noonday smoke i saw a measureless beast morose and bold   with eyes like one from filthy dreams awoke who stares upon the daylight in despair for very terror of the nothing there  this beast in one flat hand clutched vulturewise   a glittering image of itself in jet and with the other groped about its eyes   to drive away the dreams that pestered it and never ceased its coils to toss and beat the mire encumbering its feeble feet  sharp was its hunger though continually   it seemed a cud of stones to ruminate and often like a dog let glittering lie   this meatless fare its foolish gaze to sate once more convulsively to stoop its jaw or seize the morsel with an envious paw  indeed it seemed a hidden enemy   must lurk within the clouds above that bank it strained so wildly its pale stubborn eye   to pierce its own foul vapours dim and dank till wearied out it raved in wrath and foam daring that nought invisible to come  ay and it seemed some strange delight to find   in this unmeaning din till suddenly as if it heard a rumour on the wind   or far away its freer children cry lifting its face madequiet there it stayed till died the echo its own rage had made  that place alone was barren where it lay   flowers bloomed beyond utterly sweet and fair and even its own dull heart might think to stay   in livelong thirst of a clear river there flowing from unseen hills to unheard seas through a still vale of yew and almond trees  and then i spied in the lush green below   its tortured belly one like silver pale with fingers closed upon a rope of straw   that bound the beast squat neck to hoary tail lonely in all that verdure faint and deep he watched the monster as a shepherd sheep  i marvelled at the power strength and rage   of this poor creature in such slavery bound tettered with worms of fear forlorn with age   its blue wingstumps stretched helpless on the ground while twilight faded into darkness deep and he who watched it piped its pangs asleep     idleness   i saw old idleness fat with great cheeks puffed to the huge circumference of a sigh but past all tinge of apples long ago his boyish fingers twiddled up and down the filthy remnant of a cup of physic that thicked in odour all the while he stayed his eyes were sad as fishes that swim up and stare upon an element not theirs through a thin skin of shrewish water then turn on a languid fin and dip down down into unplumbed vast oozy deeps of dream his stomach was his master and proclaimed it and never were such meagre puppets made the slaves of such a tyrant as his thoughts of that obese epitome of ills trussed up he sat the mockery of himself and when upon the wan green of his eye i marked the gathering lustre of a tear thought i myself must weep until i caught a grey smug smile of satisfaction smirch his pallid features at his misery and laugh did i to see the little snares he had set for pests to vex him his great feet prisoned in greater boots so narrow a stool to seat such elephantine parts as his ay and the book he read a hebrew bible and to incite a gross and backward wit an old crabbed wormed greek dictionary and a foxy ovid bound in dappled calf     goliath   still as a mountain with dark pines and sun he stood between the armies and his shout rolled from the empyrean above the host bid any little flea ye have come forth and wince at death upon my fingernail he turned his largeboned face and all his steel tossed into beams the lustre of the noon and all the shaggy horror of his locks rustled like locusts in a field of corn the meagre pupil of his shameless eye moved like a cormorant over a glassy sea he stretched his limbs and laughed into the air to feel the groaning sinews of his breast and the long gush of his swollen arteries pause and nodding wheeled towering in all his height then like a wind that hushes gazed and saw down down far down upon the untroubled green a shepherdboy that swung a little sling goliath shut his lids to drive that mote which vexed the eastern azure of his eye out of his vision and stared down again yet stood the youth there ruddy in the flare of his vast shield nor spake nor quailed gazed up as one might scan a mountain to be scaled then as it were a voice unearthly still cried in the cavern of his bristling ear his name is death  and like the flush that dyes sahara to its lifeless verge his brows bright brass flamed into sudden crimson and his great spear leapt upward lightninglike shaking a dreadful thunder in the air spun betwixt earth and sky bright as a berg that hoards the sunlight in a myriad spires crashed and struck echo through an armys heart then paused goliath and stared down again and fleetfoot fear from rolling orbs perceived steadfast unharmed a stooping shepherdboy frowning upon the target of his face and wrath tossed suddenly up once more his hand and a deep groan grieved all his strength in him he breathed and lost in dazzling darkness prayed besought his reins his gloating gods his youth and turned to smite what he no more could see then sped the singing pebblemessenger the chosen of the lord from israels brooks fleet to its mark and hollowed a light path down to the appalling babel of his brain and like the smoke of dreaming souffri√®re dust rose in cloud spread wide slow silted down softly all softly on his armours blaze                                          characters from shakespeare                                           falstaff   twas in a tavern that with old age stooped and leaned rheumatic rafters oer his head a blowzed prodigious man which talked and stared and rolled as if with purpose a small eye like a sweet cupid in a cask of wine i could not view his fatness for his soul which peeped like harmless lightnings and was gone as haps to voyagers of the summer air and when he laughed time trickled down those beams as in a glass and when in selfdefence he puffed that paunch and wagged that huge greek head nosed like a punchinello then it seemed an hundred widows swept in his small voice now tenor and now bass of drummy war he smiled compact of loam this orchard man mused like a midnight webbed with moonbeam snares of flitting love wokeand a king he stood whom all the world hath in sheer jest refused for helpless laughters sake and then forfend bacchus and jove reared vast olympus there and pan leaned leering from promethean eyes lord sighed his aspect weeping oer the jest what simple mouse brought such a mountain forth     macbeth   rose like dim battlements the hills and reared steep crags into the fading primrose sky but in the desolate valleys fell small rain mingled with drifting cloud i saw one come like the fierce passion of that vacant place his face turned glittering to the evening sky his eyes like grey despair fixed satelessly on the still rainy turrets of the storm and all his armour in a haze of blue he held no sword bare was his hand and clenched as if to hide the inextinguishable blood murder had painted there and his wild mouth seemed spouting echoes of deluded thoughts around his head like vipers all distort his locks shook heavyladen at each stride if fire may burn invisible to the eye o if despair strive everlastingly then haunted here the creature of despair fanning and fanning flame to lick upon a soul still childish in a blackened hell     banquo   what dost thou here far from thy native place what piercing influences of heaven have stirred thy hearts last mansion allcorruptible to wake to move and in the sweets of wine and fire sit tempting madness with unholy eyes begone thou shuddering pale anomaly the dark presses without on yew and thorn stoops now the owl upon her lonely quest the pomp runs high here and our beauteous women seek no cold witnesso let murder cry too shrill for human ear only to god come not in power to wreak so wild a vengeance thou knowest not now the limit of mans heart he is beyond thy knowledge gaze not then horror enthroned lit with insanest light     mercutio   along an avenue of almondtrees came three girls chattering of their sweethearts three and lo mercutio with byronic ease out of his philosophic eye cast all a mere flowered twig of thought whereat three hearts fell still as when an air dies out and venus falters lonely oer the sea but when within the further mist of bloom his step and form

pattern of small leaves espalier in a fading summer air and there ophelia walks an azure flower whom wind and snowflakes and the sudden rain of loves wild skies have purified to heaven there is a beauty past all weeping now in that sweet crooked mouth that vacant smile only a lonely grey in those mad eyes which never on earth shall learn their loneliness and when amid startled birds she sings lament mocking in hope the long voice of the stream it seems her hearts lute hath a broken string ivy she hath that to old ruin clings and rosemary that sees remembrance fade and pansies deeper than the gloom of dreams but ah if utterable would this earth remain the base unreal thing it is better be out of sight of peering eyes outout of hearing of alluseless words spoken of tedious tongues in heedless ears and lest at last the world should learn heartsecrets lest that sweet wolf from some dim thicket steal better the glassy horror of the stream     hamlet   umbrageous cedars murmuring symphonies stooped in late twilight oer dark denmarks prince he sat his eyes companioned with dream lustrous large eyes that held the world in view as some entranc√®d childs a puppet show darkness gave birth to the alltrembling stars and a far roar of longdrawn cataracts flooding immeasurable night with sound he sat so still his very thoughts took wing and lightest ariels the stillness haunted with midgelike measures but at last even they sank neath the influences of his night the sweet dust shed faint perfume in the gloom through all wild space the stars bright arrows fell on the lone princethe troubled son of man on times dark waters in unearthly trouble then as the roar increased and one fair tower of cloud took sky and stars with majesty he rose his face a parchment of old age

alas   from peering close where very little was in dens secluded from the open skies  but poetry in bravery went down   and called his name soft clear and fearlessly stooped low and stroked his muzzle overgrown refreshed his drought with dew wiped pure and free   his eyes and lo laughed loud for joy to see in those grey deeps the azure of her own     april   come then with showers i love thy cloudy face   gilded with splendour of the sunbeam thro   the heedless glory of thy locks i know the arch sweet languor of thy fleeting grace the windy lovebeams of thy dwellingplace   thy dim dells where in azure bluebells blow   the brimming rivers where thy lightnings go harmless and full and swift from race to race  thou takest all young hearts captive with thine eyes   at rumour of thee the tongues of children ring louder than bees the golden poplars rise   like trumps of peace and birds on homeward wing fly mocking echoes shrill along the skies   above the waves grave diapasoning     seamagic

her gilded weathercocks on roof and spire   exulting eastward in the western fire all things recall one heartsick memory  ever the rustle of the advancing foam   the surges desolate thunder and the cry   as of some lone babe in the whispering sky ever i peer into the restless gloom   to where a ship clad dim and loftily looms steadfast in the wonder of her home     the marketplace   my mind is like a clamorous marketplace   all day in wind rain sun its babel wells   voice answering to voice in tumult swells chaffering and laughing pushing for a place my thoughts haste on gay strange poor simple base   this one buys dust and that a bauble sells   but none to any scrutiny hints or tells the haunting secrets hidden in each sad face  dies down the clamour when the dark draws near   strange looms the earth in twilight of the west lonely with one sweet star serene and clear   dwelling when all this place is hushed to rest   on vacant stall gold refuse worst and best abandoned utterly in haste and fear     anatomy   by chance my fingers resting on my face   stayed suddenly where in its orbit shone   the lamp of all things beautiful then on following more heedfully did softly trace each arch and prominence and hollow place   that shall revealed be when all else is gone   warmth colour roundnessto oblivion and nothing left but darkness and disgrace  life like a moment passed seemed then to be   a transient dream this raiment that it wore while spelled my hand out its mortality   made certain all that had seemed doubt before provedo how vaguely yet how lucidly   how much death does and yet can do no more     even in the grave   i laid my inventory at the hand   of death who in his gloomy arbour sate   and while he conned it sweet and desolate i heard love singing in that quiet land he read the record even to the end   the heedless livelong injuries of fate   the burden of foe the burden of love and hate the wounds of foe the bitter wounds of friend  all all he read ay even the indifference   the vain talk vainer silence hope and dream he questioned me what seekst thou then instead   i bowed my face in the pale evening gleam then gazed he on me with strange innocence even in the grave thou wilt have thyself he said     bright life   come now i said put off these webs of death   distract this leaden yearning of thine eyes   from

keen without avail till swam my uncontented blade   with ichor green and pale  and silence fell the rushing sun   stood still in paths of heat gazing in waves of horror on   the dead about my feet  never a whir of wing no bee   stirred oer the shameful slain nought but a thirsty wasp crept in   stooped and came out again  the very air trembled in fear   eclipsing shadow seemed rising in crimson waves of gloom   on one who dreamed     echo   who called i said and the words   through the whispering glades hither thither baffled the birds   who called who called  the leafy boughs on high   hissed in the sun the dark air carried my cry   faintingly on  eyes in the green in the shade   in the motionless brake voices that said what i said   for mockerys sake  who cares i bawled through my

hands like mine   plays ever silently  on on quite silently   when i am there alone turns not his head lifts not his eyes   heeds not as he plays on  after the birds are flown   from singing in the trees when all is grey all silent   voices and winds and bees  and i am there alone   forlornly silently plays in the evening garden   myself with me     autumn   there is a wind where the rose was cold rain where sweet grass was   and clouds like sheep   stream oer the steep grey skies where the lark was  nought gold where your hair was nought warm where your hand was   but phantom forlorn   beneath the thorn your ghost where your face was  sad winds where your voice was tears tears where my heart was   and ever with me   child ever with me silence where hope was     winter   green

powdery a robin sat in the tree  and he whistled sweet and i in the crusted snow with snowclubbed feet jigged to and fro till from the day the roselight ebbed away  and the robin flew into the air the air the white mist through and small and rare the nightfrost fell in the calm and misty dell  and the dusk gathered low and the silver moon and stars on the frozen snow drew taper bars kindled winking fires in the hooded briers  and the sprawling bear growled deep in the sky and orions hair streamed sparkling by but the north sighed low snow snow more snow

                      the three cherry trees     there were three cherry trees once   grew in a garden all shady and there for delight of so gladsome a sight   walked a most beautiful lady   dreamed a most beautiful lady    birds in those branches did sing   blackbird and throstle and linnet but she walking there was by far the most fair   lovelier than all else within it   blackbird and throstle and linnet    but blossoms to berries do come   all hanging on stalks light and slender and one long summers day charmed that lady away   with vows sweet and merry and tender   a lover with voice low and tender    moss and lichen the green branches deck   weeds nod in its paths green and shady yet a light footstep seems there to wander in dreams   the ghost of that beautiful lady   that happy and beautiful lady     old susan   when susans work was done she would sit with one fat guttering candle lit and window opened wide to win the sweet night air to enter in there with a thumb to keep her place she would read with stern and wrinkled face her mild eyes gliding very slow across the letters to and fro while wagged the guttering candle flame in the wind that through the window came and sometimes in the silence she would mumble a sentence audibly or shake her head as if to say you silly souls to act this way and never a sound from night i would hear unless some faroff cock crowed clear or her old shuffling thumb should turn another page and rapt and stern through her great glasses bent on me she would glance into reality and shake her round old silvery head withyoui thought you was in bed only to tilt her book again and rooted in romance remain     old ben   sad is old ben tristlewaite   now his day is done and all his children   far away are gone  he sits beneath his jasmined porch   his stick between his knees his eyes fixed vacant   on his mossgrown trees  grass springs in the green path   his flowers are lean and dry his thatch hangs in wisps against   the evening sky  he has no heart to care now   though the winds will blow whistling in his casement   and the rain drip through  he thinks of his old bettie   how shed shake her head and say youll live to wish my sharp old tongue   could scoldsome day  but as in pale high autumn skies   the swallows float and play his restless thoughts pass to and fro   but nowhere stay  soft on the morrow they are gone   his garden then will be denser and shadier and greener   greener the mossgrown tree     miss loo   when thinstrewn memory i look through i see most clearly poor miss loo her tabby cat her cage of birds her nose her hair her muffled words and how she would open her green eyes as if in some immense surprise whenever as we sat at tea she made some small remark to me  tis always drowsy summer when from out the past she comes again the westering sunshine in a pool floats in her parlour still and cool while the slim bird its lean wires shakes as into piercing song it breaks till peters palegreen eyes ajar dream wake wake dream in one brief bar and i am sitting dull and shy and she with gaze of vacancy  and large hands folded on the tray musing the afternoon away her satin bosom heaving slow with sighs that softly ebb and flow and her plain face in such dismay it seems unkind to look her way until all cheerful back will come her gentle gleaming spirit home and one would think that poor miss loo asked nothing else if she had you     the tailor   few footsteps stray when dusk droops oer the tailors old stonelintelled door there sits he stitching half asleep beside his smoky tallow dip click click his needle hastes and shrill cries back the cricket beneath the sill sometimes he stays and over his thread leans sidelong his old tousled head or stoops to peer with halfshut eye when some strange footfall echoes by till clearer gleams his candles spark into the dusty summer dark then from his crosslegs he gets down to find how dark the evening is grown and hunchedup in his door he will hear the cricket whistling crisp and clear and so beneath the starry grey will mutter half a seam away     martha   once  once upon a time    over and over again martha would tell us her stories   in the hazel glen  hers were those clear grey eyes   you watch and the story seems told by their beautifulness   tranquil as dreams  she would sit with her two slim hands   clasped round her bended knees while we on our elbows lolled   and stared at ease  her voice and her narrow chin   her grave small lovely head seemed half the meaning   of the words she said  once  once upon a time    like a dream you dream in the night fairies and gnomes stole out   in the leafgreen light  and her beauty far away   would fade as her voice ran on till hazel and summer sun   and all were gone  all fordone and forgot   and like clouds in the height of the sky our hearts stood still in the hush   of an age gone by     the sleeper   as ann came in one summers day   she felt that she must creep so silent was the clear cool house   it seemed a house of sleep and sure when she pushed open the door   rapt in the stillness there her mother sat with stooping head   asleep upon a chair fastfast asleep her two hands laid   loosefolded on her knee so that her small unconscious face   looked half unreal to be so calmly lit with sleeps pale light   each feature was so fair her foreheadevery trouble was   smoothed out beneath her hair but though her mind in dream now moved   still seemed her gaze to rest from out beneath her fastsealed lids   above her moving breast on ann as quite quite still she stood   yet slumber lay so deep even her hands upon her lap   seemed saturate with sleep and as ann peeped a cloudlike dread   stole over her and then on stealthy mouselike feet she trod   and tiptoed out again     the keys of morning   while at her bedroom window once   learning her task for school little louisa lonely sat   in the morning clear and cool she slanted her small beadbrown eyes   across the empty street and saw death softly watching her   in the sunshine pale and sweet  his was a long lean sallow face   he sat with halfshut eyes like an old sailor in a ship   becalmed neath tropic skies beside him in the dust he had set   his staff and shady hat these peeping small louisa saw   quite clearly where she sat  the thinness of his coalblack locks   his hands so long and lean they scarcely seemed to grasp at all   the keys that hung between both were of gold but one was small   and with this last did he wag in the air as if to say   come hither child to me  louisa laid her lesson book   on the cold windowsill and in the sleepy sunshine house   went softly down until she stood in the halfopened door   and peeped but strange to say where death just now had sunning sat   only a shadow lay just the tall chimneys roundtopped cowl   and the small sun behind had with its shadow in the dust   called sleepy death to mind but most she thought how strange it was   two keys that he should bear and that when beckoning he should wag   the littlest in the air     rachel   rachel sings sweet   oh yes at night her pale face bent   in the candlelight her slim hands touch   the answering keys and she sings of hope   and of memories sings to the little   boy that stands watching those slim   light heedful hands he looks in her face   her dark eyes seem dark with a beautiful   distant dream and still she plays   sings tenderly to him of hope   and of memory     alone   a very old woman lives in yon house the squeak of the cricket the stir of the mouse are all she knows of the earth and us  once she was young would dance and play like many another young popinjay and run to her mother at dusk of day  and colours bright she delighted in the fiddle to hear and to lift her chin and sing as small as a twittering wren  but age apace comes at last to all and a lone house filled with the crickets call and the scampering mouse in the hollow wall     the bells   shadow and light both strove to be the eight bellringers company as with his gliding rope in hand counting his changes each did stand while rang and trembled every stone to music by the bellmouths blown till the bright clouds that towered on high seemed to reecho cry with cry still swang the clappers to and fro when in the farspread fields below i saw a ploughman with his team lift to the bells and fix on them his distant eyes as if he would drink in the utmost sound he could while near him sat his children three and in the green grass placidly played undistracted on as if what music earthly bells might give could only faintly stir their dream and stillness make more lovely seem soon night hid horses children all in sleep deep and ambrosial yet yet it seemed from star to star welling now near now faint and far those echoing bells rang on in dream and stillness made even lovelier seem     the scarecrow   all winter through i bow my head   beneath the driving rain the north wind powders me with snow   and blows me back again at midnight neath a maze of stars   i flame with glittering rime and stand above the stubble stiff   as mail at morningprime but when that child called spring and all   his host of children come scattering their buds and dew upon   these acres of my home some rapture in my rags awakes   i lift void eyes and scan the skies for crows those ravening foes   of my strange master man i watch him striding lank behind   his clashing team and know soon will the wheat swish body high   where once lay sterile snow soon shall i gaze across a sea   of sunbegotten grain which my unflinching watch hath sealed   for harvest once again     nod   softly along the road of evening   in a twilight dim with rose wrinkled with age and drenched with dew   old nod the shepherd goes  his drowsy flock streams on before him   their fleeces charged with gold to where the suns last beam leans low   on nod the shepherds fold  the hedge is quick and green with brier   from their sand the conies creep and all the birds that fly in heaven   flock singing home to sleep  his lambs outnumber a noons roses   yet when nights shadows fall his blind old sheepdog slumbersoon   misses not one of all  his are the quiet steeps of dreamland   the waters of nomorepain his rams bell rings neath an arch of stars   rest rest and rest again     the bindweed   the bindweed roots pierce down   deeper than men do lie laid in their darkshut graves   their slumbering kinsmen by  yet what frail thinspun flowers   she casts into the air to breathe the sunshine and   to leave her fragrance there  but when the sweet moon comes   showering her silver down halfwreath√®d in faint sleep   they droop where they have blown  so all the grass is set   beneath her trembling ray with buds that have been flowers   brimmed with reflected day     winter   clouded with snow   the cold winds blow and shrill on leafless bough the robin with its burning breast   alone sings now    the rayless sun   days journey done sheds its last ebbing light on fields in leagues of beauty spread   unearthly white    thick draws the dark   and spark by spark the frostfires kindle and soon over that sea of frozen foam   floats the white moon     there blooms no bud in may   there blooms no bud in may   can for its white compare with snow at break of day   on fields forlorn and bare  for shadow it hath rose   azure and amethyst and every air that blows   dies out in beauteous mist  it hangs the frozen bough   with flowers on which the night wheeling her darkness through   scatters a starry light  fearful of its pale glare   in flocks the starlings rise slide through the frosty air   and perch with plaintive cries  only the inky rook   hunched cold in ruffled wings its snowy nest forsook   caws of unnumbered springs     noon and night flower       not any flower that blows     but shining watch doth keep every swift changing chequered hour it knows now to break forth in beauty now to sleep      this for the roving bee     keeps open house and this stainless and clear is that in darkness she may lure the moth to where her nectar is      lovely beyond the rest     are these of all delight the tiny pimpernel that noon loves best the primrose palely burning through the night      one neath days burning sky     with ruby decks her place the other when eves chariot glideth by lifts her dim torch to light that dreaming face     estranged   no one was with me there happy i wasalone yet from the sunshine suddenly     a joy was gone  a bird in an empty house sad echoes makes to ring flitting from room to room     on restless wing  till from its shades he flies and leaves forlorn and dim the narrow solitudes    so strange to him  so when with fickle heart i joyed in the passing day a presence my mood estranged     went grieved away     the tired cupid   the thin moonlight with trickling ray thridding the boughs of silver may trembles in beauty pale and cool on folded flower and mantled pool all in a haze the rushes lean and hehe sits with chin between his two cold hands his bare feet set deep in the grasses green and wet about his head a hundred rings of gold loop down to meet his wings whose feathers arched their stillness through gleam with slowgathering drops of dew the mousebat peers the stealthy vole creeps from the covert of its hole a shimmering moth its pinions furls grey in the moonshine of his curls neath the faint stars the nightairs stray scattering the fragrance of the may and with each stirring of the bough shadow beclouds his childlike brow     dreams   be gentle o hands of a child be true like a shadowy sea in the starry darkness of night     are your eyes to me  but words are shallow and soon dreams fade that the heart once knew and youth fades out in the mind     in the dark eyes too  what can a tired heart say which the wise of the world have made dumb save to the lonely dreams of a child     return again come     faithless   the words you said grow faint   the lamps you lit burn dim yet still be near your faithless friend   to urge and counsel him  still with returning feet   to where lifes shadows brood with steadfast eyes made clear in death   haunt his vague solitude  so he beguiled with earth   yet with its vain things vexed keep even to his own heart unknown   your memory unperplexed     the shade   darker than night and oh much darker she whose eyes in deep night darkness gaze on me no stars surround her yet the moon seems hid afar somewhere beneath that narrow lid she darkens against the darkness and her face only by adding thought to thought i trace limned shadowily o dream return once more to gloomy hades and the whispering shore     be angry now no more   be angry now no more   if i have grieved theeif thy kindness mine before no hope may now restore   only forgive forgive  if still resentment burns   in thy cold breast oh if no more to pity turns no more once tender yearns   thy love oh yet forgive  ask of the winter rain junes withered rose again ask grace of the salt sea she will not answer thee god would ten times have shriven a heart so riven in her cold care thou wouldst be still unforgiven     exile   had the gods loved me i had lain   where darnel is and thorn and the wild nightbirds nightlong strain   trembles in boughs forlorn  nay but they loved me not and i   must needs a stranger be whose every exiled day gone by   aches with their memory     where   where is my love   in silence and shadow she lies under the aprilgrey calm waste of the skies     and a bird above   in the darkness tender and clear keeps saying over and over love lies here      not that shes dead   only her soul is flown out of its last pure earthly mansion     and cries instead   in the darkness tender and clear like the voice of a bird in the leaves love       love lies here     music unheard   sweet sounds begone   whose music on my ear stirs foolish discontent   or lingering here when if i crossed   the crystal verge of death him i should see   who these sounds murmureth  sweet sounds begone   ask not my heart to break its bond of bravery for   sweet quiets sake lure not my feet   to leave the path they must tread on unfaltering   till i sleep in dust  sweet sounds begone   though silence brings apace deadly disquiet   of this homeless place and all i love   in beauty cries to me we but vain shadows   and reflections be     all thats past   very old are the woods   and the buds that break out of the briers boughs   when march winds wake so old with their beauty are   oh no man knows through what wild centuries   roves back the rose  very old are the brooks   and the rills that rise where snow sleeps cold beneath   the azure skies sing such a history   of come and gone their every drop is as wise   as solomon  very old are we men   our dreams are tales told in dim eden   by eves nightingales we wake and whisper awhile   but the day gone by silence and sleep like fields   of amaranth lie     when the rose is faded   when the rose is faded   memory may still dwell on her beauty shadowed   and the sweet smell gone  that vanishing loveliness   that burdening breath no bond of life hath then   nor grief of death  tis the immortal thought   whose passion still makes of the changing   the unchangeable  oh thus thy beauty   loveliest on earth to me dark with no sorrow shines   and burns with thee     sleep   men all and birds and creeping beasts   when the dark of night is deep from the moving wonder of their lives   commit themselves to sleep  without a thought or fear they shut   the narrow gates of sense heedless and quiet in slumber turn   their strength to impotence  the transient strangeness of the earth   their spirits no more see within a silent gloom withdrawn   they slumber in secrecy  two worlds they havea globe forgot   wheeling from dark to light and all the enchanted realm of dream   that burgeons out of night     the stranger   halfhidden in a graveyard   in the blackness of a yew where never living creature stirs   nor sunbeam pierces through  is a tomb green and crooked   its faded legend gone with but one rainworn cherubs head   of smouldering stone  there when the dusk is falling   silence broods so deep it seems that every wind that breathes   blows from the field of sleep  day breaks in heedless beauty   kindling each drop of dew but unforsaking shadow dwells   beneath this lonely yew  and all else lost and faded   only this listening head keeps with a strange unanswering smile   its secret with the dead     never more sailor   never more sailor shall thou be tossed on the windridden restless sea its tides may labour all the world shake neath that weight of waters hurled but its whole shock can only stir thy dust to a quiet even quieter thou mockst at land who now art come to such a small and shallow home yet bore the sea full many a care for bones that once a sailors were and though the graves deep soundlessness thy once seadeafened ear distress no robin ever on the deep hopped with his song to haunt thy sleep     arabia   far are the shades of arabia   where the princes ride at noon mid the verdurous vales and thickets   under the ghost of the moon and so dark is that vaulted purple   flowers in the forest rise and toss into blossom gainst the phantom stars   pale in the noonday skies  sweet is the music of arabia   in my heart when out of dreams i still in the thin clear mirk of dawn   descry her gliding streams hear her strange lutes on the green banks   ring loud with the grief and delight of the dimsilked darkhaired musicians   in the brooding silence of night  they haunt meher lutes and her forests   no beauty on earth i see but shadowed with that dreams recalls   her loveliness to me still eyes look coldly upon me   cold voices whisper and say he is crazed with the spell of far arabia   they have stolen his wits away     the mountains   still and blanched and cold and lone   the icy hills far off from me with frosty ulys overgrown   stand in their sculptured secrecy  no path of theirs the chamois fleet   treads with a nostril to the wind oer their icemarbled glaciers beat   no wings of eagles in my mind  yea in my mind these mountains rise   their perils dyed with evenings rose and still my ghost sits at my eyes   and thirsts for their untroubled snows     queen djenira   when queen djenira slumbers through   the sultry noons repose from out her dreams as soft she lies   a faint thin music flows  her lovely hands lie narrow and pale   with gilded nails her head couched in its handed nets of gold   lies pillowed on her bed  the little nubian boys who fan   her cheeks and tresses clear wonderful wonderful wonderful voices   seem afar to hear  they slide their eyes and nodding say   queen djenira walks today the courts of the lord pthamasar   where the sweet birds of psuthys are  and those of earth about her porch   of shadow cool and grey their sidelong beaks in silence lean   and silent flit away     nevertobe   down by the waters of the sea reigns the king of nevertobe his palace walls are black with night his torches star and moons light and for his timepiece deep and grave beats on the green unhastening wave  windswept are his high corridors his pleasance the seamantled shores for sentinel a shadow stands with hair in heaven and cloudy hands and round his bed kings guards to be watch pines in iron solemnity  his hound is mute his steed at will roams pastures deep with asphodel his queen is to her slumber gone his courtiers mute lie hewn in stone he hath forgot where he did hide his sceptre in the mountainside  greycapped and muttering mad is he the childless king of nevertobe for all his people in the deep keep everlasting fast asleep and all his realm is foam and rain whispering of what comes not again     the dark ch√Çteau   in dreams a dark ch√¢teau   stands ever open to me in far ravines dreamwaters flow   descending soundlessly above its peaks the eagle floats   lone in a sunless sky mute are the golden woodland throats   of the birds flitting by  no voice is audible the wind   sleeps in its peace no flower of the light can find   refuge beneath its trees only the darkening ivy climbs   mingled with wilding rose and cypress morn and evening times   black shadow throws  all vacant and unknown   only the dreamer steps from stone to hollow stone   where the green moss sleeps peers at the rivers in its deeps   the eagle lone in the sky while the dew of evening drips   coldly and silently  would that i could steal in   into each secret room would that my sleepbright eyes could win   to the inner gloom gaze from its high windows   far down its mouldering walls where amberclear still lethe flows   and foaming falls  but ever as i gaze   from slumber soft doth come some touch my stagnant sense to raise   to its old earthly home fades then that sky serene   and peak of ageless snow fades to a paling dawnlit green   my dark ch√¢teau     the dwellingplace   deep in a forest where the kestrel screamed   beside a lake of water clear as glass the timeworn windows of a stone house gleamed         named only alas  yet happy as the wild birds in the glades   of that green forest thridding the still air with low continued heedless serenades         its heedless people were  the throbbing chords of violin and lute   the lustre of lean tapers in dark eyes fair colours beauteous flowers faintbloomed fruit         made earth seem paradise  to them that dwelt within this lonely house   like children of the gods in lasting peace they ate sang danced as if each days carouse         need never pause nor cease  some to the hunt would wend with hound and horn   and clash of silver beauty bravery pride heeding not one who on white horse upborne         with soundless hoofs did ride  dreamers there were who watched the hours away   beside a fountains foam and in the sweet of phantom evening neath the nightbirds lay         did loved with lovedone meet  all all were children for the long day done   they barred the heavy door against lightfoot fear and few words spake though one known face was gone         yet still seemed hovering near  they heaped the bright fire higher poured dark wine   and in long revelry dazed the questioning eye curtained threefold the heartdismaying shine         of midnight streaming by  they shut the dark out from the painted wall   with candles dared the shadow at the door sang down the faint reiterated call         of those who came no more  yet clear above that portal plain was writ   confronting each at length alone to pass out of its beauty into night starlit         that word alas     the listeners   is there anybody there said the traveller   knocking on the moonlit door and his horse in the silence champed the grasses   of the forests ferny floor and a bird flew up out of the turret   above the travellers head and he smote upon the door again a second time   is there anybody there he said but no one descended to the traveller   no head from the leaffringed sill leaned over and looked into his grey eyes   where he stood perplexed and still but only a host of phantom listeners   that dwelt in the lone house then stood listening in the quiet of the moonlight   to that voice from the world of men stood thronging the faint moonbeams on the dark stair   that goes down to the empty hall hearkening in an air stirred and shaken   by the lonely travellers call and he felt in his heart their strangeness   their stillness answering his cry while his horse moved cropping the dark turf   neath the starred and leafy sky for he suddenly smote on the door even   louder and lifted his head tell them i came and no one answered   that i kept my word he said never the least stir made the listeners   though every word he spake fell echoing through the shadowiness of the still house   from the one man left awake ay they heard his foot upon the stirrup   and the sound of iron on stone and how the silence surged softly backward   when the plunging hoofs were gone     time passes       there was nought in the valley     but a tower of ivory its base enwreathed with red     flowers that at evening     caught the suns crimson as to ocean low he sped      lucent and lovely     it stood in the morning under a trackless hill     with snows eternal     muffling its summit and silence ineffable      sighing of solitude     winds from the cold heights haunted its yellowing stone     at noon its shadow     stretched athwart cedars     whence every bird was flown      its stair was broken     its starlit walls were fretted its flowers shone     wide at the portal     fullblown and fading their last faint fragrance gone      and on high in its lantern     a shape of the living watched oer a shoreless sea     from a tower rotting     with age and weakness     once lovely as ivory     beware   an ominous bird sang from its branch     beware o wanderer night mid her flowers of glamourie spilled     draws swiftly near  night with her darkened caravans     piled deep with silver and myrrh draws from the portals of the east     o wanderer near  night who walks plum√®d through the fields     of stars that strangely stir smitten to fire by the sandals of him     who walks with her     the journey   heartsick of his journey was the wanderer   footsore and parched was he and a witch who long had lurked by the wayside   looked out of sorcery  lift up your eyes you lonely wanderer   she peeped from her casement small heres shelter and quiet to give you rest young man   and apples for thirst withal  and he looked up out of his sad reverie   and saw all the woods in green with birds that flitted feathered in the dappling   the jewelbright leaves between  and he lifted up his face towards her lattice   and there alluringwise slanting through the silence of the long past   dwelt the still green witchs eyes  and vaguely from the hidingplace of memory   voices seemed to cry what is the darkness of one brief lifetime   to the deaths thou hast made us die  heed not the words of the enchantress   who would us still betray and sad with the echo of their reproaches   doubting he turned away  i may not shelter beneath your roof lady   nor in this woods green shadow seek repose nor will your apples quench the thirst   a homesick wanderer knows  homesick forsooth she softly mocked him   and the beauty in her face made in the sunshine pale and trembling   a stillness in that place  and he sighed as if in fear that young wanderer   looking to left and to right where the endless narrow road swept onward   till in distance lost to sight  and there fell upon his sense the brier   haunting the air with its breath and the faint shrill sweetness of the birds throats   their tent of leaves beneath  and there was the witch in no wise heeding   her arbour and fruitfilled dish her pitcher of wellwater and clear damask   all that the weary wish  and the last gold beam across the green world   faltered and failed as he remembered his solitude and the dark nights   inhospitality  and he looked upon the witch with eyes of sorrow   in the darkening of the day and turned him aside into oblivion   and the voices died away  and the witch stepped down from her casement   in the hush of night he heard the calling and wailing in dewy thicket   of bird to hidden bird  and gloom stole all her burning crimson   remote and faint in space as stars in gathering shadow of the evening   seemed now her phantom face  and one nights rest shall be a myriad   midst dreams that come and go till heedless fate unmoved by weakness bring him   this same strange byway through  to the beauty of earth that fades in ashes   the lips of welcome and the eyes more beauteous than the feeble shine of hesper   lone in the lightening skies  till once again the witchs guile entreat him   but worn with wisdom he steadfast and cold shall choose the dark nights   inhospitality     haunted   the rabbit in his burrow keeps no guarded watch in peace he sleeps the wolf that howls in challenging night cowers to her lair at morning light the simplest bird entwines a nest where she may lean her lovely breast couched in the silence of the bough but thou o man what rest hast thou  thy emptiest solitude can bring only a subtler questioning in thy divided heart thy bed recalls at dawn what midnight said seek how thou wilt to feign content thy flaming ardours quickly spent soon thy last company is gone and leaves theewith thyselfalone  pomp and great friends may hem thee round a thousand busy tasks be found earths thronging beauties may beguile thy longing lovesick heart awhile and pride like clouds of sunset spread a changing glory round thy head but fade will all and thou must come hating thy journey homeless home  rave how thou wilt unmoved remote that inward presence slumbers not frets out each secret from thy breast gives thee no rally pause nor rest scans close thy very thoughts lest they should sap his patient power away answers thy wrath with peace thy cry with tenderest taciturnity     silence   with changeful sound life beats upon the ear   yet striving for release   the most seductive strings     sweet jargonings     the happiest throats   most easeful lovely notes fall back into a veiling silentness  even mid the rumour of a moving host   blackening the clear green earth   vainly gainst that thin wall     the trumpets call     or with loud hum   the smokebemuffled drum from that high quietness no reply comes forth  when all at peace two friends at ease alone   talk out their heartsyet still   between the gracenotes of     the voice of love     from each to each   trembles a rarer speech and with its presence every pause doth fill  unmoved it broods this allencompassing hush   of one who stooping near   no smallest stir will make     our fear to wake     but yet intent   upon some mystery bent   harkens the lightest word we say or hear     winter dusk   dark frost was in the air without   the dusk was still with cold and gloom when less than even a shadow came     and stood within the room  but of the three around the fire   none turned a questioning head to look still read a clear voice on and on     still stooped they oer their book  the children watched their mothers eyes   moving on softly line to line it seemed to listen toothat shade     yet made no outward sign  the fireflames crooned a tiny song   no cold wind moved the wintry tree the children both in fa√´rie dreamed     beside their mothers knee  and nearer yet that spirit drew   above that heedless one intent only on what the simple words     of her small story meant  no voiceless sorrow grieved her mind   no memory her bosom stirred nor dreamed she as she read to two     twas surely three who heard  yet when the story done she smiled   from face to face serene and clear a love half dread sprang up as she     leaned close and drew them near     the ghost         peace in thy hands       peace in thine eyes       peace on thy brow flower of a moment in the eternal hour       peace with me now        not a wave breaks       not a bird calls       my heart like a sea silent after a storm that hath died

spot latticed from the moons beams perchance a distant dreamer dreams perchance upon its darkening air the unseen ghosts of children fare faintly swinging sway and sweep like lovely seaflowers in its deep while unmoved to watch and ward amid its gloomed and daisied sward stands with bowed and dewy head that one little leaden lad     the riddlers   thou solitary the blackbird cried i from the happy wren linnet and blackcap woodlark thrush perched all upon a sweetbrier bush have come at cold of midnighttide to ask thee why and when grief smote thy heart so thou dost sing in solemn hush of evening so sorrowfully lovelorn thing nay nay not sing but rave but wail most melancholic nightingale do not the dews of darkness steep all pinings of the day in sleep why then when rocked in starry nest we mutely couch secure at rest doth thy lone heart delight to make music for sorrows sake a moon was there so still her beam it seemed the whole world lay in dream lulled by the watery sea and from her leafy nighthung nook upon this stranger soft did look the nightingale sighed he  tis strange my friend the kingfisher but yestermorn conjured me here out of his green and gold to say why thou in splendour of the noon wearest of colour but golden shoon and else dost thee array in a most sombre suit of black surely he sighed some load of grief past all our thinkingand belief must weigh upon his back do then in turn tell me if joy thy heart as well as voice employ why dost thou now most sable shine in plumage woefuller far than mine thy silence is a sadder thing than any dirge i sing  thus then these two small birds perched there breathed a strange riddle both did share yet neither could expound and wewho sing but as we can in the small knowledge of a man have we an answer found nay some are happy whose delight is hid even from themselves from sight and some win peace who spend the skill of words to sweeten despair of finding consolation where life has but one dark end who in rapt solitude tell oer a tale as lovely as forlore into the midnight air     moonlight   the far moon maketh lovers wise   in her pale beauty trembling down lending curved cheeks dark lips dark eyes

pack   too blind too blind to see by no wild hope of force or greed   could you make sure of me  and like a phantom through the glades   with tender breast aglow the goddess in me laughed to hear   your horns aroving go  she laughed to think no mortal ever   by dint of mortal flesh the very cause that was the hunt   one moment could enmesh  that though with captive limbs i lay   stilled breath

made wails a summons faint and sad no voice ever answers me       only vacancy once once  the cricket shrills and far and near the quiet fills with its tiny voice and then       hush falls again  mute shadows creeping slow mark how the hours go every stone is mouldering slow and the least winds that blow some minutest atom shake some fretting ruin make in roof and walls how black it is beneath these thickboughed trees     mistress fell   whom seek you here sweet mistress fell one who loved me passing well dark his eye wild his face stranger if in this lonely place bide such an one then prythee say i am come here today  many his like mistress fell i did not look so cannot tell only this i surely know when his voice called me i must go touched me his fingers and my heart leapt at the sweet pains smart  why did he leave you mistress fell magic laid its dreary spell stranger he was fast asleep into his dream i tried to creep called his name soft was my cry he answerednot one sigh

below  thus have they told me and i come as flies the wounded wildbird home not tears i give but all that he clasped in his arms sweet charity all that he lovedto him i bring for a close whispering

the air when echo lurks by the waters to heed   tis i speak thee fair  dark is the hour ay and cold   lone is my house ah but mine sight touch lips eyes yearned in vain   long dead these to thine   silence still faint on the porch   brake the flames of the stars in gloom groped a hopewearied hand   over keys bolts and bars  a face peered all the grey night   in chaos of vacancy shone nought but vast sorrow was there   the sweet cheat gone     the stranger   in the woods as i did walk   dappled with the moons beam i did with a stranger talk   and his name was dream  spurred his heel dark his cloak   shadywide his bonnets brim his horse beneath a silvery oak   grazed as i talked with him  softly his breastbrooch burned and shone   hill and deep were in his eyes one of his hands held mine and one   the fruit that makes men wise  wondrously strange was earth to see   flowers white as milk did gleam spread to heaven the assyrian tree   over my head with dream  dews were still betwixt us twain   stars a trembling beauty shed yetnot a whisper comes again   of the words he said     betrayal   she will not die they say she will but put her beauty by         and hie away  oh but her beauty gone how lonely then will seem all reverie         how black to me  all things will sad be made and every hope a memory         all gladness dead  ghosts of the past will know my weakest hour and whisper to me         and coldly go  and hers in deep of sleep clothed in its mortal beauty i shall see         and waking weep  naught will my mind then find in mans false heaven my peace to be         all blind and blind     the cage   why did you flutter in vain hope poor bird   hardpressed in your small cage of clay twas but a sweet false echo that you heard       caught only a feint of day  still is the night all dark a homeless dark   burn yet the unanswering stars and silence brings the same seas desolate surgesans bound or mark       of all your wanderings  fret now no more be still those steadfast eyes   those folded hands they cannot set you free only with beauty wake wild memories   sorrow for where you are for where you would be     the revenant   o all ye fair ladies with your colours and your graces   and your eyes clear in flame of candle and hearth toward the dark of this old window lift not up your smiling faces   where a shade stands forlorn from the cold of the earth  god knows i could not rest for one i still was thinking of   like a rose sheathed in beauty her spirit was to me now out of unforgottenness a bitter draught im drinking of   tis sad of such beauty unremembered to be  men all all shades o womanwinds wist not of the way they blow   apart from your kindness lifes at best but a snare though a tongue now past praise this bitter thing doth say i know   what solitude means and how homeless i fare  strange strange are ye allexcept in beauty shared with her   since i seek one i loved yet was faithless to in death not life enough i heaped so thus my heart must fare with her   now wrapt in the gross clay bereft of lifes breath     music   when music sounds gone is the earth i know and all her lovely things even lovelier grow her flowers in vision flame her forest trees lift burdened branches stilled with ecstasies  when music sounds out of the water rise naiads whose beauty dims my waking eyes rapt in strange dreams burns each enchanted face with solemn echoing stirs their dwellingplace  when music sounds all that i was i am ere to this haunt of brooding dust i came while from times woods break into distant song the swiftwinged hours as i hasten along     the remonstrance   i was at peace until you came and set a careless mind aflame i lived in quiet cold content all longing in safe banishment until your ghostly lips and eyes     made wisdom unwise  naught was in me to tempt your feet to seek a lodging quite forgot lay the sweet solitude we two in childhood used to wander through times cold had closed my heart about     and shut you out  well and what then o vision grave take all the little all i have strip me of what in voiceless thought lifes kept of life unhoped unsought reverie and dream that memory must     hide deep in dust  this only i saythough cold and bare the haunted house you have chosen to share still neath its walls the moonbeam goes     and trembles on the untended rose  still oer its broken rooftree rise the starry arches of the skies and in your lightest word shall be     the thunder of an ebbing sea     nocturne   tis not my voice now speaks but a bird in darkling forest hollows a sweet throat pleads on till distant echo too hath heard     and doubles every note so love that shrouded dwells in mystery     would cry and waken thee  thou solitary stir in thy still sleep all the night waits thee yet thou still dreamst on furtive the shadows that about thee creep and cheat the shining footsteps of the moon unseal thine eyes it is my heart that sings     and beats in vain its wings  lost in heavens vague the stars burn softly through the worlds dark latticings we prisoned stray within its lovely labyrinth and know     mute seraphs guard the way even from silence unto speech from love to that selfs self it still is dreaming of     the exile   i am that adam who with snake for guest hid anguished eyes upon eves piteous breast i am that adam who with broken wings fled from the seraphs brazen trumpetings betrayed and fugitive i still must roam a world where sin and beauty whisper of home  oh from wide circuit shall at length i see pure daybreak lighten again on edens tree loosed from remorse and hope and loves distress enrobe me again in my lost nakedness no more with wordless grief a loved one grieve but to heavens nothingness rewelcome eve     the unchanging   after the songless rose of evening     night quiet dark still in nodding cavalcade advancing     starred the deep hill you in the valley standing     in your quiet wonder took all that glamour peace and mystery     in one grave look beauty hid your naked body     time dreamed in your bright hair in your eyes the constellations     burned far and fair     invocation   the burning fire shakes in the night   on high her silver candles gleam with farflung arms enflamed with light   the trees are lost in dream  come in thy beauty tis my love   lost in farwandering desire hath in the darkling deep above   set stars and kindled fire     eyes   o strange devices that alone divide the se√´r from the seen the very highway of earths pomp and pride that lies between the traveller and the cheating sweet delight of where he longs to be but which bound hand and foot he close on night can only see     life   hearken o dear now strikes the hour we die we who in our strange kiss have proved a dream the worlds realities turned each from others darkness with a sigh need heed no more of life waste no more breath on any other journey but of death  and yet oh know we well how each of us must prove loves infidel still out of ecstasy turn trembling back to earths same empty track of leaden day by day and hour by hour and be of all things lovely the cold mortuary     the disguise   why in my heart o grief dost thou in beauty hide dead is my wellcontent and buried deep my pride cold are their stones beloved to hand and side  the shadows of even are gone shut are the days clear flowers now have her birds left mute their singing bowers lone shall we be we twain in the night hours  thou with thy cheek on mine and dark hair loosed shall see take the far stars for fruit the cypress tree and in the yews black shall the moon be  we will tell no old tales nor heed if in wandering air die a lost song of love or the once fair still as wellwater be the thoughts we share  and while the ghosts keep tryst from chill sepulchres dreamless our gaze shall sleep and sealed our ears heart unto heart will speak without tears  o thy veiled lovely face joys strange disguise shall be the last to fade from these rapt eyes ere the first dart of daybreak pierce the skies     vain questioning   what needest thoua few brief hours of rest wherein to seek thyself in thine own breast a transient silence wherein truth could say such was thy constant hope and this thy way       o burden of life that is       a livelong tangle of perplexities  what seekest thoua truce from that thou art some steadfast refuge from a fickle heart still to be thou and yet no thing of scorn to find no stay here and yet not forlorn       o riddle of life that is       an endless war twixt contrarieties  leave this vain questioning is not sweet the rose sings not the wild bird ere to rest he goes hath not in miracle brave june returned burns not her beauty as of old it burned       o foolish one to roam       so far in thine own mind away from home  where blooms the flower when her petals fade where sleepeth echo by earths music made where all things transient to the changeless win there waits the peace thy spirit dwelleth in     vigil   dark is the night   the fire burns faint and low hoursdaysyears   into grey ashes go i strive to read   but sombre is the glow  thumbed are the pages   and the print is small mocking the winds   that from the darkness call feeble the fire that lends   its light withal  o ghost draw nearer   let thy shadowy hair blot out the pages   that we cannot share be ours the one last leaf   by fate left bare  lets finis scrawl   and then lifes book put by turn each to each   in all simplicity ere the last flame is gone   to warm us by     the old men   old and alone sit we   caged riddlerid men lost to earths listen and see   thoughts wherefore and when  only far memories stray   of a past once lovely but now wasted and faded away   like green leaves from the bough  vast broods the silence of night   the ruinous moon lifts on our faces her light   whence all dreaming is gone  we speak not trembles each head   in their sockets our eyes are still desire as cold as the dead   without wonder or will and one with a lanthorn draws near   at clash with the moon in our eyes where art thou he asks i am here   one by one we arise  and none lifts a hand to withhold   a friend from the touch of that foe heart cries unto heart thou art old   yet reluctant we go     the dreamer   o thou who giving helm and sword   gavst too the rusting rain and starry darks all tender dews     to blunt and stain  out of the battle i am sped   unharmed yet stricken sore a living shape amid whispering shades     on lethes shore  no trophy in my hands i bring   to this sad sighing stream the neighings and the trumps and cries     were but a dream  traitor to life of life betrayed   o of thy mercy deep a dream my all the all i ask     is sleep     motley   come death id have a word with thee and thou poor innocency and lovea lad with broken wing and pity too the fool shall sing to you as fools will sing  ay music hath small sense and a tunes soon told and earth is old and my poor wits are dense yet have i secretsdark my dear to breathe you all come near and lest some hideous listener tells ill ring my bells  they are all at war yes yes their bodies go neath burning sun and icy star to chaunted songs of woe dragging cold cannon through a mire of rain and blood and spouting fire the new moon glinting hard on eyes wide with insanities  hush i use words i hardly know the meaning of and the mute birds are glancing at love from out their shade of leaf and flower trembling at treacheries which even in noonday cower heed heed not what i said of frenzied hosts of men more fools than i on envy hatred fed who kill and die spake i not plainly then yet pity whispered why  thou silly thing off to thy daisies go mine was not news for child to know and deathno ears hath he hath supped where creep eyeless worms in hush of sleep yet when he smiles the hand he draws athwart his grinning jaws faintly the thin bones rattle andthere there hearken how my bells in the air drive away care  nay but a dream i had of a world all mad not simply happy mad like me who am mad like an empty scene of water and willow tree where the wind hath been but that foul satanmad who rots in his own head and counts the dead not honest oneand two but for the ghosts they were brave faithful true when head in air in earths clear green and blue heaven they did share with beauty who bade them there  there now death goes mayhap ive wearied him ay and the light doth dim and asleeps the rose and tired innocence in dreams is hence  come love my lad nodding that drowsy head tis time thy prayers were said     the marionettes   let the foul scene proceed   theres laughter in the wings tis sawdust that they bleed   but a box death brings  how rare a skill is theirs   these extreme pangs to show how real a frenzy wears   each feigner of woe  gigantic dins uprise   even the gods must feel a smarting of the eyes   as these fumes upsweal  strange such a piece is free   while we spectators sit aghast at its agony   yet absorbed in it  dark is the outer air   cold the night draughts blow mutely we stare and stare   at the frenzied show  yet heaven hath its quiet shroud   of deep immutable blue we cry an end we are bowed   by the dread tis true  while the shape who hoofs applause   behind our deafened ear hootsangelwisethe cause   and affright even fear     to et 1917   you sleep too welltoo far away   for sorrowing word to soothe or wound your very quiet seems to say   how longedfor a peace you have found  else had not death so lured you on   you would have grievedtwixt joy and fear to know how my small loving son   had wept for you my dear     april moon   roses are sweet to smell and see   and lilies on the stem but rarer stranger buds there be   and she was like to them  the little moon that april brings   more lovely shade than light that setting silvers lonely hills   upon the verge of night  close to the world of my poor heart   so stole she still and clear now that shes gone o dark and dark   the solitude the fear     the fools song       never no never listen too long to the chattering wind in the willow the night birds song      tis sad in sooth to lie under the grass but none too gladsome to wake and grow cold where lifes shadows pass      dumb the old tollwoman squats and for every green copper battered and worn doles out nevers and nots      i know a blind man too who with a sharp ear listens and listens the whole world through      oh sit we snug to our feast with platter and finger and spoonand good victuals at least     clear eyes   clear eyes do dim at last   and cheeks outlive their rose time heedless of the past   no lovingkindness knows chill unto mortal lip     still lethe flows  griefs too but brief while stay   and sorrow being oer its salt tears shed away   woundeth the heart no more stealthily lave those waters     that solemn shore  ah then sweet face burn on   while yet quick memory lives and sorrow ere thou art gone   know that my heart forgives ere yet grown cold in peace     it loves not nor grieves     dust to dust   heavenly archer bend thy bow now the flame of life burns low youth is gone i too would go  even fortune leads to this harsh or kind at last she is murderess of all ecstasies  yet the spirit dark alone bound in sense still hearkens on for tidings of a bliss foregone  sleep is well for dreamless head at no breath astonish√®d from the gardens of the dead  i the immortal harps hear ring by babylons river languishing heavenly archer loose thy string     the three strangers   far are those tranquil hills   dyed with fair evenings rose on urgent secret errand bent     a traveller goes  approach him strangers three   barefooted cowled their eyes scan the lone hastening solitary     with dumb surmise  one instant in close speech   with them he doth confer godsped he hasteneth on     that anxious traveller   i was that manin a dream   and each worlds night in vain i patient wait on sleep to unveil     those vivid hills again  would that they three could know   how yet burns on in me lovefrom one lost in paradise     for their grave courtesy     alexander   it was the great alexander   capped with a golden helm sate in the ages in his floating ship     in a dead calm  voices of seamaids singing   wandered across the deep the sailors labouring on their oars     rowed as in sleep  all the high pomp of asia   charmed by that siren lay out of their weary and dreaming minds     faded away  like a bold boy sate their captain   his glamour withered and gone in the souls of his brooding mariners     while the song pined on  time like a falling dew   life like the scene of a dream laid between slumber and slumber     only did seem  o alexander then   in all us mortals too wax thou not boldtoo bold     on the wave darkblue  come the calm infinite night   who then will hear aught save the singing     of the seamaids clear     the reawakening   green in light are the hills and a calm wind flowing   filleth the void with a flood of the fragrance of spring wings in this mansion of life are coming and going   voices of unseen loveliness carol and sing  coloured with buds of delight the boughs are swaying   beauty walks in the woods and wherever she rove flowers from wintry sleep her enchantment obeying   stir in the deep of her dream reawaken to love  oh now begone sullen carethis light is my seeing   i am the palace and mine are its windows and walls daybreak is come and life from the darkness of being   springs like a child from the womb when the lonely one calls     the vacant day   as i did walk in meadows green   i heard the summer noon resound with call of myriad things unseen   that leapt and crept upon the ground  high overhead the windless air   throbbed with the homesick coursing cry of swallows that did everywhere   wake echo in the sky  beside me too clear waters coursed   which willow branches lapsing low breaking their crystal gliding forced   to sing as they did flow  i listened and my heart was dumb   with praise no language could express longing in vain for him to come   who had breathed such blessedness  on this fair world wherein we pass   so chequered and so brief a stay and yearned in spirit to learn alas   what kept him still away     the flight   how do the days press on and lay   their fallen locks at evening down whileas the stars in darkness play     and moonbeams weave a crown  a crown of flowerlike light in heaven   where in the hollow arch of space morns mistress dreams and the pleiads seven     stand watch about her place  stand watcho days no number keep   of hours when this dark clay is blind when the worlds clocks are dumb in sleep     tis then i seek my kind     for all the grief   for all the grief i have given with words   may now a few clear flowers blow in the dust and the heat and the silence of birds         where the lonely go  for the thing unsaid that heart asked of me   be a dark cool water callingcalling to the footsore benighted solitary         when the shadows are falling  o be beauty for all my blindness   a moon in the air where the weary wend and dews burdened with lovingkindness         in the dark of the end     the scribe   what lovely things   thy hand hath made the smoothplumed bird   in its emerald shade the seed of the grass   the speck of stone which the wayfaring ant   stirsand hastes on  though i should sit   by some tarn in thy hills using its ink   as the spirit wills to write of earths wonders   its live willed things flit would the ages   on soundless wings ere unto z   my pen drew nigh leviathan told   and the honeyfly and still would remain   my wit to try my worn reeds broken   the dark tarn dry all words forgotten   thou lord and i     fare well   when i lie where shades of darkness shall no more assail mine eyes nor the rain make lamentation     when the wind sighs how will fare the world whose wonder was the very proof of me memory fades must the remembered     perishing be  oh when this my dust surrenders hand foot lip to dust again may these loved and loving faces     please other men may the rustling harvest hedgerow still the travellers joy entwine and as happy children gather     posies once mine  look thy last on all things lovely every hour let no night seal thy sense in deathly slumber     till to delight thou have paid thy utmost blessing since that all things thou wouldst praise beauty took from those who loved them     in other days
